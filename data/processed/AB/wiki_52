The disease is characterized by slowly progressive weakness and wasting of both proximal muscles (located on or close to the torso) and distal muscles (close to hands or feet), most apparent in the finger flexors and knee extensors. IBM is often confused with an entirely different class of diseases, called hereditary inclusion body myopathies (hIBM). The \"M\" in hIBM is an abbreviation for \"myopathy\" while the \"M\" in IBM is for \"myositis\". In IBM, two processes appear to occur in the muscles in parallel, one autoimmune and the other degenerative. Inflammation is evident from the invasion of muscle fibers by immune cells. Degeneration is characterized by the appearance of holes, deposits of abnormal proteins, and filamentous inclusions in the muscle fibers. sIBM is a rare disease, with a prevalence ranging from 1 to 71 individuals per million.\nWeakness comes on slowly (over months to years) in an asymmetric manner and progresses steadily, leading to severe weakness and wasting of arm and leg muscles. IBM is more common in men than women. Patients may become unable to perform activities of daily living and most require assistive devices within 5 to 10 years of symptom onset. sIBM does not significantly affect life expectancy, although death related to malnutrition and respiratory failure can occur. The risk of serious injury due to falls is increased. There is no effective treatment for the disease as of 2019.\nClassification and terminology.\nIBM stands for \"inclusion body \"myositis:\" not \"inclusion body \"myopathy.\"\" The 'inclusion body' refers to a histological finding of rimmed vacuoles in muscle tissue. However, IBM does not refer to the collection of diseases that feature these inclusion bodies. It refers to a specific disease entity.\nMultiple genetic diseases that feature inclusion bodies have been grouped into \"\"hereditary\" inclusion body \"myopathies\" (hIBM).\" \"Myopathy\" is used because inflammation is not a prominent finding. There is inconsistency in what individual disease entities fall under the category of hIBM. The term \"\"sporadic\" inclusion body \"myositis\"\" (sIBM) was introduced as a way to refer to IBM to avoid confusion with hIBM. However, one author discourages use of sIBM, as it implies that IBM and hIBM differ only in inheritance; they actually have unrelated mechanisms and manifestations of disease.\nSigns and symptoms.\nsIBM causes progressive muscle weakness. How sIBM affects individuals is variable, including the age of onset (which generally varies from the forties upwards) and rate of progression. Because of this variability, there is no \"textbook case\".\nCommon early symptoms include frequent tripping and falling and difficulty going up stairs. Foot drop in one or both feet can occur. Part of the cause for this dysfunction is the early involvement of the quadriceps muscles. Weakness of the tibialis anterior muscle is responsible for foot drop. Another common early symptom is trouble manipulating the fingers, such as difficulty with tasks such as turning doorknobs or gripping keys. Weakness of finger flexion and ankle dorsiflexion occurs early. sIBM also preferentially affects the wrist flexors, biceps, and triceps.\nDuring the course of the illness, the patient's mobility is progressively restricted as it becomes difficult to bend down, reach for things, and walk quickly. Many patients say they have balance problems and fall easily, as the muscles cannot compensate for an off-balanced posture. Because sIBM makes the leg muscles weak and unstable, patients are very vulnerable to serious injury from tripping or falling down. Although pain has not been traditionally part of the \"textbook\" description, many patients report severe muscle pain, especially in the thighs.\nProgressive difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) is present in 40 to 85% of IBM cases and often leads to death from aspiration pneumonia.\nIBM can also result in diminished capacity for aerobic exercise. This decline is most likely a consequence of the sedentary lifestyle leading to disuse muscle atrophy that is often associated with the symptoms of IBM (i.e. progressive muscle weakness, decreased mobility, and increased level of fatigue). Therefore, one focus of treatment should be the improvement of aerobic capacity.\nPatients with sIBM usually eventually need to resort to a cane or a walker and, in most cases, a wheelchair eventually becomes a necessity.\n\"The progressive course of s-IBM leads slowly to severe disability. Finger functions can become very impaired, such as manipulating pens, keys, buttons, and zippers, pulling handles, and firmly grasping handshakes. Arising from a chair becomes difficult. Walking becomes more precarious. Sudden falls, sometimes resulting in major injury to the skull or other bones, can occur, even from walking on minimally irregular ground or from other minor imbalances outside or in the home, due to weakness of quadriceps and gluteus muscles depriving the patient of automatic posture maintenance. A foot-drop can increase the likelihood of tripping. Dysphagia can occur, usually caused by upper esophageal constriction that often can be symptomatically improved, for several months to years, by bougie dilation per a GI or ENT physician. Respiratory muscle weakness can sometimes eventuate.\"\nCauses.\nThe cause of IBM is unknown. IBM likely results from the interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors.\nThere are two major theories about how sIBM is caused. One hypothesis suggests that the inflammation-immune reaction, caused by an unknown trigger\u00a0\u2013 likely an undiscovered virus or an autoimmune disorder \u2013 is the primary cause of sIBM and that the degeneration of muscle fibers and protein abnormalities are secondary features. Despite the arguments \"in favor of an adaptive immune response in sIBM, a purely autoimmune hypothesis for sIBM is untenable because of the disease's resistance to most immunotherapy.\"\nThe second school of thought advocates the theory that sIBM is a degenerative disorder related to aging of the muscle fibers and that abnormal, potentially pathogenic protein accumulations in myofibrils play a key causative role in sIBM (apparently before the immune system comes into play). This hypothesis emphasizes the abnormal intracellular accumulation of many proteins, protein aggregation and misfolding, proteosome inhibition, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.\nOne review discusses the \"limitations in the beta-amyloid-mediated theory of IBM myofiber injury.\"\nDalakas (2006) suggested that a chain of events causes IBM \u2013 some sort of virus, likely a retrovirus, triggers the cloning of T cells. These T cells appear to be driven by specific antigens to invade muscle fibers. In people with sIBM, the muscle cells display \"flags\" telling the immune system that they are infected or damaged (the muscles ubiquitously express MHC class I antigens) and this immune process leads to the death of muscle cells. The chronic stimulation of these antigens also causes stress inside the muscle cell in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and this ER stress may be enough to cause a self-sustaining T cell response (even after a virus has dissipated). In addition, this ER stress may cause the misfolding of protein. The ER is in charge of processing and folding molecules carrying antigens. In IBM, muscle fibers are overloaded with these major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules that carry the antigen protein pieces, leading to more ER stress and more protein misfolding.\nA self-sustaining T cell response would make sIBM a type of autoimmune disorder. When studied carefully, it has not been possible to detect an ongoing viral infection in the muscles. One theory is that a chronic viral infection might be the initial triggering factor setting IBM in motion. There have been a handful of IBM cases \u2013 approximately 15 \u2013 that have shown clear evidence of a virus called HTLV-1. The HTLV-1 virus can cause leukemia, but in most cases lies dormant and most people end up being lifelong carriers of the virus. One review says that the best evidence points towards a connection with some type of retrovirus and that a retroviral infection combined with immune recognition of the retrovirus is enough to trigger the inflammation process.\nGenetics.\nsIBM is not inherited and is not passed on to the children of IBM patients. There are genetic features that do not directly cause IBM but that appear to predispose a person to getting IBM\u00a0\u2013 having this particular combination of genes increases one's susceptibility to getting IBM. Some 67% of IBM patients have a particular combination of human leukocyte antigen genes in a section of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype in the center of the MHC class II region. sIBM is not passed on from generation to generation, although the susceptibility region of genes may be.\nThere are also several rare forms of hereditary inclusion body myopathy that are linked to specific genetic defects and that are passed on from generation to generation. Since these forms do not show features of muscle inflammation, they are classified as myopathies rather than forms of myositis. Because they do not display inflammation as a primary symptom, they may in fact be similar, but different diseases to sporadic inclusion body myositis. There are several different types, each inherited in different ways. See hereditary inclusion body myopathy.\nA 2007 review concluded there is no indication that the genes responsible for the familial or hereditary conditions are involved in sIBM.\nDiagnosis.\nElevated creatine kinase (CK) levels in the blood (at most ~10 times normal) are typical in sIBM but affected individuals can also present with normal CK levels. Electromyography (EMG) studies display variable abnormalities such as increased insertional activity, increased spontaneous activity (fibrillation potentials and sharp waves), and large/broad or short/narrow motor unit potentials. On EMG, recruitment patterns can be reduced or increased. Findings can vary even within the same muscle of an affected individual. Muscle biopsy may display several common findings including inflammatory cells invading muscle cells, vacuolar degeneration, and inclusion bodies of aggregations of multiple proteins. sIBM is a challenge to the pathologist and even with a biopsy, diagnosis can be ambiguous.\nA diagnosis of inclusion body myositis was historically dependent on muscle biopsy results. Antibodies to cytoplasmic 5'-nucleotidase (cN1A; NT5C1A) have been strongly associated with the condition. However, other inflammatory conditions, such as lupus, can have a positive anti-NT5C1A. As of 2019, it remains to be established whether a positive anti-NT5C1A antibody test can make muscle biopsy unneeded.\nMuscle imaging can help establish the pattern of muscle involvement and selection of a biopsy site.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nIBM is often initially misdiagnosed as polymyositis. A course of prednisone is typically completed with no improvement and eventually, sIBM is confirmed. sIBM weakness comes on over months or years and progresses steadily, whereas polymyositis has an onset of weeks or months. Muscular dystrophy (e.g., limb girdle muscular dystrophy) must be considered as well. sIBM can be mistaken for physical deconditioning.\nHereditary myopathies can mimic sIBM, both in signs and symptoms and in the appearance of muscle biopsies. A small percentage of those initially diagnosed with sIBM are later found to have pathogenic mutations in the genes \"VCP\" and \"SQSTM1\", which are known to cause hIBM.\nIBM has a distinctive pattern of muscle involvement that distinguishes it among inflammatory myopathies. Characteristic of IBM is weakness of finger flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. Other inflammatory myopathies cause a proximal muscle weakness pattern, such as weakness of hip flexion, abduction, and extension, as well as shoulder abduction. IBM and other inflammatory myopathies both cause bicep/tricep weakness.\nManagement.\nThere is no standard course of treatment to slow or stop the progression of the disease as of 2019. sIBM patients do not reliably respond to anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressant, or immunomodulatory medications. Most of disease management is supportive care. Prevention of falls is an important consideration. There is no consensus on exercise guidelines; however, physical therapy is recommended to teach the patient a home exercise program, to teach how to compensate during mobility-gait training with an assistive device, transfers and bed mobility. An exercise regimen preferentially minimizes a patient's risk of injury and corresponds to the patient's goals.\nOther related disorders.\nWhen sIBM was originally described, the major feature noted was muscle inflammation. Two other disorders were also known to display muscle inflammation, and sIBM was classified along with them. They are dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) and all three illnesses were called idiopathic (of unknown origin) myositis or inflammatory myopathies.\nIt appears that sIBM and polymyositis share some features, especially the initial sequence of immune system activation, however, polymyositis comes on over weeks or months, does not display the subsequent muscle degeneration and protein abnormalities as seen in IBM, and as well, polymyositis tends to respond well to treatments, IBM does not. IBM is often confused with (misdiagnosed as) polymyositis. Polymyositis that does not respond to treatment is likely IBM.\nDermatomyositis shares a number of similar physical symptoms and histopathological traits as polymyositis, but exhibits a skin rash not seen in polymyositis or sIBM. It may have different root causes unrelated to either polymyositis or sIBM.\nMutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) cause multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), which can present (among others) as a rare form of inclusion body myopathy.\nEpidemiology.\nPrevalence of disease in a rigorous meta-analysis in 2017 was 46 patients per million. The earliest published prevalence was in 2000 and put at 5 per million. A 2017 study in Ireland reported 112 per million. It is not believed that the disease prevalence is increasing with time, but rather diagnostics and reporting are improving.\nEstimates of the mean age of onset range from 61 to 68 years old.\nSociety and culture.\nIn the biographical drama film Father Stu, the protagonist, a boxer-turned-Catholic priest, has sIBM.\nMusician Peter Frampton was diagnosed with the disease in 2019.\nSportscaster and former Major League Baseball pitcher Mike Krukow has been diagnosed with the disease.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Ion implantation is used in semiconductor device fabrication and in metal finishing, as well as in materials science research. The ions can alter the elemental composition of the target (if the ions differ in composition from the target) if they stop and remain in the target. Ion implantation also causes chemical and physical changes when the ions impinge on the target at high energy. The crystal structure of the target can be damaged or even destroyed by the energetic collision cascades, and ions of sufficiently high energy (tens of MeV) can cause nuclear transmutation.\nGeneral principle.\nIon implantation equipment typically consists of an ion source, where ions of the desired element are produced, an accelerator, where the ions are electrostatically accelerated to a high energy or using radiofrequency, and a target chamber, where the ions impinge on a target, which is the material to be implanted. Thus ion implantation is a special case of particle radiation. Each ion is typically a single atom or molecule, and thus the actual amount of material implanted in the target is the integral over time of the ion current. This amount is called the dose. The currents supplied by implants are typically small (micro-amperes), and thus the dose which can be implanted in a reasonable amount of time is small. Therefore, ion implantation finds application in cases where the amount of chemical change required is small.\nTypical ion energies are in the range of 10 to 500 keV (1,600 to 80,000 aJ). Energies in the range 1 to 10 keV (160 to 1,600 aJ) can be used, but result in a penetration of only a few nanometers or less. Energies lower than this result in very little damage to the target, and fall under the designation ion beam deposition. Higher energies can also be used: accelerators capable of 5 MeV (800,000 aJ) are common. However, there is often great structural damage to the target, and because the depth distribution is broad (Bragg peak), the net composition change at any point in the target will be small.\nThe energy of the ions, as well as the ion species and the composition of the target determine the depth of penetration of the ions in the solid: A monoenergetic ion beam will generally have a broad depth distribution. The average penetration depth is called the range of the ions. Under typical circumstances ion ranges will be between 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. Thus, ion implantation is especially useful in cases where the chemical or structural change is desired to be near the surface of the target. Ions gradually lose their energy as they travel through the solid, both from occasional collisions with target atoms (which cause abrupt energy transfers) and from a mild drag from overlap of electron orbitals, which is a continuous process. The loss of ion energy in the target is called stopping and can be simulated with the binary collision approximation method.\nAccelerator systems for ion implantation are generally classified into medium current (ion beam currents between 10 \u03bcA and ~2 mA), high current (ion beam currents up to ~30 mA), high energy (ion energies above 200 keV and up to 10 MeV), and very high dose (efficient implant of dose greater than 1016 ions/cm2).\nIon source.\nAll varieties of ion implantation beamline designs contain general groups of functional components (see image). The first major segment of an ion beamline includes an ion source used to generate the ion species. The source is closely coupled to biased electrodes for extraction of the ions into the beamline and most often to some means of selecting a particular ion species for transport into the main accelerator section.\nThe ion source is often made of materials with a high melting point such as tungsten, tungsten doped with lanthanum oxide (lanthanated tungsten), molybdenum and tantalum. Lanthanum oxide helps extend the life of the ion source. Often, inside the ion source a plasma is created between two tungsten electrodes, called reflectors, using a gas often based on fluorine or hydrogen containing the ion to be implanted whether it is germanium, boron, or silicon, such as boron trifluoride, boron difluoride, germanium tetrafluoride or silicon tetrafluoride. Arsine gas or phosphine gas can be used in the ion source to provide arsenic or phosphorus respectively for implantation. The ion source also has an indirectly heated cathode. Alternatively this heated cathode can be used as one of the reflectors, eliminating the need for a dedicated one, or a directly heated cathode is used.\nOxygen-based gases (oxides) can be used to provide ions for implantation such as carbon dioxide for implanting carbon. Hydrogen or hydrogen with xenon, krypton or argon may be added to the plasma to delay the degradation of tungsten components due to the halogen cycle. The hydrogen can come from a high pressure cylinder or from a hydrogen generator that uses electrolysis. \nRepellers at each end of the ion source continually move the atoms from one end of the ion source to the other, resembling two mirrors pointed at each other constantly reflecting light.\nThe ions are extracted from the source by an extraction electrode outside the ion source through a slit shaped aperture in the source, then the ion beam then passes through an analysis magnet to select the ions that will be implanted and then passes through one or two linear accelerators (linacs) that accelerate the ions before they reach the wafer in a process chamber. In medium current ion implanters there is also a neutral ion trap before the process chamber to remove neutral ions from the ion beam.\nSome dopants such as aluminum, are often not provided to the ion source as a gas but as a solid compound based on Chlorine or Iodine that is vaporized in a nearby crucible such as Aluminium iodide or Aluminium chloride or as a solid sputtering target inside the ion source made of Aluminium oxide or Aluminium nitride. Implanting antimony often requires the use of a vaporizer attached to the ion source, in which antimony trifluoride, antimony trioxide, or solid antimony are vaporized in a crucible and a carrier gas is used to route the vapors to an adjacent ion source, although it can also be implanted from a gas containing fluorine such as antimony hexafluoride or vaporized from liquid antimony pentafluoride. Gallium, Selenium and Indium are often implanted from solid sources such as selenium dioxide for selenium although it can also be implanted from hydrogen selenide. Crucibles often last 60\u2013100 hours and prevent ion implanters from changing recipes or process parameters in less than 20\u201330 minutes. Ion sources can often last 300 hours.\nThe \"mass\" selection (just like in mass spectrometer) is often accompanied by passage of the extracted ion beam through a magnetic field region with an exit path restricted by blocking apertures, or \"slits\", that allow only ions with a specific value of the product of mass and velocity/charge to continue down the beamline. If the target surface is larger than the ion beam diameter and a uniform distribution of implanted dose is desired over the target surface, then some combination of beam scanning and wafer motion is used. Finally, the implanted surface is coupled with some method for collecting the accumulated charge of the implanted ions so that the delivered dose can be measured in a continuous fashion and the implant process stopped at the desired dose level.\nApplication in semiconductor device fabrication.\nDoping.\nSemiconductor doping with boron, phosphorus, or arsenic is a common application of ion implantation. When implanted in a semiconductor, each dopant atom can create a charge carrier in the semiconductor after annealing. Annealing is necessary after ion implantation to activate dopants and can be carried out using a tube or batch furnace, Rapid Thermal Processing, flash lamp anneal, laser anneal or other annealing techniques. A hole can be created for a p-type dopant, and an electron for an n-type dopant. This modifies the conductivity of the semiconductor in its vicinity. The technique is used, for example, for adjusting the threshold voltage of a MOSFET. Ion implantation is practical due to the high sensitivity of semiconductor devices to foreign atoms, as ion implantation does not deposit large numbers of atoms. Sometimes such as during the manufacturing of SiC devices, ion implantation is carried out while heating the SiC wafer to 500\u00a0\u00b0C. This is known as a hot implant and it is used to control damage to the surface of the semiconductor. Cryogenic implants (Cryo-implants) can have the same effect.\nThe energies used in doping often vary from 1 KeV to 3 MeV and it is not possible to build an ion implanter capable of providing ions at any energy due to physical limitations. To increase the throughput of ion implanters, efforts have been made to increase the current of the beam created by the implanter. The beam can be scanned across the wafer magnetically, electrostatically, mechanically or with a combination of these techniques. A mass analyzer magnet is used to select the ions that will be implanted on the wafer. Ion implantation is also used in displays containing LTPS transistors.\nIon implantation was developed as a method of producing the p-n junction of photovoltaic devices in the late 1970s and early 1980s, along with the use of pulsed-electron beam for rapid annealing, although pulsed-electron beam for rapid annealing has not to date been used for commercial production. Ion implantation is not used in most photovoltaic silicon cells, instead, thermal diffusion doping is used.\nSilicon on insulator.\nOne prominent method for preparing silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates from conventional silicon substrates is the \"SIMOX\" (separation by implantation of oxygen) process, wherein a buried high dose oxygen implant is converted to silicon oxide by a high temperature annealing process.\nMesotaxy.\nMesotaxy is the term for the growth of a crystallographically matching phase underneath the surface of the host crystal (compare to epitaxy, which is the growth of the matching phase on the surface of a substrate). In this process, ions are implanted at a high enough energy and dose into a material to create a layer of a second phase, and the temperature is controlled so that the crystal structure of the target is not destroyed. The crystal orientation of the layer can be engineered to match that of the target, even though the exact crystal structure and lattice constant may be very different. For example, after the implantation of nickel ions into a silicon wafer, a layer of nickel silicide can be grown in which the crystal orientation of the silicide matches that of the silicon.\nApplication in metal finishing.\nTool steel toughening.\nNitrogen or other ions can be implanted into a tool steel target (drill bits, for example). The structural change caused by the implantation produces a surface compression in the steel, which prevents crack propagation and thus makes the material more resistant to fracture. The chemical change can also make the tool more resistant to corrosion.\nSurface finishing.\nIn some applications, for example prosthetic devices such as artificial joints, it is desired to have surfaces very resistant to both chemical corrosion and wear due to friction. Ion implantation is used in such cases to engineer the surfaces of such devices for more reliable performance. As in the case of tool steels, the surface modification caused by ion implantation includes both a surface compression which prevents crack propagation and an alloying of the surface to make it more chemically resistant to corrosion.\nOther applications.\nIon beam mixing.\nIon implantation can be used to achieve ion beam mixing, i.e. mixing up atoms of different elements at an interface. This may be useful for achieving graded interfaces or strengthening adhesion between layers of immiscible materials.\nIon implantation-induced nanoparticle formation.\nIon implantation may be used to induce nano-dimensional particles in oxides such as sapphire and silica. The particles may be formed as a result of precipitation of the ion implanted species, they may be formed as a result of the production of a mixed oxide species that contains both the ion-implanted element and the oxide substrate, and they may be formed as a result of a reduction of the substrate, first reported by Hunt and Hampikian. Typical ion beam energies used to produce nanoparticles range from 50 to 150 keV, with ion fluences that range from 1016 to 1018 ions/cm2. The table below summarizes some of the work that has been done in this field for a sapphire substrate. A wide variety of nanoparticles can be formed, with size ranges from 1\u00a0nm on up to 20\u00a0nm and with compositions that can contain the implanted species, combinations of the implanted ion and substrate, or that are comprised solely from the cation associated with the substrate.\nComposite materials based on dielectrics such as sapphire that contain dispersed metal nanoparticles are promising materials for optoelectronics and nonlinear optics.\nProblems with ion implantation.\nCrystallographic damage.\nEach individual ion produces many point defects in the target crystal on impact such as vacancies and interstitials. Vacancies are crystal lattice points unoccupied by an atom: in this case the ion collides with a target atom, resulting in transfer of a significant amount of energy to the target atom such that it leaves its crystal site. This target atom then itself becomes a projectile in the solid, and can cause successive collision events.\nInterstitials result when such atoms (or the original ion itself) come to rest in the solid, but find no vacant space in the lattice to reside. These point defects can migrate and cluster with each other, resulting in dislocation loops and other defects. Different ion species, implantation dose, and energy can lead to different types of defects. Strain and local distortion will also appear as a result of the ion implantation.\nDamage recovery.\nBecause ion implantation causes unwanted damage to the crystal structure of the target, ion implantation processing is often followed by thermal annealing to restore the crystal structure, as the thermal treatment can provide extra energy to the lattice. Some common annealing techniques include conventional furnace annealing, rapid thermal annealing (RTA), and laser annealing. RTA and laser annealing have much shorter annealing times, significantly limiting the dopant diffusion, while furnace annealing can achieve better uniformity.\nAmorphization.\nThe amount of crystallographic damage can be enough to completely amorphize the surface of the target: i.e. it can become an amorphous solid (such a solid produced from a melt is called a glass). In some cases, complete amorphization of a target is preferable to a highly defective crystal: An amorphized film can be regrown at a lower temperature than required to anneal a highly damaged crystal. Amorphisation of the substrate can occur as a result of the beam damage. For example, yttrium ion implantation into sapphire at an ion beam energy of 150 keV to a fluence of 5*1016 Y+/cm2 produces an amorphous glassy layer approximately 110\u00a0nm in thickness, measured from the outer surface. [Hunt, 1999]\nSputtering.\nSome of the collision events result in atoms being ejected (sputtered) from the surface, and thus ion implantation will slowly etch away a surface. The effect is only appreciable for very large doses.\nIon channelling.\nIf there is a crystallographic structure to the target, and especially in semiconductor substrates where the crystal structure is more open, particular crystallographic directions offer much lower stopping than other directions. The result is that the range of an ion can be much longer if the ion travels exactly along a particular direction, for example the &lt;110&gt; direction in silicon and other diamond cubic materials. This effect is called \"ion channelling\", and, like all the channelling effects, is highly nonlinear, with small variations from perfect orientation resulting in extreme differences in implantation depth. For this reason, most implantation is carried out a few degrees off-axis, where tiny alignment errors will have more predictable effects.\nIon channelling can be used directly in Rutherford backscattering and related techniques as an analytical method to determine the amount and depth profile of damage in crystalline thin film materials.\nSafety.\nHazardous materials.\nIn fabricating wafers, toxic materials such as arsine and phosphine are often used in the ion implanter process. Other common carcinogenic, corrosive, flammable, or toxic elements include antimony, arsenic, phosphorus, and boron. Semiconductor fabrication facilities are highly automated, but residue of hazardous elements in machines can be encountered during servicing and in vacuum pump hardware.\nHigh voltages and particle accelerators.\nHigh voltage power supplies used in ion accelerators necessary for ion implantation can pose a risk of electrical injury. In addition, high-energy atomic collisions can generate X-rays and, in some cases, other ionizing radiation and radionuclides. In addition to high voltage, particle accelerators such as radio frequency linear particle accelerators and laser wakefield plasma accelerators present other hazards.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "15571", "revid": "45679277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15571", "title": "John Woo", "text": "Hong Kong filmmaker (born 1947)\n use both this parameter and |birth_date to display the person's date of birth, date of death, and age at death) --&gt;\n \u200b(&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;)&lt;wbr /&gt;\u200b\nJohn Woo Yu-sen (; born 22 September 1946) is a Hong Kong film director known as a highly influential figure in the action film genre. The recipient of various accolades, including a Hong Kong Film Award for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Editing, as well as a Golden Horse Award, an Asia Pacific Screen Award and a Saturn Award, he is regarded as a pioneer of heroic bloodshed films and the gun fu genre in Hong Kong action cinema. He is known for his highly chaotic \"bullet ballet\" action sequences, stylized imagery, Mexican standoffs, frequent use of slow motion and allusions to \"wuxia\", film noir and Western cinema.\nConsidered one of the major figures of Hong Kong cinema, Woo has directed several notable action films. He is known for his collaborations with actor Chow Yun-fat in five Hong Kong action films: \"A Better Tomorrow\" (1986), which made Chow a box-office superstar in Asia, \"A Better Tomorrow II\" (1987), \"The Killer\" (1989), \"Once a Thief\" (1991), and \"Hard Boiled\" (1992). He has also directed martial arts films such as \"The Dragon Tamers\" (1975), \"Hand of Death\" (1976), and \"Last Hurrah for Chivalry\" (1979), and action comedies such as \"Follow the Star\" (1978), \"From Riches to Rags\" (1980), \"Run, Tiger, Run\" (1984), and the aforementioned \"Once a Thief\".\n\"Hard Target\" (1993), starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, was his American directorial debut, and the first major Hollywood film directed by a Chinese\u00a0\u2013 and more broadly, Asian\u00a0\u2013 filmmaker. His other Hollywood films include \"Broken Arrow\" (1996), \"Face/Off\" (1997) and \"\" (2000). He made his Canadian debut with the action comedy film \"Once a Thief\" (1996), which is a remake of Woo's 1991 film of the same name. He continued to be active in Hong Kong cinema, directing films such as the two-part historical epic \"The Crossing\" (2014). His first Chinese-language feature since \"Hard Boiled\" (1992) was the internationally co-produced \"Red Cliff\" (2008\u20132009), which broke the Chinese box office record previously held by \"Titanic\" in mainland China.\nWoo is the creator of the comic series \"Seven Brothers\", published by Virgin Comics. He is the founder and chairman of the production company \"Lion Rock Productions\".\nEarly life.\nWoo was born as Wu Yu-seng (Ng Yu-sum in Cantonese) on 22 September 1946, in Guangzhou, China, amidst the chaotic Chinese Civil War. Due to school age restrictions, his mother changed his birth date to 22 September 1948, which is what remains on his passport. The Woo family, who were Protestant Christians, faced persecution during Mao Zedong's early anti-bourgeois purges after the communist revolution in China, and fled to Hong Kong when he was five.\nImpoverished, the Woo family lived in the slums at Shek Kip Mei. His father was a teacher, though rendered unable to work by tuberculosis, and his mother was a manual laborer on construction sites. The family was rendered homeless by the Shek Kip Mei Fire of 1953. Charitable donations from disaster relief efforts enabled the family to relocate; however, violent crime had by then become commonplace in Hong Kong housing projects. At age three he was diagnosed with a serious medical condition. Following surgery on his spine, he was unable to walk correctly until eight years old, and as a result his right leg is shorter than his left leg.\nHis Christian upbringing shows influences in his films. As a young boy, Woo had wanted to be a Christian minister. He later found a passion for movies influenced by the French New Wave especially Jean-Pierre Melville. Woo has said he was shy and had difficulty speaking, but found making movies a way to explore his feelings and thinking and would \"use movies as a language\".\nWoo found respite in Bob Dylan and in American Westerns. He has stated the final scene of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" made a particular impression on him in his youth: the device of two comrades, each of whom fire pistols from each hand, is a recurrent spectacle later found in his own work.\nCareer.\n1969\u20131985: Career beginnings in Hong Kong.\nIn 1969, Woo was hired as a script supervisor at Cathay Studios. In 1971, he became an assistant director at Shaw Studios. The same year, he watched Bruce Lee's \"The Big Boss\", which left a strong impression on him due to how different it was from earlier martial arts films. Lee's films inspired Woo to direct his own action films. Woo worked as assistant director for some films directed by Chang Cheh during the 1970s, and took inspiration from Cheh's work. His directorial debut in 1974 was the feature film \"The Young Dragons\" (\u9435\u6f22\u67d4\u60c5, \"Ti\u011b h\u00e0n r\u00f3u q\u00edng\"). In the kung fu film genre, it was choreographed by Jackie Chan. The film was picked up by Golden Harvest Studio, where he went on to direct more martial arts films. He later had success as a comedy director with \"Money Crazy\" (\u767c\u9322\u5bd2, \"F\u0101 qi\u00e1n h\u00e0n\") (1977), starring Hong Kong comedian Ricky Hui and Richard Ng.\n1986\u20131992: 'Heroic Bloodshed', breakthrough and international recognition.\nBy the mid-1980s, Woo was experiencing occupational burnout. Several of his films were commercial disappointments, and he felt a distinct lack of creative control. It was during this period of self-imposed exile that director/producer Tsui Hark provided the funding for Woo to film a longtime pet project, \"A Better Tomorrow\" (1986). The story of two brothers\u2014one a law enforcement officer, the other a criminal\u2014was a financial blockbuster. \"A Better Tomorrow\" became a defining achievement in Hong Kong action cinema.\n\"John Woo: Interviews\" includes a 36-page interview with Woo by editor Robert K. Elder, which documents the years 1968 to 1990. It includes Woo's early career in working on comedies, his work on kung fu films (during which time he gave Jackie Chan one of his first major film roles), and more recently, his gunpowder morality plays in Hong Kong. In 1992, during a Toronto International Film Festival press conference for \"Reservoir Dogs\", Quentin Tarantino revealed he wrote a screenplay for a film directed by Woo, but went unproduced.\n1993\u20132000: Move to the United States and international success.\nAn \u00e9migr\u00e9 in 1993, the director experienced difficulty in cultural adjustment while contracted with Universal Studios to direct Jean-Claude Van Damme in \"Hard Target\". Like other foreign national film directors confronted with the Hollywood environment, Woo was unaccustomed to pervasive management concerns over matters such as limitations on violence and completion schedules. When initial cuts failed to yield an \"R\" rated film, the studio assumed control of the project and edited footage to produce a cut \"suitable for American audiences\".\nA three-year hiatus saw Woo next direct John Travolta and Christian Slater in \"Broken Arrow.\" A frenetic chase-themed film, the director once again found himself hampered by studio management and editorial concerns. Despite a larger budget than his previous \"Hard Target,\" the final feature lacked the trademark Woo style. Public reception saw modest financial success.\nReluctant to pursue projects which would necessarily entail front-office controls, the director cautiously rejected the script for \"Face/Off\" several times until it was rewritten to suit him. (The futuristic setting was changed to a contemporary one.) Paramount Pictures also offered the director significantly more freedom to exercise his speciality: emotional characterisation and elaborate action. A complex story of adversaries\u2014each of whom surgically alters their identity\u2014law enforcement agent John Travolta and terrorist Nicolas Cage play a cat-and-mouse game, trapped in each other's outward appearance. \"Face/Off\" opened in 1997 to critical acclaim and strong attendance. Grosses in the United States exceeded $100\u00a0million. \"Face/Off\" was also nominated for an Academy Award in the category Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger) at the 70th Academy Awards.\nAround this period, Woo would also produce and direct several film and TV projects. In 1996, Woo produced and directed \"Once a Thief\", a Canadian made-for-television remake of Woo's 1991 caper film. The teleplay subsequently spawned a television series of the same name, which Woo executive produced. In 1998, Woo directed \"Blackjack\", which featured Dolph Lundgren as a leukophobic bodyguard who hunts down an assassin. The film was intended as a backdoor pilot for a television series, but was not picked up. That same year, Woo served as executive producer and action choreographer on Antoine Fuqua's directorial debut \"The Replacement Killers\", which featured Chow Yun-Fat's first international starring role.\nLater, Woo directed \"\", the second entry in the Tom Cruise-led . Despite receiving mixed reviews, \"Mission: Impossible 2\" grossed over $549 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2000, as well as of Woo's career.\n2001\u20132007: Decline in Hollywood and other ventures.\nWoo made two additional films in Hollywood: \"Windtalkers\" (2002) and \"Paycheck\" (2003), both of which fared poorly at the box office and were summarily dismissed by critics. Also in 2003, Woo directed a television pilot entitled \"The Robinsons: Lost in Space\" for The WB Television Network, based on the 1960s television series \"Lost in Space\". The pilot was not purchased.\nWoo also directed and produced the 2007 video game \"Stranglehold\", which is a sequel to his 1992 film, \"Hard Boiled\". The game features Woo as a multiplayer playable character. That same year he produced the anime movie, \"\", the sequel to Shinji Aramaki's 2004 film \"Appleseed\".\n2008\u20132017: \"Red Cliff\" and return to Asian cinema.\nIn 2008, Woo returned to Asian cinema with the completion of the two-part epic war film \"Red Cliff\", based on a historical battle from \"Records of the Three Kingdoms\". Produced on a grand scale, it is his first film in China since he emigrated from Hong Kong to the United States in 1993. Part 1 of the film was released throughout Asia in July 2008, to generally favourable reviews and strong attendance. Part 2 was released in China in January 2009.\nWoo was presented with a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival in 2010. At this time, Woo also served as co-director and producer of the 2010 wuxia film \"Reign of Assassins\", starring Michelle Yeoh.\nHe followed \"Red Cliff\" with another two-part film, \"The Crossing\", in 2014 and 2015. Featuring an all-star cast, the four-hour epic tells the parallel stories of several characters who all ultimately find themselves passengers on the doomed Taiping steamer, which sank in 1949 en route from mainland China to Taiwan and has been described as \"China's \"Titanic\"\".\nFollowing the box-office disappointment of \"The Crossing\", Woo and producer Terence Chang disbanded Lion Rock Productions.\nWoo followed up \"The Crossing\" with \"Manhunt\", a remake of the 1976 Japanese crime thriller of the same name. Production started on \"Manhunt\" in June 2016 in Osaka and later reported to be finished filming by the end of November. The film, co-led by Chinese actor Zhang Hanyu and Japanese actor Masaharu Fukuyama, features a large Japanese cast including Yasuaki Kurata, Jun Kunimura, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, Nanami Sakuraba, Naoto Takenaka and Tao Okamoto. In addition, Chinese actress Qi Wei, Korean actress Ha Ji-won and Woo's daughter Angeles were cast in key roles in the film. The film was released in China on 24 November 2017.\n2021\u2013present: \"Silent Night\" and return to Hollywood.\nFollowing another hiatus, Woo returned to Hollywood to direct the action thriller \"Silent Night\", where a normal father heads into the underworld to avenge his young son's death. Produced by Basil Iwanyk, the film starred Joel Kinnaman and was told entirely without dialogue. It was Woo's first American feature film since \"Paycheck\" (2003).\nWoo commented in 2015 that he would remake \"The Killer\" for American audiences. Initially, actress Lupita Nyong'o had been cast for the lead role, however by March 2023, Nathalie Emmanuel was cast instead, with Omar Sy joining the film as the cop character. The film was directed by Woo, produced by Universal Studios and released exclusively on Peacock.\nIn September 2024, Woo's official Instagram account and the social media accounts of the duo Sparks all posted a photo of Woo with members Ron and Russell Mael, strongly hinting at collaborating on a \"new project\" which would not be an action film. The hashtag #xcrucior points to a musical Sparks have been developing with Focus Features as their follow-up to \"Annette\" and sought a director for. Woo has previously tried to get musical projects in production, and shares a love of French cinema and Jaques Demy's \"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" with the Mael brothers. He later confirmed it to be a \"half-musical\".\nUnrealized film projects.\nIn May 2008, Woo announced in Cannes that his next movie would be \"1949\", an epic love story set between the end of World War II and Chinese Civil War to the founding of the People's Republic of China, the shooting of which would take place in China and Taiwan. Its production was due to begin by the end of 2008, with a theatrical release planned in December 2009. However, in early April 2009, the film was cancelled due to script right issues. Reports indicated that Woo might be working on another World War II film, this time about the American Volunteer Group, or the Flying Tigers. The movie was tentatively titled \"Flying Tiger Heroes\" and Woo is reported as saying it will feature \"The most spectacular aerial battle scenes ever seen in Chinese cinema.\" It was not clear whether Woo would not be directing the earlier war film, or whether it was put on the back burner. Woo has stated that Flying Tiger Heroes would be an \"extremely important production\" and will \"emphasise US-Chinese friendship and the contributions of the Flying Tigers and the Yunnan people during the war of resistance.\" Woo has announced he will be using IMAX cameras to film the \"Flying Tigers\" project. \"It has always been a dream of mine to explore shooting with IMAX cameras and to work in the IMAX format, and the strong visual element of this film is incredibly well-suited to the tastes of cinemagoers today [...] Using IMAX for Flying Tigers would create a new experience for the audience, and I think it would be another breakthrough for Chinese movies\".\nPersonal life.\nWoo has been married to Annie Woo Ngau Chun-lung since 1976. They have two daughters, Kimberley Woo, Angeles Woo, and a son Frank Woo. He is a Christian and told BBC in an interview that he believes in God and has utmost admiration for Jesus, whom he calls a \"great philosopher\".\nHis three favorite films are David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\", Akira Kurosawa's \"Seven Samurai\" and Jean-Pierre Melville's \"Le Samoura\u00ef\". A complete list of his 48 inspirational films was published in May 2018. As of July 2024, Woo is the only filmmaker who has listed \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" by David Lean and \"Zorba the Greek\" by Michael Cacoyannis as favorites on LaCinetek, a French website that collects and publishes lists from film directors.\nFilmography.\nTelevision.\nProducer only\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "15573", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15573", "title": "Japan", "text": "Island country in East Asia\nJapan is an island country in East Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the Asian mainland, it is bordered to the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea in the south. The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands alongside 14,121 smaller islands. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight traditional regions, and around 75% of its terrain is mountainous and heavily forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population along its eastern coastal plains. With a population of over 123\u00a0million as of 2025, it is the world's 11th most populous country. Tokyo is the country's capital and largest city.\nThe first known habitation of the archipelago dates to the Upper Paleolithic, with the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic dating to c.\u200936,000 BC. Between the 4th and 6th centuries, its kingdoms were united under an emperor in Nara and later Heian-ky\u014d. From the 12th century, actual power was held by military aristocrats known as and feudal lords called , enforced by warrior nobility named \"samurai\". After rule by the Kamakura and Ashikaga shogunates and a century of warring states, Japan was unified in 1600 by the Tokugawa shogunate, which implemented an isolationist foreign policy. In 1853, an American fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. \nThe Meiji period saw Japan pursue rapid industrialization, modernization, militarism, and overseas colonization. The country annexed Korea in 1910, invaded China in 1937, and attacked the U.S. and European colonial powers in 1941, thus entering World War II as an Axis power. After being defeated in the Pacific War and suffering the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under Allied occupation. It underwent rapid economic growth in the following decades and became one of the first major non-NATO allies of the U.S. Since the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in the early 1990s, it has experienced a prolonged period of economic stagnation referred to as the Lost Decades.\nJapan is a constitutional monarchy with a bicameral legislature known as the National Diet. Widely considered a great power and the only Asian member of the G7, it maintains one of the world's strongest militaries but has constitutionally renounced its right to declare war. A developed country with one of the world's largest economies by nominal GDP, it is a global leader in the automotive, electronics, and robotics industries, in addition to making significant contributions to science and technology. It has one of the world's highest life expectancies, but is undergoing a population decline. The culture of Japan is well known around the world, particularly its popular culture as expressed in animation, art, comics, cuisine, fashion, films, music, television, and video games.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji and is pronounced or . Before was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as (, changed in Japan around 757 to ) and in Japan by the endonym . , the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored for official uses, including on Japanese banknotes and postage stamps. is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters mean \"sun origin\", which is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".\nThe name \"Japan\" is based on Min or Wu Chinese pronunciations of and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the Early Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of the characters as . The old Malay name for Japan, or , was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as \"Giapan\" in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric to classical history.\nModern humans arrived in Japan around 38,000 years ago (~36,000 BC), marking the beginning of the Japanese Paleolithic. Around 14,500\u00a0BC (the start of the J\u014dmon period), a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture emerged. Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. The Japonic-speaking Yayoi people later entered the archipelago from the Korean Peninsula, intermingling with the J\u014dmon people. The Yayoi period saw the introduction of innovative practices including wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy from China and Korea. According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (descendant of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.\nJapan first appears in written history in the Chinese \"Book of Han\", completed in 111 AD, where it is described as having a hundred small kingdoms. A century later, the \"Book of Wei\" records that the kingdom of Yamatai (which may refer to Yamato) unified most of these kingdoms. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh\u014dtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592\u2013710).\nIn 645, the government led by Prince Naka no \u014ce and Fujiwara no Kamatari devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. The Reform began with land reform, based on Confucian ideas and philosophies from China. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The true aim of the reforms was to bring about greater centralization and to enhance the power of the imperial court, which was also based on the governmental structure of China. Envoys and students were dispatched to China to learn about Chinese writing, politics, art, and religion. \nThe Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince \u014cama and his nephew Prince \u014ctomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih\u014d Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.\nThe Nara period (710\u2013784) marked the emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the (712) and (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture. A smallpox epidemic in 735\u2013737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital, settling on Heian-ky\u014d (modern-day Kyoto) in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794\u20131185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's \"The Tale of Genji\" and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem were written during this time.\nFeudal era.\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan by the Minamoto clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura. After Yoritomo's death, the H\u014dj\u014d clan came to power as regents for the . The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333) and became popular among the samurai class. \nThe Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573). The succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords () and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").\nDuring the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West (see Nanban trade and Nanban art). Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other ; his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period. After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, unified the nation in the early 1590s and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori within the Council of Five Elders and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed by Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including , as a code of conduct to control the autonomous , and in 1639 the isolationist (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603\u20131868). Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads (Kaid\u014d) and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. The study of Western sciences () continued through contact with the Dutch enclave in Nagasaki. The Edo period gave rise to (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.\nModern era.\nThe United States Navy sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry to force the opening of Japan to the outside world. Arriving at Uraga with four \"Black Ships\" in July 1853, the Perry Expedition resulted in the March 1854 Convention of Kanagawa. Subsequent similar treaties with other Western countries brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution (November 29, 1890), and assembled the Imperial Diet. \nDuring the Meiji period (1868\u20131912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed state in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin, and annexed Korea in 1910. The Japanese population doubled from 35\u00a0million in 1873 to 70\u00a0million by 1935, with a significant shift to urbanization.\nThe early 20th century saw a period of Taish\u014d democracy (1912\u20131926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and China in 1920. The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, a period of lawlessness following the 1923 Great Tokyo Earthquake, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups. \nThis process accelerated in the 1930s, spawning several radical nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded China and occupied Manchuria, which led to the establishment of puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations in 1933. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis powers.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945). In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7\u20138, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, among others, beginning World War II in the Pacific. Throughout areas occupied by Japan during the war, numerous abuses were committed against local inhabitants. Many women were forced into sexual slavery. \nAfter Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. The war cost Japan millions of lives and many of its conquered territories, including \"de jure\" parts of Japan such as Korea, Taiwan, Karafuto, and the Kurils. The Allies, led by the United States, repatriated millions of Japanese settlers from their former colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Empire of Japan and its influence over the territories it conquered. The Allies convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders except the Emperor for Japanese war crimes.\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the world's second-largest economy at that time; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\" characterized by economic stagnation and low inflation. In 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history\u2014the T\u014dhoku earthquake\u2014triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became Emperor, beginning the era (2019-).\nGeography.\nJapan comprises 14,125 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over northeast\u2013southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China Sea. The country's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp\u014d Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019[ [update]], Japan's territory is . Japan has the sixth-longest coastline in the world at . Because of its far-flung outlying islands, Japan's exclusive economic zone is the eighth-largest in the world, covering .\nThe Japanese archipelago is 67% forests and 14% agricultural. The primarily rugged and mountainous terrain is restricted for habitation. Thus the habitable zones, mainly in the coastal areas, have very high population densities: Japan is the 40th most densely populated country even without considering that local concentration. Honshu has the highest population density at 450 persons/km2 (1200/sq mi) as of 2010[ [update]], while Hokkaido has the lowest density of 64.5 persons/km2 as of 2016[ [update]]. As of 2014[ [update]], approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (). Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and the country's largest freshwater lake.\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanic eruptions because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 17th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2016 World Risk Index. Japan has 111 active volcanoes. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century; the 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.\nClimate.\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. The northernmost region, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.\nIn the Sea of Japan region on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall during winter. In the summer, the region sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the Foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter. The mountains of the Ch\u016bgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.\nThe Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp\u014d Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain. According to the Environment Ministry, heavy rainfall and increasing temperatures have caused problems in the agricultural industry and elsewhere. The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, , was recorded on August 5, 2025.\nBiodiversity.\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry\u016bky\u016b and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife as of 2019[ [update]], including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the small Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. There are 53 Ramsar wetland sites in Japan. Five sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.\nEnvironment.\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concerns, the government introduced environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.\nJapan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a country's commitment to environmental sustainability. Japan is the world's fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change. In 2020, the government of Japan announced a target of carbon-neutrality by 2050. Environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.\nGovernment and politics.\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the emperor (\"Tenn\u014d\") is limited to a ceremonial role. Executive power is instead wielded by the prime minister and the Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Naruhito is the Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 2019.\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 248 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The prime minister as the head of government has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State, and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet. Sanae Takaichi is Japan's prime minister; she took office after winning the 2025 Liberal Democratic Party leadership election and securing a confidence and supply agreement with Ishin.\nHistorically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as . Since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post\u2013World War II modifications. The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world. Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.\nAdministrative divisions.\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor and legislature. In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:\nForeign relations.\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan is one of the G4 countries seeking reform of the Security Council. Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. It is the world's fifth-largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2\u00a0billion in 2014. In 2024, Japan had the fourth-largest diplomatic network in the world. Japan is widely considered to be a great power due to its economic power and political, cultural, and military influence.\nJapan has close economic and military relations with the United States, with which it maintains a security alliance. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and a major source of Japanese imports, and is committed to defending the country, with military bases in Japan. In 2016, Japan announced the Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision, which frames its regional policies. Japan is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (\"the Quad\"), a multilateral security dialogue reformed in 2017 aiming to limit Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region, along with the United States, Australia, and India.\nJapan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. It contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan. Japan has strained relations with China over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.\nMilitary.\nJapan is the third highest-ranked Asian country in the 2024 Global Peace Index. It spent 1.4% of its total GDP on its defence budget and maintained the tenth-largest military budget in the world in 2024. The country's military, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. The military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The deployment of troops to Iraq and Afghanistan marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II.\nThe Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines. In 2015, the Japanese parliament passed the Legislation for Peace and Security, allowing the JSDF to participate in foreign conflicts in an \"existential crisis situation\". In December 2022, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida instructed the government to increase spending by 65% until 2027. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea and China, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.\nLaw enforcement.\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency. As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission. The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads. The Japan Coast Guard guards territorial waters surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.\nThe Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords, and other weaponry. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics as of 2018[ [update]], the incidence rates of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, sexual violence, and robbery are very low in Japan.\nHuman rights.\nJapanese society traditionally places a strong emphasis on collective harmony and conformity, which has led to the suppression of individual rights. Japan's constitution prohibits racial and religious discrimination, and the country is a signatory to numerous international human rights treaties. However, it lacks any laws against discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or gender identity and does not have a national human rights institution.\nJapan has faced criticism for its gender inequality, not allowing same-sex marriages, use of racial profiling by police, and allowing capital punishment. Other human rights issues include the treatment of marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities, refugees and asylum seekers.\nEconomy.\nJapan has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP, after that of the United States, China, Germany and India; and the fifth-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. As of 2023[ [update]], Japan's labor force is the world's tenth-largest, consisting of over 69.2\u00a0million workers. As of 2024[ [update]], Japan has a low unemployment rate of around 2.6%. Its poverty rate is the second highest among the G7 countries, and exceeds 15.7% of the population. Japan has the highest ratio of public debt to GDP among advanced economies, with a national debt estimated at 248% relative to GDP as of 2022[ [update]]. The Japanese yen is the world's third-largest reserve currency after the US dollar and the euro.\nIn 2024, Japan was the world's eight-largest exporter and sixth-largest importer. Its exports amounted to 21.9% of its total GDP in 2023. In 2024, Japan's main export markets were China (22.2%, including Hong Kong) and the United States (20.6%). Its main exports are motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors, and auto parts. Japan's main import markets in 2024 were China (22.3%), the United States (10.5%), and Australia (7.1%). Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, and raw materials.\nThe Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are common in the Japanese work environment. Japan has a large cooperative sector, with three of the world's ten largest cooperatives, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative as of 2018[ [update]]. It ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. The country attracted 36.9\u00a0million international tourists in 2024, and was ranked eleventh in the world in 2019 for inbound tourism. The 2024 \"Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report\" ranked Japan third in the world out of 117 countries. Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $46.1\u00a0billion.\nAgriculture and fishery.\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.2% of the country's total GDP as of 2018[ [update]]. Only 11.2% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% as of 2018[ [update]]. Japan's small agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected. There has been a growing concern about farming as farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.\nJapan ranked seventh in the world in tonnage of fish caught and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting critiques that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has sparked controversy by supporting commercial whaling.\nIndustry and services.\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the \"largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods\". Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP. The country's manufacturing output is the fourth highest in the world as of 2023[ [update]].\nJapan is in the top three globally for both automobile production and export, and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company by production. The Japanese shipbuilding industry faces increasing competition from its East Asian neighbors, South Korea and China; a 2020 government initiative identified this sector as a target for increasing exports.\nOnce considered the strongest in the world, the Japanese consumer electronics industry is in a state of decline as regional competition arises in neighboring East Asian countries such as South Korea and China. However, Japan's video game sector remains a major industry; in 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6\u00a0billion, with $5.8\u00a0billion coming from mobile gaming. By 2015, Japan had become the world's fourth-largest PC game market by revenue, behind China, the United States, and South Korea.\nJapan's service sector accounts for about 69.8% of its total economic output as of 2023[ [update]]. Banking, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Toyota, Mitsubishi UFJ, -NTT, Aeon, SoftBank, Hitachi, and Itochu listed as among the largest in the world.\nScience and technology.\nRelative to gross domestic product, Japan's research and development budget is the sixth or seventh highest in the world, with 907,400 researchers sharing a 22-trillion-yen research and development budget as of 2023[ [update]]. Japan has the second highest number of researchers in science and technology per capita in the world with 14 per 1000 employees. The country has produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine, and three Fields medalists.\nJapan leads the world in robotics production and use, supplying 38% of the world's 2024 total; down from 55% in 2017.\nThe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib\u014d) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe \"Akatsuki\" was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include building a Moon base and landing astronauts by 2030. In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the Moon's origin and evolution. The explorer entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007, and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nJapan has invested heavily in transportation infrastructure since the 1990s. The country has approximately of roads made up of of city, town and village roads, of prefectural roads, of general national highways and of national expressways as of 2017[ [update]].\nSince privatization in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. The high-speed Shinkansen (bullet trains) that connect major cities are known for their safety and punctuality.\nThere are 280 airports in Japan as of 2025[ [update]]. The largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was Asia's second-busiest airport in 2019. The Keihin and Hanshin superport hubs are among the largest in the world, at 7.98 and 5.22\u00a0million TEU respectively as of 2017[ [update]].\nEnergy.\nAs of 2019[ [update]], 37.1% of energy in Japan is produced from petroleum, 25.1% from coal, 22.4% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 2.8% from nuclear power, among other sources. Nuclear power was down from 11.2% in 2010. By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service. The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and has a heavy dependence on imported energy. The country has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.\nDemographics.\nJapan has a population of almost 123\u00a0million, of whom nearly 120\u00a0million are Japanese nationals (2024 estimates). A small population of foreign residents makes up the remainder. Japan is the world's fastest aging country and has the highest proportion of elderly citizens of any country, comprising one-third of its total population; this is the result of a post\u2013World War II baby boom, which was followed by an increase in life expectancy and a decrease in birth rates. \nJapan has a total fertility rate of 1.2, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is among the world's lowest: it has a median age of 48.4, the highest in the world. As of 2025[ [update]], over 29.3% of the population is over 65, or more than one in four out of the Japanese population. As a growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remaining childless, Japan's population is expected to drop to around 88\u00a0million by 2065.\nThe changes in demographic structure have created several social issues, particularly a decline in the workforce population and an increase in the cost of social security benefits. The Government of Japan projects that there will be almost one elderly person for each person of working age by 2060. Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.\nIn 2023, 92% of the Japanese population lived in cities. The capital city, Tokyo, has a population of 13.9\u00a0million (2022). It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 37.4\u00a0million people (2024). Japan is an ethnically and culturally homogeneous society, with the Japanese people forming 97.4% of the country's population. Minority ethnic groups in the country include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people. Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, and Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent are also among Japan's small minority groups. \"Burakumin\" make up a social minority group.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLanguages.\nThe Japanese language is Japan's \"de facto\" national language and the primary written and spoken language of most people in the country. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radicals used by kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. English has taken a major role in Japan as a business and international link language, and is a compulsory subject at the junior and senior high school levels. Japanese Sign Language is the primary sign language used in Japan and has gained some official recognition, but its usage has been historically hindered by discriminatory policies and a lack of educational support.\nBesides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few native speakers remaining as of 2014[ [update]]. Additionally, a number of other languages are taught and used by ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, and a growing number of foreign-language students, such as Korean (including a distinct Zainichi Korean dialect), Chinese and Portuguese.\nReligion.\nJapan's constitution guarantees full religious freedom. Upper estimates suggest that 84\u201396% of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual. The level of participation in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.\nIn 2018, 1% to 1.5% of the population were Christians. Throughout the latest century, Western customs originally related to Christianity, including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas, have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.\nAbout 90% of those practicing Islam in Japan are foreign-born migrants as of 2016[ [update]]. In 2018, there were an estimated 105 mosques and 200,000 Muslims in Japan, 43,000 of which were Japanese nationals. Other minority religions include Hinduism, Judaism, and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, as well as the animist beliefs of the Ainu.\nEducation.\nSince the 1947 Fundamental Law of Education, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years. Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school. The top-ranking university in Japan is the University of Tokyo. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program. MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) coordinated by the OECD ranks the knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world. Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math, and sciences with the average student scoring 520 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. It spent 7.4% of its total GDP on education in 2021. \nIn 2023, Japan ranked third for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education, at 56%. Approximately 65.5% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification, with bachelor's degrees being held by 34.8% of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. Japanese women are more highly educated than the men: 59% of women possess a university degree, compared to 52% of men.\nHealth.\nHealth care in Japan is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.\nJapan spent 11.42% of its total GDP on healthcare in 2022. In 2020, the overall life expectancy in Japan at birth was 85 years (82 years for men and 88 years for women), the highest in the world; while it had a very low infant mortality rate (2 per 1,000 live births). Since 1981, the principal cause of death in Japan is cancer, which accounted for 27% of the total deaths in 2018\u2014followed by cardiovascular diseases, which led to 15% of the deaths. Japan has one of the world's highest suicide rates, which is considered a major social issue. Another significant public health issue is smoking among Japanese men. Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia among developed countries.\nCulture.\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe, and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords, and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha, and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance. Japan is considered a cultural superpower.\nArt and architecture.\nThe history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism.\nJapanese architecture is a combination of local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden or mud plaster structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Since the 19th century, Japan has incorporated much of Western modern architecture into construction and design. It was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz\u014d Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.\nLiterature and philosophy.\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the and chronicles and the poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as \"kana\" (hiragana and katakana) was developed. \"The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter\" is considered the oldest extant Japanese narrative. An account of court life is given in \"The Pillow Book\" by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, while \"The Tale of Genji\" by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.\nDuring the Edo period, the ch\u014dnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash\u014d revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh\u016b with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue \"Oku no Hosomichi\". The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S\u014dseki and Mori \u014cgai were significant novelists in the early 20th century, followed by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, Kaf\u016b Nagai and, more recently, Haruki Murakami and Kenji Nakagami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors\u00a0\u2013 Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce (1994).\nJapanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals remain evident in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.\nPerforming arts.\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, forms an integral part of Japanese culture. Kumi-daiko (ensemble drumming) was developed in post-war Japan and became very popular in North America. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop. Karaoke is a significant cultural activity.\nThe four traditional theaters from Japan are \"noh\", \"ky\u014dgen\", \"kabuki\", and \"bunraku\". Noh is one of the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.\nMedia.\nAccording to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79% of Japanese watch television daily. Japanese television dramas are viewed both within Japan and internationally. Many Japanese media franchises have gained considerable global popularity and are among the world's highest-grossing media franchises. Japanese newspapers are among the most circulated in the world as of 2016[ [update]].\nJapan has one of the oldest and largest film industries globally. Ishir\u014d Honda's \"Godzilla\" became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of \"kaiju\" films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Japanese comics, known as manga, developed in the mid-20th century and have become popular worldwide. A large number of manga series have become some of the best-selling comics series of all time, rivalling the American comics industry. Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have become highly popular globally.\nHolidays.\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend. The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on the second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh\u014dwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on the third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on the third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on the second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.\nCuisine.\nJapanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staples. Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be termed a national dish, alongside ramen and sushi. Traditional Japanese sweets are known as \"wagashi\". Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes include green tea ice cream.\nPopular Japanese beverages include sake, a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14\u201317% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century. Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.\nSports.\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo and kendo are taught as part of the compulsory junior high school curriculum. Karate, which originated in the Ryukyu Kingdom, is popular across the world and has been included in the Olympic Games. Baseball is the most popular sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), was established in 1936. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League (J.League) in 1992, association football gained a wide following. The country co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times, and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan.\nIn motorsport, Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, and the World Rally Championship. Drivers from Japan have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as podium finishes in Formula One, in addition to success in domestic championships. Super GT is the most popular national racing series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top-level domestic open-wheel series. The country hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix.\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998. The country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship and co-hosted the 2023 Basketball World Championship. Tokyo hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2021, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice. The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other country. Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country and hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nGovernment\nGeneral information"}
{"id": "15575", "revid": "47864652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15575", "title": "Geography of Japan", "text": "Japan is an archipelagic country comprising a stratovolcanic archipelago over along the Pacific coast of East Asia. It consists of 14,125 islands. The five main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Okinawa. The other 14,120 islands are classified as \"remote islands\" by the Japanese government. The Ryukyu Islands and Nanp\u014d Islands are south and east of the main islands.\nThe territory covers . It is the fourth-largest island country in the world and the largest island country in East Asia. The country has the 6th longest coastline at and the 8th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of in the world.\nThe terrain is mostly rugged and mountainous, with 66% forest. The population is clustered in urban areas along the coast, plains, and valleys. Japan is located in the northwestern Ring of Fire on multiple tectonic plates. East of the Japanese archipelago are three oceanic trenches. The Japan Trench is created as the oceanic Pacific Plate subducts beneath the continental Okhotsk Plate. The continuous subduction process causes frequent earthquakes, tsunamis, and stratovolcanoes. The islands are also affected by typhoons. The subduction plates have pulled the Japanese archipelago eastward, created the Sea of Japan, and separated it from the Asian continent by back-arc spreading 15 million years ago.\nThe climate varies from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical and tropical rainforests in the south. These differences in climate and landscape have allowed the development of a diverse flora and fauna, with some rare endemic species, especially in the Ogasawara Islands.\nJapan extends from 20\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 north latitude (Okinotorishima to Benten-jima) and from 122\u00b0 to 153\u00b0 east longitude (Yonaguni to Minami Torishima). Japan is surrounded by seas. To the north, the Sea of Okhotsk separates it from the Russian Far East; to the west, the Sea of Japan separates it from the Korean Peninsula; to the southwest, the East China Sea separates the Ryukyu Islands from China and Taiwan; to the east is the Pacific Ocean.\nThe Japanese archipelago is over long in a north-to-southwardly direction from the Sea of Okhotsk to the Philippine Sea in the Pacific Ocean. It is narrow, and no point in Japan is more than from the sea. In 2023, a government recount of the islands with digital maps increased the total from 6,852 to 14,125 islands. The five main islands are (from north to south) Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Three of the four major islands (Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku) are separated by narrow straits of the Seto Inland Sea and form a natural entity. The 6,847 smaller islands are called remote islands. This includes the Bonin Islands, Dait\u014d Islands, Minami-Tori-shima, Okinotorishima, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands, Nansei Islands, and the Nanp\u014d Islands, as well as numerous islets, of which 430 are inhabited. The Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan but disputed by China. This excludes the disputed Northern Territories (Kuril Islands) and Liancourt Rocks. In total, as of 2021, Japan's territory is , of which is land and is water. Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (). It is the largest island country in East Asia and the fourth largest island country in the world.\nBecause of Japan's many far-flung outlying islands and long coastline, the country has extensive marine life and mineral resources in the ocean. The Exclusive Economic Zone of Japan covers and is the 8th largest in the world. It is more than 11 times the land area of the country. The Exclusive Economic Zone stretches from the baseline out to from its coast. Its territorial sea is , but between in the international straits\u2014La P\u00e9rouse (or S\u014dya Strait), Tsugaru Strait, \u014csumi, and Tsushima Strait.\nJapan has a population of 126 million as of 2019. It is the 11th most populous country in the world and the second most populous island country. 81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture, and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanp\u014d Islands.\nMap of Japan.\nJapan is formally divided into eight regions, from northeast (Hokkaid\u014d) to southwest (Ryukyu Islands):\nEach region contains several prefectures, except the Hokkaido region, which comprises only Hokkaido Prefecture.\nThe regions are not official administrative units but have been traditionally used as the regional division of Japan in a number of contexts. For example, maps and geography textbooks divide Japan into the eight regions; weather reports usually give the weather by region; and many businesses and institutions use their home region as part of their name (Kinki Nippon Railway, Ch\u016bgoku Bank, Tohoku University, etc.). While Japan has eight High Courts, their jurisdictions do not correspond with the eight regions.\nComposition, topography and geography.\nAbout 73% of Japan is mountainous, with a mountain range running through each of the main islands. Japan's highest mountain is Mount Fuji, with an elevation of . Japan's forest cover rate is 68.55% since the mountains are heavily forested. The only other developed nations with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden.\nSince there is little level ground, many hills and mountainsides at lower elevations around towns and cities are often cultivated. As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century. Hot springs are numerous and have been exploited by the leisure industry.\nThe Geospatial Information Authority of Japan measures Japan's territory annually in order to continuously grasp the state of the national land. As of July 1, 2021, Japan's territory is . It increases in area due to volcanic eruptions such as Nishinoshima (\u897f\u4e4b\u5cf6), the natural expansion of the islands, and land reclamation.\nThis table shows land use in 2002.\nLocation.\nThe Japanese archipelago is relatively far away from the Asian continent. Kyushu is closest to the southernmost point of the Korean peninsula, with a distance of , which is almost six times farther away than from England to France across the English Channel. Thus, historically, Kyushu was the gateway between Asia and Japan. China is separated by of sea from Japan's big main islands. Hokkaido is near Sakhalin, which was occupied by Japan from 1905 to 1945. Most of the population lives on the Pacific coast of Honsh\u016b. The west coast facing the Sea of Japan is less densely populated.\nThe Japanese archipelago has been difficult to reach since ancient history. During the Paleolithic period around 20,000 BCE, at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, there was a land bridge between Hokkaido and Sakhalin that linked Japan with the Asian continent. The land bridge disappeared when sea levels rose in the J\u014dmon period around 10,000 BCE.\nJapan's remote location, surrounded by vast seas, rugged, mountainous terrain, and steep rivers, makes it secure against invaders and uncontrolled migration from the Asian continent. The Japanese can close their civilization with an isolationist foreign policy. During the Edo period, the Tokugawa Shogunate enforced the Sakoku policy, which prohibited most foreign contact and trade from 1641 to 1853. In modern times, the inflow of people is managed via seaports and airports. Thus, Japan is fairly insulated from continental issues.\nThroughout history, Japan has never been fully invaded or colonized by other countries. The Mongols tried to invade Japan twice and failed in 1274 and 1281. Japan capitulated only once after nuclear attacks in World War II. At the time, Japan did not have nuclear technology. The insular geography is a major factor in the isolationist, semi-open, and expansionist periods of Japanese history.\nMountains and volcanoes.\nThe mountainous islands of the Japanese archipelago form a crescent off the eastern coast of Asia. They are separated from the continent by the Sea of Japan, which serves as a protective barrier. Japan has 108 active volcanoes (10% of the world's active volcanoes) because of active plate tectonics in the Ring of Fire.\nAround 15 million years ago, the volcanic shoreline of the Asian continent was pushed out into a series of volcanic island arcs. This created the \"back-arc basins\" known as the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk with the formal shaping of the Japanese archipelago. The archipelago also has summits on mountain ridges that were uplifted near the outer edge of the continental shelf. About 73 percent of Japan's area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent. A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves: the \"face\", facing the Pacific Ocean, and the \"back\", toward the Sea of Japan. On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.\nCentral Japan is marked by the convergence of the three mountain chains\u2014the Hida, Kiso, and Akaishi mountains\u2014that form the Japanese Alps (\"Nihon Arupusu\"), several of whose peaks are higher than . The highest point in the Japanese Alps is Mount Kita at . The highest point in the country is Mount Fuji (Fujisan, also erroneously called Fujiyama), a volcano dormant since 1707 that rises to above sea level in Shizuoka Prefecture. On the Sea of Japan side are plateaus and low mountain districts, with altitudes of 500 to 1,500 meters.\nPlains.\nThere are three major plains in central Honsh\u016b. The largest is the Kant\u014d Plain, which covers in the Kant\u014d region. The capital Tokyo and the largest metropolitan population are located there. The second largest plain in Honsh\u016b is the N\u014dbi Plain (), with the third-most-populous urban area being Nagoya. The third-largest plain in Honsh\u016b is the Osaka Plain, which covers in the Kinki region. It features the second-largest urban area of Osaka (part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area). Osaka and Nagoya extend inland from their bays until they reach steep mountains. The Osaka Plain is connected with Kyoto and Nara. Kyoto is located in the Yamashiro Basin () and Nara is in the Nara Basin ().\nThe Kant\u014d Plain, Osaka Plain, and N\u014dbi Plain are the most important economic, political, and cultural areas of Japan. These plains had the largest agricultural production and large bays with ports for fishing and trade. This made them the largest population centers. Kyoto and Nara are the ancient capitals and cultural heart of Japan. The Kant\u014d Plain became Japan's center of power because it is the largest plain with a central location, and historically, it had the most agricultural production that could be taxed. The Tokugawa Shogunate established a \"bakufu\" in Edo in 1603. This evolved into the capital of Tokyo by 1868.\nHokkaido has multiple plains, such as the Ishikari Plain (), Tokachi Plain (), the Kushiro Plain, the largest wetland in Japan (), and the Sarobetsu Plain (). There are many farms that produce a plethora of agricultural products. The average farm size in Hokkaido was 26 hectares per farmer in 2013. That is nearly 11 times larger than the national average of 2.4 hectares. This made Hokkaido the most agriculturally rich prefecture in Japan. Nearly one-fourth of Japan's arable land and 22% of Japan's forests are in Hokkaido.\nAnother important plain is the Sendai Plain around the city of Sendai in northeastern Honsh\u016b. Many of these plains are along the coast, and their areas have been increased by land reclamation throughout recorded history.\nRivers.\nRivers are generally steep and swift, and few are suitable for navigation except in their lower reaches. Although most rivers are less than in length, their rapid flow from the mountains is what provides hydroelectric power. Seasonal variations in flow have led to the extensive development of flood control measures. The longest, the Shinano River, which winds through Nagano Prefecture to Niigata Prefecture and flows into the Sea of Japan, is long.\nThese are the 10 longest rivers of Japan.\nLakes and coasts.\nThe largest freshwater lake is Lake Biwa (), northeast of Kyoto in Shiga Prefecture. Lake Biwa is an ancient lake and is estimated to be the 13th oldest lake in the world, dating to at least 4 million years ago. It has consistently carried water for millions of years. Lake Biwa was created by plate tectonics in an active rift zone. This created a very deep lake with a maximum depth of . Thus, it is not naturally filled with sediment. Over the course of millions of years, a diverse ecosystem evolved in the lake. It has more than 1,000 species and subspecies. There are 46 native fish species and subspecies, including 11 species and 5 subspecies that are endemic or near-endemic. Approximately 5,000 water birds visit the lake each year.\nThe following are the 10 largest lakes of Japan.\nExtensive coastal shipping, especially around the Seto Inland Sea, compensates for the lack of navigable rivers. The Pacific coastline south of Tokyo is characterized by long, narrow, gradually shallowing inlets produced by sedimentation, which has created many natural harbors. The Pacific coastline north of Tokyo, the coast of Hokkaido, and the Sea of Japan coast are generally unindented, with few natural harbors.\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 765\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in Japan, making it the 35th-ranked country in terms of tidal flat extent.\nLand reclamation.\nThe Japanese archipelago has been transformed by humans into a sort of continuous land, in which the four main islands are entirely reachable and passable by rail and road transportation thanks to the construction of huge bridges and tunnels that connect each other and various islands.\nApproximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (\"umetatechi\"). It began in the 12th century. Land was reclaimed from the sea and from river deltas by building dikes, drainage, and rice paddies on terraces carved into mountainsides. The majority of land reclamation projects occurred after World War II, during the Japanese economic miracle. Reclamation of 80% to 90% of all the tidal flatland was done. Large land reclamation projects with landfills were done in coastal areas for maritime and industrial factories, such as Higashi Ogishima in Kawasaki, Osaka Bay, and Nagasaki Airport. Port Island, Rokk\u014d Island, and Kobe Airport were built in Kobe. Late 20th and early 21st century projects include artificial islands such as Chubu Centrair International Airport in Ise Bay, Kansai International Airport in the middle of Osaka Bay, Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise, and Wakayama Marina City. The village of \u014cgata in Akita was established on land reclaimed from Lake Hachir\u014dgata (Japan's second largest lake at the time) starting in 1957. By 1977, the amount of land reclaimed totaled .\nExamples of land reclamation in Japan include:\nMuch reclaimed land is made up of landfill waste materials, dredged earth, sand, sediment, sludge, and soil removed from construction sites. It is used to build human-made islands in harbors and embankments in inland areas. On November 8, 2011, Tokyo City began accepting rubble and waste from the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami region. This rubble was processed, and when it had the appropriate radiation levels, it was used as a landfill to build new artificial islands in Tokyo Bay. Yamashita Park in Yokohama City was made with rubble from the great Kant\u014d earthquake in 1923.\nThere is a risk of contamination on artificial islands with landfills and reclaimed land if there was industry that spilled toxic chemicals into the ground. For example, the artificial island of Toyosu was once occupied by a Tokyo gas factory. Toxic substances were discovered in the soil and groundwater at Toyosu. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government spent an additional 3.8 billion yen ($33.5 million) to pump out groundwater by digging hundreds of wells. In June 2017, plans to move the Tsukiji fish market were restarted but delayed from July to the autumn of 2018. After the new site was declared safe following a cleanup operation, Toyosu Market was opened.\nOceanography and seabed of Japan.\nJapan's sea territory is . Japan ranks fourth with its exclusive economic zone ocean water volume from 0 to depth. Japan ranks fifth with a sea volume of 2,000\u20133,000 meters, fourth with 3,000\u20134,000 meters, third with 4,000\u20135,000 meters, and first with a volume of 5,000 to over 6,000 meters. The relief map of the Japanese archipelago shows that 50% of Japan's sea territory has an ocean volume between 0 and deep. The other 50% has a depth of to over . 19% has a depth of 0 to . Thus, Japan possesses one of the largest ocean territories with a combination of all depths, from shallow to very deep. Multiple long undersea mountain ranges stretch from Japan's main islands to the south. They occasionally reach above the sea surface as islands. East of the undersea mountain ranges are three oceanic trenches: the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka Trench (max depth ), Japan Trench (max depth ), and Izu\u2013Ogasawara Trench (max depth ).\nThere are large quantities of marine life and mineral resources in the ocean and seabed of Japan. At a depth of over , there are minerals such as manganese nodules, cobalt in the crust, and hydrothermal deposits. Within the island straits remarkable subaqueous dunes are present on the shelf.\nGeology.\nTectonic plates.\nThe Japanese archipelago is the result of subducting tectonic plates over several 100 million years, from the mid-Silurian (443.8 Mya) to the Pleistocene (11,700 years ago). Approximately of oceanic floor has passed under the Japanese archipelago in the last 450 million years, with most being fully subducted. It is considered a mature island arc.\nThe islands of Japan were created by tectonic plate movements:\nThe Pacific Plate and Philippine Sea Plate are subduction plates. They are deeper than the Eurasian plate. The Philippine Sea Plate moves beneath the continental Amurian Plate and the Okinawa Plate to the south. The Pacific Plate moves under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. These subduction plates pulled Japan eastward and opened the Sea of Japan by back-arc spreading around 15 million years ago. The Strait of Tartary and the Korea Strait opened much later. La P\u00e9rouse Strait formed about 60,000 to 11,000 years ago, closing the path used by mammoths, which had earlier moved to northern Hokkaido. The eastern margin of the Sea of Japan is an incipient subduction zone consisting of thrust faults that formed from the compression and reactivation of old faults involved in earlier rifting.\nThe subduction zone is where the oceanic crust slides beneath the continental crust or other oceanic plates. This is because the oceanic plate's lithosphere has a higher density. Subduction zones are sites that usually have a high rate of volcanism and earthquakes. Additionally, subduction zones develop belts of deformation. The subduction zones on the east side of the Japanese archipelago cause frequent low-intensity earth tremors. Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis occur several times per century. It is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Northeastern Japan, north of the Tanakura fault, had high volcanic activity 14\u201317\u00a0million years before the present.\nMedian Tectonic Line.\nThe Japan Median Tectonic Line (MTL) is Japan's longest fault system. The MTL begins near Ibaraki Prefecture, where it connects with the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) and the Fossa Magna. It runs parallel to Japan's volcanic arc, passing through central Honsh\u016b to near Nagoya, through Mikawa Bay, then through the Seto Inland Sea from the Kii Channel and Naruto Strait to Shikoku along the Sadamisaki Peninsula and the Bungo Channel and H\u014dyo Strait to Ky\u016bsh\u016b.\nThe MTL moves right-lateral strike-slip at about 5\u201310 millimeters per year. The sense of motion is consistent with the direction of the Nankai Trough's oblique convergence. The rate of motion on the MTL is much less than the rate of convergence at the plate boundary. This makes it difficult to distinguish the motion on the MTL from interseismic elastic straining in GPS data.\nOceanic trenches.\nEast of the Japanese archipelago are three oceanic trenches.\nComposition.\nThe Japanese islands are formed of the mentioned geological units parallel to the subduction front. The parts of islands facing the Pacific Plate are typically younger and display a larger proportion of volcanic products, while island parts facing the Sea of Japan are mostly heavily faulted and folded sedimentary deposits. In northwest Japan, there are thick quaternary deposits. This makes the determination of the geological history and composition difficult, and it is not yet fully understood.\nThe Japanese island arc system has distributed volcanic series where the volcanic rocks change from tholeiite\u2014calc-alkaline\u2014alkaline with increasing distance from the trench. The geologic province of Japan is mostly basin and has a bit of extended crust.\nGrowing archipelago.\nThe Japanese archipelago grows gradually because of perpetual tectonic plate movements, earthquakes, stratovolcanoes, and land reclamation in the Ring of Fire.\nFor example, during the 20th century, several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. The 1914 Sakurajima eruption produced lava flows that connected the former island with the \u014csumi Peninsula in Kyushu. It is the most active volcano in Japan.\nDuring the 2013 eruption southeast of Nishinoshima, a new, unnamed volcanic island emerged from the sea. Erosion and shifting sands caused the new island to merge with Nishinoshima. A 1911 survey determined the caldera was at its deepest.\nThe 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami caused portions of northeastern Japan to shift by closer to North America. This made some sections of Japan's landmass wider than before. The areas of Japan closest to the epicenter experienced the largest shifts. A stretch of coastline dropped vertically by , allowing the tsunami to travel farther and faster onto land. On 6 April, the Japanese coast guard said that the earthquake shifted the seabed near the epicenter and elevated the seabed off the coast of Miyagi Prefecture by . A report by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, published in \"Science\" on 2 December 2011, concluded that the seabed in the area between the epicenter and the Japan Trench moved east-southeast and rose about as a result of the quake. The report also stated that the quake caused several major landslides on the seabed in the affected area.\nSea of Japan.\nHistory.\nDuring the Pleistocene (spanning 2.58 million-11,700 years ago) glacial cycles, the Japanese islands may have occasionally been connected to the Eurasian Continent via the Korea Strait and the Korean Peninsula or Sakhalin. The Sea of Japan was considered to be a frozen inner lake because of the lack of the warm Tsushima Current. Various plants and large animals, such as the elephant \"Palaeoloxodon naumanni,\" migrated into the Japanese archipelago.\nThe Sea of Japan was a landlocked sea when the land bridge of East Asia existed circa 18,000 BCE. During the glacial maximum, the marine elevation was 200 meters lower than present. Thus, Tsushima island in the Korea Strait was a land bridge that connected Kyushu and the southern tip of Honshu with the Korean peninsula. There were still several kilometers of sea to the west of the Ryukyu islands, and most of the Sea of Japan was open sea with a mean depth of . Comparatively, most of the Yellow Sea (Yellow Plane) had a semi-arid climate (dry steppe) because it was relatively shallow, with a mean depth of . The Korean Peninsula was landlocked on the entire west and south sides of the Yellow Plane. The onset of the formation of the Japan Arc was in the Early Miocene (23 million years ago). The Early Miocene period was when the Sea of Japan started to open and the northern and southern parts of the Japanese archipelago separated from each other. The Sea of Japan expanded during the Miocene.\nThe northern part of the Japanese archipelago was further fragmented until the orogenesis of the northeastern Japanese archipelago began in the Late Miocene. The orogenesis of the high mountain ranges in northeastern Japan started in the Late Miocene and lasted into the Pliocene. The southern part of the Japanese archipelago remained a relatively large landmass. The land area expanded northward during the Miocene.\nDuring the advance of the last Ice Age, the world sea level dropped. This dried up and closed the exit straits of the Sea of Japan one by one. The deepest, and thus the last to close, was the western channel of the Korea Strait. There is controversy as to whether the Sea of Japan became a huge, cold inland lake. The Japanese archipelago had a taiga biome (open boreal woodlands). It was characterized by coniferous forests consisting mostly of pines, spruces, and larches. Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril islands had mammoth steppe biome (steppe-tundra). The vegetation was dominated by palatable high-productivity grasses, herbs, and willow shrubs.\nPresent.\nThe Sea of Japan has a surface area of , a mean depth of , and a maximum depth of . It has a carrot-like shape, with the major axis extending from southwest to northeast and a wide southern part narrowing toward the north. The coastal length is about , with the largest part () belonging to Russia. The sea extends from north to south for more than and has a maximum width of about .\nThere are three major basins: the Yamato Basin in the southeast, the Japan Basin in the north, and the Tsushima Basin in the southwest. The Japan Basin has an oceanic crust and is the deepest part of the sea, whereas the Tsushima Basin is the shallowest, with depths below . The Yamato Basin and Tsushima Basin have thick oceanic crusts. The continental shelves of the sea are wide on the eastern shores of Japan. On the western shores, they are narrow, particularly along the Korean and Russian coasts, averaging about .\nThe geographical location of the Japanese archipelago has defined the Sea of Japan for millions of years. Without the Japanese archipelago, it would just be the Pacific Ocean. The term has been the international standard since at least the early 19th century. In 2012, the International Hydrographic Organization, the international governing body for naming bodies of water around the world, recognized the term \"Sea of Japan\" as the only title for the sea.\nOcean currents.\nThe Japanese archipelago is surrounded by eight ocean currents.\nNatural resources.\nLand resources.\nThere are small deposits of coal, oil, iron, and minerals in the Japanese archipelago. Japan is scarce in critical natural resources and has long been heavily dependent on imported energy and raw materials. The oil crisis in 1973 encouraged the efficient use of energy. Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency. In regards to agricultural products, the self-sufficiency rate of most items is less than 100%, except for rice. Rice has 100% food self-sufficiency. This makes it difficult to meet Japan's food demand without imports.\nMarine resources.\nThe exclusive economic zone of Japan has an estimated large quantity of mineral resources such as methane clathrate, natural gas, metallic minerals, and rare-earth mineral reserves. Seabed mineral resources such as manganese nodules, cobalt-rich crust, and submarine hydrothermal deposits are located at depths over . Most of these deep-sea resources are unexplored at the seabed. Japan's mining law restricts offshore oil and gas production. There are technological hurdles to mine at such extreme depths and to limit the ecological impact. There are no successful commercial ventures that mine the deep sea yet. So currently, there are few deep sea mining projects to retrieve minerals or deepwater drilling on the ocean floor.\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 40 trillion cubic feet of methane clathrate in the eastern Nankai Trough of Japan. As of 2019, the methane clathrate in the deep sea remains unexploited because the necessary technology has not been established yet. This is why, currently, Japan has very limited proven reserves like crude oil.\nThe Kant\u014d region alone is estimated to have over 400 billion cubic meters of natural gas reserves. It forms a Minami Kant\u014d gas field in the area spanning Saitama, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Ibaraki, and Chiba prefectures. However, mining is strictly regulated in many areas because it is directly below Tokyo and is only slightly mined on the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula. In Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture, there have been frequent accidents with natural gas that was released naturally from the Minami Kant\u014d gas field.\nIn 2018, south of Minami-Tori-shima at deep, approximately 16 million tons of rare-earth minerals were discovered by JAMSTEC in collaboration with Waseda University and the University of Tokyo.\nMarine life.\nJapan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch (2014). In 2005, Japan ranked sixth in the world in the tonnage of fish caught. Japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000 and 9,864,422 tons in 1980. In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan's total fishery production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s, although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.\nEnergy.\nAs of 2011[ [update]], 46.1% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 21.3% from coal, 21.4% from natural gas, 4.0% from nuclear power, and 3.3% from hydropower. Nuclear power is a major domestic source of energy and produced 9.2 percent of Japan's electricity as of 2011[ [update]], down from 24.9 percent the previous year. Following the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami disaster, the nuclear reactors were shut down. Thus, Japan's industrial sector became even more dependent than before on imported fossil fuels. By May 2012, all of the country's nuclear power plants were taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some of Japan's 50 nuclear reactors to service. Shinzo Abe's government sook to restart the nuclear power plants that meet strict new safety standards and is emphasizing nuclear energy's importance as a base-load electricity source. In 2015, Japan successfully restarted one nuclear reactor at the Sendai Nuclear Power Plant in Kagoshima prefecture, and several other reactors around the country have since resumed operations. Opposition from local governments has delayed several restarts that remain pending.\nReforms of the electricity and gas sectors, including the full liberalization of Japan's energy market in April 2016 and the gas market in April 2017, constitute an important part of Prime Minister Abe's economic program.\nJapan has the third-largest geothermal reserves in the world. Geothermal energy is being heavily focused on as a source of power following the Fukushima disaster. The Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry is exploring over 40 locations for potential geothermal energy plants.\nOn 3 July 2018, Japan's government pledged to increase renewable energy sources from 15% to 22\u201324%, including wind and solar, by 2030. Nuclear energy will provide 20% of the country's energy needs as an emissions-free energy source. This will help Japan meet climate change commitments.\nNational Parks and Scenic Beauty.\nNational Parks.\nJapan has 34 and 56 in 2019. These are designated and managed for protection and sustainable usage by the Ministry of the Environment under the of 1957. The Quasi-National Parks have slightly less beauty, size, diversity, or preservation. They are recommended for ministerial designation and managed by the prefectures under the supervision of the Ministry of the Environment.\nThe Japanese archipelago has diverse landscapes. For example, the northern part of Hokkaido has a taiga biome. Hokkaido has 22% of Japan's forestland with coniferous trees (Sakhalin fir and Sakhalin spruce) and broad-leaved trees (Japanese oak, birch, and painted maple). The seasonal views change throughout the year. In the south, the Yaeyama Islands are in the subtropics, with numerous species of subtropical and tropical plants and mangrove forests. Most natural islands have mountain ranges in the center and coastal plains.\nPlaces of Scenic Beauty.\nThe Places of Scenic Beauty and Natural Monuments are selected by the government via the Agency for Cultural Affairs in order to protect Japan's cultural heritage. As of 2017, there are 1,027 and 410 . The highest classifications are 75 and 36 .\nThree Views of Japan.\nThe is the canonical list of Japan's three most celebrated scenic sights, attributed to 1643 scholar Hayashi Gah\u014d. These are traditionally the pine-clad islands of Matsushima in Miyagi Prefecture, the pine-clad sandbar of Amanohashidate in Kyoto Prefecture, and Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima Prefecture. In 1915, the New Three Views of Japan were selected in a national election by the Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u5b9f\u696d\u4e4b\u65e5\u672c\u793e). In 2003, the Three Major Night Views of Japan were selected by the \"New Three Major Night Views of Japan and the 100 Night Views of Japan Club\" (\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u4e09\u5927\u591c\u666f\u30fb\u591c\u666f100\u9078\u4e8b\u52d9\u5c40).\nClimate.\nMost regions of Japan, such as much of Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, belong to the temperate zone with a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfa\") characterized by four distinct seasons. However, its climate varies from a cool, humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfa\"/\"Dfb\") in the north, such as northern Hokkaido, to a warm tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Af\") in the south, such as the Yaeyama Islands and Minami-Tori-shima.\nClimate zones.\nJapan's varied geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones.\nRainfall.\nJapan is generally a rainy country with high humidity. Because of its wide range of latitude, seasonal winds, and different types of ocean currents, Japan has a variety of climates, with the latitude range of the inhabited islands ranging from 24\u00b0N to 46\u00b0N, which is comparable to the range between Nova Scotia and The Bahamas on the east coast of North America. Tokyo is between 35\u00b0N and 36\u00b0N, which is comparable to that of Tehran, Athens, or Las Vegas.\nAs Mount Fuji and the coastal Japanese Alps provide a rain shadow, Nagano and Yamanashi Prefectures receive the least precipitation in Honshu, though it still exceeds annually. A similar effect is found in Hokkaido, where Okhotsk Subprefecture receives as little as per year. All other prefectures have coasts on the Pacific Ocean, Sea of Japan, or Seto Inland Sea or have a body of salt water connected to them. Two prefectures\u2014Hokkaido and Okinawa\u2014are composed entirely of islands.\nSummer.\nThe climate from June to September is marked by hot, wet weather brought by tropical airflows from the Pacific Ocean and Southeast Asia. These air flows are full of moisture and deposit substantial amounts of rain when they reach land. There is a marked rainy season, beginning in early June and continuing for about a month. It is followed by hot, sticky weather. Five or six typhoons pass over or near Japan every year from early August to early October, resulting in significant damage. Annual precipitation averages between except for areas such as Kii Peninsula and Yakushima Island, which is Japan's wettest place, with the annual precipitation being one of the world's highest at 4,000 to 10,000\u00a0mm.\nMaximum precipitation, like the rest of East Asia, occurs in the summer months except on the Sea of Japan coast, where strong northerly winds produce a maximum in late autumn and early winter. Except for a few sheltered inland valleys during December and January, precipitation in Japan is above of rainfall equivalent in all months of the year, and in the wettest coastal areas it is above per month throughout the year.\nMid-June to mid-July is generally the rainy season in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, excluding Hokkaido since the seasonal rain front, or , dissipates in northern Honshu before reaching Hokkaido. In Okinawa, the rainy season starts early in May and continues until mid-June. Unlike the rainy season in mainland Japan, it rains neither everyday nor all day long during the rainy season in Okinawa. Between July and October, typhoons, grown from tropical depressions generated near the equator, can attack Japan with furious rainstorms.\nWinter.\nIn winter, the Siberian High develops over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low develops over the northern Pacific Ocean. The result is a flow of cold air southeastward across Japan that brings freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls to the central mountain ranges facing the Sea of Japan but clear skies to areas fronting the Pacific.\nThe warmest winter temperatures are found in the Nanp\u014d and Bonin Islands, which enjoy a tropical climate due to the combination of latitude, distance from the Asian continent, and warming effect of winds from the Kuroshio, as well as the Volcano Islands (at the latitude of the southernmost of the Ryukyu Islands, 24\u00b0 N). The coolest summer temperatures are found on the northeastern coast of Hokkaido in Kushiro and Nemuro Subprefectures.\nSunshine.\nSunshine, in accordance with Japan's uniformly heavy rainfall, is generally modest in quantity, though no part of Japan receives the consistently gloomy fogs that envelope the Sichuan Basin or Taipei. Amounts range from about six hours per day on the Inland Sea coast and sheltered parts of the Pacific Coast and Kant\u014d Plain to four hours per day on the Sea of Japan coast of Hokkaido. In December, there is a very pronounced sunshine gradient between the Sea of Japan and Pacific coasts, as the former side can receive less than 30 hours and the Pacific side as much as 180 hours. In summer, however, sunshine hours are lowest on exposed parts of the Pacific coast, where fogs from the Oyashio current create persistent cloud cover similar to that found on the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin.\nExtreme temperature records.\nThe highest recorded temperature in Japan was 41.8\u00a0\u00b0C (107.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on 5 August 2025. An unverified record of 42.7\u00a0\u00b0C was taken in Adachi, Tokyo, on 20 July 2004. The high humidity and the maritime influence make temperatures in the 40s rare, with summers dominated by a more stable subtropical monsoon pattern through most of Japan. The lowest was \u221241.0\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221241.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in Asahikawa on 25 January 1902. However, an unofficial \u221241.5\u00a0\u00b0C was taken in Bifuka on 27 January 1931. Mount Fuji broke the Japanese record lows for each month except January, February, March, and December. Record lows for any month were taken as recently as 1984.\nMinami-Tori-shima has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Aw\") and the highest average temperature in Japan of 25\u00a0\u00b0C.\nPopulation distribution.\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million in 2019. It is the eleventh-most populous country and the second-most populous island country in the world. The population is clustered in urban areas along the coast, plains, and valleys. In 2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities. Japan is an urban society, with about 5% of the labor force working in agriculture. About 80 million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific coast of Honshu.\n81% of the population lives on Honshu, 10% on Kyushu, 4.2% on Hokkaido, 3% on Shikoku, 1.1% in Okinawa Prefecture, and 0.7% on other Japanese islands such as the Nanp\u014d Islands. Nearly 1 in 3 Japanese people live in the Greater Tokyo Area, and over half live in the Kanto, Kinki, and Chukyo metropolitan areas.\nHonshu.\n is the largest island of Japan and the second most populous island in the world. It has a population of 104,000,000 with a population density of (2010). Honshu is roughly long and ranges from wide, and the total area is . It is the 7th largest island in the world. This makes it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain ().\nThe Greater Tokyo Area on Honshu is the largest metropolitan area (megacity) in the world, with people (2016). The area is and has a population density of 2,642 persons/km2.\nKyushu.\n is the third-largest island of Japan of the five main islands. As of 2016[ [update]], Kyushu has a population of 12,970,479 and covers . It has the second-highest population density of 307.13 persons/km2 (2016).\nShikoku.\n is the second-smallest of the five main islands (after Okinawa Island), with . It is located south of Honshu and northeast of Kyushu. It has the second-smallest population of 3,845,534 (2015) and the third-highest population density of 204.55 persons/km2.\nHokkaido.\n is the second-largest island of Japan and the largest and northernmost prefecture. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaido from Honshu. It has the third largest population of the five main islands, with 5,383,579 (2015), and the lowest population density, with just 64.5 persons/km2 (2016). The island area ranks 21st in the world by area. It is 3.6% smaller than the island of Ireland.\nOkinawa Prefecture.\n is the southernmost prefecture of Japan. It encompasses two-thirds of the Ryukyu Islands, over long. It has a population of 1,445,812 (2017) and a density of 662 persons/km2. is the smallest and most southwestern of the five main islands, at . It has the smallest population of 1,301,462 (2014) and the highest population density of 1083.6 persons/km2.\nNanp\u014d Islands.\n are the groups of islands that are located to the south and east of the main islands of the Japanese archipelago. They extend from the Izu Peninsula west of Tokyo Bay southward for about to within of the Mariana Islands. The Nanp\u014d Islands are all administered by Tokyo Metropolis.\nTaiheiy\u014d Belt.\nThe Taiheiy\u014d Belt is a megalopolis that includes the Greater Tokyo Area and Keihanshin megapoles. It is almost long, from Ibaraki Prefecture in the northeast to Fukuoka Prefecture in the southwest. Satellite images at night show a dense and continuous strip of light (demarcating urban zones) that delineates the region with overlapping metropolitan areas in Japan. It has a total population of approximately 81,859,345 (2016).\nUnderwater habitats.\nThere are plans to build underwater habitats in Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone. Currently no underwater city is constructed yet. For example, the Ocean Spiral by Shimizu Corporation would have a floating dome 500 meters in diameter with hotels, residential and commercial complexes. It could be 15\u00a0km long. This allows mining of the seabed, research and production of methane from carbon dioxide with micro-organisms. The Ocean Spiral was co-developed with JAMSTEC and Tokyo University.\nExtreme points.\nJapan extends from 20\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 north latitude (Okinotorishima to Benten-jima) and from 122\u00b0 to 153\u00b0 east longitude (Yonaguni to Minami Torishima). These are the points that are farther north, south, east, or west than any other location in Japan.\nJapan's main islands.\nThe five main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Honsh\u016b, Ky\u016bsh\u016b, Shikoku, and Okinawa. These are also called the mainland. All of these points are accessible to the public.\nLargest islands of Japan.\nThese are the 50 largest islands of Japan. It excludes the disputed Kuril Islands, known as the northern territories.\nNorthern Territories.\nJapan has a longstanding claim to the Southern Kuril Islands (Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai Islands). These islands were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. The Kuril Islands historically belonged to Japan. The Kuril Islands were first inhabited by the Ainu people and then controlled by the Japanese Matsumae clan in the Edo Period. The Soviet Union did not sign the San Francisco Treaty in 1951. The U.S. Senate Resolution of April 28, 1952, ratifying the San Francisco Treaty, explicitly stated that the USSR had no title to the Kurils. This dispute has prevented the signing of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia.\nGeographically, the Kuril Islands are a northeastern extension of Hokkaido. Kunashiri and the Habomai Islands are visible from the northeastern coast of Hokkaido. Japan considers the northern territories (aka Southern Chishima) part of the Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture.\nTime zone.\nThere is one time zone in the whole Japanese archipelago. It is 9 hours ahead of UTC. There is no daylight saving time. The easternmost Japanese island, Minami-Tori-shima, also uses Japan Standard Time, while it is geographically southeast of Tokyo and in the time zone.\nSakhalin uses , even though it is located directly north of Hokkaido. The Northern Territories and the Kuril Islands use , although they are geographically in .\nNatural hazards.\nEarthquakes and tsunami.\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index.\nAs many as 1,500 earthquakes are recorded yearly, and magnitudes of 4 to 6 are common. Minor tremors occur almost daily in one part of the country or another, causing slight shaking of buildings. Undersea earthquakes also expose the Japanese coastline to danger from .\nDestructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunamis, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake that hit Japan on March 11, 2011. It triggered a large tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.\nThe 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake was the largest ever recorded in Japan and is the world's fourth largest earthquake to strike since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Service. It struck offshore about northeast of Tokyo and east of the city of Sendai and created a massive tsunami that devastated Japan's northeastern coastal areas. At least 100 aftershocks registering a magnitude of 6.0 or higher have followed the main shock. At least 15,000 people died as a result.\nResearchers found the source of great thrust earthquakes and associated tsunamis in the Greater Tokyo Area at the Izu-Ogasawara Trench. There is a 'trench-trench triple junction' of the oceanic Philippine Sea Plate that underthrusts a continental plate and is being subducted by the Pacific Plate.\nReclaimed land and human-made islands are particularly susceptible to liquefaction during an earthquake. As a result, there are specific earthquake resistance standards and ground reform work that apply to all construction in these areas. In an area that was possibly reclaimed in the past, old maps and land condition drawings are checked, and drilling is carried out to determine the strength of the ground. However, this can be very costly, so for a private residential block of land, a Swedish weight sounding test is more common.\nJapan has become a world leader in research on the causes and prediction of earthquakes. The development of advanced technology has permitted the construction of skyscrapers even in earthquake-prone areas. Extensive civil defense efforts focus on training in protection against earthquakes, in particular against accompanying fire, which represents the greatest danger.\nVolcanic eruptions.\nJapan has 111 active volcanoes. That is 10% of all active volcanoes in the world. Japan has stratovolcanoes near the subduction zones of the tectonic plates. During the 20th century, several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. In 1991, Japan's Unzen Volcano on Kyushu, about east of Nagasaki, awakened from its 200-year slumber to produce a new lava dome at its summit. Beginning in June, repeated collapse of this erupting dome generated ash flows that swept down the mountain's slopes at speeds as high as . Unzen erupted in 1792 and killed more than 15,000 people. It is the worst volcanic disaster in the country's recorded history.\nMount Fuji is a dormant stratovolcano that last erupted on 16 December 1707 till about 1 January 1708. The H\u014dei eruption of Mount Fuji did not have a lava flow, but it did release some of volcanic ash. It spread over vast areas around the volcano and reached Edo almost away. Cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi provinces. In Edo, the volcanic ash was several centimeters thick. The eruption is rated a 5 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.\nThere are three VEI-7 volcanoes in Japan. These are the Aira Caldera, the Kikai Caldera, and the Aso Caldera. These giant calderas are remnants of past eruptions. Mount Aso is the largest active volcano in Japan. 300,000 to 90,000 years ago, there were four eruptions of Mount Aso that emitted huge amounts of volcanic ash that covered all of Kyushu and up to Yamaguchi Prefecture.\nSurveys by KOBEC (Kobe Ocean-Bottom Exploration Center) confirm that a giant lava dome of 23 cubic kilometers formed after the Kikai Caldera erupted in 4,300 BC. There is a 1% chance of a giant caldera eruption in the Japanese archipelago within the next 100 years. Approximately 40 cubic kilometers of magma would be released in one burst and cause enormous damage.\nAccording to a 2014 study by KOBEC of Kobe University, in a worst-case scenario, if there is a VEI-7 eruption of the Aso Caldera and if the volcanic ash is carried by westerly winds, then pyroclastic flows would cover the 7 million population near the Aso Caldera within two hours. The pyroclastic flows could reach much of Kyushu. Beyond the pyroclastic area is volcanic ash that falls from the sky. If the volcanic ash continuously flows northward, then the ash fall would make it impossible to live normally in large parts of the main islands of Japan due to the paralysis of traffic and lifelines for a limited period (a few days to 2 weeks) until the eruption subsides. In this scenario, the exception would be eastern and northern Hokkaido (the Ryukyu Islands and southern Nanpo Islands would also be excluded). Professor Yoshiyuki Tatsumi, head of KOBEC, told the \"Mainichi Shimbun\" that \"the probability of a gigantic caldera eruption hitting the Japanese archipelago is 1 percent in the next 100 years\" with a death toll of many tens of millions of people and wildlife. The potential exists for tens of millions of humans and other living beings to die during a VEI-7 volcanic eruption with significant short-term effects on the global climate. Most casualties would occur in Kyushu from the pyroclastic flows. The potential damage from the volcanic ash depends on the wind direction. If, in another scenario, the wind blows in a western or southern direction, then the volcanic ash could affect the East Asian continent or South-East Asia. If the ash flows eastward, then it will spread over the Pacific Ocean. Since the Kikai Caldera is submerged, it is unclear how much damage the hot ash clouds would cause if large quantities of volcanic ash stayed beneath the ocean surface. The underwater ash would be swept away by ocean currents.\nPaektu Mountain on the Chinese\u2013North Korean border had a VEI-7 eruption in 946. Paektu Mountain is mainly a threat to the surrounding area in North Korea and Manchuria. The west coast of Hokkaido is about away. However, a temple in Japan reported \"white ash falling like snow\" on 3 November 946 AD. So strong winds carried the volcanic ash eastward across the Sea of Japan. An average of of ashfall covered about of the Sea of Japan and northern Japan (Hokkaido and Aomori Prefecture). It took the ash clouds a day or so to reach Hokkaido. The total eruption duration was 4 and a half to 14 days (111\u2013333 hours).\nIn October 2021, large quantities of pumice pebbles from the submarine volcano Fukutoku-Okanoba damaged fisheries, tourism, the environment, 11 ports in Okinawa, and 19 ports in Kagoshima prefecture. Clean-up operations took 2\u20133 weeks.\nImproving technology and methods to predict volcano and giant caldera eruptions would help to prepare and evacuate people earlier. Technology is needed to accurately capture the state of the magma chamber, which spreads thinly with a thickness of less than several kilometers around the middle of the crust. The underground area of Kyushu must be monitored because it is a dangerous area with the potential for a caldera eruption. The most protective measure is to stop the hot ash clouds from spreading and devastating areas near the eruption so that people don't need to evacuate. There are currently no protective measures to minimize the spread of millions of tons of deadly hot ash during a VEI-7 eruption.\nIn 2018, NASA published a theoretical plan to prevent a volcanic eruption by pumping large quantities of cold water down a borehole into the hydrothermal system of a supervolcano. The water would cool the huge body of magma in the chambers below the volcano so that the liquid magma would become semi-solid. Thus, enough heat could be extracted to prevent an eruption. The heat could be used by a geothermal plant to generate geothermal energy and electricity.\nTyphoons.\nSince recording started in 1951, an average of 2.6 typhoons reached the main islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido per year. Approximately 10.3 typhoons approach within the 300-kilometer range near the coast of Japan. Okinawa is, due to its geographic location, most vulnerable to typhoons, with an average of 7 storms per year. The most destructive was the Isewan Typhoon, with 5,000 casualties in the Tokai region in September 1959. In October 2004, Typhoon Tokage caused heavy rain in Kyushu and central Japan, resulting in 98 casualties. Until the 1960s, the death toll was hundreds of people per typhoon. Since the 1960s, improvements in construction, flood prevention, high tide detection, and early warnings have substantially reduced the death toll, which rarely exceeds a dozen people per typhoon. Japan also has special search and rescue units to save people in distress.\nHeavy snowfall during the winter in the snow country regions causes landslides, flooding, and avalanches.\nEnvironmental issues.\nIn the 2006 environment annual report, the Ministry of Environment reported that the current major issues are: global warming and preservation of the ozone layer; conservation of the atmospheric environment, water, and soil; waste management and recycling; measures for chemical substances; conservation of the natural environment; and participation in international cooperation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of April 2025, Japan's population was roughly 123.4 million people, and peaked at 128.5 million people in 2010. It is the 6th-most populous country in Asia, and the 11th-most populous country in the world.\nIn 2024, the median age of Japanese people was projected to be 49.9 years, the highest level since 1950, compared to 29.8 for India, 38.9 for the United States and 40.2 for China. Japan has the second highest median age in the world, behind only Monaco. An improved quality of life and regular health checks are two reasons why Japan has one of the highest life expectancies in the world.\nThe life expectancy from birth in Japan improved significantly after World War II, rising 20 years between 1945 and 1955. As life expectancy rises further, Japan expects to experience difficulties caring for the older generations in the future. Shortages in the service sector are already a major concern, with demand for nurses and care workers increasing.\nThe fertility rate among Japanese women was around 1.4 children per woman from 2010 to 2018. From then until 2022, the fertility rate declined to 1.2. Apart from a small baby boom in the early 1970s, the crude birth rate in Japan has been declining since 1950. It reached its currently lowest point of 5.8\u00a0births per thousand people in 2023. With a falling birth rate and a large share of its inhabitants reaching old age, Japan's population is expected to continue declining, a trend that has been seen since 2010.\nJapanese is a major language of the Japonic language family spoken by Japanese people, which is separated into several dialects, with the Tokyo dialect considered Standard Japanese. Japanese has around 128 million speakers, primarily in Japan, the only country where it is the national language, and within the Japanese diaspora across the globe.\nThe sex ratio in Japan in 2021 was 95.38 males per 100 females. There are 61.53 million males and 64.52 million females in Japan. The female percentage of the population was 51.18%, compared to 48.82% male population. Japan has 2.98 million more females than males.\nHistorical overview.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2025, Japan was the world's twelfth-most populous country. Japan's population had declined by 0.8 percent from the time of the 2012 census, the first time it had declined since the 1945 census.\nSince 2010, Japan has experienced net population loss due to falling birth rates and minimal immigration, despite having one of the highest life expectancies in the world, at 85.00 years in 2016. It stood at 81.25 in 2006. Using the annual estimate for October of each year, the population peaked in 2008 at 128,083,960 and had fallen by 2,983,352 by October 2021.\nBased on 2012 data from the National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, Japan's population will keep declining by about one million people every year in the coming decades, which would leave it with a population of around 70 million by 2060 and 42 million by early 22nd century if the current projections do not change. More than 40% of the population is expected to be over the age of 65 in 2060. In 2021, the population had for fifteen consecutive years declined by 644,000 on this year, the largest drop on record since 1945 and also reflecting a record low of 831,000 births. In 2013, more than 20 percent of the population of Japan were aged 65 and over.\nIn July 2000, the population consisted of 47,062,743 households, with 78.7% in urban areas. Japan has a high population density of 329.5 people per square kilometer. There are 1,523 persons per square kilometer of habitable land. In July 1993, more than 50% of the population lived on 2% of the land. In 2009, the population to land density ratio had gradually increased, now at 127 million per 337 sq km. Compared to the findings of July 1993 and July 2000, the population density has greatly increased, from 50% of the population living on 2% of the land to 77%.\nAs the years have progressed since the last recordings of the population, Japan's population has decreased, raising concern about the future of Japan. There are many causes, such as the declining birthrates, as well as the ratio of men to women since the last measurements from the years of 2006 and 2010. According to the Japanese Health Ministry, the population is estimated to drop from its current state of 125.58 million to 86.74 million by the year 2060.\nJapan dropped from the 5th most populous country in the world to 6th in 1964, 7th in 1978, 8th in 1990, to 9th in 1998, to 10th in the early 21st century, 11th in 2020, and to 12th in 2023. Between 2010 to 2015, Japan's population shrank by almost a million, and Japan lost a half-million in 2022 alone. The number of Japanese citizens decreased by 801,000 to 122,423,038 in 2022 from a year earlier, which was the most severe decrease and the first time all 47 prefectures have suffered a decline since the launch of the poll in 1968. In early 2010, Japan's population reached 128,057,352. In the 2010s, the long-lasting effects of Japanese economic crisis during the Great Recession strongly slowed down immigration rates in Japan.\nIn March 2011, Japan was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, which caused the meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear plant. These disasters resulted in 20,000 deaths, a reduction of about 1.39 years in the average life expectancy, a decrease in birth rates, and the steepest decrease in immigration rates since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.\nFrom January 2020 to the end of September 2021 and as a direct effect of COVID-19 pandemic, Japan registered at least 112,000 excess deaths, a reduction of about 2.6 years in the average life expectancy, a noticeable decrease in birth rates and a marked decrease in immigration rates. The overall effect was a record population decline of 798,214 persons in that year, although the excess mortality rate for all causes has been estimated at between 100,000 and 130,000 deaths. It is the largest population decline recorded since World War I (1914\u20131918), Spanish flu pandemic (1918\u20131920), Great Kanto earthquake (1923), Showa Recession and Depression of 1930s, and Asia-Pacific War in World War II (1937\u20131945).\nAccording to a demographic study conducted by Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the Japanese population, including foreign residents, declined from 128 million people in 2010 to 124.3 million people in 2023, with a decrease of almost 511,000 people in one year.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nPopulation.\nCensus.\nJapan collects census information every five years, with censuses conducted by the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The latest population census reflects the situation as of 2020.\nPopulation density.\nIn 2025, Japan's population density was 338 people per square kilometer (875 people per square mile). It ranks 41st in a list of countries by population density. Between 1955 and 1989, land prices in the six largest cities increased by 15,000%, +12% per year compounded. Urban land prices generally increased 40% from 1980 to 1987. In the six largest cities, the price of land doubled over that period. For many families, this trend put housing in central cities out of reach.\nThe result was lengthy commutes for many workers in the big cities, especially in Tokyo area/Kanto Region, where daily commutes of two hours each way are common. In 1991, as the bubble economy started to collapse, land prices began a steep decline, and within a few years fell 60% below their peak. After a decade of declining land prices, residents began moving back into central city areas, especially Tokyo's 23\u00a0wards, as evidenced by 2005 census figures. Despite nearly 70% of Japan being covered by forests, parks in many major cities\u2014especially Tokyo and Osaka\u2014are smaller and scarcer than in major West European or North American cities. As of 2014, parkland per inhabitant in Tokyo is 5.78 square meters, which is roughly half of the 11.5 square meters of Madrid.\nNational and regional governments devote resources to making regional cities and rural areas more attractive by developing transportation networks, social services, industry, and educational institutions to try to decentralize settlement and improve the quality of life. Nevertheless, major cities, especially Tokyo, Yokohama and Fukuoka, and to a lesser extent Kyoto, Osaka and Nagoya, remain attractive to young people seeking education and jobs.\nUrban distribution.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nJapan has a high population concentration in urban areas on the plains since 75% of Japan's land area is made up of mountains, and also Japan has a forest cover rate of 68.5% (the only other developed countries with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden).\nThe 2010 census shows 90.7% of the total Japanese population live in cities.\nJapan is an urban society with about only 5% of the labor force working in agriculture. Many farmers supplement their income with part-time jobs in nearby towns and cities. About 80\u00a0million of the urban population is heavily concentrated on the Pacific shore of Honshu.\nMetropolitan Tokyo\u2013Yokohama, with its population of 35 million residents, is the world's most populous city. Japan faces the same problems that confront urban industrialized societies throughout the world: overcrowded cities and congested highways.\nAge structure.\nJapan's population is aging faster than that of any other nation. The population of those 65\u00a0years or older roughly doubled in 24 years, from 7.1% of the population in 1970 to 14.1% in 1994. The same increase took 61 years in Italy, 85 years in Sweden, and 115 years in France. In 2014, 26% of Japan's population was estimated to be 65\u00a0years or older, and the Health and Welfare Ministry has estimated that over-65s will account for 40% of the population by 2060. The demographic shift in Japan's age profile has triggered concerns about the nation's economic future and the viability of its welfare state.\nPopulation pyramids by prefecture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population estimates by sex and age group (01.VII.2020) (Because of rounding, totals are not in all cases the sum of the respective components.

In January 2023, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida pledged to take urgent steps to tackle the country's declining birth rate, calling it \"now or never\" for Japan's aging society; he had planned to double the budget for child-related policies by June 2023 and to set up a new government agency in April.\nLife expectancy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:row hover highlight/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nData source: National Institute of Population and Social Security Research\nHistorical data.\nSources: Our World In Data and the United Nations.\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\nMarriages and divorce.\nMany Japanese lead a sexless marriage. Japan has the lowest level of couples having sex at 45 times per year, well below the global average of 103 times. With reasons of \"tired\" and \"bored with intercourse\" usually given as an answer. Despite this, Japan ranks as number two globally on the amount spent on pornography, after South Korea.\nEthnic groups.\nNaturalized Japanese citizens and native-born Japanese nationals with a multi-ethnic background are all considered to be Japanese in the population census of Japan.\nDiscrimination against ethnic minorities.\nThree native Japanese minority groups can be identified. The largest are the \"hisabetsu buraku\" or \"discriminated communities\", also known as the \"burakumin\". These descendants of premodern outcast hereditary occupational groups, such as butchers, leatherworkers, funeral directors, and certain entertainers, may be considered a Japanese analog of India's Dalits. Historically, discrimination against these occupational groups was based on Buddhist prohibitions on killing and Shinto notions of pollution, and it was also a feature of governmental social control.\nDuring the Edo period, such people were required to live in special \"buraku\" and, like the rest of the population, they were bound by sumptuary laws which were based on the inheritance of social class. The Meiji government abolished most of the derogatory names which were applied to these discriminated communities in 1871, but the new laws had little effect on the social discrimination which was faced by the former outcasts and their descendants. However, the laws eliminated the economic monopoly which they had on certain occupations. The \"buraku\" continued to be treated as social outcasts and some casual interactions with the majority caste were perceived taboo until the era after World War II.\nEstimates of their number range from 2 to 4\u00a0million (about 4% of the national population in 2022). Although the members of these marginalized communities are physically indistinguishable from other Japanese, most of them live in urban ghettoes or they live in the traditional special hamlets which are located in rural areas, and as a result, membership in a marginalized group can be surmised from the location of a family's home, a family's occupation, the dialect which a family speaks, or the mannerisms which a family uses when it communicates with people. Checks on the backgrounds of families which were designed to ferret out \"buraku\" were commonly performed as a condition of marriage arrangements and employment applications, but in Osaka, they have been illegal since 1985.\nAmong the \"hisabetsu buraku\", past and current discrimination against them has resulted in lower educational attainments and it has also resulted in a lower socioeconomic status, by contrast, the majority of Japanese have higher educational attainments and they also have a higher economic status. Movements with objectives which range from \"liberation\" to the encouragement of integration have attempted to change this situation, with some success. Nadamoto Masahisa of the Buraku History Institute estimates that as of 1998, between 60 and 80% of burakumin married a non-burakumin.\nRyukyuans.\nOne of the largest minority groups among Japanese citizens is the Ryukyuan people. They are primarily distinguished by their use of several distinct Ryukyuan languages, though use of Ryukyuan is dying out. The Ryukyuan people and language originated in the Ryukyu Islands, which are in Okinawa prefecture and Kagoshima Prefecture.\nAinu.\nThe third largest minority group among Japanese citizens is the Ainu, whose language is an isolate. Historically, the Ainu were an indigenous hunting and gathering population who occupied most of northern Honsh\u016b as late as the Nara period (A.D.\u00a0710\u201394). As Japanese settlement expanded, the Ainu were pushed northward, by the Tokugawa shogunate, the Ainu were pushed into the island of Hokkaido.\nCharacterized as remnants of a primitive circumpolar culture, the fewer than 20,000\u00a0Ainu in 1990 were considered racially distinct and thus not fully Japanese. Disease and a low birth rate had severely diminished their numbers over the past two centuries, and intermarriage had brought about an almost completely mixed population.\nAlthough no longer in daily use, the Ainu language is preserved in epics, songs, and stories transmitted orally over succeeding generations. Distinctive rhythmic music and dances and some Ainu festivals and crafts are preserved, but mainly in order to take advantage of tourism.\nH\u0101fu.\nH\u0101fu (a kana rendition of \"half\") is a term used for people who are biracial and ethnically half Japanese. Of the one million children born in Japan in 2013, 2.2% had one or two non-Japanese parents.[70] According to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, in 2016 one in forty-nine babies born in Japan were born into families with one non-Japanese parent. Most intermarriages in Japan are between Japanese men and women from other Asian countries, including China, the Philippines and South Korea. Southeast Asia too, also has significant populations of people with half-Japanese ancestry, particularly in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.\nIn the 1940s, biracial Japanese children (Ainoko), specifically Amerasian children, encountered social problems such as poverty, perception of impurity and discrimination due to negative treatment in Japan. In the 21st century, discrimination against h\u0101fu occurs based on how different their identity, behavior and appearance is from a typical Japanese person.\nLanguages.\nThe Japanese society of Yamato people is linguistically homogeneous with small populations of Koreans (0.9\u00a0million), Chinese/Taiwanese (0.65\u00a0million), Filipino (306,000 some being Japanese Filipino; children of Japanese and Filipino parentage). This can be also said for Brazilians (300,000, many of whom are ethnically Japanese) as well as Peruvians and Argentineans of both Latin American and Japanese descent. Japan has indigenous minority groups such as the Ainu and Ryukyuans, who generally speak Japanese.\nCitizenship.\nJapanese citizenship is conferred \"jure sanguinis\", and monolingual Japanese-speaking minorities often reside in Japan for generations under permanent residency status without acquiring citizenship in their country of birth, although legally they are allowed to do so. This is because Japanese law does not recognize dual citizenship after the age of adulthood, and so people becoming naturalized Japanese citizens must relinquish their previous citizenship upon reaching the age of 22 years \nIn addition, people taking Japanese citizenship must take a name using one or more of the Japanese character sets (hiragana, katakana, kanji). Names written in the Western alphabet, Korean alphabet, Arabic characters, etc., are not acceptable as legal names. Chinese characters are usually legally acceptable as nearly all Chinese characters are recognized as valid by the Japanese government. Transliterations of non-Japanese names using katakana (e.g. \u3000\"\" for \"Smith\") are also legally acceptable.\nHowever, some naturalizing foreigners feel that becoming a Japanese citizen should mean that they have a Japanese name and that they should abandon their foreign name, and some foreign residents do not wish to do this\u2014although most Special Permanent Resident Koreans and Chinese already use Japanese names. Nonetheless, some 10,000 Zainichi Koreans naturalize every year. Approximately 98.6% of the population are Japanese citizens, and 99% of the population speak Japanese as their first language. Non-ethnic Japanese in the past, and to an extent in the present, also live in small numbers in the Japanese archipelago.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nShinto and Buddhism are Japan's two major religions. They have co-existed for more than a thousand years. Most Japanese people generally do not exclusively identify themselves as adherents of one religion, but rather incorporate various elements in a syncretic fashion. There are small Christian and other minorities as well, with the Christian population dating to as early as the 1500s, as a result of European missionary work before sakoku was implemented from 1635 to 1853.\nMigration.\nInternal migration.\nIn the 1980s, between 6 million and 7 million people moved their residences each year. About 50% of these moves were within the same prefecture. The others were relocations from one prefecture to another. During Japan's economic development in the twentieth century, and especially during the 1950s and 1960s, migration was characterized by urbanization as people from rural areas in increasing numbers moved to the larger metropolitan areas in search of better jobs and education. Out-migration from rural prefectures continued in the late 1980s, but more slowly than in previous decades.\nIn the 1980s, government policy provided support for new urban development away from the large cities, particularly Tokyo, and assisted regional cities to attract young people to live and work there. Regional cities offered familiarity to those from nearby areas, lower costs of living, shorter commutes, and, in general, a more relaxed lifestyle than could be had in larger cities. Young people continued to move to large cities to attend universities and find work, but some returned to regional cities, a pattern known as U-turn, or to their prefecture of origin (referred to as \"J-turn\"), or even moved to a rural area for the first time (\"I-turn\").\nIn the 1980s, significant numbers of people left the largest central cities, Tokyo and Osaka, to move to suburbs within their metropolitan areas. In 1988, more than 500,000 people left Tokyo, which experienced a net loss through migration of nearly 73,000 for the year. Osaka had a net loss of nearly 36,000 in the same year.\nWith a decreasing total population, internal migration results in only eight prefectures showing an increase in population. These are Okinawa \n(2.9%), Tokyo \n(2.7%), Aichi \n(1.0%), Saitama \n(1.0%), Kanagawa \n(0.9%), Fukuoka \n(0.6%), Shiga \n(0.2%), and Chiba \n(0.1%).\nEmigration.\nIn 1975, about 663,300 Japanese were living abroad, approximately 75,000 of whom had permanent foreign residency, more than six times the number who had that status. In 1990, more than 200,000 Japanese went abroad for extended periods of study, research, or business assignments. As the government and private corporations have stressed internationalization, greater numbers of individuals have been directly affected, decreasing Japan's historical insularity. By the late 1980s, these problems, particularly the bullying of returnee children in schools, had become a major public issue both in Japan and in Japanese communities abroad.\nCities with significant populations of Japanese nationals in 2015 included: \nNote: The above data shows the number of Japanese nationals living overseas. It was published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan and relates to 2015.\nImmigration.\nAccording to the Japanese immigration centre, the number of foreign residents in Japan has steadily increased, and the number of foreign residents exceeded 3,768,977 people in December 2024.\nIn 2020, the number of foreigners in Japan was 2,887,116. This includes 325,000 Filipinos, many of whom are married to Japanese nationals and possessing some degree of Japanese ancestry, 208,538 Brazilians, the majority possessing some degree of Japanese ancestry, 778,112 Chinese, 448,053 Vietnamese and 426,908 South Koreans. Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, Filipinos and Brazilians account for about 77% of foreign residents in Japan.\nThe current issue of the shrinking workforce in Japan alongside its aging population has resulted in a recent need to attract foreign labour to the country. Reforms which took effect in 2015 relax visa requirements for \"Highly Skilled Foreign Professionals\" and create a new type of residence status with an unlimited period of stay.\nThe number of naturalized individuals peaked in 2003 at 17,633, before declining to 8,863 by 2024. Most of the decline is accounted for by a steep reduction in the number of Japan-born Koreans taking Japanese citizenship. Historically the bulk of those taking Japanese citizenship have not been foreign-born immigrants but rather Japanese-born descendants of Koreans and Taiwanese who lost their citizenship in the Japanese Empire in 1947 as part of the American Occupation policy for Japan.\nJapanese statistical authorities do not collect information on ethnicity, only nationality. As a result, both native and naturalized Japanese citizens are counted in a single group. Although official statistics therefore show homogeneity, other analyses describe the population as \"multi-ethnic\".\nNet Migration.\nForeign residents.\nIn December 2024, there were 3,768,977 foreign residents in Japan, representing 3.04% of the Japanese population. Foreign Army personnel, of which there were up to 430,000 from the SCAP (post-occupation, United States Forces Japan) and 40,000 BCOF in the immediate post-war years, have not been at any time included in Japanese foreign resident statistics. Most foreign residents in Japan come from Brazil or from other Asian countries, particularly from China, Vietnam, South Korea, the Philippines, and Nepal.\nA number of long-term resident Koreans in Japan today retain familial links with the descendants of Koreans, that either immigrated voluntarily or were forcibly relocated during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Within this group, a number hold Special Permanent Resident status, granted under the terms of the Normalisation Treaty (22nd June 1965) between South Korea and Japan. In many cases special residents, despite being born in Japan and speaking Japanese, have chosen not to take advantage of the mostly automatic granting of citizenship to special resident applicants.\nBeginning in 1947 the Japanese government started to repatriate Korean nationals, who had nominally been granted Japanese citizenship during the years of military occupation. When the Treaty of San Francisco came into force many ethnic Koreans lost their Japanese citizenship from April 28, 1952, and with it the right to welfare grants, to hold a government job of any kind or to attend Japanese schools. In the following year the government contrived, with the help of the Red Cross, a scheme to \"repatriate\" Korean residents, who mainly were from the Southern Provinces, to their \"home\" of North Korea. Between 1959 and 1984 93,430 people used this route, of whom 6,737 were Japanese or Chinese dependents. Most of these departures \u2013 78,276 \u2013 occurred before 1962.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAll non-Japanese without special residential status (people whose residential roots go back to before WWII) are required by law to register with the government and carry alien registration cards. From the early 1980s, a civil disobedience movement encouraged refusal of the fingerprinting that accompanied registration every five years.\nOpponents of fingerprinting argued that it was discriminatory because the only Japanese who were fingerprinted were criminals. The courts upheld fingerprinting, but the law was changed so that fingerprinting was done once rather than with each renewal of the registration, which until a law reform in 1989 was usually required every six months for anybody from the age of 16. Those refusing fingerprinting were denied re-entry permits, thus depriving them of freedom of movement.\nOf these foreign residents below, the new wave which started in 2014, came to Japan as students or trainees. These foreigners are registered under student visa or trainee visa, which gives them the student residency status. Most of these new foreigners are under this visa. Almost all of these foreign students and trainees will return to their home country after three to four years (one valid period); few students extend their visa. Vietnamese make up the largest increase. Burmese, Cambodians, Filipinos and Chinese are also increasing.\nAsian migrant wives of Japanese men have also contributed to the foreign-born population in the country. Many young single Japanese male farmers choose foreign wives, mainly from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and South Korea, due to a lack of interest from Japanese women living a farming life. Migrant wives often travel as mail-order brides as a result of arranged marriages with Japanese men.\nTable: numbers of foreign nationals in Japan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nForeign residents as of 2015.\nThere was an increase of 110,358 foreign residents from 2014 to 2015. Vietnamese made the largest proportion of these new foreign residents, whilst Nepalese, Filipino, Chinese and Taiwanese are also significant in numbers. Together these countries makes up 91,126 or 82.6% of all new residents from 2014 to 2015. The majority of these immigrants will only remain in Japan for a maximum of five years, as many of them have entered Japan in order to complete trainee programmes. Once they complete their programmes, they will be required to return to their home countries.\nIn December 2014, there were 2,121,831 foreigners residing in Japan, 677,019 of whom were long-term residents in Japan, according to national demographics figures. The majority of long-term residents were from Asia, totalling 478,953. Chinese made up the largest portion of them with 215,155, followed by Filipinos with 115,857, and Koreans with 65,711. Thai, Vietnamese, and Taiwanese long-term residents totaled 47,956, and those from other Asian countries totaled 34,274. The Korean figures do not include zainichi Koreans with \"tokubetsu eijusha\" (\"special permanent resident\") visas, of whom there were 354,503, of a total of 358,409 of all nationalities with such visas. The number of permanent residents had declined over the previous five years due to high cost of living.\nForeign residents as of 2021.\nIn 2019, the number of foreign residents of Japan reached a high of 2.93 million before falling to 2.76 million at the end of 2021. The number of foreign workers was 1.46 million in 2018. 29.7% were in the manufacturing sector. 389,000 are from Vietnam and 316,000 are from China.\nOn April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted. The revision clarifies and better protects the rights of foreign workers. Japan formally accepts foreign blue-collar workers. This helps reduce labour shortage in certain sectors of the economy. The reform changes the status of foreign workers to regular employees and they can obtain permanent residence status.\nThe reform includes a new visa status called . In order to qualify, applicants must pass a language and skills test, level N4 or higher of the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test. In the old \"Technical Trainee programme\" a foreign employee was tied to their employer. This caused numerous cases of exploitation. The revision gives foreign workers more freedom to leave and change their employer.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15577", "revid": "48523215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15577", "title": "Politics of Japan", "text": "Political system of Japan\nIn Japan, politics are conducted in a framework of a dominant-party bicameral parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy. A hereditary monarch, currently Emperor Naruhito, serves as head of state while the Prime Minister of Japan, currently Sanae Takaichi since 2025, serves as the elected head of government.\nLegislative power is vested in the National Diet, which consists of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The House of Representatives has eighteen standing committees ranging in size from 20 to 50 members and The House of Councillors has sixteen ranging from 10 to 45 members.\nExecutive power is vested in the Cabinet, which is led by the Prime Minister who is nominated by National Diet and appointed by the Emperor. A Liberal Democratic minority government has held office since 2025.\nJudicial power is vested in the Supreme Court and lower courts, and sovereignty is vested in the people of Japan by the 1947 Constitution, which was written during the Occupation of Japan primarily by American officials and had replaced the previous Meiji Constitution. Japan is considered a constitutional monarchy with a system of civil law.\nThe Japanese politics in the post-war period has largely been dominated by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has been in power almost continuously since its foundation in 1955, a phenomenon known as the 1955 System. Of the 32 prime ministers since the end of the country's occupation in 1952, 25 as well as the longest serving ones have been members of the LDP. Consequently, Japan has been described as a \"de facto\" one-party state. The LDP lost its parliamentary majority in 2024, but continues to lead the country as part of a minority government.\nJapan is currently a \"full democracy\" in the Democracy Index with the highest V-Dem electoral and liberal democracy scores in Asia.\nConstitution.\nThe current constitution was approved by Japan in 1947, this document aimed to address the weaknesses of the previous Meiji Constitution and lay the foundation for a vibrant democracy in Japan. Its key features include:\nLegitimacy.\nThe creation and ratification of this current document has been widely viewed by many geopolitical analysts and historians as one that was forced upon Japan by the United States after the end of World War II.\nAlthough this \"imposition\" claim arose originally as a rallying cry among conservative politicians in favour of constitutional revision in the 1950s, and that it wasn't \"inherently Japanese\", it has also been supported by the research of several independent American and Japanese historians of the period.\nA competing claim, which also emerged from the political maelstrom of the 1950s revision debate, holds that the ratification decision was actually the result of apparent \"collaboration\" between American occupation authorities, successive Japanese governments of the time, and private sector \"actors\".\nGovernment.\nArticle 1 of the Constitution of Japan (\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u61b2\u6cd5, \"Nihon-koku kenp\u014d\") defines the Emperor (\u5929\u7687, \"Tenn\u014d\") to be \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\". He performs ceremonial duties and holds no real power. Political power is held mainly by the Prime Minister, Cabinet, and other elected members of the National Diet. The Imperial Throne is succeeded by a paternal male member of the Imperial House as designated by the Imperial Household Law.\nThe chief of the executive branch and head of government, the Prime Minister (\u5185\u95a3\u7dcf\u7406\u5927\u81e3, \"Naikaku S\u014dri-Daijin\"), is appointed by the Emperor as directed by the National Diet. The prime minister in Japan is the head of the cabinet, has the power to appoint and dismiss cabinet ministers, and can dissolve the lower house of the Diet. While formally limited in powers, the prime minister possesses informal powers such as party support, popularity, and influence over the bureaucracy. Individual leadership can significantly impact the policymaking process, especially following recent cabinet reforms that enhanced the prime minister's influence. The Cabinet (\u5185\u95a3, \"Naikaku\") members are nominated by the Prime Minister, and are also required to be civilian. The country has had a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) minority government, and it has been convention that the President of the LDP serves as the Prime Minister since 2012.\nLegislature.\nJapanese constitution states that the National Diet (\u56fd\u4f1a, \"Kokkai\"), its law-making institution, shall consist of two Houses, namely the House of Representatives (\u8846\u8b70\u9662, \"Sh\u016bgiin\") and the House of Councillors (\u53c2\u8b70\u9662, \"Sangiin\"). The Diet shall be the highest organ of state power, and shall be the sole law-making organ of the State. It states that both Houses shall consist of elected members, representative of all the people and that the number of the members of each House shall be fixed by law. Both houses pass legislation in identical form for it to become law. Similarly to other parliamentary systems, most legislation that is considered in the National Diet is proposed by the cabinet. The cabinet then relies on the expertise of the bureaucracy to draft actual bills.\nThe lower house, the House of Representatives, the most powerful of the two, holds power over the government, being able to force its resignation. The lower house also has ultimate control of the passage of the budget, the ratification of treaties, and the selection of the Prime Minister. Its power over its sister house is, if a bill is passed by the lower house (the House of Representatives) but is voted down by the upper house (the House of Councillors), the ability to override the decision of the House of Councillors. Members of the lower house, as a result of the Prime Minister's power to dissolve them, more frequently serve for less than four years in any given terms.\nThe upper house, the House of Councillors, is very weak and bills are sent to the House of Councillors only to be approved, not made. Members of the upper house are elected for six-year terms with half the members elected every three years.\nIt is possible for different parties to control the lower house and the upper house, a situation referred to as a \"twisted Diet\", something that has become more common since the JSP took control of the upper house in 1989.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nSeveral political parties exist in Japan. However, the politics of Japan have primarily been dominated by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) since 1955, with the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) playing an important role as the opposition in lengthy period of times. The DPJ was the ruling party from 2009 to 2012 with the LDP as the opposition. The LDP was the ruling party for decades since 1955, despite the existence of multiple parties. Most of the prime ministers (presidents of the LDP) were elected from inner factions of the LDP.\nPolicy making.\nDespite an increasingly unpredictable domestic and international environment, policy making conforms to well established postwar patterns. The close collaboration of the ruling party, the elite bureaucracy and important interest groups often make it difficult to tell who exactly is responsible for specific policy decisions.\nPolicy development in Japan.\nAfter a largely informal process within elite circles in which ideas were discussed and developed, steps might be taken to institute more formal policy development. This process often took place in deliberation councils (\"shingikai\"). There were about 200 \"shingikai\", each attached to a ministry; their members were both officials and prominent private individuals in business, education, and other fields. The \"shingikai\" played a large role in facilitating communication among those who ordinarily might not meet.\nGiven the tendency for real negotiations in Japan to be conducted privately (in the \"nemawashi\", or root binding, process of consensus building), the \"shingikai\" often represented a fairly advanced stage in policy formulation in which relatively minor differences could be thrashed out and the resulting decisions couched in language acceptable to all. These bodies were legally established but had no authority to oblige governments to adopt their recommendations. The most important deliberation council during the 1980s was the Provisional Commission for Administrative Reform, established in March 1981 by Prime Minister Suzuki Zenko. The commission had nine members, assisted in their deliberations by six advisers, twenty-one \"expert members,\" and around fifty \"councillors\" representing a wide range of groups. Its head, Keidanren president Doko Toshio, insisted that the government agree to take its recommendations seriously and commit itself to reforming the administrative structure and the tax system.\nIn 1982, the commission had arrived at several recommendations that by the end of the decade had been actualized. These implementations included tax reform, a policy to limit government growth, the establishment in 1984 of the Management and Coordination Agency to replace the Administrative Management Agency in the Office of the Prime Minister, and privatization of the state-owned railroad and telephone systems. In April 1990, another deliberation council, the Election Systems Research Council, submitted proposals that included the establishment of single-seat constituencies in place of the multiple-seat system.\nAnother significant policy-making institution in the early 1990s was the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research Council. It consisted of a number of committees, composed of LDP Diet members, with the committees corresponding to the different executive agencies. Committee members worked closely with their official counterparts, advancing the requests of their constituents, in one of the most effective means through which interest groups could state their case to the bureaucracy through the channel of the ruling party.\nPost-war political developments in Japan.\nPolitical parties had begun to revive almost immediately after the Allied occupation began because of surrender of Japan in World War II. Left-wing organizations, such as the Japan Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party, quickly reestablished themselves, as did various conservative parties. The old Rikken Seiy\u016bkai and Rikken Minseit\u014d came back as, the Liberal Party (Nihon Jiy\u016bt\u014d) and the Japan Progressive Party (Nihon Shimpot\u014d) respectively. The first postwar general election was held in 1946 (women were given the franchise for the first time in 1946), and the Liberal Party's vice president, Yoshida Shigeru (1878\u20131967), became prime minister.\nFor the 1947 general election, anti-Yoshida forces left the Liberal Party and joined forces with the Progressive Party to establish the new Democratic Party (Minshut\u014d). This divisiveness in conservative ranks gave a plurality to the Japan Socialist Party, which was allowed to form a cabinet, which lasted less than a year. Thereafter, the socialist party steadily declined in its electoral successes. After a short period of Democratic Party administration, Yoshida returned in late 1948 and continued to serve as prime minister until 1954.\nEven before Japan regained full sovereignty, the government had rehabilitated nearly 80,000 people who had been purged, many of whom returned to their former political and government positions. A debate over limitations on military spending and the sovereignty of the Emperor ensued, contributing to the great reduction in the Liberal Party's majority in the first post-occupation elections (October 1952). After several reorganizations of the armed forces, in 1954 the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) were established under a civilian director. Cold War realities and the hot war in nearby Korea also contributed significantly to the United States-influenced economic redevelopment, the suppression of communism, and the discouragement of organized labor in Japan during this period.\nContinual fragmentation of parties and a succession of minority governments led conservative forces to merge the Liberal Party (Jiy\u016bt\u014d) with the Japan Democratic Party (Nihon Minshut\u014d), an offshoot of the earlier Democratic Party, to form the Liberal Democratic Party (Jiy\u016b-Minshut\u014d; LDP) in November 1955, called 1955 System. This party continuously held power from 1955 through 1993, except for a short while when it was replaced by a new minority government. LDP leadership was drawn from the elite who had seen Japan through the defeat and occupation. It attracted former bureaucrats, local politicians, businessmen, journalists, other professionals, farmers, and university graduates.\nIn October 1955, socialist groups reunited under the Japan Socialist Party (JSP), which emerged as the second most powerful political force. It was followed closely in popularity by the Komeito, founded in 1964 as the political arm of the Soka Gakkai (Value Creation Society), until 1991, a lay organization affiliated with the Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b Buddhist sect. The Komeito emphasized the traditional Japanese beliefs and attracted urban laborers, former rural residents, and women. Like the Japan Socialist Party, it favored the gradual modification and dissolution of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact.\nPolitical developments since 1990.\nThe LDP domination lasted until the National Diet Lower House general election on 18 July 1993, in which LDP failed to win a majority. A coalition of new parties and existing opposition parties formed a governing majority and elected a new non-LDP prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa (leader of Japan New Party), in August 1993. His government's major legislative objective was political reform, consisting of a package of new political financing restrictions and major changes in the electoral system. The coalition succeeded in passing landmark political reform legislation in January 1994.\nIn April 1994, Prime Minister Hosokawa resigned. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata (leader of Japan Renewal Party) formed the successor coalition government, Japan's first minority government in almost 40 years. Prime Minister Hata resigned less than two months later. Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama (leader of JSP) formed the next government in June 1994 with the coalition of JSP, the LDP, and the small New Party Sakigake. The advent of a coalition containing the JSP and LDP shocked many observers because of their previously fierce rivalry.\nPrime Minister Murayama served from June 1994 to January 1996. He was succeeded by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto (president of the LDP), who served from January 1996 to July 1998. Prime Minister Hashimoto headed a loose coalition of three parties until the July 1998 Upper House election, when the two smaller parties cut ties with the LDP. Hashimoto resigned due to a poor electoral performance by the LDP in the Upper House elections. He was succeeded as party president of the LDP and prime minister by Keiz\u014d Obuchi, who took office on 30 July 1998. The LDP formed a governing coalition with the Liberal Party in January 1999, and Obuchi remained prime minister. The LDP-Liberal coalition expanded to include the New Komeito Party in October 1999.\nPolitical developments since 2000.\nPrime Minister Obuchi suffered a stroke in April 2000 and was replaced by Yoshir\u014d Mori. After the Liberal Party left the coalition in April 2000, Prime Minister Mori welcomed a Liberal Party splinter group, the New Conservative Party, into the ruling coalition. The three-party coalition made up of the LDP, New Komeito, and the New Conservative Party maintained its majority in the Diet following the June 2000 Lower House elections.\nAfter a turbulent year in office in which he saw his approval ratings plummet to the single digits, Prime Minister Mori agreed to hold early elections for the LDP presidency in order to improve his party's chances in crucial July 2001 Upper House elections. On 24 April 2001, riding a wave of grassroots desire for change, maverick politician Junichiro Koizumi defeated former prime minister Hashimoto and other party stalwarts on a platform of economic and political reform.\nKoizumi was elected as Japan's 56th Prime Minister on 26 April 2001. On 11 October 2003, Prime Minister Koizumi dissolved the lower house and he was re-elected as the president of the LDP. Likewise, that year, the LDP won the general election, even though it suffered setbacks from the new opposition party, the liberal and social-democratic Democratic Party (DPJ). A similar event occurred during the 2004 Upper House election as well.\nOn 8 August 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi called for a snap general election to the lower house, as threatened, after LDP stalwarts and opposition DPJ parliamentarians defeated his proposal for a large-scale reform and privatization of Japan Post, which besides being Japan's state-owned postal monopoly is arguably the world's largest financial institution, with nearly 331 trillion yen of assets. The election was scheduled for 11 September 2005, with the LDP achieving a landslide victory under Junichiro Koizumi's leadership.\nThe ruling LDP started losing hold in 2006. No prime minister except Koizumi had good public support. On 26 September 2006, the new LDP President Shinzo Abe was elected by a special session of the National Diet to succeed Junichiro Koizumi as the next prime minister. He was Japan's youngest post-World War II prime minister and the first born after the war. On 12 September 2007, Abe surprised Japan by announcing his resignation from office. He was replaced by Yasuo Fukuda, a veteran of LDP.\nIn the meantime, on 4 November 2007, the leader of the main opposition party, Ichir\u014d Ozawa announced his resignation from the post of party president, after controversy over an offer to the DPJ to join the ruling coalition in a grand coalition, but has since, with some embarrassment, rescinded his resignation.\nOn 11 January 2008, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda forced a bill allowing ships to continue a refueling mission in the Indian Ocean in support of US-led operations in Afghanistan. To do so, PM Fukuda used the LDP's overwhelming majority in the Lower House to ignore a previous \"no-vote\" of the opposition-controlled Upper House. This was the first time in 50 years that the Lower House voted to ignore the opinion of the Upper House. Fukuda resigned suddenly on 1 September 2008, just a few weeks after reshuffling his cabinet. On 1 September 2008, Fukuda's resignation was designed so that the LDP did not suffer a \"power vacuum\". It thus caused a leadership election within the LDP, and the winner, Tar\u014d As\u014d (Shigeru Yoshida's grandson) was chosen as the new LDP president on 24 September 2008, he was appointed as the 92nd Prime Minister after the House of Representatives voted in his favor in the extraordinary session of the National Diet.\nLater, on 21 July 2009, Prime Minister As\u014d dissolved the House of Representatives and general election was held on 30 August.\nThe election results for the House of Representatives were announced on 30 and 31 August 2009. The opposition party DPJ led by Yukio Hatoyama (Ichir\u014d Hatoyama's grandson), won a majority by gaining 308 seats (10 seats were won by its allies the Social Democratic Party and the People's New Party). On 16 September 2009, the leader of DPJ, Hatoyama was elected by the House of Representatives as the 93rd Prime Minister of Japan.\nPolitical developments since 2010.\nOn 2 June 2010, Hatoyama resigned due to lack of fulfillments of his policies, both domestically and internationally and soon after, on 8 June, Akihito, Emperor of Japan ceremonially swore in the newly elected DPJ's leader, Naoto Kan as the 94th prime minister. Kan suffered an early setback in the 2010 Japanese House of Councillors election. In a routine political change in Japan, DPJ's new leader and former finance minister of Kan Cabinet, Yoshihiko Noda was cleared and elected by the National Diet as 95th prime minister on 30 August 2011. He was officially appointed as prime minister in the attestation ceremony by Emperor Akihito at the Tokyo Imperial Palace on 2 September 2011.\nNoda dissolved the lower house on 16 November 2012 (as he failed to get support outside the Diet on various domestic issues i.e. consumption tax, nuclear energy) and general election was held on 16 December. The results were in favor of the LDP, which won an absolute majority in the leadership of former prime minister Shinzo Abe. He was appointed as the 96th Prime Minister of Japan on 26 December 2012. With the changing political situation, earlier in November 2014, Prime Minister Abe called for a fresh mandate for the Lower House. In an opinion poll the government failed to win public trust due to bad economic achievements in the two consecutive quarters and on the tax reforms.\nThe general election was held on 14 December 2014, and the results were in favor of the LDP and its ally New Komeito. Together they managed to secure a huge majority by winning 325 seats for the Lower House. The opposition, DPJ, could not manage to provide alternatives to the voters with its policies and programs. \"Abenomics\", the ambitious self-titled fiscal policy of the current prime minister, managed to attract more voters in this election, many Japanese voters supported the policies. Shinz\u014d Abe was sworn as the 97th prime minister on 24 December 2014 and would go ahead with his agenda of economic revitalization and structural reforms in Japan.\nPrime Minister Abe was elected again for a fourth term after the 2017 general election. It was a snap election called by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Abe's ruling coalition won a clear majority with more than two-thirds of 465 seats in the lower house of Parliament (House of Representatives). The opposition was in deep political crisis.\nIn July 2019, Japan had a national election. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Prime Minister Abe won a majority of seats in the upper house of Parliament (House of Councillors). However, Abe failed to achieve the two-thirds majority, and the ruling coalition could not amend the constitution.\nPolitical developments since 2020.\nContemporary issues such as economic challenges, demographic shifts, and environmental concerns play a significant role in shaping political discourse, highlighting the interplay between these social issues and political responses. Ultimately, the potential for overcoming anxiety over governance is a critical theme, suggesting that increased political participation and engagement could lead to more effective governance and a reduction in public anxiety, all of which contribute to the complex and dynamic nature of Japanese politics.\nOn 28 August 2020, following reports of ill-health, Abe resigned citing health concerns, triggering a leadership election to replace him as prime minister. Abe was the longest-serving prime minister in the political history of Japan.\nAfter winning the leadership of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, a close ally of his predecessor, was elected as the 99th prime minister of Japan on 16 September 2020. On 2 September 2021, Suga announced that he would not seek reelection as LDP President, effectively ending his term as prime minister. On 4 October 2021, Fumio Kishida took office as new prime minister. Kishida was elected leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) previous week. He was officially confirmed as the 100th prime minister following a parliamentary vote with appointment by Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo Imperial Palace. On 31 October 2021, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) held onto its single party majority in the general election.\nOn 8 July 2022, former prime minister Shinzo Abe was shot and killed at a campaign rally in Nara for the 2022 Japanese House of Councillors election. State funeral of Abe was held on 27 September at Nippon Budokan.\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) rated Japan a \"full democracy\" its report for 2023. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices, Japan was the 23rd most electoral democratic country in the world as of 2023.\nOn 1 October 2024, Japan\u2019s parliament confirmed Shigeru Ishiba, new leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), as the new prime minister to replace Fumio Kishida.\nIshiba announced his resignation as prime minister on 7 September 2025, following a decline in public approval ratings to 23% and weeks of infighting in the LDP. In October 2025, Sanae Takaichi was elected to succeed him as party president, becoming the first woman to serve in the role. Later that same month, Komeito announced that it would leave the ruling coalition. She became prime minister on 21 October, after signing a confidence and supply agreement with Ishin.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the IMF forecast for 2025, it will be the fourth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and the fifth-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) by the end of the year. It constituted 3.7% of the world's economy on a nominal basis in 2024. According to the same forecast, the country's nominal per capita GDP (PPP) will be $56,440 (2025). Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Japan's nominal GDP as measured in American dollars fluctuates sharply.\nA founding member of the G7 and an early member of the OECD, Japan was the first country in Asia to achieve developed country status. In 2024, Japan was the sixth-largest in the world as an importer and eight-largest as an exporter. The country also has the world's fourth-largest consumer market. Japan used to run a considerable trade surplus, but the decline of the manufacturing sector since the 1980s and increased fossil fuel imports after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 have changed this trend in recent years. Being the world's largest creditor nation, Japan has a considerable net international investment surplus. The country has the world's second-largest foreign-exchange reserves, worth $1.4 trillion. Japan has the third-largest financial assets in the world, valued at $12 trillion, or 8.6% of the global GDP total as of 2020. Japan has a highly efficient and strong social security system, which comprises roughly 23.5% of GDP. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is the world's fourth-largest stock exchange by market capitalisation as of 2025.\nJapan has a highly service-dominated economy, which contributes approximately 70% of GDP, with most of the remainder coming from the industrial sector. The country's automobile industry, which is the third largest in the world, dominates the industrial sector, with Toyota being the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of cars. Japan is often ranked among the world\u2019s most innovative countries, leading several measures of global patent filings. However, its manufacturing industry has lost its world dominance since the 1990s. In 2022, Japan spent around 3.7% of GDP on research and development. As of 2025, 38 of the \"Fortune Global 500\" companies are based in Japan.\nLong having been an agricultural country, it has been estimated that Japan\u2019s economy was among the top ten in the world by size before the industrial revolution started. Industrialisation in Japan began in the second half of the 19th century with the Meiji Restoration, initially focusing on the textile industry and later on heavy industries. The country rapidly built its colonial empire and the third most powerful navy in the world. After the defeat in the Second World War, Japan\u2019s economy recovered and developed further rapidly, primarily propelled by its lucrative manufacturing exporting industries. It became the second largest economy in the world in 1988 and remained so until 2010, and on a nominal per capita basis, the most high-income among the G7 countries in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1995, Japan\u2019s share of the world\u2019s nominal GDP was 17.8%, reaching approximately 71% of that of the United States.\nDriven by speculative investments and excessive lending, the Japanese asset price bubble of the early 1990s burst, triggering a prolonged period of economic stagnation marked by deflation and persistently low or negative growth, now known as the Lost Decades. From 1995 to 2023, the country\u2019s GDP fell from $5.5 trillion to $4.2 trillion in nominal terms. At the turn of the 21st century, the Bank of Japan set out to encourage growth through a policy of quantitative easing, with the central bank purchasing government bonds at an unprecedented scale to address the persisting deflationary pressure. In 2016, the Bank of Japan introduced a negative interest policy to stimulate economic growth and combat persistent deflationary pressure. A combination of domestic policies and global economic conditions helped the country achieve its 2% inflation target, leading to the conclusion of the policy in 2024.\nAs of 2021, Japan has significantly higher public debt than other developed nations, at approximately 260% of GDP. 45% of this debt is held by the Bank of Japan, and most of the remainder is also held domestically. The Japanese economy faces considerable challenges posed by an ageing and declining population, which peaked at 128.5 million people in 2010 and has fallen to 122.6 million people in 2024. In 2024, the country's working age population consisted of approximately 59.6% of the total population, which was the lowest rate among all the OECD countries. According to 2023 government projections, the country's population will fall to 87 million by 2070, with only 45 million of working age.\nHistory.\nThe economic history of Japan is one of the most studied. Major milestones in modern Japan's economic progress include:\nEdo period (1603\u20131868).\nThe beginning of the Edo period coincides with the last decades of the Nanban trade period, marked by intense interaction with European powers. Japan built its first Western-style warships, such as the \"San Juan Bautista\", and commissioned around 350 Red Seal Ships for intra-Asian commerce. Japanese adventurers, such as Yamada Nagamasa, were active throughout Asia.\nTo eradicate Christian influence, Japan entered a period of isolation called \"sakoku\" in the 1630s, which led to economic stability and mild progress. In the 1650s, Japanese export porcelain production increased significantly due to a civil war in China, mainly in Kyushu. This trade dwindled by the 1740s under renewed Chinese competition but resumed after Japan\u2019s mid-19th century opening.\nEconomic development during the Edo period included urbanisation, increased commodity shipping, and expanded domestic and foreign commerce. The construction trades, banking facilities, and merchant associations flourished. \"Daimy\u014d\"-led authorities (\"han\") oversaw rising agricultural production and rural handicrafts. By the mid-18th century, Edo had a population of over 1 million, while Osaka and Kyoto each had more than 400,000 inhabitants, becoming centres for trade and handicraft production. Rice, the economy\u2019s base, was taxed at about 40% of the harvest and sold at the fudasashi market in Edo. \"Daimy\u014d\" used forward contracts similar to modern futures trading to sell rice before harvest.\nDuring the \"sakoku\" period, Japan studied Western sciences and techniques (\"rangaku\") through Dutch traders in Dejima, including geography, medicine, natural sciences, astronomy, and mechanical sciences. Japan reopened its economy to the West after being pressured by the United States twice in 1853 and 1854.\nPre-war period (1868\u20131945).\nSince the mid-19th century, after the Meiji Restoration, the country was opened up to Western commerce and influence and went through a period of economic development that extended through to the First World War. Economic developments of the prewar period began with the \"Rich State and Strong Army Policy\" by the Meiji government. During the Meiji period (1868\u20131912), leaders inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to Europe and the United States, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (\"Oyatoi gaikokujin\"). The government also built an extensive railway network, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development.\nTo promote industrialisation, the government decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, the private sector was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest role of government was to help provide good economic conditions for business. In short, government was to be the guide and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, the government built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger conglomerates such as Mitsubishi. Government emerged as chief promoter of private enterprise, enacting a series of pro-business policies.\nPost-war period (1945\u20131989).\nJapan underwent significant economic transformation and rapid recovery and growth, emerging from the devastation of the Second World War to become a global economic powerhouse. The immediate post-war period saw Japan slowly recovering as a democratic nation under the Allied Occupation. The Korean War (1950\u20131953), which happened in its now divided former colony, boosted the economy, as Japan served as a major supply hub for U.S. forces. By the 1950s and 1960s, Japan\u2019s economy had entered a period of high growth, often referred to as the 'Japanese Economic Miracle'. Key factors in this growth included government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, advanced technology, and a focus on export-oriented manufacturing. Japan\u2019s economy diversified from textiles to steel, shipbuilding, and eventually electronics and automobiles, with companies such as Toyota, Sony, Hitachi and Honda becoming household names worldwide.\nIn 1968, Japan became the world\u2019s third-largest economy then the second largest in 1988, surpassing the Soviet Union, a position it held until it was surpassed by China in 2010. The government played a crucial role through policies that promoted industrial expansion and technological advancement. Japan\u2019s emphasis on quality control and continuous improvement () further boosted its international competitiveness. By the 1980s, Japan was leading in a wide range of industries, including automotive and consumer electronics, and was known for its formidable trade surplus and wealth. However, the late 1980s also saw the infamous Plaza Accord and the formation of an asset price bubble, with inflated real estate and stock market prices, setting the stage for the economic stagnation of the 'Lost Decades' that followed.\nHeisei period (1989\u20132019).\nGrowth slowed markedly in the late 1990s, also termed the Lost Decade, after the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble. As a consequence Japan ran massive budget deficits (added trillions in yen to the Japanese financial system) to finance large public works programs.\nBy 1998, Japan's public works projects still could not stimulate demand enough to end the economy's stagnation. In desperation, the Japanese government undertook \"structural reform\" policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Unfortunately, these policies led Japan into deflation on numerous occasions between 1999 and 2004. The Bank of Japan used quantitative easing to expand the country's money supply in order to raise expectations of inflation and spur economic growth. Initially, the policy failed to induce any growth, but it eventually began to affect inflationary expectations. By late 2005, the economy finally began what seems to be a sustained recovery. GDP growth for that year was 2.8%, with an annualised fourth quarter expansion of 5.5%, surpassing the growth rates of the US and European Union during the same period. Unlike previous recovery trends, domestic consumption has been the dominant factor of growth.\nDespite having interest rates down near zero for a long period of time, the quantitative easing strategy did not succeed in stopping price deflation. This led some economists, such as Paul Krugman, and some Japanese politicians, to advocate the generation of higher inflation expectations. In July 2006, the zero-rate policy was ended. In 2008, the Japanese Central Bank still had the lowest interest rates in the developed world, but deflation had still not been eliminated and the Nikkei 225 has fallen over approximately 50% (between June 2007 and December 2008). However, on 5 April 2013, the Bank of Japan announced that it would be purchasing 60\u201370 trillion yen in bonds and securities in an attempt to eliminate deflation by doubling the money supply in Japan over the course of two years. Markets around the world have responded positively to the government's current proactive policies, with the Nikkei 225 adding more than 42% since November 2012. \"The Economist\" has suggested that improvements to bankruptcy law, land transfer law, and tax laws will aid Japan's economy. In recent years, Japan has been the top export market for almost 15 trading nations worldwide.\nIn December 2018, a free trade agreement between Japan and the European Union was cleared to commence in February 2019. It creates the world's largest free trade zone valued at 1/3rd of global gross domestic product. This reduces tariffs on Japanese cars by 10%, duties by 30% on cheese and 10% on wines and opens service markets.\n2020\u201321 recession.\nIn early January 2020, Japanese economy began to suffer from the COVID-19 pandemic. In early April, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state of emergency. Less than a quarter of Japanese people expected living conditions to improve in the coming decades. In October 2020 during the pandemic, Japan and the United Kingdom formally signed the first free-trade agreement post-Brexit, which will boost trade by approximately \u00a315.2 billion. It enables tariff-free trade on 99% of exports to Japan. On 15 February 2021, the Nikkei average breached the 30k benchmark, the highest since November 1991. It was due to strong corporate earnings, GDP data and optimism over the COVID-19 vaccination program in the country.\nPost-recession (2021\u2013present).\nAt the end of March 2022, the Ministry of Finance announced that the national debt reached precisely 1.017 million billion yen. The total public debt of the country, which includes debts contracted by local governments, represents 1.210 million billion yen (9,200 billion dollars) which is nearly 250% of Japan's GDP. Economist Kohei Iwahara said such an exceptional debt to GDP level is only possible because Japanese hold most of the debt: \"\u201cJapanese households hold most of their savings in bank accounts (48%) and these sums are used by commercial banks to buy Japanese government bonds. Thus, 85.7% of these bonds are held by Japanese investors.\u201d\nThe Bank of Japan's main policy aim since the Lost Decades started had been to end deflation and eventually achieve 2% inflation. The increased international economic tension brought about by events such as the Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 finally helped the country achieve the much-anticipated inflation target of 2%, and the negative interest policy since 2016 was ended in March 2024. However, while other major economies focus on suppressing inflation by raising interest rates, Japan aims to firmly establish inflation by maintaining low rates. As a side effect, the Japanese yen has become extremely weak, hitting a 37.5-year low of 161 yen/USD in July 2024. Furthermore, the real effective exchange rate in May 2024, when the 2020 average is set at 100, is 68.65, the lowest level since the start of the Bank of Japan statistics in January 1970, due to a combination of low inflation in Japan and a relatively low trade share. This devaluation of the currency caused Japan to lose its status as the world\u2019s third largest economy to Germany in nominal terms, which was approximately half the size of the country's economy a decade earlier.\nFactors such as an apparent end to the 30-year struggle against deflation, improvements in corporate governance, and high corporate profits boosted the stock market. Consequently, both the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indices surpassed the record highs they reached more than 30 years ago in 2024. The market capitalisation of the Tokyo Stock Exchange\u2019s prime section exceeded a quadrillion yen for the first time in July 2024.\nMacro-economic trend.\nGDP composition.\nIndustries by GDP value-added 2012. Values are converted using the exchange rate on 13 April 2013.\nDevelopment of main indicators.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132023 (with IMF staff estimates in 2024\u20132029). Inflation under 5% is in green.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSectors of the economy.\nAgriculture.\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.1% (2017) of the total country's GDP. Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Due to this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000\u00a0km2 (14 million acres) cultivated.\nJapan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidised and protected, with government regulations that favour small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture as practiced in North America. There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.\nRice accounts for almost all of Japan's cereal production. Japan is the second-largest agricultural product importer in the world. Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%.\nAlthough Japan is usually self-sufficient in rice (except for its use in making rice crackers and processed foods) and wheat, the country must import about 50% of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops and relies on imports for half of its supply of meat. Japan imports large quantities of wheat and soybeans. Japan is the 5th largest market for the European Union's agricultural exports. Over 90% of mandarin oranges in Japan are grown in Japan. Apples are also grown due to restrictions on apple imports.\nFishery.\nJapan ranked fourth in the world in 1996 in tonnage of fish caught. Japan captured 4,074,580 metric tons of fish in 2005, down from 4,987,703 tons in 2000, 9,558,615 tons in 1990, 9,864,422 tons in 1980, 8,520,397 tons in 1970, 5,583,796 tons in 1960 and 2,881,855 tons in 1950. In 2003, the total aquaculture production was predicted at 1,301,437 tonnes. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period.\nCoastal fishing by small boats, set nets, or breeding techniques accounts for about one third of the industry's total production, while offshore fishing by medium-sized boats makes up for more than half the total production. Deep-sea fishing from larger vessels makes up the rest. Among the many species of seafood caught are sardines, skipjack tuna, crab, shrimp, salmon, pollock, squid, clams, mackerel, sea bream, sauries, tuna and Japanese amberjack. Freshwater fishing, including salmon, trout and eel hatcheries and fish farms, takes up about 30% of Japan's fishing industry. Among the nearly 300 fish species in the rivers of Japan are native varieties of catfish, chub, herring and goby, as well as such freshwater crustaceans as crabs and crayfish. Marine and freshwater aquaculture is conducted in all 47 prefectures in Japan.\nJapan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.\nIndustry.\nJapanese manufacturing and industry is very diversified, with a variety of advanced industries that are highly successful. Industry accounts for 30.1% (2017) of the nation's GDP. The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world.\nIndustry is concentrated in several regions, with the Kant\u014d region surrounding Tokyo, (the Keihin industrial region) as well as the Kansai region surrounding Osaka (the Hanshin industrial region) and the T\u014dkai region surrounding Nagoya (the Ch\u016bky\u014d\u2013T\u014dkai industrial region) the main industrial centers.&lt;ref name=\"Profile of Osaka/Kansai\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other industrial centers include the southwestern part of Honsh\u016b and northern Shikoku around the Seto Inland Sea (the Setouchi industrial region); and the northern part of Ky\u016bsh\u016b (Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b). In addition, a long narrow belt of industrial centers called the Taiheiy\u014d Belt is found between Tokyo and Fukuoka, established by particular industries, that have developed as mill towns.\nJapan enjoys high technological development in many fields, including consumer electronics, automobile manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing, optical fibers, optoelectronics, optical media, facsimile and copy machines, and fermentation processes in food and biochemistry. However, many Japanese companies are facing emerging rivals from the United States, South Korea, and Taiwan.\nAutomobile manufacturing.\nJapan is the third biggest producer of automobiles in the world. Toyota is currently the world's largest car maker, and the Japanese car makers Nissan, Honda, Suzuki, and Mazda also count for some of the largest car makers in the world. By number, Japan is the world's second-largest exporter of cars after China as of 2024.\nMining.\nJapan's mining production has been minimal, and Japan has very little mining deposits. However, massive deposits of rare earths have been found off the coast of Japan. In the 2011 fiscal year, the domestic yield of crude oil was 820 thousand kiloliters, which was 0.4% of Japan's total crude processing volume.\nIn 2019, Japan was the 2nd largest world producer of iodine, 4th largest worldwide producer of bismuth, the world's 9th largest producer of sulfur and the 10th largest producer of gypsum.\nServices.\nJapan's service sector accounts for 68.7% (2017) of its total economic output. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries such as MUFG, Mizuho, NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, Aeon, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR East, Seven &amp; i Holdings, KDDI and Japan Airlines counting as some of the largest companies in the world. two of the five most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers. The Koizumi government set Japan Post, one of the country's largest providers of savings and insurance services for privatisation by 2015. The six major \"keiretsus\" are the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa. Japan is home to 180 companies from the Forbes Global 2000 or 9% (as of 2013).\nTourism.\nIn 2012, Japan was the fifth most visited country in Asia and the Pacific, with over 8.3 million tourists. In 2013, due to the weaker yen and easier visa requirements for southwest Asian countries, Japan received a record 11.25 million visitors, which was higher than the government's projected goal of 10 million visitors. The government hopes to attract 40 million visitors a year by the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Some of the most popular visited places include the Shinjuku, Ginza, Shibuya and Asakusa areas in Tokyo, and the cities of Osaka, Kobe and Kyoto, as well as Himeji Castle. Hokkaido is also a popular winter destination for visitors with several ski resorts and luxury hotels being built there.\nJapan's economy is less dependent on international tourism than those of other G7 countries and OECD countries in general; from 1995 to 2014, it was by far the least visited country in the G7 despite being the second largest country in the group, and as of 2013 was one of the least visited countries in the OECD on a per capita basis. In 2013, international tourist receipts was 0.3% of Japan's GDP, while the corresponding figure was 1.3% for the United States and 2.3% for France.\nInfrastructure.\nIn 2018, Japan ranked 5th overall in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, and 2nd in the infrastructure category.\nIn 2005, one half of Japan's energy was produced from petroleum, a fifth from coal, and 14% from natural gas. Nuclear power in Japan made a quarter of electricity production but due to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster there has been a large desire to end Japan's nuclear power program. In September 2013, Japan closed its last 50 nuclear power plants nationwide, causing the nation to be nuclear free. The country has since then opted to restart a few of its nuclear reactors.\nJapan's spendings on roads has been considered large. The 1.2 million kilometers of paved road are one of the major means of transportation. Japan has left-hand traffic. A single network of speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities and are operated by toll-collecting enterprises. New and used cars are inexpensive, and the Japanese government has encouraged people to buy hybrid vehicles. Car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy-efficiency.\nRail transport is a major means of transport in Japan. Dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; for instance, 6 passenger JR enterprises, Kintetsu Railway, Seibu Railway, and Keio Corporation. Often, strategies of these enterprises contain real estate or department stores next to stations, and many major stations have major department stores near them. The Japanese cities of Fukuoka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo and Yokohama all have subway systems. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities. All trains are known for punctuality, and a delay of 90 seconds can be considered late for some train services.\nThere are 98 passenger and 175 total airports in Japan, and flying is a popular way to travel. The largest domestic airport, Tokyo International Airport, is Asia's second busiest airport. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya area). The largest ports in Japan include Nagoya Port, the Port of Yokohama, the Port of Tokyo and the Port of Kobe.\nAbout 84% of Japan's energy is imported from other countries. Japan is the world's largest liquefied natural gas importer, second largest coal importer, and third largest net oil importer. Given its heavy dependence on imported energy, Japan has aimed to diversify its sources. Since the oil shocks of the 1970s, Japan has reduced dependence on petroleum as a source of energy from 77.4% in 1973 to about 43.7% in 2010 and increased dependence on natural gas and nuclear power. In September 2019, Japan will invest 10 billion on liquefied natural gas projects worldwide, in a strategy to boost the global LNG market and reinforce the security of energy supply. Other important energy source includes coal, and hydroelectricity is Japan's biggest renewable energy source. Japan's solar market is also currently booming. Kerosene is also used extensively for home heating in portable heaters, especially farther north. Many taxi companies run their fleets on liquefied natural gas. A recent success towards greater fuel economy was the introduction of mass-produced hybrid vehicles. Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, who was working on Japan's economic revival, signed a treaty with Saudi Arabia and UAE about the rising prices of oil, ensuring Japan's stable deliveries from that region.\nFinance and banking.\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange is the third largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalisation, as well as the 2nd largest stock market in Asia, with 2,292 listed companies. The Nikkei 225 and the TOPIX are the two important stock market indexes of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Stock Exchange, another major stock exchange in Japan, merged on 1 January 2013, creating one of the world's largest stock exchanges. Other stock exchanges in Japan include the Nagoya Stock Exchange, Fukuoka Stock Exchange and Sapporo Securities Exchange.\nLabor force.\nThe unemployment rate in December 2013 was 3.7%, down 1.5 percentage points from the claimed unemployment rate of 5.2% in June 2009 due to the strong economic recovery.\nIn 2008 Japan's labor force consisted of some 66 million workers\u201440% of whom were women\u2014and was rapidly shrinking.\nOne major long-term concern for the Japanese labor force is its low birthrate. In 2005, the number of deaths in Japan exceeded the number of births, indicating that the decline in population had already started. While one countermeasure for a declining birthrate would be to increase immigration, Japan has struggled to attract potential migrants despite immigration laws being relatively lenient (especially for high-skilled workers) compared to other developed countries. This is also apparent when looking at Japan's work visa programme for \"specified skilled worker\", which had less than 3,000 applicants, despite an annual goal of attracting 40,000 overseas workers, suggesting Japan faces major challenges in attracting migrants compared to other developed countries regardless of its immigration policies. A Gallup poll found that few potential migrants wished to migrate to Japan compared to other G7 countries, consistent with the country's low migrant inflow.\nIn 1989, the predominantly public sector union confederation, SOHYO (General Council of Trade Unions of Japan), merged with RENGO (Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation) to form the Japanese Trade Union Confederation. Labor union membership is about 12 million.\nAs of 2019 Japan's unemployment rate was the lowest in the G7. Its employment rate for the working-age population (15\u201364) was the highest in the G7.\nLaw and government.\nJapan ranks 27th of 185 countries in the ease of doing business index 2013.\nJapan has one of the smallest tax rates in the developed world. After deductions, the majority of workers are free from personal income taxes. Consumption tax rate is 10%, while corporate tax rates are high, second highest corporate tax rate in the world, at 36.8%. However, the House of Representatives has passed a bill which increased the consumption tax to 10% in October 2015. The government has also decided to reduce corporate tax and to phase out automobile tax.\nIn 2016, the IMF encouraged Japan to adopt an income policy that pushes firms to raise employee wages in combination with reforms to tackle the labor market dual tiered employment system to drive higher wages, on top of monetary and fiscal stimulus. Shinzo Abe has encouraged firms to raise wages by at least three per cent annually (the inflation target plus average productivity growth).\nShareholder activism is rare despite the fact that the corporate law gives shareholders strong powers over managers. Under Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, corporate governance reform has been a key initiative to encourage economic growth. In 2012, only around 40% of leading Japanese companies had any independent directors; by 2016, the majority had begun to appoint independent directors.\nThe government's liabilities include the second largest public debt of any nation with debt of over one quadrillion yen, or 8,535,340,000,000 in USD. Former Prime Minister Naoto Kan has called the situation 'urgent'.\nJapan's central bank has the second largest foreign-exchange reserves after China, with over one trillion US Dollars in foreign reserves.\nCulture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOur expansion could be much bigger and quicker, but we are held back. Nowhere in the world do the [regulatory approvals] take so long. (The process is) old fashioned. \u2014 \"Tony Fernandes, AirAsia chief.\" \nOverview.\n (), 'consensus building', in Japanese culture is an informal process of quietly betting the foundation for some proposed change or project, by talking to the people concerned, gathering support and feedback, and so forth. It is considered an important element in any major change, before any formal steps are taken, and successful \"nemawashi\" enables changes to be carried out with the consent of all sides.\nJapanese companies are known for management methods such as \"The Toyota Way\". (\u6539\u5584, Japanese for 'improvement') is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers. By improving standardised activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see Lean manufacturing). was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world. The corporate application of the system has been criticised for neglecting or harming the quality of life of workers, particularly via the implementation of long working hours. However, according to the OECD, Japan's average for annual hours worked per employee is lower than the OECD average and middling among G7 countries.\nSome companies have powerful enterprise unions and . The system or as it is called in Japan, is the Japanese system of preferring to promote employees close to retirement. This is done to prioritise experience in executive positions and to allow older employees to achieve a higher salary level before retirement. The system has been criticised for leaving younger employees at a disadvantage against older employees who may be less capable.\nRelationships between government bureaucrats and companies are often close. is the institutionalised practice where Japanese senior bureaucrats retire to high-profile positions in the private and public sectors. The practice is increasingly viewed as corrupt and a limitation on efforts to reduce ties between the private sector and the state that prevent economic and political reforms. Lifetime employment (\"sh\u016bshin koy\u014d\") and seniority-based career advancement have been common in the Japanese work environment. These practices have become less common in recent years.\n refers to someone whose income is salary-based; particularly those working for corporations. Coined in Japan, the word's frequent use by Japanese corporations and its prevalence in Japanese manga and anime has led to its adoption into and common usage within the English language to refer to Japanese white-collar workers, and it can be found in many English-language books and articles pertaining to Japanese culture. Immediately following World War II, becoming a salaryman was viewed as a gateway to a stable, middle-class lifestyle. In modern use, the term carries associations of long working hours, low prestige in the corporate hierarchy, absence of significant sources of income other than salary, wage slavery, and . The term \"salaryman\" refers almost exclusively to males.\nAn office lady, often abbreviated OL (Japanese: ), is a female office worker in Japan who performs generally pink collar tasks such as serving tea and doing secretarial or clerical work. Like many unmarried Japanese, OLs often live with their parents well into early adulthood. Office ladies are usually full-time permanent staff, with little opportunity for promotion, and there is often a tacit expectation that they leave their jobs if they get married.\n is a Japanese expression for people between the age of 15 and 34 who lack full-time employment or are unemployed, excluding homemakers and students. They may also be described as \"underemployed\" or freelance workers. These people do not start a career after high school or university but instead usually live as parasite singles with their parents and earn some money with low skilled and low paid jobs. Low income makes it difficult for freeters to start a family, and lacking qualifications in the form of skilled labor experience makes it difficult for them to start a career at a later point in life.\n, which can be translated quite literally from Japanese as \"death from overwork\", is occupational sudden death. The major medical causes of kar\u014dshi deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress.\n, (sometimes also translated as 'corporate bouncers', 'meeting-men', or 'corporate blackmailers') are a form of specialised racketeer unique to Japan, and often associated with the yakuza, who extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly humiliate companies and their management, usually in their . is a Japanese term for 'moneylender' or 'loan shark'. It is a contraction of the Japanese words for 'salaryman' and 'cash'. Around 14 million people, or 10% of the Japanese population, have borrowed from a . In total, there are about 10,000 firms (down from 30,000 a decade ago); however, the top seven firms make up 70% of the market. The value of outstanding loans totals 100 billion. The biggest \"sarakin\" are publicly traded and often allied with big banks.\nThe first \"Western-style\" department store in Japan (called , ) was Mitsukoshi, founded in 1904, which has its root as a kimono store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an even longer history, dating back to 1611 and becoming a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time. These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold luxurious products which contributed to them having sophisticated atmospheres. From the 1920s, private railway operators started to build department stores directly linked to their lines' terminuses. Seibu and Hankyu are examples of this practice. From the 1980s onwards, Japanese department stores have faced fierce competition from supermarkets and convenience stores, and they have gradually declined in prominence. Still, \"dep\u0101to\" are seen as bastions of cultural conservatism in the country. Gift certificates for department stores are frequently given as presents in Japan. Department stores in Japan generally offer a wide range of services which can include foreign exchange, travel reservations, and ticket sales for local concerts and other events.\n\"Keiretsu\".\nA is a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings. It is a type of business group. The prototypical appeared in Japan during the \"economic miracle\" following World War II. Before Japan's surrender, Japanese industry was controlled by large family-controlled vertical monopolies called . The Allies dismantled the in the late 1940s, but the companies formed from the dismantling of the were reintegrated. The dispersed corporations were re-interlinked through share purchases to form horizontally integrated alliances across many industries. Where possible, companies would also supply one another, making the alliances vertically integrated as well. In this period, official government policy promoted the creation of robust trade corporations that could withstand pressures from intensified world trade competition.\nThe major were each centered on one bank, which lent money to the 's member companies and held equity positions in the companies. Each central bank had great control over the companies in the \"keiretsu\" and acted as a monitoring entity and as an emergency bail-out entity. One effect of this structure was to minimise the presence of hostile takeovers in Japan, because no entities could challenge the power of the banks.\nThere are two types of : vertical and horizontal. Vertical \"keiretsu\" illustrates the organisation and relationships within a company (for example all factors of production of a certain product are connected), while a horizontal \"keiretsu\" shows relationships between entities and industries, normally centered on a bank and trading company. Both are complexly woven together and sustain each other.\nThe Japanese recession in the 1990s had profound effects on the . Many of the largest banks were hit hard by bad loan portfolios and forced to merge or go out of business. This had the effect of blurring the lines between the \"keiretsu\": Sumitomo Bank and Mitsui Bank, for instance, became Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in 2001, while Sanwa Bank (the banker for the Hankyu-Toho Group) became part of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, now known as MUFG Bank. Additionally, many companies from outside the keiretsu system, such as Sony, began outperforming their counterparts within the system.\nGenerally, these causes gave rise to a strong notion in the business community that the old system was not an effective business model, and led to an overall loosening of alliances. While the still exist, they are not as centralised or integrated as they were before the 1990s. This, in turn, has led to a growing corporate acquisition industry in Japan, as companies are no longer able to be easily \"bailed out\" by their banks, as well as rising derivative litigation by more independent shareholders.\nOther economic indicators.\nNet international investment position: 266,223 / billion (1st)\nIndustrial production growth rate: 7.5% (2010 est.)\nInvestment (gross fixed): 20.3% of GDP (2010 est.)\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\nAgriculture products: rice, sugar beets, vegetables, fruit, pork, poultry, dairy products, eggs, fish\nExport commodities: machinery and equipment, motor vehicles, semiconductors, chemicals\nImport commodities: machinery and equipment, fuels, foodstuffs, chemicals, textiles, raw materials (2001)\nExchange rates:\n\"Japanese Yen per US$1\" \u2013 88.67 (2010), 93.57 (2009), 103.58 (2008), 117.99 (2007), 116.18 (2006), 109.69 (2005), 115.93 (2003), 125.39 (2002), 121.53 (2001), 105.16 (January 2000), 113.91 (1999), 130.91 (1998), 120.99 (1997), 108.78 (1996), 94.06 (1995)\nElectricity:\nElectricity production by source:\nElectricity standards:\nOil:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This took place in the midst of the rapid industrialization and social reorganization that the Meiji period symbolized in Japanese history. Given how the nation's railroad technology was in its infancy, Japan's growing postal system relied heavily on human-powered transport, including rickshaws, as well as horse-drawn methods of delivery. For example, while commemorating the 50th anniversary of Japan's postal service, the country's 1921 government released decorative postcards depicting intrepid horseback riders carrying the mail.\nIn communication terms, British technicians had already been employed in assisting with Japanese lighthouses, and the country's budding mail system looked to hybridize British ideas with local practicalities. Shipping along the nation's coastline in particular demonstrates a key instance of how the Japanese economy developed: the government closely working with private companies to industrially expand in a way that met social needs while also allowing for large profits. Mitsubishi's contract for mail transport by sea proved lucrative enough that it assisted with the firm becoming one of the famous \"zaibatsu\".\nSince 2007, the nation's post offices have been managed by the firm Japan Post Network, which, in turn, is a part of the larger Japan Post Holdings conglomerate. As of December 2017, the smaller company has been managed by CEO Koji Furukawa. The simple Japanese postal mark, predating mass literacy in the nation, is still used to this day.\nGeneral background and history.\nAn example of the dawn of modern Japanese communications is the shift in newspaper publication. News vendors of the Tokugawa period, taking place from 1603 to 1867, typically promoted publications by reading the contents aloud and handed out papers that were printed from hand-graven blocks. Widespread adoption of movable type took place as Japanese society modernized. In particular, \"Yomiuri Shimbun\", a national daily newspaper that became the country's largest by circulation, was founded in 1874 and designed to be read in detail using standard Japanese vernacular. Five such dailies got started early in the Meiji period, taking place from 1868 to 1912. \"Yomiuri\" specifically took direct influence from American publications controlled by William Randolph Hearst.\nThe first such mass newspaper to be founded was the \"Nagasaki Shipping List &amp; Advertiser\", established in 1861 in Nagasaki by the Englishman A.W. Hansard. Its first issue ran 22 June of that year. The newspaper, which notably discussed matters in the English language, laid the groundwork for Hansard's later publication \"Japan Herald\".\nThe broadcast industry has been dominated by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (Nippon Hoso Kyokai\u2014NHK) since its founding in 1925.\nIn the postwar period, NHK's budget and operations were under the purview of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the Broadcasting Law of 1950 provides for independent management and programming by NHK. Television broadcasting began in 1953, and color television was introduced in 1960. Cable television was introduced in 1969. In 1978 an experimental broadcast satellite with two color television channels was launched. Operational satellites for television use were launched between 1984 and 1990. Television viewing spread so rapidly that, by 1987, 99 percent of Japan's households had color television sets and the average family had its set on at least five hours a day. Starting in 1987, NHK began full-scale experimental broadcasting on two channels using satellite-to-audience signals, thus bringing service to remote and mountainous parts of the country that earlier had experienced poor reception. The new system also provided twenty-four hours a day, nonstop service.\nIn the late 1980s, NHK operated two public television and three radio networks nationally, producing about 1,700 programs per week. Its general and education programs were broadcast through more than 6,900 television stations and nearly 330 AM and more than 500 FM radio transmitting stations. Comprehensive service in twenty-one languages is available throughout the world.\nRapid improvements, innovations, and diversification in communications technology, including optical fiber cables, communications satellites, and fax machines, led to rapid growth of the communications industry in the 1980s. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, owned by the government until 1985, had dominated the communications industry until April 1985, when new common carriers, including Daini Denden, were permitted to enter the field. NTT Worldwide Telecommunications Corp (Kokusai Denshin Denwa Company, commonly known as KDD, now part of KDDI Inc.) lost its monopoly hold on international communications activities in 1989, when Nihon Kokusai Tsushin and other private overseas communications firms began operations.\nIn 1992 Japan also had more than 12,000 televisions stations, and the country had more than 350 radio stations, 300 AM radio stations and 58 FM. Broadcasting innovations in the 1980s included sound multiplex (two-language or stereo) broadcasting, satellite broadcasting, and in 1985 the University of the Air and teletext services were inaugurated.\nJapan has been the world leader in telecommunications in the 1980s, but this position that has been challenged by the United States' dot-com industry in the 1990s and the emerging tiger states in Asia. While the United States is leading in digital content, South Korea is leading in broadband access, India is leading in software, and Taiwan is leading in research and development.\nJapan went into the 21st century after achieving widespread saturation with telecommunication devices. For instance, by 2008 the government's Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry stated that about 75 million people used mobile phones to access the Internet, accounting for about 82% of individual internet users.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Japan's transport sector stands out for its energy efficiency: it uses less energy per person compared to other countries, thanks to a high share of rail transport and low overall travel distances. Transport in Japan is also very expensive in international comparison, reflecting high tolls and taxes, particularly on automobile transport.\nJapan's spending on roads has been large. The of paved road are the main means of transport. Traffic in Japan drives on the left. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities, which are operated by toll-collecting enterprises.\nDozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transport markets; for instance, seven JR Group companies, Kintetsu Railway, Seibu Railway, and Keio Corporation. Often, strategies of these enterprises contain real estate or department stores next to stations. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities. All trains are known for punctuality.\nThere are 176 airports, and the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport, was by passenger traffic the third-busiest in Asia and the fourth-busiest in the world in 2018, but not in the top ten in 2022. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya area). The largest ports include Nagoya Port.\nRailway.\nIn Japan, railways are a major means of passenger transport, especially for mass and high-speed transport between major cities and for commuter transport in metropolitan areas. Seven Japan Railways Group companies, state-owned until 1987, cover most parts of Japan. There also are railway services operated by private rail companies, regional governments, and companies funded by both regional governments and private companies.\nTotal railways of include several track gauges, the most common of which is narrow gauge, with of track of which is electrified.\nHiroshima, Saitama, Fukuoka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, Sapporo, Sendai, Tokyo, and Yokohama have subway systems.\nMost Japanese people traveled on foot until the later part of the 19th century. The first railway was built between Tokyo's Shimbashi Station and Yokohama's former Yokohama Station (now Sakuragich\u014d Station) in 1872. Many more railways developed soon afterward.\nJapan has one of the world\u2019s most developed transport systems, with railways acting as the core of passenger transport. Car ownership is high, but road development has not kept pace with demand. This can be explained partly by the dense urban areas and limitation of land, making large-scale road expansion difficult.\nShinkansen (bullet train).\nThe Shinkansen, or \"bullet trains\", as they are known colloquially, are the high-speed rail trains that run across Japan. The of 8 Shinkansen lines run on completely separate lines from their commuting train counterparts, with a few exceptions. Shinkansen takes up a large portion of the long-distance travel in Japan, with the whole system carrying over 10 billion passengers in its lifetime. 1,114,000 journeys are made daily, with the fastest train being the JR East E5 and E6 series trains, which operate at a maximum speed of . Shinkansen trains are known to be very safe, with no accident-related deaths or injuries from passengers in their 50-plus year history. Shinkansen trains are also known to be very punctual, following suit with all other Japanese transport; in 2003, the average delay per train on the Tokaido Shinkansen was a mere 6 seconds. Japan has been trying to sell its Shinkansen technology overseas, and has struck deals to help build systems in India, Thailand, and the United States.\nThe first Shinkansen line opened between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964, and trains can now make the journey in 2 hours and 25 minutes. Additional Shinkansen lines connect Tokyo to Aomori, Niigata, Kanazawa, and Hakodate and Osaka to Fukuoka and Kagoshima, with new lines under construction to Tsuruga and Sapporo. A separate line heads out to Nagasaki, albeit through a separate relay service.\nJapan has been developing maglev technology trains, and broke the world maglev speed record in April 2015 with a train traveling at the speed of . The Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen, a commercial maglev service, is currently under construction from Tokyo to Nagoya and Osaka, and when completed in 2045 will cover the distance in 67 minutes, half the time of the current Shinkansen.\nRoad.\nAccording to http:// , Japan in April 2012 had approximately of roads made up of \u00a0km of city, town and village roads, of prefectural roads, of general national highways and of national expressways. The http:// cites a total length of expressways at (fiscal 2008). A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. Hokkaido has a separate network, and Okinawa Island has a highway of this type. In the year 2005, the toll collecting companies, formerly Japan Highway Public Corporation, have been transformed into private companies in public ownership, and there are plans to sell parts of them. This policy aims to encourage competition and decrease tolls.\nRoad passenger and freight transport expanded considerably during the 1980s as private ownership of motor vehicles greatly increased along with the quality and extent of the nation's roads. Bus companies including the JR Bus companies operate long-distance bus services on the nation's expanding expressway network. In addition to relatively low fares and deluxe seating, the buses are well utilized because they continue service during the night when air and train services are limited.\nThe cargo sector grew rapidly in the 1980s, recording 274.2 billion tonne-kilometres in 1990. The freight handled by motor vehicles, mainly trucks, in 1990, was over 6 billion tonnes, accounting for 90 percent of domestic freight tonnage and about 50 percent of tonne-kilometers.\nRecent large infrastructure projects were the construction of the Great Seto Bridge and the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line (opened 1997).\nRoad safety.\nRoad fatalities have decreased in Japan, due in part to stricter enforcement of drunk driving laws:\nIn Tokyo, road safety is 13 killed per million.\nSome long-distance express buses in Japan are Amtrak buses, operated by Nangoku Kotsu.\nAir.\nIn 2013, Japan had the fourth largest passenger air market in the world with 105,913,000 passengers. In 2013 Japan had 98 airports. The main international gateways are Narita International Airport (Tokyo area), Kansai International Airport (Osaka/Kobe/Kyoto area), and Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport (Nagoya area). The main domestic hub is Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport), by passenger traffic the third-busiest in Asia and the fourth-busiest in the world in 2018, but not in the top ten in 2022; other major traffic hubs include Osaka International Airport, New Chitose Airport outside Sapporo, and Fukuoka Airport. 14 heliports are estimated to exist (1999).\nThe two main airlines are Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. Other passenger carriers include Skymark Airlines, Solaseed Air, Air Do, StarFlyer and Fuji Dream Airlines. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, formerly Northwest Airlines, are major international operators from Narita Airport.\nFrom the early 1970s under Japan\u2019s \u201c45/47 regime\u201d, the government allocated route rights among the three major carriers of that time. JAL for international and trunk domestic routes, ANA for trunk and local domestic services, and JAS for local/domestic routes.\nDomestic airfares in Japan were subject to government regulation until around 2000. Discount fare schemes were introduced in the mid-1990s, allowing reductions of up to about 50%.\nJAL and JAS merged in 2002/2004, reducing the number of major domestic carriers.\nMaritime.\nThere are approximately of waterways in Japan; seagoing craft ply all coastal inland seas.\nThere are 994 ports in Japan as of April 2014. There are overlapping classifications of these ports, some of which are multi-purpose, e.g. cargo, passenger, naval, and fishery. The five designated \"super\" container ports are Yokkaichi, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kobe, and Osaka. 23 are designated major/international, 125 designated as important, while there are also purely fisherman ports.\nThe twenty-three major seaports designated as special, important ports by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism: Chiba, Fushiki/Toyama, Himeji, Hiroshima, Kawasaki, Kitakyushu, Kobe, Kudamatsu, Muroran, Nagoya, Niigata, Osaka, Sakai/Senpoku, Sendai/Shiogama, Shimizu, Shimonoseki, Tokyo, Tomakomai, Wakayama, Yokkaichi, and Yokohama.\nJapan has 988 ships of \u00a0gross tonnage\u00a0(GT) or over on its national ship register, totaling \u00a0tonnes deadweight (DWT). However, only 17% of Japanese-owned capacity is registered in Japan. UNCTAD estimates that 224 million dwt of tonnage is controlled by Japanese owners, making Japan the second largest beneficial owner of tonnage after Greece.\nFerries connect Hokkaido to Honshu, and Okinawa Island to Kyushu and Honshu. They also connect other smaller islands and the main islands. The scheduled international passenger routes are to China, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. Coastal and cross-channel ferries on the main islands decreased in routes and frequencies following the development of bridges and expressways but some are still operating (as of 2007).\nPipelines.\nJapan has of pipelines for crude oil, for petroleum products, and for natural gas.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15582", "revid": "45925219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15582", "title": "Foreign relations of Japan", "text": " \nThe are handled by Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nJapan maintains diplomatic relations with every United Nations member nations except for North Korea, in addition to UN observer states Holy See, as well as Kosovo, Cook Islands, and Niue.\nIn 19th century, Japanese foreign relations had an earliest beginnings in 5th century and after their opening to the world in 1854 with the Convention of Kanagawa. Japan had rapidly modernized and built a strong military. In early 20th century, Japan was imperialistic seeking control of nearby areas\u2014with major wars against China and Russia. It gained control parts of China including Manchuria, Korea, Taiwan, Okinawa, and as well as Southeast Asia and Pacific islands. Empire of Japan has lost in World War II to then-American President Harry S. Truman and allies, and was stripped of all of its foreign conquests and possessions. (See History of Japanese foreign relations). American General Douglas MacArthur, acting for Allied powers, supervised occupied Japan between 1945 and 1951. Since the occupation ended diplomatic policy, Japan has been based on close partnership with the United States of America after Truman left from office and seeking trade agreements. In the Cold War (1947\u20131991), Japan was demilitarized, but it allied with America, Mexico, Canada, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and among other allied countries in the confrontation with the Soviet Union. It played a major support role in Korean War (1950\u20131953). In a rapid economic developments in between early 1960s and 1980s, Japan was one of the major greatest economic powers in the world.\nSince the death of Emperor Hirohito in January 1989, by early 1990s, Japan became more active assertive, moving from a passive, reactive posture to one of greater international engagement, especially participated in peacekeeping operations by the United Nations, and sent troops to Cambodia, Mozambique, Golan Heights, and East Timor.\nIn the beginning of 21st century, in early 2001, Japan had focused on maintaining its core relationship with America, especially response to the war on terror, and participating in regional diplomacy, which included supporting stabilization efforts in Afghanistan. Despite the war on terror after 9/11 terror attacks hit America in September 2001, Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force also dispatched their troops to Southern Iraq for the restoration of basic infrastructures. Also, Japanese maritime naval vessels have been assigned to resupply duties in Indian Ocean to the present date. \nForeign policy.\nBeyond its immediate neighbors, Japan has pursued a more active foreign policy in recent years, recognizing the responsibility which accompanies its economic strength. Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda stressed a changing direction in a policy speech to the National Diet: \"Japan aspires to become a hub of human resource development as well as for research and intellectual contribution to further promote cooperation in the field of peace-building.\" This follows the modest success of a Japanese-conceived peace plan which became the foundation for nationwide elections in Cambodia in 1998.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Japan maintains diplomatic relations with:\nBilateral relations.\nAfrica.\nJapan is increasingly active in Africa. In May 2008, the first Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize will be awarded at Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV), which signals a changing emphasis in bilateral relations.\nAmericas.\nJapan has continued to extend significant support to development and technical assistance projects in Latin America.\nAsia.\nSoutheast Asia.\nBy 1990 Japan's interaction with the vast majority of Asia-Pacific countries, especially its burgeoning economic exchanges, was multifaceted and increasingly important to the recipient countries. The developing countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regarded Japan as critical to their development. Japan's aid to the ASEAN countries totaled US$1.9 billion in Japanese fiscal year (FY) 1988 versus about US$333 million for the United States during U.S. FY 1988. As of the late 1980s, Japan was the number one foreign investor in the ASEAN countries, with cumulative investment as of March 1989 of about US$14.5 billion, more than twice that of the United States. Japan's share of total foreign investment in ASEAN countries in the same period ranged from 70 to 80 percent in Thailand to 20 percent in Indonesia.\nIn the late 1980s, the Japanese government was making a concerted effort to enhance its diplomatic stature, especially in Asia. Toshiki Kaifu's much publicized spring 1991 tour of five Southeast Asian nations\u2014Malaysia, Brunei, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines\u2014culminated in a 3 May major foreign policy address in Singapore, in which he called for a new partnership with the ASEAN and pledged that Japan would go beyond the purely economic sphere to seek an \"appropriate role in the political sphere as a nation of peace.\" As evidence of this new role, Japan took an active part in promoting negotiations to resolve the Cambodian conflict.\nIn 1997, the ASEAN member nations and the People's Republic of China, South Korea and Japan agreed to hold yearly talks to further strengthen regional cooperation, the ASEAN Plus Three meetings. In 2005 the ASEAN plus Three countries together with India, Australia and New Zealand held the inaugural East Asia Summit (EAS).\nSouth Asia.\nIn South Asia, Japan's role is mainly that of an aid donor. Japan's aid to seven South Asian countries totaled US$1.1 billion in 1988. Except for Pakistan, which received heavy inputs of aid from the United States, all other South Asian countries received most of their aid from Japan as of the early 1990s. Four South Asian nations\u2014India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka\u2014are in the top ten list of Tokyo's aid recipients worldwide as of the early 1990s. A point to note is that Indian Government has received no aid since the 2004 Tsunami that struck India but Indian registered NGOs look to Japan for much investment in their projects.\nPrime Minister Toshiki Kaifu signaled a broadening of Japan's interest in South Asia with his swing through the region in April 1990. In an address to the Indian parliament, Kaifu stressed the role of free markets and democracy in bringing about \"a new international order,\" and he emphasized the need for a settlement of the Kashmir territorial dispute between India and Pakistan and for economic liberalization to attract foreign investment and promote dynamic growth. To India, which was very short of hard currency, Kaifu pledged a new concessional loan of \u00a5100 billion (about US$650 million) for the coming year.\nJapan\u2019s engagement with the Middle East region reflects a sophisticated, multi-dimensional approach that has evolved since the 1973 oil crisis. Initially driven by energy security concerns, Japan\u2019s strategy now includes economic partnerships, cultural exchanges, and political collaboration. By strengthening ties with both energy-exporting nations like Saudi Arabia and non-energy-focused countries such as Egypt, Japan has built a network of interdependence that extends beyond oil to broader strategic and cultural dimensions.\nEurope.\nIn what became known as the Tensh\u014d embassy, the first ambassadors from Japan to European powers reached Lisbon, Portugal in August 1584. From Lisbon, the ambassadors left for the Vatican in Rome, which was the main goal of their journey. The embassy returned to Japan in 1590, after which time the four nobleman ambassadors were ordained by Alessandro Valignano as the first Japanese Jesuit fathers.\nA second embassy, headed by Hasekura Tsunenaga and sponsored by Date Masamune, was also a diplomatic mission to the Vatican. The embassy left 28 October 1613 from Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, in the northern T\u014dhoku region of Japan, where Date was \"daimy\u014d\". It traveled to Europe by way of New Spain, arriving in Acapulco on 25 January 1614, Mexico City in March, Havana in July, and finally Seville on 23 October 1614. After a short stop-over in France, the embassy reached Rome in November 1615, where it was received by Pope Paul V. After return travel by way of New Spain and the Philippines, the embassy reached the harbor of Nagasaki in August 1620. While the embassy was gone, Japan had undergone significant change, starting with the 1614 Osaka Rebellion, leading to a 1616 decree from the Tokugawa shogunate that all interaction with non-Chinese foreigners was confined to Hirado and Nagasaki. In fact, the only western country that was allowed to trade with Japan was the Dutch Republic. This was the beginning of \"sakoku\", where Japan was essentially closed to the western world until 1854.\nModern era.\nThe cultural and non-economic ties with Western Europe grew significantly during the 1980s, although the economic nexus remained by far the most important element of Japanese \u2013 West European relations throughout the decade. Events in West European relations, as well as political, economic, or even military matters, were topics of concern to most Japanese commentators because of the immediate implications for Japan. The major issues centered on the effect of the coming West European economic unification on Japan's trade, investment, and other opportunities in Western Europe. Some West European leaders were anxious to restrict Japanese access to the newly integrated European Union, but others appeared open to Japanese trade and investment. In partial response to the strengthening economic ties among nations in Western Europe and to the United States\u2013Canada\u2013Mexico North American Free Trade Agreement, Japan and other countries along the Asia-Pacific rim began moving in the late 1980s toward greater economic cooperation.\nOn 18 July 1991, after several months of difficult negotiations, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu signed a joint statement with the Dutch prime minister and head of the European Community Council, Ruud Lubbers, and with the European Commission president, Jacques Delors, pledging closer Japanese \u2013 European Community consultations on foreign relations, scientific and technological cooperation, assistance to developing countries, and efforts to reduce trade conflicts. Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials hoped that this agreement would help to broaden Japanese \u2013 European Community political links and raise them above the narrow confines of trade disputes.\nDisputed territories.\nJapan has several territorial disputes with its neighbors concerning the control of certain outlying islands.\nJapan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands (including Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai group) which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea's assertions concerning Liancourt Rocks (Japanese: \"Takeshima\", Korean: \"Dokdo\") are acknowledged, but not accepted by Japan. Japan has strained relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) over the Senkaku Islands; and with the People's Republic of China over the status of Okinotorishima.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Until 1670 he wrote his name as John Wray; from then on, he used 'Ray', after \"having ascertained that such had been the practice of his family before him\". He published important works in the fields of botany, zoology and natural theology. \nHis classification of plants in his \"Historia Plantarum\" was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division, by which species were classified by repeated sub-division into groups according to a pre-conceived series of characteristics they have or have not, and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. He was among the first to attempt a biological definition for the concept of \"species\", as \"a group of morphologically similar organisms arising from a common ancestor\". Another significant contribution to taxonomy was his division of plants into those with two seedling leaves (dicotyledons) or only one (monocotyledons), a division used in taxonomy today.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nJohn Ray was born in the village of Black Notley in Essex in the Kingdom of England on 29 November 1627. He is said to have been born in the smithy, his father having been the village blacksmith. After studying at Braintree school, he was sent at the age of sixteen to the University of Cambridge, studying at Trinity College. Initially at Catharine Hall, his tutor was Daniel Duckfield, and later transferred to Trinity, where his tutor was James Duport, and his \"intimate friend\" and fellow-pupil the celebrated Isaac Barrow. Ray was chosen minor fellow of Trinity in 1649, and later major fellow. He held many college offices, becoming successively lecturer in Greek (1651), mathematics (1653), and humanity (1655), \"praelector\" (1657), junior dean (1657), and college steward (1659 and 1660); and according to the habit of the time, he was accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at Great St Mary's, long before he took holy orders on 23 December 1660. Among these sermons were his discourses on \"The wisdom of God manifested in the works of the creation\", and \"Deluge and Dissolution of the World\". Ray was also highly regarded as a tutor and he communicated his own passion for natural history to several pupils. Ray's student, Isaac Barrow, helped Francis Willughby to learn mathematics and Ray collaborated with Willughby later. It was at Trinity that he came under the influence of John Wilkins, when the latter was appointed master of the college in 1659.\nLater life and family.\nAfter leaving Cambridge in 1663 he spent some time travelling both in Britain and the continent. In 1673, Ray married Margaret Oakley of Launton in Oxfordshire; in 1676 he went to Middleton Hall near Tamworth, and in 1677 to Falborne (or Faulkbourne) Hall in Essex. Finally, in 1679, he removed to his birthplace at Black Notley, where he afterwards remained. His life there was quiet and uneventful, although he had poor health, including chronic sores. Ray kept writing books and corresponded widely on scientific matters, collaborating with his doctor and contemporary Samuel Dale. He lived, in spite of his infirmities, to the age of seventy-seven, dying at Black Notley. He is buried in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul, where there is a memorial to him. He is widely regarded as one of the earliest of the English parson-naturalists.\nWork.\nAt Cambridge, Ray spent much of his time in the study of natural history, a subject which would occupy him for most of his life, from 1660 to the beginning of the eighteenth century. When Ray found himself unable to subscribe as required by the Act of Uniformity 1662 he, along with 13 other college fellows, resigned his fellowship on 24 August 1662 rather than swear to the declaration that the Solemn League and Covenant was not binding on those who had taken it. Tobias Smollett quoted the reasoning given in the biography of Ray by William Derham:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The reason of his refusal was not (says his biographer) as some have imagined, his having taken the solemn league and covenant; for that he never did, and often declared that he ever thought it an unlawful oath: but he said he could not say, for those that had taken the oath, that no obligation lay upon them, but feared there might.\"\nHis religious views were generally in accord with those imposed under the restoration of Charles II of England, and (though technically a nonconformist) he continued as a layman in the Established Church of England.\nFrom this time onwards he seems to have depended chiefly on the bounty of his pupil Francis Willughby, who made Ray his constant companion while he lived. They travelled extensively, carrying out field observations and collecting specimens of botany, ornithology, ichthyology, mammals, reptiles and insects. Initially they agreed that Ray would take responsibility for the plants, and Willughby for birds, beasts, fishes, and insects. Willughby arranged that after his death, Ray would have 6 shillings a year for educating Willughby's two sons.\nIn the spring of 1663 Ray started together with Willughby and two other pupils (Philip Skippon and Nathaniel Bacon) on a tour through Europe, from which he returned in March 1666, parting from Willughby at Montpellier, whence the latter continued his journey into Spain. He had previously in three different journeys (1658, 1661, 1662) travelled through the greater part of Great Britain, and selections from his private notes of these journeys were edited by George Scott in 1760, under the title of \"Mr Ray's Itineraries\". Ray himself published an account of his foreign travel in 1673, entitled \"Observations topographical, moral, and physiological, made on a Journey through part of the Low Countries, Germany, Italy, and France\". From this tour Ray and Willughby returned laden with collections, on which they meant to base complete systematic descriptions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\nIn 1667 Ray was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1669 he and Willughby published a paper on \"Experiments concerning the Motion of Sap in Trees\". In 1671 he presented the research of Francis Jessop on formic acid to the Royal Society.\nFollowing Willughby's death in 1672, Ray took on the responsibility of bringing both Willughby's work and his own to publication. Ray was left with an ornithology and ichthyology to edit as well as his own work dealing with mammals, reptiles and insects. Although he presented the \"Ornithologia\" (1676) as Willughby's, he made extensive contributions to the work. His task became more difficult after the death of Lady Cassandra, Willughby's mother, on July 25, 1675. Lady Cassandra had supported Ray's continued work, but the widow Willughby had no interest in her late husband's scientific interests or his scientific friends. Ray was no longer allowed to instruct the children, and Ray and his wife Margaret Oakley were forced to leave the Willughby household in Middleton. Critically, Ray lost access to the Willughby collections, notes and manuscripts at this time. The plants gathered on his British tours had already been described in his \"Catalogus plantarum Angliae\" (1670), which formed the basis for later English floras. He had likely already used the botanical collections to lay much of the groundwork of his \"Methodus plantarum nova\" (1682). His great \"Historia generalis plantarum\" appeared in 3 volumes in 1686, 1688 and 1704.\nIn the 1690s he published three volumes on religion\u2014the most popular being \"The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation\" (1691), an essay describing evidence that all in nature and space is God's creation as in the Bible is affirmed. In this volume, he moved on from the naming and cataloguing of species like his successor Carl Linnaeus. Instead, Ray considered species' lives and how nature worked as a whole, giving facts that are arguments for God's will expressed in his creation of all 'visible and invisible' (Colossians 1:16). Ray gave an early description of dendrochronology, explaining how to find the ash tree's age from its tree-rings.\nTaxonomy.\nRay's work on plant taxonomy spanned a wide range of thought, starting with an approach that was predominantly in the tradition of the herbalists and Aristotelian, but becoming increasingly theoretical and finally rejecting Aristotelianism. Despite his early adherence to Aristotelian tradition, his first botanical work, the \"Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium\" (1660), was almost entirely descriptive, being arranged alphabetically. His model was an account by Bauhin of the plants growing around Basel in 1622 and was the first English county flora, covering about 630 species. However at the end of the work he appended a brief taxonomy which he stated followed the usage of Bauhin and other herbalists.\nSystem of classification.\nRay's system, starting with his Cambridge catalogue, began with the division between the imperfect or lower plants (Cryptogams), and perfect (\"planta perfecta\") higher plants (Seed plants). The latter he divided by life forms, e.g. trees (\"arbores\"), shrubs (\"frutices\"), subshrubs (\"suffrutices\") and herbaceous plants (\"herbae\") and lastly grouping them by common characteristics. The trees he divided into 8 groups, e.g. \"Pomiferae\" (including apple and pear). The shrubs he placed in 2 groups, \"Spinosi\" (Berberis etc.) and \"Non Spinosi\" (Jasmine etc.). The subshrubs formed a single group and the herbs into 21 groups.\nDivision of Herbae;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs outlined in his \"Historia Plantarum\" (1685\u20131703):\nDefinition of species.\nRay was the first person to produce a biological definition of species, in his 1686 \"History of Plants\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... no \"surer criterion for determining species has occurred to me than\" the distinguishing features that perpetuate themselves in propagation from seed. Thus, no matter what variations occur in the individuals or the species, if they spring from the seed of one and the same plant, they are accidental variations and not such as to distinguish a species... Animals likewise that differ specifically preserve their distinct species permanently; one species never springs from the seed of another nor vice versa.\nPublications.\nRay published about 23 works, depending on how they are counted. The biological works were usually in Latin, the rest in English. His first publication, while at Cambridge, was the \"Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium\" (1660), followed by many works, botanical, zoological, theological and literary. Until 1670 he wrote his name as John Wray. From then on, he used 'Ray', after \"having ascertained that such had been the practice of his family before him\".\nList of selected publications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLibraries holding Ray's works.\nIncluding the various editions, there are 172 works of Ray, of which most are rare. The only libraries with substantial holdings are all in England.p153 The list in order of holdings is:\nThe British Library, Euston, London. Holds over 80 of the editions.\nThe Bodleian Library, University of Oxford.\nThe University of Cambridge Library.\nLibrary of Trinity College, Cambridge.\nThe Natural History Museum Library, South Kensington, London.\nThe John Rylands Library, University of Manchester, Deansgate, Manchester\nLegacy.\nRay's biographer, Charles Raven, commented that \"Ray sweeps away the litter of mythology and fable... and always insists upon accuracy of observation and description and the testing of every new discovery\".p10 Ray's works were directly influential on the development of taxonomy by Carl Linnaeus.\nThe Ray Society, named after John Ray, was founded in 1844. It is a scientific text publication society and registered charity, based at the Natural History Museum, London, which exists to publish books on natural history, with particular (but not exclusive) reference to the flora and fauna of the British Isles. As of 2017, the Society had published 179 volumes.\nThe John Ray Society (a separate organisation) is the Natural Sciences Society at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. It organises a programme of events of interest to science students in the college.\nIn 1986, to mark the 300th anniversary of the publication of Ray's \"Historia Plantarum\", there was a celebration of Ray's legacy in Braintree, Essex. A \"John Ray Gallery\" was opened in the Braintree Museum.\nThe John Ray Initiative (JRI) is an educational charity that seeks to reconcile scientific and Christian understandings of the environment. It was formed in 1997 in response to the global environmental crisis and the challenges of sustainable development and environmental stewardship. John Ray's writings proclaimed God as creator whose wisdom is \"manifest in the works of creation\", and as redeemer of all things. JRI aims to teach appreciation of nature, increase awareness of the state of the global environment, and to promote a Christian understanding of environmental issues.\nFurthermore, a nature walk has been established in Essex in memoriam of John Ray. \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Botanist/styles.css\"/&gt;The standard author abbreviation Ray is used to indicate this person as the author when citing a botanical name.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15600", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15600", "title": "James Joyce", "text": "Irish novelist and poet (1882\u20131941)\nJames Augustine Aloysius Joyce (born James Augusta Joyce; 2 February 1882 \u2013 13 January 1941) was an Irish novelist, poet, and literary critic. He contributed to the modernist movement and is regarded among the most influential and important writers of the 20th century. Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\" (1922) is a landmark in which the episodes of Homer's \"Odyssey\" are paralleled in a variety of literary styles, particularly stream of consciousness. Other well-known works are the short-story collection \"Dubliners\" (1914) and the novels \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" (1916) and \"Finnegans Wake\" (1939). His other writings include three books of poetry, a play, letters, and occasional journalism.\nBorn in Dublin into a middle-class family, Joyce attended the Jesuit Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare, then, briefly, the Christian Brothers\u2013run O'Connell School. Despite the chaotic family life imposed by his father's unpredictable finances, he excelled at the Jesuit Belvedere College and graduated from University College Dublin in 1902. In 1904, he met his future wife, Nora Barnacle, and they moved to mainland Europe. He briefly worked in Pola (now in Croatia) and then moved to Trieste in Austria-Hungary, working as an English instructor. Except for an eight-month stay in Rome working as a correspondence clerk and three visits to Dublin, Joyce lived there until 1915. In Trieste, he published his book of poems \"Chamber Music\" and his short-story collection \"Dubliners\", and began serially publishing \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the English magazine \"The Egoist\". During most of World War I, Joyce lived in Zurich, Switzerland, and worked on \"Ulysses\". After the war, he briefly returned to Trieste and in 1920 moved to Paris, which was his primary residence until 1940.\n\"Ulysses\" was first published in Paris in 1922, but its publication in the United Kingdom and the United States was prohibited because of its perceived obscenity. Copies were smuggled into both countries and pirated versions were printed until the mid-1930s, when publication became legal. \"Ulysses\" frequently ranks high in lists of the greatest books, and academic literature analysing Joyce's work is extensive and ongoing. Many writers, film-makers, and other artists have been influenced by his stylistic innovations, such as his meticulous attention to detail, use of interior monologue, wordplay, and the radical transformation of traditional plot and character development.\nThough most of his adult life was spent abroad, his fictional universe centres on Dublin and is largely populated by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. \"Ulysses\" is set in the city's streets and alleyways. Joyce said: \"For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if I can get to the heart of Dublin I can get to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal.\"\nIn 1923, Joyce started his next major work, \"Finnegans Wake\". It was published in 1939. Between these years, he travelled widely. He and Nora were married in a civil ceremony in London in 1931. He made several trips to Switzerland, frequently seeking treatment for his increasingly severe eye problems and psychological help for his daughter, Lucia. When Germany occupied France during World War II, Joyce moved back to Zurich in 1940. He died there in 1941 after surgery for a perforated ulcer at age 58.\nEarly life.\nJoyce was born on 2 February 1882 at 41 Brighton Square, Rathgar, Dublin, Ireland, to John Stanislaus and Mary Jane \"May\" (n\u00e9e Murray) Joyce. He was the eldest of ten surviving siblings. He was baptised a Catholic as James Augustine Joyce in the nearby St Joseph's Church in Terenure on 5 February 1882 by Father John O'Mulloy. His godparents were Philip and Ellen McCann. The Joyce family came from Fermoy in County Cork, where they owned a small salt and lime works. Joyce's paternal grandfather, James Augustine, married Ellen O'Connell, daughter of John O'Connell, a Cork alderman who owned a drapery business and other properties in Cork City. Her family claimed kinship with the political leader Daniel O'Connell, who had helped secure Catholic emancipation for the Irish in 1829.\nJohn Joyce was appointed rate collector by Dublin Corporation in 1887. The family moved to the fashionable small town of Bray, from Dublin. Joyce was attacked by a dog around this time, causing a lifelong fear of dogs. He later developed a fear of thunderstorms from a superstitious aunt who had called them a sign of God's wrath.\nIn 1891, nine-year-old Joyce wrote \"Et Tu, Healy\", a poem on the death of Charles Stewart Parnell that his father printed on broadsides and distributed to friends. The poem expressed the sentiments of the elder Joyce, who was angry at Parnell's apparent betrayal by the Irish Catholic Church, the Irish Parliamentary Party, and the British Liberal Party that resulted in a collaborative failure to secure Irish Home Rule in the British Parliament. This sense of betrayal, particularly by the Church, left a lasting impression that Joyce expressed in his life and art.\nThat year, his family began to slide into poverty, worsened by his father's drinking and financial mismanagement. John Joyce's name was published in \"Stubbs' Gazette\", a blacklist of debtors and bankrupts, in November 1891, and he was temporarily suspended from work. In January 1893, he was dismissed with a reduced pension.\nJoyce began his education in 1888 at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, but had to leave in 1891 when his father could no longer pay the fees. He studied at home and briefly attended the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin. Joyce's father then had a chance meeting with the Jesuit priest John Conmee, who knew the family. Conmee arranged for Joyce and his brother Stanislaus to attend the Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, without fees starting in 1893. In 1895, Joyce, now 13, was elected by his peers to join the Sodality of Our Lady. Joyce spent five years at Belvedere, his intellectual formation guided by the principles of Jesuit education laid down in the \"Ratio Studiorum\" (\"Plan of Studies\"). He won first place for English composition in his final two years before graduating in 1898.\nUniversity years.\nJoyce enrolled at University College in 1898 to study English, French and Italian. While there, he was exposed to the scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas, which had a strong influence on his thought for the rest of his life. He participated in many of Dublin's theatrical and literary circles. His closest colleagues included leading Irish figures of his generation, such as George Clancy, Tom Kettle and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. Many of the acquaintances he made at this time appeared in his work. His first publication\u2014a laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen's \"When We Dead Awaken\"\u2014was printed in \"The Fortnightly Review\" in 1900. Inspired by Ibsen's works, Joyce sent him a fan letter in Norwegian and wrote a play, \"A Brilliant Career\", which he later destroyed.\nIn 1901 the National Census of Ireland listed Joyce as a 19-year-old Irish- and English-speaking unmarried student living with his parents, six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road) in Clontarf, Dublin. During this year he became friends with Oliver St. John Gogarty, the model for Buck Mulligan in \"Ulysses\". In November, Joyce wrote an article, \"The Day of the Rabblement\", criticising the Irish Literary Theatre for its unwillingness to produce the works of playwrights like Ibsen, Leo Tolstoy, and Gerhart Hauptmann. He protested against nostalgic Irish populism and argued for an outward-looking, cosmopolitan literature. Because he mentioned Gabriele D'Annunzio's novel (\"The Flame\"), which was on the Catholic list of prohibited books, his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce and Sheehy-Skeffington\u2014who had also had an article rejected\u2014had their essays jointly printed and distributed. Arthur Griffith decried the censorship of Joyce's work in his newspaper \"United Irishman\".\nJoyce graduated from the Royal University of Ireland in October 1902. He considered studying medicine and began attending lectures at the Catholic University Medical School in Dublin. When the medical school refused to provide a tutoring position to help finance his education, he left Dublin to study medicine in Paris, where he received permission to attend the course for a certificate in physics, chemistry, and biology at the \u00c9cole de M\u00e9decine. By the end of January 1903 he had given up plans to study medicine, but he stayed in Paris, often reading late in the . He frequently wrote home claiming ill health due to the water, the cold weather, and his change of diet, appealing for money his family could ill afford.\nPost-university years in Dublin.\nIn April 1903, Joyce learned his mother was dying and immediately returned to Ireland. He tended to her, reading aloud from drafts that were eventually worked into his unfinished novel \"Stephen Hero\". During her final days, she unsuccessfully tried to get him to make his confession and to take communion. She died on 13 August. Afterwards, Joyce and Stanislaus refused to kneel with other members of the family praying at her bedside. John Joyce's drinking and abusiveness increased in the months following her death, and the family began to fall apart. Joyce spent much of his time carousing with Gogarty and his medical school colleagues, and tried to scrape together a living by reviewing books.\nJoyce's life began to change when he met Nora Barnacle on 10 June 1904. She was a 20-year-old woman from Galway city who was working in Dublin as a chambermaid. They had their first outing together on 16 June 1904, walking through the Dublin suburb of Ringsend, where Nora masturbated him. This event was commemorated as the date for the action of \"Ulysses\", known in popular culture as \"Bloomsday\" in honour of the novel's main character Leopold Bloom. This began a relationship that continued for 37 years, until Joyce died. Soon after this outing, Joyce, who had been out with his colleagues, approached a young woman in St Stephen's Green and was beaten up by her companion. He was picked up and dusted off by an acquaintance of his father's, Alfred H. Hunter, who took him into his home to tend to his injuries. Hunter, who was rumoured to be a Jew and to have an unfaithful wife, became one of the models for Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of \"Ulysses\".\nJoyce was a talented tenor and explored becoming a musical performer. On 8 May 1904, he was a contestant in the \"Feis Ceoil\", an Irish music competition for promising composers, instrumentalists and singers. In the months before the contest, Joyce took singing lessons with two voice instructors, Benedetto Palmieri and Vincent O'Brien. He paid the entry fee by pawning some of his books. For the contest, Joyce had to sing three songs. He did well with the first two, but when he was told he had to sight read the third, he refused. Joyce won the third-place medal anyway. After the contest, Palmieri wrote to Joyce that Luigi Denza, the composer of the popular song \"\" who was the judge for the contest, spoke highly of his voice and would have given him first place but for the sight-reading and lack of sufficient training. Palmieri offered to give Joyce free singing lessons. Joyce refused the lessons, but kept singing in Dublin concerts that year. His performance at a concert given on 27 August may have solidified Nora's devotion to him. Although Joyce did not pursue a singing career, he included thousands of musical allusions in his literary works.\nThroughout 1904, Joyce sought to develop his literary reputation. On 7 January he attempted to publish a prose work examining aesthetics called \"A Portrait of the Artist\", but it was rejected by the intellectual journal \"Dana\". He then reworked it into a fictional novel of his youth, \"Stephen Hero\", that he laboured over for years but eventually abandoned. He wrote a satirical poem, \"The Holy Office\", that parodied W. B. Yeats's poem \"To Ireland in the Coming Times\" and once more mocked the Irish Literary Revival. It too was rejected for publication, this time for being \"unholy\". He wrote the collection of poems \"Chamber Music\" at this time; which was also rejected. He did publish three poems, one in \"Dana\" and two in \"The Speaker\", and George William Russell published three of Joyce's short stories in the Irish Homestead. These stories\u2014\"The Sisters\", \"Eveline\", and \"After the Race\"\u2014were the beginnings of \"Dubliners\".\nIn September 1904, Joyce was having difficulties finding a place to live and moved into a Martello tower near Dublin, which Gogarty was renting. Within a week, Joyce left when Gogarty and another housemate, Dermot Chenevix Trench, fired a pistol in the middle of the night at some pans hanging directly over Joyce's bed. With the help of funds from Lady Gregory and a few other acquaintances, Joyce and Nora left Ireland less than a month later.\n1904\u20131906: Zurich, Pola and Trieste.\nZurich and Pola.\nIn October 1904, Joyce and Nora went into self-imposed exile. They briefly stopped in London and Paris to secure funds before heading on to Zurich.\nJoyce had been informed through an agent in England that there was a vacancy at the Berlitz Language School, but when he arrived there was no position. The couple stayed in Zurich for a little over a week. The director of the school sent Joyce on to Trieste, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the First World War. There was no vacancy there either. The director of the school in Trieste, Almidano Artifoni, secured a position for him in Pola, then Austria-Hungary's major naval base, where he mainly taught English to naval officers. Less than one month after the couple had left Ireland, Nora had become pregnant. Joyce soon became close friends with Alessandro Francini Bruni, the director of the school at Pola, and his wife Clothilde. By the beginning of 1905, the two families were living together. Joyce kept writing when he could. He completed a short story for \"Dubliners\", \"Clay\", and worked on his novel \"Stephen Hero\". He disliked Pola, calling it a \"back-of-God-speed place\u2014a naval Siberia\", and as soon as a job became available, he went to Trieste.\nFirst stay in Trieste.\nJoyce moved to Trieste in March 1905 aged 23. He taught English at the Berlitz school. That June he published the satirical poem \"The Holy Office\".\nAfter Nora gave birth to their first child, Giorgio, on 27 July 1905, he convinced Stanislaus to move to Trieste and obtained a position for him at the Berlitz school. Stanislaus moved in with Joyce as soon as he arrived that October, although most of his salary went directly to supporting Joyce's family. In February 1906, the Joyce household once more shared an apartment with the Francini Brunis.\nDuring this period Joyce completed 24 chapters of \"Stephen Hero\" and all but the final story of \"Dubliners\", but was unable to get \"Dubliners\" published. Although the London publisher Grant Richards had a contract with Joyce, the printers were unwilling to print passages they found controversial; English law could not protect them if brought to court for circulating indecent language. Richards and Joyce tried to find a solution where the book could avoid legal liability while preserving Joyce's artistic integrity. As they negotiated, Richards began to scrutinise the stories more carefully. He became concerned that the book might damage his publishing house's reputation and eventually backed down from his agreement.\nTrieste was Joyce's main residence until 1920; he stayed temporarily in Rome, travelled to Dublin, and emigrated to Zurich during World War I, but Trieste became a second Dublin for him and played an important role in his development as a writer. He completed \"Dubliners,\" reworked \"Stephen Hero\" into \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\", wrote his only published play \"Exiles\" and decided to make \"Ulysses\" a full-length novel as he worked through his notes and jottings, working out the characters of Leopold and Molly Bloom in Trieste. \nMany of the novel's details were taken from Joyce's observation of the city and its people, and some of its stylistic innovations appear to have been influenced by Futurism. There are even words of the Triestine dialect in \"Finnegans Wake\". Joyce was introduced to the Greek Orthodox liturgy in Trieste. Under its influence, he rewrote his first short story and later drew on it in creating the liturgical parodies in \"Ulysses\".\n1906\u20131915: Rome, Trieste, and sojourns to Dublin.\nRome.\nIn late May 1906, the head of the Berlitz school ran away after embezzling its funds. Artifoni took over the school but let Joyce know that he could afford to keep only one brother on. Tired of Trieste and discouraged that he could not get a publisher for \"Dubliners\", Joyce found an advertisement for a correspondence clerk in a Roman bank that paid twice his current salary. He was hired for the position and went to Rome at the end of July.\nJoyce felt he accomplished very little during his brief stay in Rome, but it had a large impact on his writing. Though his new job took up most of his time, he revised \"Dubliners\" and worked on \"Stephen Hero\". Rome was the birthplace of the idea for \"The Dead\", which became the final story of \"Dubliners\", and for \"Ulysses\", which was originally conceived as a short story. His stay in the city was one of his inspirations for \"Exiles\". While there, he read the socialist historian Guglielmo Ferrero in depth. Ferrero's anti-heroic interpretations of history, arguments against militarism, and conflicted attitudes toward Jews found their way into \"Ulysses\", particularly in the character of Leopold Bloom. In London, Elkin Mathews published \"Chamber Music\" on the recommendation of the British poet Arthur Symons. Nonetheless, Joyce was dissatisfied with his job, had exhausted his finances, and realised he would need additional support when he learned Nora was pregnant again. He left Rome after seven months.\nSecond stay in Trieste.\nJoyce returned to Trieste in March 1907, but was unable to find full-time work. He went back to being an English instructor, working part-time for Berlitz and giving private lessons. The author Ettore Schmitz, better known by pen name Italo Svevo, was one of his students. Svevo was a Catholic of Jewish origin who became one of the models for Leopold Bloom. Joyce learned much of what he knew about Judaism from him. The two became lasting friends and mutual critics. Svevo supported Joyce's identity as an author, helping him work through his writer's block with \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\". Roberto Prezioso, editor of the Italian newspaper \"Piccolo della Sera\", was another of Joyce's students. He helped Joyce financially by commissioning him to write for the newspaper. Joyce quickly produced three articles aimed toward the Italian irredentists in Trieste. He indirectly paralleled their desire for independence from Austria-Hungary with the struggle against British rule in Ireland. Joyce earned additional money by giving a series of lectures at\nTrieste's Universit\u00e0 Popolare on Ireland and the arts, as well as on William Shakespeare's play \"Hamlet\".\nIn May, Joyce was struck by an attack of rheumatic fever, which left him incapacitated for weeks. The illness exacerbated eye problems that plagued him for the rest of his life. While Joyce was still recovering from the attack, Lucia was born on 26 July 1907. During his convalescence, he was able to finish \"The Dead\", the last story of \"Dubliners\".\nAlthough a heavy drinker, Joyce gave up alcohol for a period in 1908. He reworked \"Stephen Hero\" as the more concise and interior \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\". He completed the third chapter by April and translated John Millington Synge's \"Riders to the Sea\" into Italian with the help of Nicol\u00f2 Vidacovich. He even took singing lessons again. Joyce had been looking for an English publisher for \"Dubliners\" but was unable to find one, so he submitted it to a Dublin publisher, Maunsel and Company, owned by George Roberts.\nVisits to Dublin.\nIn July 1909, Joyce received a year's advance payment from one of his students and returned to Ireland to introduce Giorgio to both sides of the family, his own in Dublin and Nora's in Galway. He unsuccessfully applied for the position of Chair of Italian at his alma mater, which had become University College Dublin. He met with Roberts, who seemed positive about publishing \"Dubliners\". He returned to Trieste in September with his sister Eva, who helped Nora run the home. Joyce stayed in Trieste for only a month, as he almost immediately came upon the idea of starting a cinema in Dublin, which unlike Trieste had none. He quickly got the backing of some Triestine businessmen and returned to Dublin in October, launching Ireland's first cinema, the Volta Cinematograph. It was initially well-received, but fell apart after Joyce left. He returned to Trieste in January 1910 with another sister, Eileen.\nFrom 1910 to 1912, Joyce still lacked a reliable income. This brought his conflicts with Stanislaus, who was frustrated with lending him money, to their peak. In 1912, Prezioso arranged for him to lecture on \"Hamlet\" for the Minerva Society between November 1912 and February 1913. Joyce once more lectured at the Universit\u00e0 Popolare on various topics in English literature and applied for a teaching diploma in English at the University of Padua. He performed very well on the qualification tests, but was denied because Italy did not recognise his degree from an Irish university. In mid-1912, Joyce and his family returned to Dublin briefly. While there, his three-year struggle with Roberts over the publication of \"Dubliners\" ended as Roberts refused to publish it due to concerns of libel. Roberts had the printed sheets destroyed, but Joyce obtained a copy of the proof sheets. When Joyce returned to Trieste, he wrote an invective against Roberts, \"Gas from a Burner\". He never went to Dublin again.\nPublication of \"Dubliners\" and \"A Portrait\".\nJoyce's fortunes changed for the better in 1913 when Richards agreed to publish \"Dubliners\". It was issued on 15 June 1914, eight and a half years since Joyce had first submitted it to him. Around the same time, he found an unexpected advocate in Ezra Pound, who was living in London. On Yeats's advice, Pound wrote to Joyce asking if he could include a poem from \"Chamber Music\", \"I Hear an Army Charging upon the Land\", in the journal \"Des Imagistes\". They began a correspondence that lasted until the late 1930s. Pound became Joyce's promoter, helping ensure that Joyce's works were published and publicised.\nAfter Pound persuaded Dora Marsden to serially publish \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the London literary magazine \"The Egoist\", Joyce's pace of writing increased. He completed \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" by 1914; resumed \"Exiles\", completing it in 1915; started the novelette \"Giacomo Joyce\", which he eventually abandoned; and began drafting \"Ulysses\".\nIn August 1914, World War I broke out. Although Joyce and Stanislaus were subjects of the United Kingdom, which was now at war with Austria-Hungary, they remained in Trieste. Even when Stanislaus, who had publicly expressed his sympathy for the Triestine irredentists, was interned at the beginning of January 1915, Joyce chose to stay. In May 1915, Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary, and less than a month later Joyce took his family to Zurich in neutral Switzerland.\n1915\u20131920: Zurich and Trieste.\nZurich.\nJoyce arrived in Zurich as a double exile: he was an Irishman with a British passport and a Triestine on parole from Austria-Hungary. To get to Switzerland, he had to promise the Austro-Hungarian officials that he would not help the Allies during the war, and he and his family had to leave almost all of their possessions in Trieste. During the war, both the British and Austro-Hungarian secret services kept Joyce under surveillance.\nJoyce's first concern was earning a living. One of Nora's relatives sent them a small sum to cover the first few months. Pound and Yeats worked with the British government to provide a stipend from the Royal Literary Fund in 1915 and a grant from the British civil list the following year. Eventually, Joyce received large regular sums from the editor Harriet Shaw Weaver, who operated \"The Egoist\", and the psychotherapist Edith Rockefeller McCormick, who lived in Zurich, studying under Carl Jung. Weaver financially supported Joyce for the rest of his life and even paid for his funeral. Between 1917 and the beginning of 1919, Joyce was financially secure and lived quite well; the family sometimes stayed in Locarno in Switzerland's Italian-speaking region. But Joyce's health problems persisted. During their time in Zurich, he and Nora both suffered illnesses diagnosed as \"nervous breakdowns\", and he underwent many eye surgeries.\nWriting \"Ulysses\".\nDuring the war, Zurich was the centre of a vibrant expatriate community. Joyce's spent evenings in the Cafe Pfauen, where he got to know some of the artists living in the city, including the sculptor August Suter and the painter Frank Budgen. He often used the time spent with them as material for \"Ulysses\". He met the writer Stefan Zweig, who organised the premiere of \"Exiles\" in Munich in August 1919. He became aware of Dada, which was coming into its own at the Cabaret Voltaire. He may have met the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary Vladimir Lenin at the Cafe Odeon, a place they both frequented.\nJoyce kept up his interest in music. He met Ferruccio Busoni, staged music with Otto Luening, and learned music theory from Philipp Jarnach. Much of what Joyce learned about musical notation and counterpoint found its way into \"Ulysses\", particularly the \"Sirens\" section.\nJoyce avoided public discussion of the war and maintained strict neutrality. He made few comments about the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland; although he was sympathetic to the Irish independence movement, he disagreed with its violence. He stayed intently focused on \"Ulysses\" and the struggle to get his work published. Some of the serial instalments of \"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in \"The Egoist\" had been censored by the printers, but the entire novel was published by B. W. Huebsch in 1916. In 1918, Pound got a commitment from Margaret Caroline Anderson, the owner and editor of the New York-based literary magazine \"The Little Review\", to publish \"Ulysses\" serially.\nThe English Players.\nJoyce co-founded an acting company, the English Players, and became its business manager. The company was pitched to the British government as a contribution to the war effort, and mainly staged works by Irish playwrights, such as Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, and John Millington Synge. For Synge's \"Riders to the Sea\", Nora played a principal role and Joyce sang offstage, which he did again when Robert Browning's \"In a Balcony\" was staged. He hoped the company would eventually stage his play, \"Exiles\", but his participation in the English Players declined in the wake of the influenza epidemic of 1918, though the company continued until 1920.\nJoyce's work with the English Players involved him in a lawsuit. Henry Wilfred Carr, a wounded war veteran and British consul, accused Joyce of underpaying him for his role in \"The Importance of Being Earnest\". Carr sued for compensation; Joyce countersued for libel. The cases were resolved in 1919, with Joyce winning the compensation case but losing the one for libel. The incident created acrimony between the British consulate and Joyce for the rest of his time in Zurich.\nThird stay in Trieste.\nBy 1919, Joyce was in financial difficulty again. McCormick stopped paying her stipend, partly because he refused to be psychoanalysed by Jung, and Zurich had become expensive to live in after the war. He was also becoming isolated as the city's emigres returned home. In October 1919, Joyce's family moved back to Trieste, but it had changed. The Austro-Hungarian empire had ceased to exist, and Trieste was now an Italian city in postwar recovery. Eight months after his return, Joyce went to Sirmione, Italy, to meet Pound, who made arrangements for him to move to Paris. Joyce and his family packed their belongings and headed for Paris in June 1920.\n1920\u20131941: Paris and Zurich.\nParis.\nWhen Joyce and his family arrived in Paris in July 1920, their visit was intended to be a layover on their way to London. For the first four months, he stayed with Ludmila Savitzky and met Sylvia Beach, who ran the Rive Gauche bookshop, Shakespeare and Company. Beach quickly became an important person in Joyce's life, providing financial support and becoming one of his publishers. Through Beach and Pound, Joyce quickly joined the intellectual circle of Paris and was integrated into the international modernist artist community. He met Valery Larbaud, who championed Joyce's works to the French and supervised the French translation of \"Ulysses\". Paris became the Joyces' regular residence for 20 years, though they never settled at a single location for long.\nPublication of \"Ulysses\".\nJoyce finished writing \"Ulysses\" near the end of 1921, but had difficulties getting it published. With financial backing from the lawyer John Quinn, Margaret Anderson and her co-editor Jane Heap had begun serially publishing it in \"The Little Review\" in March 1918, but in January and May 1919, two instalments were suppressed as obscene and potentially subversive. In September 1920, an unsolicited instalment of the \"Nausicaa\" episode was sent to the daughter of a New York attorney associated with the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, leading to an official complaint. The trial proceedings continued until February 1921, when Anderson and Heap, defended by Quinn, were fined $50 each for publishing obscenity and ordered to cease publishing \"Ulysses\". Huebsch, who had expressed interest in publishing the novel in the United States, decided against it after the trial. Weaver was unable to find an English printer, and the novel was banned for obscenity in the United Kingdom in 1922, where it was blacklisted until 1936.\nAlmost immediately after Anderson and Heap were ordered to stop printing \"Ulysses\", Beach agreed to publish it through her bookshop. She had books mailed to people in Paris and the United States who had subscribed to get a copy; Weaver sent books from Beach's plates to subscribers in England. Soon, the postal officials of both countries began confiscating the books. They were then smuggled into both countries. Because the work had no copyright in the United States at this time, \"bootleg\" versions appeared, including pirate versions from publisher Samuel Roth, who ceased his actions only in 1928, when a court enjoined publication. \"Ulysses\" was not legally published in the United States until 1934, when Judge John M. Woolsey ruled in \"United States v. One Book Called Ulysses\" that the book is not obscene.\nWriting \"Finnegans Wake\".\nIn 1923, Joyce began his next work, an experimental novel that became \"Finnegans Wake\". It took 16 years to complete. At first, Joyce called it \"Work in Progress\", which was the name Ford Madox Ford used in April 1924 when he published its \"Mamalujo\" episode in his magazine, \"The Transatlantic Review\". In 1926, Eugene and Maria Jolas serialised the novel in their magazine, \"transition\". When parts of the novel first came out, some of Joyce's supporters\u2014like Stanislaus, Pound, and Weaver\u2014 wrote unfavourably about it, and it was criticised by writers like Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in, Wyndham Lewis, and Rebecca West. In response, Joyce and the Jolases organised the publication of a collection of favourable essays, \"Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress\", to which Samuel Beckett and William Carlos Williams contributed. An additional purpose of publishing these essays was to market \"Work in Progress\" to a larger audience. Joyce publicly revealed the novel's title as \"Finnegans Wake\" in 1939, the year he completed it. It was published in London by Faber and Faber with the assistance of T. S. Eliot.\nJoyce's health problems afflicted him throughout his Paris years. He had over a dozen eye operations, but his vision severely declined. By 1930, he was practically blind in the left eye, and his right eye functioned poorly. He had all his teeth removed because of infection. At one point, Joyce became worried that he could not finish \"Finnegans Wake\", asking the Irish author James Stephens to complete it if he became unable.\nJoyce's financial problems continued. Although he was now earning a good income from his investments and royalties, his spending habits often left him without available money. Still, he published \"Pomes Penyeach\" in 1927, a collection of 13 poems that he wrote in Trieste, Zurich and Paris.\nMarriage in London.\nIn 1930, Joyce began thinking of establishing a residence in London once more, primarily to ensure that Giorgio, who had just married Helen Fleischmann, would have his inheritance secured under British law. Joyce moved to London, obtained a long-term lease on a flat, registered on the electoral roll, and became liable for jury service. After having lived together for 27 years, Joyce and Nora married at the Register Office in Kensington on 4 July 1931. Joyce stayed in London for at least six months to establish his residency, but abandoned his flat and returned to Paris later in the year when Lucia showed signs of mental illness. He planned to return, but never did, and later became disaffected with England.\nIn later years, Joyce lived in Paris but frequently travelled to Switzerland for eye surgery or for treatment for Lucia, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Lucia was analysed by Jung, who had previously written that \"Ulysses\" was similar to schizophrenic writing. Jung suggested that she and her father were two people going into a river, with Joyce diving and Lucia falling. Despite Joyce's attempts to help Lucia, she remained permanently institutionalised after his death.\nFinal return to Zurich.\nIn the late 1930s, Joyce became increasingly concerned about the rise of fascism and antisemitism. In 1938, he helped Jews escape Nazi persecution. After the fall of France in 1940, Joyce and his family fled from Nazi occupation, returning to Zurich a final time.\nDeath.\nOn 11 January 1941, Joyce underwent surgery in Zurich for a perforated duodenal ulcer. He fell into a coma the next day. He awoke at 2\u00a0am on 13 January 1941, and asked a nurse to call his wife and son. They were en route when he died 15\u00a0minutes later, at age 58.\nHis body was buried in the Fluntern Cemetery in Zurich. Swiss tenor Max Meili sang \"Addio terra, addio cielo\" from Monteverdi's \"L'Orfeo\" at the burial service. Joyce had been a subject of the United Kingdom all of his life, and although two senior Irish diplomats were in Switzerland at the time, only the British consul attended the funeral. When Frank Cremins, \"charg\u00e9 d'affaires\" at Bern, informed Joseph Walshe, secretary at the Department of External Affairs in Dublin, of Joyce's death, Walshe responded: \"Please wire details of Joyce's death. If possible find out did he die a Catholic? Express sympathy with Mrs Joyce and explain inability to attend funeral.\" Buried originally in an ordinary grave, Joyce was moved in 1966 to a more prominent \"honour grave\", with a seated portrait statue by American artist Milton Hebald nearby. Nora survived him by 10 years. She is buried by his side, as is their son Giorgio, who died in 1976.\nAfter Joyce's death, the Irish government declined Nora's request to permit the repatriation of his remains, despite being persistently lobbied by the American diplomat John J. Slocum. In October 2019, a motion was put to Dublin City Council to plan and budget for the costs of the exhumations and reburials of Joyce and his family somewhere in Dublin, subject to his family's wishes. The proposal immediately became controversial, with the \"Irish Times\" commenting: \"it is hard not to suspect that there is a calculating, even mercantile, aspect to contemporary Ireland's relationship to its great writers, whom we are often more keen to 'celebrate', and if possible monetise, than read\".\nPolitical views.\nThroughout his life, Joyce maintained an active interest in Irish politics and the country's relationship to the British Empire. He studied socialism and anarchism. He attended socialist meetings and expressed an individualist anarchist view influenced by Benjamin Tucker's philosophy and Oscar Wilde's essay \"The Soul of Man Under Socialism\". He described his opinions as \"those of a socialist artist\". Joyce's direct engagement in politics was strongest during his time in Trieste, when he submitted newspaper articles, gave lectures, and wrote letters advocating for Ireland's independence from British rule. After leaving Trieste, Joyce's direct involvement in politics waned, but his later works still reflect his commitment. He remained sympathetic to individualist anarchism and critical of coercive ideologies such as nationalism. His novels address socialist, anarchist, and Irish nationalist issues. \"Ulysses\" has been read as a critique of the effect of British rule on the Irish people. \"Finnegans Wake\" has been read as an investigation of the divisive issues of Irish politics, the interrelationship between colonialism and race, and the coercive oppression of nationalism and fascism.\nJoyce wrote critically of British rule in Ireland and was sympathetic to attempts to establish an independent Irish republic. In 1907, he expressed his support for the early Sinn F\u00e9in movement before the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. But Joyce refused to exchange his British passport for an Irish one. When he had a choice, he renewed his British passport in 1935 instead of obtaining one from the Irish Free State, and chose to keep it in 1940 when accepting an Irish passport could have helped him to leave Vichy France more easily. His refusal to change his passport was partly due to the advantages a British passport gave him internationally, his being out of sympathy with the violence of Irish politics, and his dismay over the Irish Free State's political alignment with the Catholic Church.\nReligious views.\nJoyce had a complex relationship with religion. Joyce lapsed from the Church early in life, and firsthand statements by him and Stanislaus attest that he did not consider himself a Catholic, though his work is deeply influenced by Catholicism. In particular, his intellectual foundations were grounded in his early Jesuit education. Even after he left Ireland, he sometimes went to church. When living in Trieste, he woke up early to attend Mass on Holy Thursday and Good Friday and occasionally attended Eastern Orthodox services, saying he liked the ceremonies better.\nJoyce's wife Nora refused to allow a Catholic service when he died. His works frequently critique, ridicule, and blaspheme Catholicism, and he appropriates Catholic rituals and concepts for his own artistic purposes. Some critics have therefore argued that Joyce firmly rejected Catholicism, but Catholic critics have argued that Joyce never fully abandoned his faith, wrestling with it in his writings and becoming increasingly reconciled to it. They regard \"Ulysses\" and \"Finnegans Wake\" as expressions of a Catholic sensibility, insisting that the critical views of religion the characters in his novels express are not those of the author. \nOther critics have suggested that Joyce's apparent apostasy was less a denial of faith than a transmutation, a criticism of the Church's adverse effect on spiritual life, politics, and personal development. His attitude toward Catholicism has been described as an enigma in which there are two Joyces: a modern one who resisted the power of Catholicism and another who maintained his allegiance to its traditions. He has been compared to the medieval (wandering bishops), who left their discipline but not their cultural heritage of thought.\nJoyce's responses to questions about his faith were often ambiguous. For example, during an interview after the completion of \"Ulysses\", Joyce was asked, \"When did you leave the Catholic Church?\" He answered, \"That's for the Church to say.\"\nMajor works.\n\"Dubliners\".\n\"Dubliners\", first published in 1914, is a collection of 15 short stories that form a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle-class life in and around the city in the early 20th century. The tales were written when Irish nationalism and the search for national identity was at its peak. Joyce holds up a mirror to that identity as a first step in the spiritual liberation of Ireland. The stories centre on Joyce's idea of an epiphany: a moment when a character experiences a life-changing self-understanding or illumination. Many of the characters in \"Dubliners\" later appear in minor roles in Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\". The initial stories are narrated by child protagonists. Later stories deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people. This aligns with Joyce's tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence, and maturity.\n\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\".\n\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\", published in 1916, is a shortened rewrite of the novel \"Stephen Hero\", which was abandoned in 1905. It is a \"K\u00fcnstlerroman\", a kind of coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of the protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. It functions both as an autobiographical fiction of the author and a biography of the fictional protagonist. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings, are evident in this novel.\n\"Exiles\" and poetry.\nDespite early interest in the theatre, Joyce published only one play, \"Exiles\", begun shortly after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and published in 1918. A study of a husband-and-wife relationship, the play looks back to \"The Dead\" (the final story in \"Dubliners\") and forward to \"Ulysses\", which Joyce began around the time of the play's composition.\nHe published three books of poetry. The first full-length collection was \"Chamber Music\" (1907), which consisted of 36 short lyrics. It led to his inclusion in the \"Imagist Anthology\", edited by Ezra Pound, a champion of Joyce's work. Other poetry Joyce published in his lifetime includes \"Gas from a Burner\" (1912), \"Pomes Penyeach\" (1927), and \"Ecce Puer\" (written in 1932 to mark the birth of his grandson and the recent death of his father). These were published by the Black Sun Press in \"Collected Poems\" (1936).\n\"Ulysses\".\nThe action of \"Ulysses\" starts on 16 June 1904 at 8am and ends sometime after 2am the next morning. Much of it occurs inside the minds of the characters, who are portrayed through techniques such as interior monologue, dialogue, and soliloquy. The novel has 18 episodes, each covering roughly one hour of the day in a unique literary style. Each chapter refers to an episode in Homer's \"Odyssey\", as well as a specific colour, a particular art or science, and a bodily organ. \"Ulysses\" sets the characters and incidents of the \"Odyssey\" in 1904 Dublin, representing Odysseus (Ulysses), Penelope, and Telemachus in the characters of Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly Bloom, and Stephen Dedalus. It uses humour, including parody, satire and comedy, to contrast the novel's characters with their Homeric models. Joyce played down the mythic correspondences by eliminating the chapter titles so the work could be read independently of its Homeric structure.\n\"Ulysses\" can be read as a study of Dublin in 1904, exploring various aspects of the city's life, dwelling on its squalor and monotony. Joyce claimed that if Dublin was destroyed in some catastrophe, it could be rebuilt using his work as a model. To achieve this sense of detail, he relied on his memory, what he heard other people remember, and his readings, to create a sense of fastidious detail. Joyce regularly used the 1904 edition of \"Thom's Directory\"\u2014a work that listed the owners and tenants of every residential and commercial property in the city\u2014to ensure his descriptions were accurate. This combination of kaleidoscopic writing, reliance on a formal schema to structure the narrative, and exquisite attention to detail represents one of the book's major contributions to the development of 20th-century modernist literature.\n\"Finnegans Wake\".\n\"Finnegans Wake\" is an experimental novel that pushes stream of consciousness and literary allusion to their extremes. It can be read from beginning to end, but Joyce's writing transforms traditional ideas of plot and character development through his wordplay, allowing the book to be read non-linearly. Much of the wordplay stems from peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multilevel puns. This approach is similar to, but far more extensive than, Lewis Carroll's in \"Jabberwocky\" and draws on a wide range of languages. The associative nature of its language has led to its being interpreted as the story of a dream.\nThe metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola, whom Joyce read in his youth, plays an important role in \"Finnegans Wake\", as it provides the framework for how the characters' identities interplay and are transformed. Giambattista Vico's cyclical view of history\u2014in which civilisation rises from chaos, passes through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapses back into chaos\u2014structures the text's narrative, as evidenced by the book's opening and closing words: \"Finnegans Wake\" opens, \"riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs\", and ends, \"A way a lone a last a loved a long the\". Thus the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of that sentence, turning the narrative into one great cycle.\nLegacy.\nJoyce's work still has a profound influence on contemporary culture. \"Ulysses\" is a model for fiction writers, particularly its explorations into the power of language. Its emphasis on the details of everyday life has opened up new possibilities of expression for authors, painters and film-makers. It retains its prestige among readers, often ranking high on 'Great Book' lists. Joyce's innovations extend beyond English literature: his writing has been an inspiration for Latin American writers, and \"Finnegans Wake\" has become one of the key texts for French post-structuralism.\nThe open-ended form of Joyce's novels keeps them open to constant reinterpretation. They inspire an increasingly global community of literary critics. Joyce's studies\u2014based on a relatively small canon of three novels, a small short story collection, one play, and two small books of poems\u2014have generated over 15,000 articles, monographs, theses, translations, and editions.\nIn popular culture, the work and life of Joyce is celebrated annually on 16 June, known as Bloomsday, in Dublin and in an increasing number of cities worldwide.\nCollections, museums, and study centres.\nIreland.\nThe National Library of Ireland has a large collection of Joycean material, including manuscripts and notebooks, much of it available online. A joint venture between the library and University College Dublin, the Museum of Literature Ireland, the majority of whose exhibits are about Joyce and his work, has a small permanent Joyce-related collection and borrows from its parent institutions; its displays include \"Copy No. 1\" of \"Ulysses\". Dedicated centres in Dublin include the James Joyce Centre in North Great George's Street, the James Joyce Tower and Museum in Sandycove at the Martello tower where Joyce briefly lived and where he set the opening scene in \"Ulysses\", and the Dublin Writers Museum. \nUnited Kingdom.\nUniversity College London (UCL) holds the United Kingdom's only major research collection of Joyce's work, including first editions of all his major works, many other editions and translations, and critical and background literature. UCL also has an archive collection of Joyce-related material that includes letters to Jane Lidderdale and Harriet Shaw Weaver and papers relating to and by Joyce's daughter Lucia.\nUnited States.\nThe University at Buffalo's James Joyce Collection has more than 10,000 pages of Joyce's working papers, notebooks, manuscripts, photographs, correspondence and other materials, and Joyce's private library.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournal articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOnline sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLiterary works\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nJoyce Papers, National Library of Ireland\nElectronic editions\nResources"}

While strikes and use of weapons are included in some pre-arranged forms (kata), they are not frequently trained and are illegal in judo competition or free practice. Judo's international governing body is the International Judo Federation, and competitors compete in the international IJF professional circuit.\nJudo's philosophy revolves around two primary principles: and . The philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for other modern Japanese martial arts that developed from \"Ko-ry\u016b\". Judo has also spawned a number of derivative martial arts around the world, such as Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Krav Maga, sambo, and ARB. Judo also influenced the formation of other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling.\nHistory and philosophy.\nEarly life of its founder.\nThe early history of judo is inseparable from its founder, Japanese polymath and educator , born . Kano was born into a relatively affluent family. His father, Jirosaku, was the second son of the head priest of the Shinto Hiyoshi shrine in Shiga Prefecture. He married Sadako Kano, daughter of the owner of Kiku-Masamune sake brewing company and was adopted by the family, changing his name to Kano. He ultimately became an official in the Shogunate government.\nJigoro Kano had an academic upbringing and, from the age of seven, he studied English, and the under a number of tutors. When he was fourteen, Kano began boarding at an English-medium school, Ikuei-Gijuku in Shiba, Tokyo. The culture of bullying endemic at this school was the catalyst that caused Kano to seek out a at which to train.\nEarly attempts to find a jujutsu teacher who was willing to take him on met with little success. Jujutsu had become unfashionable in an increasingly westernized Japan. Many of those who had once taught the art had been forced out of teaching or become so disillusioned with it that they had simply given up. Nakai Umenari, an acquaintance of Kan\u014d's father and a former soldier, agreed to show him \"kata\", but not to teach him. The caretaker of Jirosaku's second house, Katagiri Ryuji, also knew jujutsu, but would not teach it as he believed it was no longer of practical use. Another frequent visitor, Imai Genshiro of \"Kyushin-ry\u016b\" school of jujutsu, also refused. Several years passed before he finally found a willing teacher.\nIn 1877, as a student at the University of Tokyo, Kano learned that many jujutsu teachers had been forced to pursue alternative careers, frequently opening . After inquiring at a number of these, Kano was referred to Fukuda Hachinosuke (c.\u20091828\u20131880), a teacher of the \"Tenjin Shin'y\u014d-ry\u016b\" of jujutsu, who had a small nine mat d\u014dj\u014d where he taught five students. Fukuda is said to have emphasized technique over formal exercise, sowing the seeds of Kano's emphasis on in judo.\nOn Fukuda's death in 1880, Kano, who had become his keenest and most able student in both \"randori\" and \"kata\", was given the of the Fukuda d\u014dj\u014d. Kano chose to continue his studies at another \"Tenjin Shin'y\u014d-ry\u016b\" school, that of Iso Masatomo (c.\u20091820\u20131881). Iso placed more emphasis on the practice of \"kata\", and entrusted \"randori\" instruction to assistants, increasingly to Kano. Iso died in June 1881 and Kano went on to study at the d\u014dj\u014d of Iikubo Tsunetoshi (1835\u20131889) of . Like Fukuda, Iikubo placed much emphasis on \"randori\", with \"Kit\u014d-ry\u016b\" having a greater focus on .\nFounding of the Kodokan.\nIn February 1882, Kano founded a school and d\u014dj\u014d at the , a Buddhist temple in what was then the Shitaya ward of Tokyo (now the Higashi Ueno district of Tait\u014d ward). Iikubo, Kano's \"Kit\u014d-ry\u016b\" instructor, attended the d\u014dj\u014d three days a week to help teach and, although two years would pass before the temple would be called by the name , and Kano had not yet received his in \"Kit\u014d-ry\u016b\", this is now regarded as the Kodokan founding.\nThe \"Eisho-ji\" d\u014dj\u014d was originally shoin. It was a relatively small affair, consisting of a 12 jo (214 sq ft) training area. Kano took in resident and non-resident students, the first two being Tomita Tsunejir\u014d and Shiro Saigo. In August, the following year, the pair were granted grades, the first that had been awarded in any martial art.\nJudo versus jujutsu.\nCentral to Kano's vision for judo were the principles of and . He illustrated the application of \"seiryoku zen'y\u014d\" with the concept of :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In short, resisting a more powerful opponent will result in your defeat, whilst adjusting to and evading your opponent's attack will cause him to lose his balance, his power will be reduced, and you will defeat him. This can apply whatever the relative values of power, thus making it possible for weaker opponents to beat significantly stronger ones. This is the theory of \"ju yoku go o seisu\".\nKano realised that \"seiryoku zen'y\u014d\", initially conceived as a jujutsu concept, had a wider philosophical application. Coupled with the Confucianist-influenced \"jita ky\u014dei\", the wider application shaped the development of judo from a to a . Kano rejected techniques that did not conform to these principles and emphasized the importance of efficiency in the execution of techniques. He was convinced that practice of jujutsu while conforming to these ideals was a route to self-improvement and the betterment of society in general. He was, however, acutely conscious of the Japanese public's negative perception of jujutsu:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the time a few bujitsu (martial arts) experts still existed but bujitsu was almost abandoned by the nation at large. Even if I wanted to teach jujitsu most people had now stopped thinking about it. So I thought it better to teach under a different name principally because my objectives were much wider than jujitsu.\nKano believed that \"\"j\u016bjutsu\"\" was insufficient to describe his art: although means \"art\" or \"means\", it implies a method consisting of a collection of physical techniques. Accordingly, he changed the second character to , meaning \"way\", \"road\" or \"path\", which implies a more philosophical context than \"jutsu\" and has a common origin with the Chinese concept of \"tao\". Thus Kano renamed it .\nJudo \"waza\" (techniques).\nThere are three basic categories of in judo: , and . Judo is mostly known for \"nage-waza\" and \"katame-waza\", because striking techniques of any kind are restricted in the competitive judo.\nJudo practitioners typically devote a portion of each practice session to , in order that \"nage-waza\" can be practiced without significant risk of injury. Several distinct types of \"ukemi\" exist, including ; ; ; and \nThe person who performs a \"waza\" is known as and the person to whom it is performed is known as .\n\"Nage-waza\" (throwing techniques).\n\"Nage-waza\" include all techniques in which \"tori\" attempts to throw or trip \"uke\", usually with the aim of placing \"uke\" on their back. Each technique has three distinct stages:\n\"Nage-waza\" are typically drilled by the use of , repeated turning-in, taking the throw up to the point of \"kake\".\nTraditionally, \"nage-waza\" are further categorised into , throws that are performed with \"tori\" maintaining an upright position, and , throws in which \"tori\" sacrifices his upright position in order to throw \"uke\".\n\"Tachi-waza\" are further subdivided into , in which \"tori\" predominantly uses their arms to throw \"uke\"; throws that predominantly use a lifting motion from the hips; and , throws in which \"tori\" predominantly utilises their legs.\n\"Katame-waza\" (grappling techniques).\n\"Katame-waza\" is further categorised into , in which \"tori\" traps and pins \"uke\" on their back on the floor; , in which \"tori\" attempts to force a submission by choking or strangling \"uke\"; and , in which \"tori\" attempts to submit \"uke\" by painful manipulation of their joints.\nA related concept is that of , in which \"waza\" are applied from a non-standing position.\nIn competitive judo, \"Kansetsu-waza\" is currently limited to elbow joint manipulation. Manipulation and locking of other joints can be found in various kata, such as \"Katame-no-kata\" and \"Kodokan goshin jutsu\".\n\"Atemi-waza\" (striking techniques).\n\"Atemi-waza\" are techniques in which \"tori\" disables \"uke\" with a strike to a vital point. \"Atemi-waza\" are not permitted outside of \"kata\".\nPedagogy.\n\"Randori\" (free practice).\nJudo pedagogy emphasizes . This term covers a variety of forms of practice, and the intensity at which it is carried out varies depending on intent and the level of expertise of the participants. At one extreme, is a compliant style of randori, known as , in which neither participant offers resistance to their partner's attempts to throw. A related concept is that of , in which an experienced judoka allows himself to be thrown by his less-experienced partner. At the opposite extreme from \"yakusoku geiko\" is the hard style of randori that seeks to emulate the style of judo seen in competition. While hard randori is the cornerstone of judo, over-emphasis of the competitive aspect is seen as undesirable by traditionalists if the intent of the randori is to \"win\" rather than to learn.\nKata (forms).\n are pre-arranged patterns of techniques and in judo, with the exception of elements of the \"Seiryoku-Zen'y\u014d Kokumin-Taiiku\", they are all practised with a partner. Their purposes include illustrating the basic principles of judo, demonstrating the correct execution of a technique, teaching the philosophical tenets upon which judo is based, allowing for the practice of techniques that are not allowed in randori, and to preserve ancient techniques that are historically important but are no longer used in contemporary judo.\nThere are ten kata that are recognized by the Kodokan today:\nIn addition, there are a number of commonly practiced kata that are not recognised by the Kodokan. Some of the more common kata include:\nCompetitive judo.\nHistory.\n is a vitally important aspect of judo. In 1899, Kano was asked to chair a committee of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai to draw up the first formal set of contest rules for jujutsu. These rules were intended to cover contests between different various traditional schools of jujutsu as well as practitioners of Kodokan judo. Contests were 15 minutes long and were judged on the basis of \"nage waza\" and \"katame waza\", excluding \"atemi waza\". Wins were by two ippons, awarded in every four-main different path of winning alternatives, by \"Throwing\", where the opponent's back strikes flat onto the mat with sufficient force, by \"Pinning\" them on their back for a \"sufficient\" amount of time, or by \"Submission\", which could be achieved via \"Shime-waza\" or \"Kansetsu-waza\", in which the opponent was forced to give himself or herself up or summon a referee's or corner-judge's stoppage. Finger, toe and ankle locks were prohibited. In 1900, these rules were adopted by the Kodokan with amendments made to prohibit all joint locks for \"kyu\" grades and added wrist locks to the prohibited \"kansetsu-waza\" for \"dan\" grades. It was also stated that the ratio of \"tachi-waza\" to \"ne-waza\" should be between 70% and 80% for \"kyu\" grades and between 60% and 70% for \"dan\" grades.\nIn 1916, additional rulings were brought in to further limit \"kansetsu waza\" with the prohibition of \"ashi garami\" and neck locks, as well as \"do jime\". These were further added to in 1925.\nJigoro Kano for a long time wished to see judo as an Olympic discipline. The first time judo was seen in the Olympic Games was in an informal demonstration hosted by Kano at the 1932 Games. However, Kano was ambivalent about judo's potential inclusion as an Olympic sport:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have been asked by people of various sections as to the wisdom and possibility of judo being introduced with other games and sports at the Olympic Games. My view on the matter, at present, is rather passive. If it be the desire of other member countries, I have no objection. But I do not feel inclined to take any initiative. For one thing, judo in reality is not a mere sport or game. I regard it as a principle of life, art and science. In fact, it is a means for personal cultural attainment. Only one of the forms of judo training, so-called randori or free practice can be classed as a form of sport. Certainly, to some extent, the same may be said of boxing and fencing, but today they are practiced and conducted as sports. Then the Olympic Games are so strongly flavored with nationalism that it is possible to be influenced by it and to develop \"Contest Judo\", a retrograde form as ju-jitsu was before the Kodokan was founded. Judo should be free as art and science from any external influences, political, national, racial, and financial or any other organized interest. And all things connected with it should be directed to its ultimate object, the \"Benefit of Humanity\". Human sacrifice is a matter of ancient history.\nUse of judo at the Summer Olympic Games.\nAt the 57th general session of the International Olympic Committee, held in Rome on 22 August 1960, the IOC members formally decided to include Judo among the events to be contested at the Olympic Games. The proposal, which was placed before the session by the Japanese delegation, was welcomed by all participants. The few who opposed had nothing against Judo itself but against increasing the number of Olympic events as a whole. There were only two dissenting votes in the final poll. For the first time in history a traditional Japanese sport has been included in the Olympic competition.\nFinally, judo was first contested as an Olympic sport for men in the 1964 Games in Tokyo. The Olympic Committee initially dropped judo for the 1968 Olympics, meeting protests. Dutchman Anton Geesink won the first Olympic gold medal in the open division of judo by defeating Akio Kaminaga of Japan. The women's event was introduced at the Olympics in 1988 as a demonstration event, and an official medal event in 1992.\nUse of judo at the Summer Paralympic Games.\nJudo was introduced as a Paralympic sport at the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, with women's events contested for the first time at 2004 Summer Paralympics.\nUse of judo at the Commonwealth Games.\nJudo was an optional sport included in the three editions of the Commonwealth Games: 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. From 2022, judo will become a core sport in the 22nd edition of the Commonwealth Games, in Birmingham and also the 23rd edition of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\nCurrent international contest rules.\nPenalties may be given for: passivity or preventing progress in the match; for safety infringements (for example by using prohibited techniques), or for behavior that is deemed to be against the spirit of judo. Fighting must be stopped if a participant is outside the designated area on the mat.\nWeight divisions.\nThere are currently seven weight divisions, subject to change by governing bodies, and may be modified based on the age of the competitors:\nCompetition scoring.\nA throw that places the opponent on their back with impetus and control scores an , winning the contest. A lesser throw, where the opponent is thrown onto his back, but with insufficient force to merit an ippon, scores a . Two scores of waza-ari equal an ippon . This rule was cancelled in 2017, but it was resumed in 2018. Formerly, a throw that places the opponent onto his side scores a .\nIn 2017, the International Judo Federation announced changes in evaluation of points. There will only be ippon and waza-ari scores given during a match with yuko scores now included within waza-ari.\nIppon is scored in \"ne-waza\" for pinning an opponent on his back with a recognised \"osaekomi-waza\" for 20 seconds or by forcing a submission through \"shime-waza\" or \"kansetsu-waza\". A submission is signalled by tapping the mat or the opponent at least twice with the hand or foot, or by saying . A pin lasting for less than 20 seconds, but more than 10 seconds scores waza-ari (formerly waza-ari was awarded for holds of longer than 15 seconds and yuko for holds of longer than 10 seconds).\nFormerly, there was an additional score that was lesser to yuko, that of . This has since been removed.\nIf the scores are identical at the end of the match, the contest is resolved by the \"Golden Score\" rule. \"Golden Score\" is a sudden death situation where the clock is reset to match-time, and the first contestant to achieve any score wins. If there is no score during this period, then the winner is decided by , the majority opinion of the referee and the two corner judges.\nThere have been changes to the scoring. In January 2013, the hantei was removed and the \"Golden Score\" no longer has a time limit. The match would continue until a judoka scored through a technique or if the opponent is penalised (hansoku-make).\nPenalties.\nTwo types of penalties may be awarded. A shido (\u6307\u5c0e\u00a0\u2013 literally \"guidance\") is awarded for minor rule infringements. A shido can also be awarded for a prolonged period of non-aggression. Recent rule changes allow for the first shidos to result in only warnings. If there is a tie, then and only then, will the number of shidos (if less than three) be used to determine the winner. After three shidos are given, the victory is given to the opponent, constituting an indirect hansoku-make (\u53cd\u5247\u8ca0\u3051\u00a0\u2013 literally \"foul-play defeat\"), but does not result in expulsion from the tournament. Note: Prior to 2017, the 4th shido was hansoku-make. If hansoku-make is awarded for a major rule infringement, it results not just in loss of the match, but in the expulsion from the tournament of the penalized player.\nIn mixed martial arts.\nA number of judo practitioners have made an impact in mixed martial arts. Notable judo-trained MMA fighters include Olympic medalists Hidehiko Yoshida (Gold, 1992), Naoya Ogawa (Silver, 1992), Pawe\u0142 Nastula (Gold, 1996), Makoto Takimoto (Gold, 2000), Satoshi Ishii (Gold, 2008), Ronda Rousey (Bronze, 2008), and Kayla Harrison (Gold, 2012 and 2016), former Russian national judo championship bronze medalist Fedor Emelianenko, Yoshihiro Akiyama, Don Frye, Rick Hawn, Daniel Kelly, Hector Lombard, Karo Parisyan, Ayaka Hamasaki, Ant\u00f4nio Silva, Oleg Taktarov, Rhadi Ferguson, Dong-Sik Yoon, and Khabib Nurmagomedov.\nAlternative styles and derivative martial arts.\nKano Jigoro's Kodokan judo is the most popular and well-known style of judo, but is not the only one. The terms judo and jujutsu were quite interchangeable in the early years, so some of these forms of judo are still known as jujutsu or jiu-jitsu either for that reason, or simply to differentiate them from mainstream judo. From Kano's original style of judo, several related forms have evolved\u2014some now widely considered to be \nKosen judo.\nCommonly described as a separate style of Judo, Kosen judo is a competition rules set of Kodokan judo that was popularized in the early 20th century for use in Japanese Special High Schools Championships held at Kyoto Imperial University. The word \"Kosen\" is an acronym of . Currently, competitions are organized between Japan's seven former Imperial Universities and referred to as \"Nanatei Judo\" (, literally \"Seven Emperors Judo\"). Kosen judo's focus on newaza has drawn comparisons with Brazilian jiu-jitsu.\nFreestyle Judo.\nFreestyle Judo is a form of competitive judo practiced primarily in the United States that retains techniques that have been removed from mainstream IJF rules. Freestyle Judo is currently backed by the International Freestyle Judo Alliance (IFJA). The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) officially sanctions Freestyle Judo in the United States of America.\nGeorgian Judo.\nGeorgian Judo is influenced by Chidaoba (Georgian cultural jacket wrestling). Chidaoba's major influence on the Georgian style of judo is in its unorthodox grips as well as its throws and takedowns. Georgian Judo is also known for its countering techniques through the use of power moves such as bear hugs and double underhooks into throws and takedowns. It is represented by various olympic winners and World Champions, such as Lasha Bekauri, Lukhumi Chkhvimiani, Shota Chochishvili, Tato Grigalashvili, Zaza Kedelashvili, David Khakhaleishvili, Luka Maisuradze,Lasha Shavdatuashvili and others.\nRussian Judo.\nThis distinctive style of judo was influenced by the Soviet martial art of Sambo. It is represented by well-known coaches such as Alexander Retuinskih and Igor Yakimov, and mixed martial arts fighters such as Fedor Emelianenko, Oleg Taktarov, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and Karo Parisyan. In turn, Russian judo has influenced mainstream judo, with techniques such as the flying armbar being accepted into Kodokan judo.\nMongolian Judo.\nUnlike other Far East styles of Judo, Mongolian Judo focuses much more on power rather than technique. The influence of Bokh on Mongolian Judo can be seen in its grips and body positioning. Judo grips such as the over under, double underhooks and the heavy use of grips on the belt. It is represented by various world champions, such as Khaliuny Boldbaatar, Tsendiin Damdin, Boldyn Gankhaich, Naidangiin T\u00fcvshinbayar, M\u00f6nkhbatyn Urantsetseg, Ganbatyn Boldbaatar.\nKorean Judo.\nKorean Judo is also very technical but what really separates it from other styles is the speed at which its techniques are performed. Korean Judo it is not powerful in terms of using strength but instead, the practitioners use speed, movement and technique in order to create fast and powerful snaps. This styles produced various olympic champions, like Ahn Byeong-keun, Cho Min-sun, Choi Min-ho, Ha Hyung-joo, Jeon Ki-young, Kim Jae-bum, Kim Jae-yup, Lee Kyung-keun, Lee Won-hee, Song Dae-nam and others.\nFrench Judo.\nFrench Judo is based on tactical Kumi Kata and focuses on breaking the posture of the opponent as well as preventing opponents from attaining a proper grip. This style does not use a huge amount of power; it prefers to use technique, tactics and timing. Many French judo practitioners have become World and Olympic champions, like Clarisse Agbegnenou, \u00c9milie And\u00e9ol, Marc Alexandre, Djamel Bouras, Amandine Buchard, Guillaume Chaine, Axel Clerget, Sarah-L\u00e9onie Cysique, Lucie D\u00e9cosse, Romane Dicko, David Douillet, Catherine Fleury-Vachon, Alexandre Iddir and many others.\nCuban Judo.\nCuban Judo is characterized by an explosive and high athletic style that puts an emphasis on body conditioning and calculated planning mixed with raw power.\nIn terms of training the athletes use a particularly methodical and intellectual approach to the sport.\nAzerbaijani Judo.\nJudo in Azerbaijan has developed over the years and has become deep rooted and considered a top sport in the country.\nIt's very similar to Georgian Judo, as its mostly focused on the practitioner's strength during throws.\nIt's a hybrid of the original Kodokan Judo and the traditional Azerbaijan style of wrestling called Azeri, whose techniques consist of unorthodox grips and positioning during counter-attacks.\nIsraeli Judo.\nJudo has become a top sport in Israel only recently.\nIsraeli Judo is characterized by a particular emphasis on hip throws, which are executed with a mix of technique and aggression, with the practitioner having to adjust his sleeves before powerfully gripping and throwing the opponent away.\nSambo.\nSambo is influenced by judo combined with wrestling techniques, and striking in case of combat sambo. Vasili Oshchepkov was one of the first European judo black belts under Kano. Oshchepkov went on to contribute his knowledge of judo as one of the three founders of Sambo, which also integrated various international and Soviet bloc wrestling styles and other combative techniques. Oshchepkov was executed during the political purges of 1937 and judo was banned for decades until its inclusion in the 1964 Olympics, where sambists won 4 bronze medals. In their \"History of Sambo\", Brett Jacques and Scott Anderson wrote that in Russia \"judo and SOMBO were considered to be the same thing\"\u2014albeit with a different uniform and some differences in the rules.\nBrazilian jiu-jitsu.\nAn adoption of \"Kano jiu jitsu\" (a common name for judo at the time) in Brazil attributed to Mitsuyo Maeda's students, most notably the Gracie family. 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu and other wrestling-influenced systems without the gi have also become popular.\nOther styles.\nJudo also influenced other combat styles such as close-quarters combat (CQC), mixed martial arts (MMA), shoot wrestling and submission wrestling.\nSafety.\nKano's vision for judo was one of a martial way that could be practiced realistically. Randori (free practice) was a central part of judo pedagogy and shiai (competition) a crucial test of a judoka's understanding of judo. Safety necessitated some basic innovations that shaped judo's development. Atemi waza (striking techniques) were entirely limited to kata (prearranged forms) early in judo's history. Kansetsu waza (joint manipulation techniques) were limited to techniques that focused on the elbow joint. Various throwing techniques that were judged to be too dangerous to practice safely at full force, such as all joint-locking throws from Jujutsu, were also prohibited in shiai. To maximise safety in nage waza (throwing techniques), judoka trained in ukemi (break falls) and practiced on tatami (rice straw mats).\n\"Kansetsu\" and \"shime waza\".\nThe application of joint manipulation and strangulation/choking techniques is generally safe under controlled conditions typical of judo d\u014dj\u014d and in competition. It is usual for there to be age restrictions on the practice and application of these types of techniques, but the exact nature of these restrictions will vary from country to country and from organization to organization.\n\"Nage waza\".\nSafety in the practice of throwing techniques depends on the skill level of both tori and uke. Inexpertly applied throws have the potential to injure both tori and uke, for instance when tori compensates for poor technique by powering through the throw. Similarly, poor ukemi can result in injury, particularly from more powerful throws that uke lacks the skill to breakfall from. For these reasons, throws are normally taught in order of difficulty for both tori and uke. This is exemplified in the \"Gokyo\" , a traditional grouping of throws arranged in order of difficulty of ukemi. Those grouped in are relatively simple to breakfall from whereas those grouped in are difficult to breakfall from.\nMental training.\nMental training is an emerging modality of training in judo that aims to improve the performance of high-performance athletes in training and competition and also to promote health and well-being in the daily life of athletes and their entourage through the learning and application of psychological skills. The first publication of a judo-specific practical mental training approach based on sports training principles was in 2005 with the work of Boris Blumenstein, Ronnie Lidor and Gershon Tenenbaum. In 2022, Caio Gabriel published the first article on mental training that appeared in the scientific journal of the International Judo Federation, \"The Arts and Sciences of Judo\".\nJudoka (practitioner).\nA practitioner of judo is known as a . The modern meaning of \"judoka\" in English is a judo practitioner of any level of expertise, but traditionally those below the rank of 4th \"dan\" were called ; and only those of 4th \"dan\" or higher were called \"judoka\". (The suffix , when added to a noun, means a person with expertise or special knowledge on that subject).\nA judo teacher is called . Traditionally, that title was reserved for instructors of 4th \"dan\" and above.\nJudogi (uniform).\nJudo practitioners traditionally wear white uniforms called or sometimes abbreviated in the west as \"gi\". It comprises a heavy cotton kimono-like jacket called an , similar to traditional fastened by an , coloured to indicate rank, and cotton draw-string . Early examples of keikogi had short sleeves and trouser legs and the modern long-sleeved judogi was adopted in 1906.\nThe modern use of the blue judogi for high level competition was first suggested by Anton Geesink at the 1986 Maastricht IJF DC Meeting. For competition, a blue judogi is worn by one of the two competitors for ease of distinction by judges, referees, and spectators. In Japan, both judoka use a white judogi and the traditional red obi (based on the colors of the Japanese flag) is affixed to the belt of one competitor. Outside Japan, a colored obi may also be used for convenience in minor competitions, the blue judogi only being mandatory at the regional or higher levels, depending on organization. Japanese practitioners and traditionalists tend to look down on the use of blue because judo is considered a pure sport, and replacing the pure white judogi with the impure blue is an offense.\nFor events organized under the auspices of the International judo Federation (IJF), judogi have to bear the IJF Official Logo Mark Label. This label demonstrates that the judogi has passed a number of quality control tests to ensure it conforms to construction regulations ensuring it is not too stiff, flexible, rigid or slippery to allow the opponent to grip or to perform techniques.\nOrganizations.\nThe international governing body for judo is the International Judo Federation (IJF), founded in 1951. Members of the IJF include the African Judo Union (AJU), the Pan-American Judo Confederation (PJC), the Judo Union of Asia (JUA), the European Judo Union (EJU) and the Oceania Judo Union (OJU), each comprising a number of national judo associations. The IJF is responsible for organising international competition and hosts the World Judo Championships and is involved in running the Olympic Judo events.\nRank and grading.\nJudo is a hierarchical art, where seniority of judoka is designated by what is known as the - ranking system. This system was developed by Jigoro Kano and was based on the ranking system in the board game Go.\nBeginning students progress through kyu grades towards dan grades.\nA judoka's position within the kyu-dan ranking system is displayed by the color of their belt. Beginning students typically wear a white belt, progressing through descending numerical order kyu ranks until they are deemed to have achieved a level of competence sufficient to be a dan grade, at which point they wear the . The kyu-dan ranking system has since been widely adopted by modern martial arts.\nThe highest black belt ranks have no formal requirements and are decided by the president of the Kodokan. Kano Jigoro's grandson Kano Yukimitsu served as the fourth president from 1980 until 2009. As an educator by profession, Kan\u014d believed that there should be no end to an individual's learning, and therefore no limit to the number of dan ranks. As of 2011, fifteen Japanese men have been promoted to by the Kodokan; the IJF and Western and Asian national federations have promoted another eleven who are not recognized at that level of rank by the Kodokan. On 28 July 2011, the promotion board of USA Judo awarded Keiko Fukuda the rank of 10th \"dan\", who was the first woman to be promoted to judo's highest level, albeit not a Kodokan-recognized rank.\nAlthough \"dan\" ranks tend to be consistent between national organizations there is more variation in the \"ky\u016b\" grades, with some countries having more \"ky\u016b\" grades. Although initially \"ky\u016b\" grade belt colours were uniformly white, today a variety of colours are used. The first black belts to denote a dan rank in the 1880s, initially the wide obi was used; as practitioners trained in kimono, only white and black obi were used. It was not until the early 1900s, after the introduction of the judogi, that an expanded colored belt system of awarding rank was created. Written accounts from the archives of London's Budokwai judo club, founded in 1918, record the use of coloured judo belts at the 1926 9th annual Budokwai Display, and a list of ranked colored judokas appears in the Budokwai Committee Minutes of June 1927. Kawaishi visited London and the Budokwai in 1928, and was probably inspired to bring the coloured belt system to France.\nWorld Judo Day.\nOn October 28 of every year, the judo community celebrates the World Judo Day in the honor of the birth of Judo's founder, Jigoro Kano. The theme of the World Judo Day changes from year to year, but the goal is always to highlight the moral values of Judo. The first celebration was held in 2011. Past themes for the celebration have included:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, Anthony Horowitz and Charlie Higson. The latest novel is \"On His Majesty's Secret Service\" by Charlie Higson, published in May 2023. Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.\nThe character\u2014also known by the code number 007 (pronounced \"double-oh-seven\")\u2014has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strips, video games and film. The \"James Bond\" franchise is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The films constitute one of the longest continually running film series and have grossed over US$7.04\u00a0billion in total at the box office, making \"James Bond\" the fifth-highest-grossing film series to date. It started in 1962 with \"Dr. No\", starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2021[ [update]], there have been twenty-five films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, \"No Time to Die\" (2021), stars Daniel Craig in his fifth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent Bond film productions: \"Casino Royale\" (a 1967 spoof starring David Niven) and \"Never Say Never Again\" (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965's \"Thunderball\", both starring Connery). \"Casino Royale\" has also been adapted for television, as a one-hour show in 1954 as part of the CBS series \"Climax!\".\nThe Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including their soundtracks; three of the movies' theme songs have received Academy Awards and others have received nominations. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond's cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond's relationships with various women, who are popularly referred to as \"Bond girls\".\nPublication history.\nCreation and inspiration.\nIan Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of people he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division and 30 Assault Unit during the Second World War, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\". Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war. Aside from Fleming's brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond's make up, including Conrad O'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job, Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale and Du\u0161ko Popov.\nThe name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide \"Birds of the West Indies\". Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond's guide and he later explained to the ornithologist's wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\". He further explained that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument\u00a0... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.\u2014\u200a\nOn another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, 'James Bond' was much better than something more interesting, like 'Peregrine Carruthers'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure\u2014an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\"\nFleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself and in \"Casino Royale\", Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in \"Moonraker\", Special Branch officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking\u00a0... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\"\nFleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs, and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his career in espionage and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.\nIt was not until the penultimate novel, \"You Only Live Twice\", that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of \"Dr. No\" in cinemas, and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character, henceforth giving Bond both a dry sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories. In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in \"The Times\", Bond's parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, \"\", gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920, while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.\nNovels and related works.\nIan Fleming novels.\nWhilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author; he had told a friend, \"I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories.\" On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, \"Casino Royale\", at his Goldeneye estate in Oracabessa, Jamaica, where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year. He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.\nAfter completing the manuscript for \"Casino Royale\", Fleming showed it to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much. Cape finally published it in 1953 on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books\u2014\"The Man with the Golden Gun\" and \"Octopussy and The Living Daylights\"\u2014published posthumously. All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.\nPost-Fleming novels.\nAfter Fleming's death, a continuation novel, \"Colonel Sun\", was written by Kingsley Amis (as Robert Markham) and published in 1968. Amis had already written a literary study of Fleming's Bond novels in his 1965 work \"The James Bond Dossier\". Although novelisations of two of the Eon Productions Bond films appeared in print, \"James Bond, the Spy Who Loved Me\" and \"James Bond and Moonraker\", both written by screenwriter Christopher Wood, the series of novels did not continue until the 1980s. In 1981, the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with \"Licence Renewed\". Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote were novelisations of Eon Productions films of the same name: \"Licence to Kill\" and \"GoldenEye\". Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.\nIn 1996, the American author Raymond Benson became the author of the Bond novels. Benson had previously been the author of \"The James Bond Bedside Companion\", first published in 1984.\nBy the time he moved on to other, non-Bond related projects in 2002, Benson had written six Bond novels, three novelisations and three short stories.\nAfter a gap of six years, Sebastian Faulks was commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel, which was released on 28 May 2008, the 100th anniversary of Fleming's birth. The book\u2014titled \"Devil May Care\"\u2014was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US. American writer Jeffery Deaver was then commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to produce \"Carte Blanche\", which was published on 26 May 2011. The book turned Bond into a post-9/11 agent, independent of MI5 or MI6. On 26 September 2013, \"Solo\" by William Boyd, set in 1969, was published. In October 2014, it was announced that Anthony Horowitz was to write a \"Bond\" continuation novel. Set in the 1950s two weeks after the events of \"Goldfinger\", it contains material written, but previously unreleased, by Fleming. \"Trigger Mortis\" was released on 8 September 2015. Horowitz's second Bond novel, \"Forever and a Day\", tells the origin story of Bond as a 00 agent prior to the events of \"Casino Royale\". The novel, also based on unpublished material from Fleming, was released on 31 May 2018. Horowitz's third Bond novel, \"With a Mind to Kill\", was published on 26 May 2022. Charlie Higson's first adult Bond novel, \"On His Majesty's Secret Service\", was published on 4 May 2023 to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III and support the National Literacy Trust.\nYoung Bond.\nThe \"Young Bond\" series of novels was started by Charlie Higson and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published. The first Young Bond novel, \"SilverFin\" was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books. In October 2013 Ian Fleming Publications announced that Stephen Cole would continue the series, with the first edition scheduled to be released in Autumn 2014.\n\"The Moneypenny Diaries\".\n\"The Moneypenny Diaries\" are a trilogy of novels chronicling the life of Miss Moneypenny, M's personal secretary. The novels are written by Samantha Weinberg under the pseudonym Kate Westbrook, who is depicted as the book's \"editor\". The first instalment of the trilogy, subtitled ', was released on 10 October 2005 in the UK. A second volume, subtitled ' was released on 2 November 2006 in the UK, published by John Murray. A third volume, subtitled \"\" was released on 1 May 2008.\nAdaptations.\nTelevision.\nIn 1954, CBS paid Ian Fleming $1,000 ($ in 2024 dollars) to adapt his novel \"Casino Royale\" into a one-hour television adventure, \"Casino Royale\", as part of its \"Climax!\" series. The episode aired live on 21 October 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as \"Card Sense\" James Bond and Peter Lorre as Le Chiffre. The novel was adapted for American audiences to show Bond as an American agent working for \"Combined Intelligence\", while the character Felix Leiter\u2014American in the novel\u2014became British onscreen and was renamed Clarence Leiter.\nIn 1964 Roger Moore appeared as James Bond in an extended comedy sketch opposite Millicent Martin as Sonia Sekova in her ATV TV series \"Mainly Millicent\", which also makes reference to 007. It was written by Dick Hills and Sid Green. Undiscovered for several years, it reappeared as an extra in the DVD and Blu-ray release of \"Live and Let Die\".\nIn 1973, a BBC documentary \"Omnibus: The British Hero\" featured Christopher Cazenove playing a number of such title characters (e.g. Richard Hannay and Bulldog Drummond). The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from \"Goldfinger\"\u2014notably featuring 007 being threatened with the novel's circular saw, rather than the film's laser beam\u2014and \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\nIn 1991, a spin-off animated series, \"James Bond Jr.\", was produced with Corey Burton in the role of Bond's nephew, James Bond Jr.\nIn 2022, a reality competition show based on the franchise, \"\", was released on Amazon Prime Video.\nRadio.\nIn 1958, the novel \"Moonraker\" was adapted for broadcast on South African radio, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond. According to \"The Independent\", \"listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob's cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination\".\nThe BBC have adapted five of the Fleming novels for broadcast: in 1990 \"You Only Live Twice\" was adapted into a 90-minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with Michael Jayston playing James Bond. The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2011.\nOn 24 May 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of \"Dr. No\". The actor Toby Stephens, who played Bond villain Gustav Graves in the Eon Productions version of \"Die Another Day\", played Bond, while Dr. Julius No was played by David Suchet. Following its success, a second story was adapted and on 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast \"Goldfinger\" with Stephens again playing Bond. Sir Ian McKellen was Auric Goldfinger and Stephens' \"Die Another Day\" co-star Rosamund Pike played Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming's novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis. In 2012, the novel \"From Russia, with Love\" was dramatised for Radio 4; it featured a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond. In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond, in \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\", with Alfred Molina as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and Joanna Lumley (who appeared in the 1969 film adaptation) as Irma Bunt.\nComics.\nIn 1957, the \"Daily Express\" approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him \u00a31,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication. After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed. To aid the \"Daily Express\" in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming's 007 looked too \"outdated\" and \"pre-war\" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look. The first strip, \"Casino Royale\" was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958 and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.\nMost of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis's \"Colonel Sun\"; the works were written by Henry Gammidge or Jim Lawrence (except for the adaptation of \"Dr. No\" which was written by future Modesty Blaise creator Peter O'Donnell) with Yaroslav Horak replacing McClusky as artist in 1966. After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the \"Daily Express\" and \"Sunday Express\" until May 1977.\nSeveral comic book adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of \"Dr. No\"'s release in October 1962, a comic book adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the \"Classics Illustrated\" anthology series. It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its \"Showcase\" anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).\nWith the release of the 1981 film \"For Your Eyes Only\", Marvel Comics published a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film. When \"Octopussy\" was released in the cinemas in 1983, Marvel published an accompanying comic; Eclipse also produced a one-off comic for \"Licence to Kill\", although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used. New Bond stories were also drawn up and published from 1989 onwards through Marvel, Eclipse Comics, Dark Horse Comics and Dynamite Entertainment.\nFilms.\nEon Productions films.\nEon Productions, the company of Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli, released the first cinema adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel, \"Dr. No\" (1962), based on the eponymous 1958 novel and featuring Sean Connery as 007. Connery starred in a further four films before leaving the role after \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967), which was taken up by George Lazenby for \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\" (1969). Lazenby left the role after just one appearance and Connery was brought back for his last Eon-produced film \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\nRoger Moore was appointed to the role of 007 for \"Live and Let Die\" (1973). He played Bond a further six times over twelve years, before being replaced by Timothy Dalton for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon's productions of the Bond films, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond in \"GoldenEye\" (1995); he remained in the role for a total of four films through 2002. In 2006, Daniel Craig was given the role for \"Casino Royale\" (2006), which rebooted the series. Craig appeared for a total of five films. The series has grossed well over $7\u00a0billion to date, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film series.\nIn March 2022, Amazon purchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) for $8.5 billion, and the distribution rights to its library of films, including the James Bond movies. After creating the merged Amazon MGM Studios, the company became involved in developing the next theatrical iteration of the character. By February 2025, the studio paid an additional $1 billion to acquire creative control of the future of the franchise from producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson; with the duo officially retiring from their historical oversight career for James Bond feature films. As part of the deal, the family will receive a monetary \"Bond dividend\" for the foreseeable future. Amazon MGM commence the search for a studio executive to oversee the property (\u00e0 la Marvel Studios' Kevin Feige), while also determining the next respective director and star of the franchise. In March 2025, Amazon closed deals with Amy Pascal and David Heyman to take charge of the franchise and replace Broccoli and Wilson as producers on its next instalment. By June of the same year, Denis Villeneuve was announced as the director, from a script written by Steven Knight.\nNon-Eon films.\nIn 1967, \"Casino Royale\" was adapted into a parody Bond film starring David Niven as Sir James Bond and Ursula Andress as Vesper Lynd. Niven had been Fleming's preference for the role of Bond. The result of a court case in the High Court in London in 1963 allowed Kevin McClory to produce a remake of \"Thunderball\" titled \"Never Say Never Again\" in 1983. The film, produced by Jack Schwartzman's Taliafilm production company and starring Sean Connery as Bond, was not part of the Eon series of Bond films. In 1997, the Sony Corporation acquired all or some of McClory's rights in an undisclosed deal, which were then subsequently acquired by MGM, whilst on 4 December 1997, MGM announced that the company had purchased the rights to \"Never Say Never Again\" from Taliafilm. As of 2015[ [update]], Eon holds the full adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels.\nMusic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"\u00a0cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable.\"\n\u2014David Arnold\nThe \"James Bond Theme\" was written by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962's \"Dr. No\", although the actual authorship of the music has been a matter of controversy for many years. In 2001, Norman won \u00a330,000 in libel damages from \"The Sunday Times\" newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as \"bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll\u00a0... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes.\" Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films and had an uncredited contribution to \"Dr. No\" with his arrangement of the \"James Bond Theme\".\nA Bond film staple are the theme songs heard during their title sequences sung by well-known popular singers. Shirley Bassey performed three Bond theme songs, with her 1964 song \"Goldfinger\" inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008. Several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's \"Live and Let Die\", Carly Simon's \"Nobody Does It Better\", Sheena Easton's \"For Your Eyes Only\", Adele's \"Skyfall\", Sam Smith's \"Writing's on the Wall\", and Billie Eilish's \"No Time to Die\". Adele won the award at the 85th Academy Awards, Smith won at the 88th Academy Awards, and Eilish won at the 94th Academy Awards. For the non-Eon produced \"Casino Royale\", Burt Bacharach's score included \"The Look of Love\" (sung by Dusty Springfield), which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.\nVideo games.\nIn 1983, the first Bond video game \"James Bond 007\", developed and published by Parker Brothers, was released for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, and ColecoVision. Since then, there have been numerous video games either based on the films or using original storylines. In 1997, the first-person shooter video game \"GoldenEye 007\" was developed by Rare for the Nintendo 64, based on \"GoldenEye\". The game received highly positive reviews, won the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for UK Developer of the Year in 1998, and sold over eight million copies worldwide, grossing $250\u00a0million, making it the third-best-selling Nintendo 64 game. It is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.\nIn 1999, Electronic Arts acquired the licence and released \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" on 16 December 1999. In October 2000, they released \"The World Is Not Enough\" for the Nintendo 64 followed by \"007 Racing\" for the PlayStation on 21 November 2000. In 2003, the company released ', which included the likenesses and voices of Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Heidi Klum, Judi Dench and John Cleese, amongst others. In November 2005, Electronic Arts released a video game adaptation of ', which involved Sean Connery's image and voice-over for Bond. In 2006, Electronic Arts announced a game based on then-upcoming film \"Casino Royale\": the game was cancelled because it would not be ready by the film's release in November of that year. With MGM losing revenue from lost licensing fees, the franchise was moved from EA to Activision. Activision subsequently released the \"\" game on 31 October 2008, based on the film of the same name.\nA new version of \"GoldenEye 007\" featuring Daniel Craig was released for the Wii and a handheld version for the Nintendo DS in November 2010. A year later a new version was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 under the title \"GoldenEye 007: Reloaded\". In October 2012 \"007 Legends\" was released, which featured one mission from each of the Bond actors of the Eon Productions' series. In November 2020, IO Interactive announced a new original James Bond video game which was later titled \"First Light\". The studio worked closely with licensors MGM and Eon Productions.\nRole-playing game.\nFrom 1983 to 1987, a licensed tabletop role-playing game, \"James Bond 007: Role-Playing In Her Majesty's Secret Service\", was published by Victory Games (a branch of Avalon Hill) and designed by Gerard Christopher Klug. It was the most popular espionage role-playing game for its time. In addition to providing materials for players to create original scenarios, the game also offered players the opportunity to have adventures modelled after many of the Eon Productions film adaptations, albeit with modifications to provide challenges by preventing players from slavishly imitating Bond's actions in the stories.\nGuns, vehicles, skills and gadgets.\nGuns.\nFor the first five novels, Fleming armed Bond with a Beretta 418 until he received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, criticising Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond, calling it \"a lady's gun\u2014and not a very nice lady at that!\" Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a 7.65mm Walther PPK and this exchange of arms made it to \"Dr. No\". Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains. In thanks, Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer in his novels the name Major Boothroyd and, in \"Dr. No\", M, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, introduces him to Bond as \"the greatest small-arms expert in the world\". Bond also used a variety of rifles, including the Savage Model 99 in \"For Your Eyes Only\" and a Winchester .308 target rifle in \"The Living Daylights\". Other handguns used by Bond in the Fleming books included the Colt Detective Special and a long-barrelled Colt .45 Army Special.\nThe first Bond film, \"Dr. No\", saw M (Bernard Lee) ordering Bond (Sean Connery) to leave his Beretta behind and take up the Walther PPK, which Bond used in eighteen films. In \"Tomorrow Never Dies\" and the two subsequent films, Bond's main weapon was the Walther P99 semi-automatic pistol.\nVehicles.\nIn the early Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442 Litre with an Amherst Villiers supercharger. After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in \"Moonraker\", Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he used in the remaining books of the series. During \"Goldfinger\", Bond was issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.\nThe Bond of the films has driven a number of cars, including the Aston Martin V8 Vantage, during the 1980s, the V12 Vanquish and DBS during the 2000s, as well as the Lotus Esprit; the BMW Z3, BMW 750iL and the BMW Z8. He has, however, also needed to drive a number of other vehicles, ranging from a Citro\u00ebn 2CV to a Routemaster Bus, amongst others.\nBond's most famous car is the silver grey Aston Martin DB5, first seen in \"Goldfinger\"; it later featured in \"Thunderball\", \"GoldenEye\", \"Tomorrow Never Dies\", \"Casino Royale\", \"Skyfall\" and \"Spectre\". The films have used a number of different Aston Martins for filming and publicity, one of which was sold in January 2006 at an auction in the US for $2.1\u00a0million to an unnamed European collector. In 2010, another DB5 used in \"Goldfinger\" was sold at auction for $4.6m million (\u00a32.6\u00a0million).\nSkills.\nJames Bond possesses a diverse set of skills that contribute to his effectiveness as a secret agent:\nGadgets.\nFleming's novels and early screen adaptations presented minimal equipment such as the booby-trapped attach\u00e9 case in \"From Russia, with Love\", although this situation changed dramatically with the films. However, the effects of the two Eon-produced Bond films \"Dr. No\" and \"From Russia with Love\" had an effect on the novel \"The Man with the Golden Gun\", through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.\nFor the film adaptations of Bond, the pre-mission briefing by Q Branch became one of the motifs that ran through the series. \"Dr. No\" provided no spy-related gadgets, but a Geiger counter was used; industrial designer Andy Davey observed that the first ever onscreen spy-gadget was the attach\u00e9 case shown in \"From Russia with Love\", which he described as \"a classic 007 product\". The gadgets assumed a higher profile in the 1964 film \"Goldfinger\". The film's success encouraged further espionage equipment from Q Branch to be supplied to Bond, although the increased use of technology led to an accusation that Bond was over-reliant on equipment, particularly in the later films.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"If it hadn't been for Q Branch, you'd have been dead long ago!\"\n\u2014Q, to Bond, \"Licence to Kill\"\nDavey noted that \"Bond's gizmos follow the zeitgeist more closely than any other\u00a0... nuance in the films\" as they moved from the potential representations of the future in the early films, through to the brand-name obsessions of the later films. It is also noticeable that, although Bond uses a number of pieces of equipment from Q Branch, including the Little Nellie autogyro, a jet pack and the exploding attach\u00e9 case, the villains are also well-equipped with custom-made devices, including Francisco Scaramanga (Chistopher Lee)'s golden gun, Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya)'s poison-tipped shoes, Oddjob (Harold Sakata)'s steel-rimmed bowler hat and Blofeld (Telly Savalas)'s communication devices in his agents' vanity case.\nCultural impact.\nCinematically, Bond has been a major influence within the spy genre since the release of \"Dr. No\" in 1962, with 22 secret agent films released in 1966 alone attempting to capitalise on the Bond franchise's popularity and success. The first parody was the 1964 film \"Carry On Spying\", which shows the villain Dr. Crow (Judith Furse) being overcome by agents who included James Bind (Charles Hawtry) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor). One of the films that reacted against the portrayal of Bond was the Harry Palmer series, whose first film, \"The Ipcress File\", starring Michael Caine, was released in 1965. The eponymous hero is a rough-edged, petty crook turned spy, and was what academic Jeremy Packer called an \"anti-Bond\", or what Christoph Lindner calls \"the thinking man's Bond\". The Palmer series were produced by Harry Saltzman, who also used key crew members from the Bond series, including designer Ken Adam, editor Peter R. Hunt and composer John Barry. The four Matt Helm films starring Dean Martin (released between 1966 and 1969), the Flint series starring James Coburn (comprising two films, one each in 1966 and 1967), while \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" also moved onto the cinema screen, with eight films released: all were testaments to Bond's prominence in popular culture. More recently, the \"Austin Powers\" series by writer, producer and comedian Mike Myers, and other parodies such as the \"Johnny English\" trilogy of films, have also used elements from or parodied the Bond films.\nFollowing the release of the film \"Dr. No\" in 1962, the line \"Bond\u00a0... James Bond\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers John Cork and Bruce Scivally said of the introduction in \"Dr. No\" that the \"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\". In 2001, it was voted as the \"best-loved one-liner in cinema\" by British cinema goers, and in 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series. A 2024 survey by online investment advisor and digital wealth management company MoneyFarm found that 70 per cent of Brits said they associated the word \"bond\" with James Bond, rather than the savings product of the same name.\nThe 2005 American Film Institute's 100 Years series recognised the character of James Bond himself as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number 11 on a similar list by \"Empire\" and as the fifth greatest movie character of all time by \"Premiere\". In 1965, \"Time\" magazine observed \"James Bond has developed into the biggest mass-cult hero of the decade\".\nThe 25 James Bond films produced by Eon are the longest continually running film series of all time, and including the two non Eon produced films, the 27 Bond films have grossed over $7.04\u00a0billion in total, making it the sixth-highest-grossing franchise to date. It is estimated that since \"Dr. No\", a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of the Bond series of films to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as they \"form the backbone of the industry\".\nTelevision also saw the effect of Bond films, with the NBC series \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", which was described as the \"first network television imitation\" of Bond, largely because Fleming provided advice and ideas on the development of the series, even giving the main character played by Robert Vaughn the name Napoleon Solo. Other 1960s television series inspired by Bond include \"I Spy\", and \"Get Smart\".\nConsidered a British cultural icon, James Bond had become such a symbol of the United Kingdom that the character, played by Craig, appeared in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics as Queen Elizabeth II's escort. From 1968 to 2003, and since 2016, the Cadbury chocolate box Milk Tray has been advertised by the 'Milk Tray Man', a tough James Bond\u2013style figure who undertakes daunting 'raids' to surreptitiously deliver a box of Milk Tray chocolates to a lady. Bond has been commemorated numerous times on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail, most recently in their March 2020 series to mark the 25th Bond film release. \nThroughout the life of the film series, a number of tie-in products have been released. \"Bondmania\", a term deriving from the adjacent \"Beatlemania\" and initiated in 1964 following the enormous success of \"Goldfinger\", described the clamour for Bond films and their related products, from soundtrack LPs to children's toys, board games, alarm clocks playing the Bond theme, and 007-branded shirts. In 2018, a James Bond museum opened atop the Austrian Alps. The futuristic museum is constructed on the summit of Gaislachkogl Mountain in S\u00f6lden at 10,000\u00a0ft (3,048\u00a0m) above sea level.\nThe real MI6 has an ambiguous relationship with Bond. The films may attract job applicants who may be unsuited for espionage, while dissuading more-qualified candidates. While serving as Chief of SIS, Alex Younger said that were Bond to apply for an MI6 job \"he would have to change his ways\". Younger said, however, that the franchise had \"created a powerful brand for MI6 ... Many of our counterparts envy the sheer global recognition of our acronym\", and that being depicted to global audiences as a \"ubiquitous intelligence presence\" was \"quite a force multiplier\". The Russian Federal Security Service so envied Bond that it created an annual award for fictional depictions of Russian spies.\nPublic reception.\nThe James Bond franchise enjoys widespread popularity across the world. In 2014, it was estimated that approximately 20% of the world's population has watched at least one Bond film.\nIn 2012, the polling organisation YouGov conducted a survey of American Bond fans, categorising responses by age, sex and political affiliation. All groups selected Sean Connery as their favourite Bond actor. A 2018 poll found that 47% of American adults had seen at least one Bond film, with 27% having seen every film.\nQueen Elizabeth II met the first six actors to play James Bond on the screen. She met Connery at the world premiere of \"You Only Live Twice\" in 1967, and, according to the royal biographer Gyles Brandreth: \"She really did love all the early James Bond films\", preferring the earlier films, \"before they got so loud\". Several prominent politicians have also been fans of the franchise, including John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Kim Jong Il.\nCriticisms.\nThe James Bond character and related media have received a number of criticisms and reactions across the political spectrum, and are still highly debated in popular culture studies. Some observers accuse the Bond novels and films of misogyny and sexism. In September 2021, \"No Time to Die\" director Cary Fukunaga described Sean Connery's version of Bond as 'basically a rapist'. The franchise has on occasion also been a target of religious criticism. In 1962, Vatican City's official newspaper \"L'Osservatore Romano\" condemned the film \"Dr. No\", referring to it as \"a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex\". However, in 2012, the newspaper went on to give positive reviews to the film \"Skyfall\".\nGeographers have considered the role of exotic locations in the movies in the dynamics of the Cold War, with power struggles among blocs playing out in the peripheral areas. Other critics claim that the Bond films reflect imperial nostalgia.\nCensorship and alterations.\nBans and censorship by country.\nSeveral James Bond novels, films, and video games have been banned, censored, or altered in several countries. \n2023 changes.\nIn February 2023, Ian Fleming Publications (which administers all Fleming's literary works), edited the Bond series as part of a sensitivity review. The April 2023 re-releases of the series are planned to tie into the 70th anniversary of \"Casino Royale\". The new editions remove a number of references to race, including some slurs, along with some disparagements of women and homosexuality. They include a disclaimer added at the beginning of each book, reading:\nThis book was written at a time when terms and attitudes which might be considered offensive by modern readers were commonplace. A number of updates have been made in this edition, while keeping as close as possible to the original text and the period in which it is set. \nThe decision was met with strong criticism by media outlets and public commentators, who condemned the changes as literary censorship. \"The View\" host Whoopi Goldberg expressed her opposition, arguing that offensive historical literature should be left unaltered; while \"National Review\" contributors Charles C. W. Cooke and Douglas Murray attacked the changes as excessive political correctness. Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett also opposed the changes, writing that \"what an author commits to paper is sacrosanct and shouldn't be altered...The only changes to the text should come from the author.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has around 123 million speakers, primarily in Japan, the only country where it is the national language, and within the Japanese diaspora worldwide.\nThe Japonic family also includes the Ryukyuan languages and the variously classified Hachij\u014d language. There have been many attempts to group the Japonic languages with other families such as Ainu, Austronesian, Koreanic, and the now discredited Altaic, but none of these proposals have gained any widespread acceptance.\nLittle is known of the language's prehistory, or when it first appeared in Japan. Chinese documents from the 3rd century AD recorded a few Japanese words, but substantial Old Japanese texts did not appear until the 8th century. From the Heian period (794\u20131185), extensive waves of Sino-Japanese vocabulary entered the language, affecting the phonology of Early Middle Japanese. Late Middle Japanese (1185\u20131600) saw extensive grammatical changes and the first appearance of European loanwords. The basis of the standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo region (modern Tokyo) in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th century\u2013mid 19th century). Following the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly, and words from English roots have proliferated.\nJapanese is an agglutinative, mora-timed language with relatively simple phonotactics, a pure vowel system, phonemic vowel and consonant length, and a lexically significant pitch-accent. Word order is normally subject\u2013object\u2013verb with particles marking the grammatical function of words, and sentence structure is topic\u2013comment. Sentence-final particles are used to add emotional or emphatic impact, or form questions. Nouns have no grammatical number or gender, and there are no articles. Verbs are conjugated, primarily for tense and voice, but not person. Japanese adjectives are also conjugated. Japanese has a complex system of honorifics, with verb forms and vocabulary to indicate the relative status of the speaker, the listener, and persons mentioned.\nThe Japanese writing system combines Chinese characters, known as , with two unique syllabaries (or moraic scripts) derived by the Japanese from the more complex Chinese characters: ( or , 'simple characters') and ( or , 'partial characters'). Latin script ( ) is also used in a limited fashion (such as for imported acronyms) in Japanese writing. The numeral system uses mostly Arabic numerals, but also traditional Chinese numerals.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nProto-Japonic, the common ancestor of the Japanese and Ryukyuan languages, is thought to have been brought to Japan by settlers coming from the Korean peninsula sometime in the early- to mid-4th century BC (the Yayoi period), replacing the languages of the original J\u014dmon inhabitants, including the ancestor of the modern Ainu language. Because writing had yet to be introduced from China, there is no direct evidence, and anything that can be discerned about this period must be based on internal reconstruction from Old Japanese, or comparison with the Ryukyuan languages and Japanese dialects.\nOld Japanese.\nThe Chinese writing system was imported to Japan from Baekje around the start of the fifth century, alongside Buddhism. The earliest texts were written in Classical Chinese, although some of these were likely intended to be read as Japanese using the method, and show influences of Japanese grammar such as Japanese word order. The earliest text, the , dates to the early eighth century, and was written entirely in Chinese characters, which are used to represent, at different times, Chinese, \"kanbun\", and Old Japanese. As in other texts from this period, the Old Japanese sections are written in Man'y\u014dgana, which uses \"kanji\" for their phonetic as well as semantic values.\nBased on the Man'y\u014dgana system, Old Japanese can be reconstructed as having 88 distinct morae. Texts written with Man'y\u014dgana use two different sets of \"kanji\" for each of the morae now pronounced , , , , , , , , , , , and . (The has 88, but all later texts have 87. The distinction between mo1 and mo2 apparently was lost immediately following its composition.) This set of morae shrank to 67 in Early Middle Japanese, though some were added through Chinese influence. Man'y\u014dgana also has a symbol for , which merges with before the end of the period.\nSeveral fossilizations of Old Japanese grammatical elements remain in the modern language \u2013 the genitive particle \"tsu\" (superseded by modern \"no\") is preserved in words such as \"matsuge\" (\"eyelash\", lit. \"hair of the eye\"); modern \"mieru\" (\"to be visible\") and \"kikoeru\" (\"to be audible\") retain a mediopassive suffix -\"yu(ru)\" (\"kikoyu\" \u2192 \"kikoyuru\" (the attributive form, which slowly replaced the plain form starting in the late Heian period) \u2192 \"kikoeru\" (all verbs with the \"shimo-nidan\" conjugation pattern underwent this same shift in Early Modern Japanese)); and the genitive particle \"ga\" remains in intentionally archaic speech.\nEarly Middle Japanese.\nEarly Middle Japanese is the Japanese of the Heian period, from 794 to 1185. It formed the basis for the literary standard of Classical Japanese, which remained in common use until the early 20th century.\nDuring this time, Japanese underwent numerous phonological developments, in many cases instigated by an influx of Chinese loanwords. These included phonemic length distinction for both consonants and vowels, palatal consonants (e.g. \"kya\") and labial consonant clusters (e.g. \"kwa\"), and closed syllables. This changed Japanese into a mora-timed language.\nLate Middle Japanese.\nLate Middle Japanese covers the years from 1185 to 1600, and is normally divided into two sections, roughly equivalent to the Kamakura period and the Muromachi period, respectively. The later forms of Late Middle Japanese are the first to be described by non-native sources, in this case the Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries; and thus there is better documentation of Late Middle Japanese phonology than for previous forms (for instance, the \"Arte da Lingoa de Iapam\"). Among other sound changes, the sequence merges to , in contrast with ; is reintroduced from Chinese; and merges with . Some forms rather more familiar to Modern Japanese speakers begin to appear \u2013 the continuative ending -\"te\" begins to reduce onto the verb (e.g. \"yonde\" for earlier \"yomite\"), the -k- in the final mora of adjectives drops out (\"shiroi\" for earlier \"shiroki\"); and some forms exist where modern standard Japanese has retained the earlier form (e.g. \"hayaku\" &gt; \"hayau\" &gt; \"hay\u0254\u0254\", where modern Japanese just has \"hayaku\", though the alternative form is preserved in the standard greeting \"o-hay\u014d gozaimasu\" \"good morning\"; this ending is also seen in \"o-medet\u014d\" \"congratulations\", from \"medetaku\").\nLate Middle Japanese has the first loanwords from European languages \u2013 now-common words borrowed into Japanese in this period include \"pan\" (\"bread\") and \"tabako\" (\"tobacco\", now \"cigarette\"), both from Portuguese.\nModern Japanese.\nModern Japanese is considered to begin with the Edo period (which spanned from 1603 to 1867). Since Old Japanese, the \"de facto\" standard Japanese had been the Kansai dialect, especially that of Kyoto. However, during the Edo period, Edo (now Tokyo) developed into the largest city in Japan, and the Edo-area dialect became standard Japanese. Since the end of Japan's self-imposed isolation in 1853, the flow of loanwords from European languages has increased significantly. The period since 1945 has seen many words borrowed from other languages\u2014such as German (e.g. 'temporary job', 'vaccine'), Portuguese ( 'sponge cake') and English. Many English loan words especially relate to technology\u2014for example, 'personal computer', 'internet', and 'camera'. Due to the large quantity of English loanwords, modern Japanese has developed a distinction between and , and and , with the latter in each pair only found in loanwords, e.g. for party or for Disney.\nGeographic distribution.\nAlthough Japanese is spoken almost exclusively in Japan, it has also been spoken outside of the country. Before and during World War II, through Japanese annexation of Taiwan and Korea, as well as partial occupation of China, the Philippines, and various Pacific islands, locals in those countries learned Japanese as the language of the empire. As a result, many elderly people in these countries can still speak Japanese.\nJapanese emigrant communities (the largest of which are to be found in Brazil, with 1.4 million to 1.5 million Japanese immigrants and descendants, according to Brazilian IBGE data, more than the 1.2 million of the United States) sometimes employ Japanese as their primary language. Approximately 12% of Hawaii residents speak Japanese, with an estimated 12.6% of the population of Japanese ancestry in 2008. Japanese emigrants can also be found in Peru, Argentina, Australia (especially in the eastern states), Canada (especially in Vancouver, where 1.4% of the population has Japanese ancestry), the United States (notably in Hawaii, where 16.7% of the population has Japanese ancestry, and California), and the Philippines (particularly in Davao Region and the Province of Laguna).\nOfficial status.\nJapanese has no official status in Japan, but is the \"de facto\" national language of the country. There is a form of the language considered standard: , meaning 'standard Japanese', or , 'common language', or even 'Tokyo dialect' at times. The meanings of the two terms (hy\u014djungo and ky\u014dts\u016bgo) are almost the same. \"Hy\u014djungo\" or \"ky\u014dts\u016bgo\" is a conception that forms the counterpart of dialect. This normative language was born after the from the language spoken in the higher-class areas of Tokyo (see Yamanote). \"Hy\u014djungo\" is taught in schools and used on television and in official communications. It is the version of Japanese discussed in this article.\n used in formal texts, is different compared to the , used in everyday speech. The two systems have different rules of grammar and some variance in vocabulary. \"Bungo\" was the main method of writing Japanese until about 1900; since then \"k\u014dgo\" gradually extended its influence and the two methods were both used in writing until the 1940s. \"Bungo\" still has some relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived World War\u00a0II are still written in \"bungo\", although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). \"K\u014dgo\" is the dominant method of both speaking and writing Japanese today, although \"bungo\" grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect.\nJapanese is, along with Palauan and English, an official language of Angaur, Palau according to the 1982 state constitution. At the time it was written, many of the elders participating in the process had been educated in Japanese during the South Seas Mandate over the island, as shown by the 1958 census of the Trust Territory of the Pacific which found that 89% of Palauans born between 1914 and 1933 could speak and read Japanese. However, as of the 2005 Palau census, no residents of Angaur were reported to speak Japanese at home.\nDialects and mutual intelligibility.\nJapanese dialects typically differ in terms of pitch accent, inflectional morphology, vocabulary, and particle usage. Some even differ in vowel and consonant inventories, although this is less common.\nIn terms of mutual intelligibility, a survey in 1967 found that the four most unintelligible dialects (excluding Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages and T\u014dhoku dialects) to students from Greater Tokyo were the Kiso dialect (in the deep mountains of Nagano Prefecture), the Himi dialect (in Toyama Prefecture), the Kagoshima dialect and the Maniwa dialect (in Okayama Prefecture). The survey was based on 12- to 20-second-long recordings of 135 to 244 phonemes, which 42 students listened to and translated word-for-word. The listeners were all Keio University students who grew up in the Kant\u014d region.\nThere are some language islands in mountain villages or isolated islands such as Hachij\u014d-jima island, whose dialects are descended from Eastern Old Japanese. Dialects of the Kansai region are spoken or known by many Japanese, and Osaka dialect in particular is associated with comedy (see Kansai dialect). Dialects of T\u014dhoku and North Kant\u014d are associated with typical farmers.\nThe Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages, spoken in Okinawa and the Amami Islands (administratively part of Kagoshima), are distinct enough to be considered a separate branch of the Japonic family; not only is each language unintelligible to Japanese speakers, but most are unintelligible to those who speak other Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages. However, in contrast to linguists, many ordinary Japanese people tend to consider the Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages as dialects of Japanese.\nThe imperial court also seems to have spoken an unusual variant of the Japanese of the time, most likely the spoken form of Classical Japanese, a writing style that was prevalent during the Heian period, but began to decline during the late Meiji period. The Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages are classified by UNESCO as 'endangered', as young people mostly use Japanese and cannot understand the languages. Okinawan Japanese is a variant of Standard Japanese influenced by the Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages, and is the primary dialect spoken among young people in the Ryukyu Islands.\nModern Japanese has become prevalent nationwide (including the Ry\u016bky\u016b islands) due to education, mass media, and an increase in mobility within Japan, as well as economic integration.\nClassification.\nJapanese is a member of the Japonic language family, which also includes the Ryukyuan languages spoken in the Ryukyu Islands. As these closely related languages are commonly treated as dialects of the same language, Japanese is sometimes called a language isolate.\nAccording to Martine Robbeets, Japanese has been subject to more attempts to show its relation to other languages than any other language in the world. Since Japanese first gained the consideration of linguists in the late 19th century, attempts have been made to show its genealogical relation to languages or language families such as Ainu, Korean, Chinese, Tibeto-Burman, Uralic, Altaic (or Ural-Altaic), Austroasiatic, Austronesian and Dravidian. At the fringe, some linguists have even suggested a link to Indo-European languages, including Greek, or to Sumerian. Main modern theories try to link Japanese either to northern Asian languages, like Korean or the proposed larger Altaic family, or to various Southeast Asian languages, especially Austronesian. None of these proposals have gained wide acceptance (and the Altaic family itself is now considered controversial). As it stands, only the link to Ryukyuan has wide support.\nOther theories view the Japanese language as an early creole language formed through inputs from at least two distinct language groups, or as a distinct language of its own that has absorbed various aspects from neighboring languages.\nPhonology.\nVowels.\nJapanese has five vowels, and vowel length is phonemic, with each having both a short and a long version. Elongated vowels are usually denoted with a line over the vowel (a macron) in r\u014dmaji, a repeated vowel character in hiragana, or a ch\u014donpu succeeding the vowel in katakana. () is compressed rather than protruded, or simply unrounded.\nConsonants.\nSome Japanese consonants have several allophones, which may give the impression of a larger inventory of sounds. However, some of these allophones have since become phonemic. For example, in the Japanese language up to and including the first half of the 20th century, the phonemic sequence was palatalized and realized phonetically as , approximately (); however, now and are distinct, as evidenced by words like \"Western-style tea\" and \"social status\".\nThe \"r\" of the Japanese language is of particular interest, ranging between an apical central tap and a lateral approximant. The \"g\" is also notable; unless it starts a sentence, it may be pronounced , in the Kanto prestige dialect and in other eastern dialects.\nThe phonotactics of Japanese are relatively simple. The syllable structure is (C)(G)V(C), that is, a core vowel surrounded by an optional onset consonant, a glide and either the first part of a geminate consonant (/, represented as Q) or a moraic nasal in the coda (/, represented as N).\nThe nasal is sensitive to its phonetic environment and assimilates to the following phoneme, with pronunciations including . Onset-glide clusters only occur at the start of syllables but clusters across syllables are allowed as long as the two consonants are the moraic nasal followed by a homorganic consonant.\nJapanese also includes a pitch accent, which is not represented in moraic writing; for example (\"chopsticks\") and (\"bridge\") are both spelled , and are only differentiated by the tone contour. However, Japanese is not a tonal language.\nWriting system.\nHistory.\nLiteracy was introduced to Japan in the form of the Chinese writing system, by way of Baekje before the 5th century AD. Using this script, the Japanese king Bu presented a petition to Emperor Shun of Song in AD 478. After the ruin of Baekje, Japan invited scholars from China to learn more of the Chinese writing system. Japanese emperors gave an official rank to Chinese scholars (/) and spread the use of Chinese characters during the 7th and 8th centuries.\nAt first, the Japanese wrote in Classical Chinese, with Japanese names represented by characters used for their meanings and not their sounds. Later, during the 7th century AD, the Chinese-sounding phoneme principle was used to write pure Japanese poetry and prose, but some Japanese words were still written with characters for their meaning and not the original Chinese sound. This was the beginning of Japanese as a written language in its own right. By this time, the Japanese language was already very distinct from the Ryukyuan languages.\nAn example of this mixed style is the , which was written in AD 712. Japanese writers then started to use Chinese characters to write Japanese in a style known as \"man'y\u014dgana\", a syllabic script which used Chinese characters for their sounds in order to transcribe the words of Japanese speech mora by mora.\nOver time, a writing system evolved. Chinese characters (kanji) were used to write either words borrowed from Chinese, or Japanese words with the same or similar meanings. Chinese characters were also used to write grammatical elements; these were simplified, and eventually became two moraic scripts: hiragana and katakana which were developed based on Man'y\u014dgana. Some scholars claim that Manyogana originated from Baekje, but this hypothesis is denied by mainstream Japanese scholars.\nHiragana and katakana were first simplified from kanji, and hiragana, emerging somewhere around the 9th century, was mainly used by women. Hiragana was seen as an informal language, whereas katakana and kanji were considered more formal and were typically used by men and in official settings. However, because of hiragana's accessibility, more and more people began using it. Eventually, by the 10th century, hiragana was used by everyone.\nModern Japanese is written in a mixture of three main systems: kanji, characters of Chinese origin used to represent both Chinese loanwords into Japanese and a number of native Japanese morphemes; and two syllabaries: hiragana and katakana. The Latin script (or \"r\u014dmaji\" in Japanese) is used to a certain extent, such as for imported acronyms and to transcribe Japanese names and in other instances where non-Japanese speakers need to know how to pronounce a word (such as \"ramen\" at a restaurant). Arabic numerals are much more common than the kanji numerals when used in counting, but kanji numerals are still used in compounds, such as .\nHistorically, attempts to limit the number of kanji in use commenced in the mid-19th century, but government did not intervene until after Japan's defeat in the Second World War. During the post-war occupation (and influenced by the views of some U.S. officials), various schemes including the complete abolition of kanji and exclusive use of r\u014dmaji were considered. The \"j\u014dy\u014d kanji\" (\"common use kanji\"), originally called \"t\u014dy\u014d kanji\" (kanji for general use) scheme arose as a compromise solution.\nJapanese students begin to learn kanji from their first year at elementary school. A guideline created by the Japanese Ministry of Education, the list of \"ky\u014diku kanji\" (\"education kanji\", a subset of \"j\u014dy\u014d kanji\"), specifies the 1,006 simple characters a child is to learn by the end of sixth grade. Children continue to study another 1,130 characters in junior high school, covering in total 2,136 \"j\u014dy\u014d kanji\". The official list of \"j\u014dy\u014d kanji\" has been revised several times, but the total number of officially sanctioned characters has remained largely unchanged.\nAs for kanji for personal names, the circumstances are somewhat complicated. \"J\u014dy\u014d kanji\" and \"jinmeiy\u014d kanji\" (an appendix of additional characters for names) are approved for registering personal names. Names containing unapproved characters are denied registration. However, as with the list of \"j\u014dy\u014d kanji\", criteria for inclusion were often arbitrary and led to many common and popular characters being disapproved for use. Under popular pressure and following a court decision holding the exclusion of common characters unlawful, the list of \"jinmeiy\u014d kanji\" was substantially extended from 92 in 1951 (the year it was first decreed) to 983 in 2004. Furthermore, families whose names are not on these lists were permitted to continue using the older forms.\nHiragana.\n\"Hiragana\" are used for words without kanji representation, for words no longer written in kanji, for replacement of rare kanji that may be unfamiliar to intended readers, and also following kanji to show conjugational endings. Because of the way verbs (and adjectives) in Japanese are conjugated, kanji alone cannot fully convey Japanese tense and mood, as kanji cannot be subject to variation when written without losing their meaning. For this reason, hiragana are appended to kanji to show verb and adjective conjugations. Hiragana used in this way are called okurigana. Hiragana can also be written in a superscript called furigana above or beside a kanji to show the proper reading. This is done to facilitate learning, as well as to clarify particularly old or obscure (or sometimes invented) readings.\nKatakana.\n\"Katakana\", like hiragana, constitute a syllabary; katakana are primarily used to write foreign words, plant and animal names, and for emphasis. For example, \"Australia\" has been adapted as , and \"supermarket\" has been adapted and shortened into .\nGrammar.\nSentence structure.\nJapanese word order is classified as subject\u2013object\u2013verb. Unlike many Indo-European languages, the only strict rule of word order is that the verb must be placed at the end of a sentence (possibly followed by sentence-end particles). This is because Japanese sentence elements are marked with particles that identify their grammatical functions.\nThe basic sentence structure is topic\u2013comment. Once the topic has been stated using the particle , it is normally omitted in subsequent sentences, and the next use of \"wa\" will change the topic. For instance, someone may begin a conversation with a sentence that includes . Each person may say a number of comments regarding Tanaka as the topic, and someone could change the topic to Naoko with a sentence including .\nAs these example translations illustrate, a sentence may include a topic, but the topic is not part of sentence's core statement. Japanese is often called a topic-prominent language because of its strong tendency to indicate the topic separately from the subject, and the two do not always coincide. That is, a sentence might not involve the topic directly at all. To replicate this effect in English, consider \"As for Naoko, people are rude.\" The topic, \"Naoko,\" provides context to the comment about the subject, \"people,\" and the sentence as a whole indicates that \"people are rude\" is a statement relevant to Naoko. However, the sentence's comment does not describe Naoko directly at all, and whatever the sentence indicates about Naoko is an inference. The topic is not the core of the sentence; the core of the sentence is always the comment.\nIn a basic comment, the subject is marked with the particle , and the rest of the comment describes the subject. For example, in , \"ga\" indicates that \"elephant\" is the subject of the sentence. Context determines whether the speaker means a single elephant or elephants plural. The copula ends the sentence, indicating that the subject is equivalent to the rest of the comment. Here, \"doubutsu\" means \"animal\". Therefore, the sentence means \"[The] elephant is [an] animal\" or \"Elephants are animals.\" A basic comment can end in three ways: with the copula \"da\", with a different verb, or with an adjective ending in the kana . A sentence ending might also be decorated with particles that alter the way the sentence is meant to be interpreted, as in . This is also why \"da\" is replaced with when the speaker is talking to someone they do not know well: it makes the sentence more polite.\nOften, \"ga\" implies distinction of the subject within the topic, so the previous example comment would make the most sense within a topic where not all of the relevant subjects were animals. For example, in , the particle \"wa\" indicates the topic is \"kono ganbutsu\" (\"this toy\" or \"these toys\"). In English, if there are many toys and one is an elephant, this could mean \"Among these toys, [the] elephant is [an] animal.\" That said, if the subject is clearly a subtopic, this differentiation effect may or may not be relevant, such as in . The equivalent sentence, \"As for the Japanese language, grammar is easy,\" might be a general statement that Japanese grammar is easy or a statement that grammar is an especially easy feature of the Japanese language. Context should reveal which.\nBecause \"ga\" marks the subject of the sentence but the sentence overall is intended to be relevant to the topic indicated by \"wa\", translations of Japanese into English often elide the difference between these particles. For example, the phrase \"watashi wa zou ga suki da\" literally means \"As for myself, elephants are likeable.\" The sentence about myself describes elephants as having a likeable quality. From this, it is clear that I like elephants, and this sentence is often translated into English as \"I like elephants.\" However, to do so changes the subject of the sentence (from \"Elephant\" to \"I\") and the verb (from \"is\" to \"like\"); it does not reflect Japanese grammar.\nJapanese grammar tends toward brevity; the subject or object of a sentence need not be stated and pronouns may be omitted if they can be inferred from context. In the example above, \"zou ga doubutsu da\" would mean \"[the] elephant is [an] animal\", while \"doubutsu da\" by itself would mean \"[they] are animals.\" In especially casual speech, many speakers would omit the copula, leaving the noun \"doubutsu\" to mean \"[they are] animals.\" A single verb can be a complete sentence: . In addition, since adjectives can form the predicate in a Japanese sentence (below), a single adjective can be a complete sentence: ).\nNevertheless, unlike the topic, the subject is always implied: all sentences which omit a \"ga\" particle must have an implied subject that could be specified with a \"ga\" particle. For example, means \"As for this cat, [it] is Loki.\" An equivalent sentence might read , meaning \"As for this cat, this is Loki.\" However, in the same way it is unusual to state the subject twice in the English sentence, it is unusual to specify that redundant subject in Japanese. Rather than replace the redundant subject with a word like \"it,\" the redundant subject is omitted from the Japanese sentence. It is obvious from the context that the first sentence refers to the cat by the name \"Loki,\" and the explicit subject of the second sentence contributes no information.\nWhile the language has some words that are typically translated as pronouns, these are not used as frequently as pronouns in some Indo-European languages, and function differently. In some cases, Japanese relies on special verb forms and auxiliary verbs to indicate the direction of benefit of an action: \"down\" to indicate the out-group gives a benefit to the in-group, and \"up\" to indicate the in-group gives a benefit to the out-group. Here, the in-group includes the speaker and the out-group does not, and their boundary depends on context. For example, means \"[he/she/they] explained [it] to [me/us]\". Similarly, means \"[I/we] explained [it] to [him/her/them]\". Such beneficiary auxiliary verbs thus serve a function comparable to that of pronouns and prepositions in Indo-European languages to indicate the actor and the recipient of an action.\nJapanese \"pronouns\" also function differently from most modern Indo-European pronouns (and more like nouns) in that they can take modifiers as any other noun may. For instance, one does not say in English:\nThe amazed he ran down the street. (grammatically incorrect insertion of a pronoun)\nBut one \"can\" grammatically say essentially the same thing in Japanese:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nTransliteration: (grammatically correct)&lt;/poem&gt;\nThis is partly because these words evolved from regular nouns, such as \"you\" ( \"lord\"), \"you\" ( \"that side, yonder\"), and \"I\" ( \"servant\"). This is why some linguists do not classify Japanese \"pronouns\" as pronouns, but rather as referential nouns, much like Spanish (contracted from , \"your (majestic plural) grace\") or Portuguese (from ). Japanese personal pronouns are generally used only in situations requiring special emphasis as to who is doing what to whom.\nThe choice of words used as pronouns is correlated with the sex of the speaker and the social situation in which they are spoken: men and women alike in a formal situation generally refer to themselves as or (also , hyper-polite form), while men in rougher or intimate conversation are much more likely to use the word or \"boku\". Similarly, different words such as \"anata\", \"kimi\", and (, more formally \"the one before me\") may refer to a listener depending on the listener's relative social position and the degree of familiarity between the speaker and the listener. When used in different social relationships, the same word may have positive (intimate or respectful) or negative (distant or disrespectful) connotations.\nJapanese often use titles of the person referred to where pronouns would be used in English. For example, when speaking to one's teacher, it is appropriate to use , but inappropriate to use \"anata\". This is because \"anata\" is used to refer to people of equal or lower status, and one's teacher has higher status.\nInflection and conjugation.\nJapanese nouns have no grammatical number, gender or article aspect. The noun may refer to a single book or several books; can mean \"person\" or \"people\", and can be \"tree\" or \"trees\". Where number is important, it can be indicated by providing a quantity (often with a counter word) or (rarely) by adding a suffix, or sometimes by duplication (e.g. , , usually written with an iteration mark as ). Words for people are usually understood as singular. Thus \"Tanaka-san\" usually means \"Mx Tanaka\". Words that refer to people and animals can be made to indicate a group of individuals through the addition of a collective suffix (a noun suffix that indicates a group), such as \"-tachi\", but this is not a true plural: the meaning is closer to the English phrase \"and company\". A group described as \"Tanaka-san-tachi\" may include people not named Tanaka. Some Japanese nouns are effectively plural, such as \"hitobito\" \"people\" and \"wareware\" \"we/us\", while the word \"tomodachi\" \"friend\" is considered singular, although plural in form.\nVerbs are conjugated to show tenses, of which there are two: past and non-past, which is used for the present and the future. For verbs that represent an ongoing process, the \"-te iru\" form indicates a continuous (or progressive) aspect, similar to the suffix \"ing\" in English. For others that represent a change of state, the \"-te iru\" form indicates a perfect aspect. For example, \"kite iru\" means \"They have come (and are still here)\", but \"tabete iru\" means \"They are eating\".\nQuestions (both with an interrogative pronoun and yes/no questions) have the same structure as affirmative sentences, but with intonation rising at the end. In the formal register, the question particle \"-ka\" is added. For example, becomes . In a more informal tone sometimes the particle is added instead to show a personal interest of the speaker: \"D\u014dshite konai-no?\" \"Why aren't (you) coming?\". Some simple queries are formed simply by mentioning the topic with an interrogative intonation to call for the hearer's attention: \"Kore wa?\" \"(What about) this?\"; () \"(What's your) name?\".\nNegatives are formed by inflecting the verb. For example, becomes . Plain negative forms are \"i\"-adjectives (see below) and inflect as such, e.g. .\nThe so-called \"-te\" verb form is used for a variety of purposes: either progressive or perfect aspect (see above); combining verbs in a temporal sequence (\"Asagohan o tabete sugu dekakeru\" \"I'll eat breakfast and leave at once\"), simple commands, conditional statements and permissions (\"Dekakete-mo ii?\" \"May I go out?\"), etc.\nThe word \"da\" (plain), \"desu\" (polite) is the copula verb. It corresponds to the English verb \"is\" and marks tense when the verb is conjugated into its past form \"datta\" (plain), \"deshita\" (polite). This comes into use because only \"i\"-adjectives and verbs can carry tense in Japanese. Two additional common verbs are used to indicate existence (\"there is\") or, in some contexts, property: \"aru\" (negative \"nai\") and \"iru\" (negative \"inai\"), for inanimate and animate things, respectively. For example, \"Neko ga iru\" \"There's a cat\", \"Ii kangae-ga nai\" \"[I] haven't got a good idea\".\nThe verb \"to do\" (\"suru\", polite form \"shimasu\") is often used to make verbs from nouns (\"ry\u014dri suru\" \"to cook\", \"benky\u014d suru\" \"to study\", etc.) and has been productive in creating modern slang words. Japanese also has a huge number of compound verbs to express concepts that are described in English using a verb and an adverbial particle (e.g. \"tobidasu\" \"to fly out, to flee\", from \"tobu\" \"to fly, to jump\" + \"dasu\" \"to put out, to emit\").\nThere are three types of adjectives (see Japanese adjectives):\nBoth \"keiy\u014dshi\" and \"keiy\u014dd\u014dshi\" may predicate sentences. For example,\n&lt;poem&gt; \"The rice is hot.\"\n \"He's strange.\"&lt;/poem&gt;\nBoth inflect, though they do not show the full range of conjugation found in true verbs.\nThe \"rentaishi\" in Modern Japanese are few in number, and unlike the other words, are limited to directly modifying nouns. They never predicate sentences. Examples include \"ookina\" \"big\", \"kono\" \"this\", \"iwayuru\" \"so-called\" and \"taishita\" \"amazing\".\nBoth \"keiy\u014dd\u014dshi\" and \"keiy\u014dshi\" form adverbs, by following with \"ni\" in the case of \"keiy\u014dd\u014dshi\":\n \"become strange\",\nand by changing \"i\" to \"ku\" in the case of \"keiy\u014dshi\":\n \"become hot\".\nThe grammatical function of nouns is indicated by postpositions, also called particles. These include for example:\n \"He did it.\"\n \"What will (you) eat?\"\n \"Please give it to Mx Tanaka.\"\n It is also used for the lative case, indicating a motion to a location.\n \"I want to go to Japan.\"\n \"Won't you go to the party?\"\n \"my camera\"\n \"(I) like going skiing.\"\n (literally) \"As for me, sushi is good.\" The nominative marker \"ga\" after \"watashi\" is hidden under \"wa\".\nNote: The subtle difference between wa and ga in Japanese cannot be derived from the English language as such, because the distinction between sentence topic and subject is not made there. While \"wa\" indicates the topic, which the rest of the sentence describes or acts upon, it carries the implication that the subject indicated by \"wa\" is not unique, or may be part of a larger group.\n\"Ikeda-san wa yonj\u016b-ni sai da.\" \"As for Mx Ikeda, they are forty-two years old.\" Others in the group may also be of that age.\nAbsence of \"wa\" often means the subject is the focus of the sentence.\n\"Ikeda-san ga yonj\u016b-ni sai da.\" \"It is Mx Ikeda who is forty-two years old.\" This is a reply to an implicit or explicit question, such as \"who in this group is forty-two years old?\"\nPoliteness.\nJapanese has an extensive grammatical system to express politeness and formality. This reflects the hierarchical nature of Japanese society.\nThe Japanese language can express differing levels of social status. The differences in social position are determined by a variety of factors including job, age, experience, or even psychological state (e.g., a person asking a favour tends to do so politely). The person in the lower position is expected to use a polite form of speech, whereas the other person might use a plainer form. Strangers will also speak to each other politely. Japanese children begin learning and using polite speech in basic forms from an early age, but their use of more formal and sophisticated polite speech becomes more common and expected as they enter their teenage years and start engaging in more adult-like social interactions. See \"uchi\u2013soto\".\nWhereas is commonly an inflectional system, and often employ many special honorific and humble alternate verbs: \"iku\" \"go\" becomes \"ikimasu\" in polite form, but is replaced by \"irassharu\" in honorific speech and \"ukagau\" or \"mairu\" in humble speech.\nThe difference between honorific and humble speech is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one's own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is mostly used when describing the interlocutor and their group. For example, the \"-san\" suffix (\"Mr\", \"Mrs\", \"Miss\", or \"Mx\") is an example of honorific language. It is not used to talk about oneself or when talking about someone from one's company to an external person, since the company is the speaker's in-group. When speaking directly to one's superior in one's company or when speaking with other employees within one's company about a superior, a Japanese person will use vocabulary and inflections of the honorific register to refer to the in-group superior and their speech and actions. When speaking to a person from another company (i.e., a member of an out-group), however, a Japanese person will use the plain or the humble register to refer to the speech and actions of their in-group superiors. In short, the register used in Japanese to refer to the person, speech, or actions of any particular individual varies depending on the relationship (either in-group or out-group) between the speaker and listener, as well as depending on the relative status of the speaker, listener, and third-person referents.\nMost nouns in the Japanese language may be made polite by the addition of \"o-\" or \"go-\" as a prefix. \"o-\" is generally used for words of native Japanese origin, whereas \"go-\" is affixed to words of Chinese derivation. In some cases, the prefix has become a fixed part of the word, and is included even in regular speech, such as \"gohan\" 'cooked rice; meal.' Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item's owner or to the object itself. For example, the word \"tomodachi\" 'friend,' would become \"o-tomodachi\" when referring to the friend of someone of higher status (though mothers often use this form to refer to their children's friends). On the other hand, a polite speaker may sometimes refer to \"mizu\" 'water' as \"o-mizu\" to show politeness.\nVocabulary.\nThere are three main sources of words in the Japanese language: the or ; ; and .\nThe original language of Japan, or at least the original language of a certain population that was ancestral to a significant portion of the historical and present Japanese nation, was the so-called or infrequently , i.e. \"Yamato words\"), which in scholarly contexts is sometimes referred to as ( or rarely , i.e. the \"Wa language\"). In addition to words from this original language, present-day Japanese includes a number of words that were either borrowed from Chinese or constructed from Chinese roots following Chinese patterns. These words, known as , entered the language from the 5th century onwards by contact with Chinese culture. According to the Japanese dictionary, \"kango\" comprise 49.1% of the total vocabulary, \"wago\" make up 33.8%, other foreign words or account for 8.8%, and the remaining 8.3% constitute hybridized words or that draw elements from more than one language.\nThere are also a great number of words of mimetic origin in Japanese, with Japanese having a rich collection of sound symbolism, both onomatopoeia for physical sounds, and more abstract words. A small number of words have come into Japanese from the Ainu language. \"Tonakai\" (reindeer), \"rakko\" (sea otter) and \"shishamo\" (smelt, a type of fish) are well-known examples of words of Ainu origin.\nWords of different origins occupy different registers in Japanese. Like Latin-derived words in English, \"kango\" words are typically perceived as somewhat formal or academic compared to equivalent Yamato words. Indeed, it is generally fair to say that an English word derived from Latin/French roots typically corresponds to a Sino-Japanese word in Japanese, whereas an Anglo-Saxon word would best be translated by a Yamato equivalent.\nIncorporating vocabulary from European languages, \"gairaigo\", began with borrowings from Portuguese in the 16th century, followed by words from Dutch during Japan's long isolation of the Edo period. With the Meiji Restoration and the reopening of Japan in the 19th century, words were borrowed from German, French, and English. Today most borrowings are from English.\nIn the Meiji era, the Japanese also coined many neologisms using Chinese roots and morphology to translate European concepts; these are known as \"wasei-kango\" (Japanese-made Chinese words). Many of these were then imported into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese via their kanji in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, , and are words derived from Chinese roots that were first created and used by the Japanese, and only later borrowed into Chinese and other East Asian languages. As a result, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese share a large common corpus of vocabulary in the same way many Greek- and Latin-derived words \u2013 both inherited or borrowed into European languages, or modern coinages from Greek or Latin roots \u2013 are shared among modern European languages \u2013 see classical compound.\nIn the past few decades, \"wasei-eigo\" (\"made-in-Japan English\") has become a prominent phenomenon. Words such as (&lt; \"one\" + \"pattern\", \"to be in a rut\", \"to have a one-track mind\") and (&lt; \"skin\" + \"-ship\", \"physical contact\"), although coined by compounding English roots, are nonsensical in most non-Japanese contexts; exceptions exist in nearby languages such as Korean however, which often use words such as \"skinship\" and \"rimokon\" (remote control) in the same way as in Japanese.\nThe popularity of many Japanese cultural exports has made some native Japanese words familiar in English, including \"emoji, futon, haiku, judo, kamikaze, karaoke, karate, ninja, origami, rickshaw\" (from ), \"samurai, sayonara, Sudoku, sumo, sushi, tofu, tsunami, tycoon\". See list of English words of Japanese origin for more.\nGender in the Japanese language.\nDepending on the speakers\u2019 gender, different linguistic features might be used. The typical lect used by females is called and the one used by males is called . \"Joseigo\" and \"danseigo\" are different in various ways, including first-person pronouns (such as \"watashi\" or \"atashi\" for women and for men) and sentence-final particles (such as , , or for \"joseigo\", or , , or for \"danseigo\"). In addition to these specific differences, expressions and pitch can also be different. For example, \"joseigo\" is more gentle, polite, refined, indirect, modest, and exclamatory, and often accompanied by raised pitch.\nKogal slang.\nIn the 1990s, the traditional feminine speech patterns and stereotyped behaviors were challenged, and a popular culture of \"naughty\" teenage girls emerged, called , sometimes referenced in English-language materials as \"kogal\". Their rebellious behaviors, deviant language usage, the particular make-up called , and the fashion became objects of focus in the mainstream media. Although kogal slang was not appreciated by older generations, the \"kogyaru\" continued to create terms and expressions. Kogal culture also changed Japanese norms of gender and the Japanese language.\nNon-native study.\nMany major universities throughout the world provide Japanese language courses, and a number of secondary and even primary schools worldwide offer courses in the language. This is a significant increase from before World War II; in 1940, only 65 Americans not of Japanese descent were able to read, write, and understand the language.\nInternational interest in the Japanese language dates from the 19th century but has become more prevalent following Japan's economic bubble of the 1980s and the global popularity of Japanese popular culture (such as anime and video games) since the 1990s. As of 2015, more than 3.6 million people studied the language worldwide, primarily in East and Southeast Asia. Nearly one million Chinese, 745,000 Indonesians, 556,000 South Koreans and 357,000 Australians studied Japanese in lower and higher educational institutions. Between 2012 and 2015, considerable growth of learners originated in Australia (20.5%), Thailand (34.1%), Vietnam (38.7%) and the Philippines (54.4%).\nThe Japanese government provides standardized tests to measure spoken and written comprehension of Japanese for second language learners; the most prominent is the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), which features five levels of exams. The JLPT is offered twice a year.\nExample text.\nArticle 1 of the \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" in Japanese:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

B. Lippincott. The novel won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1939. A 1971 film adaptation was written and directed by Trumbo.\nPlot.\nJoe Bonham, a young American soldier serving in World War I, awakens in a hospital bed after being caught in the blast of an exploding artillery shell. He gradually realizes that he has lost his arms, legs, and all of his face (including his eyes, ears, nose, teeth, and tongue), but that his mind functions perfectly, leaving him a prisoner in his own body.\nJoe attempts suicide by suffocation, but finds that he has had a tracheotomy that he can neither remove nor control. He then decides that he wants to be placed in a glass coffin and toured around the country in order to demonstrate to others the true horrors of war. Joe eventually successfully communicates this with military officials after several months of banging his head on his pillow in Morse code. However, he realizes that the military will not grant his wish, nor will they put him out of his misery by euthanizing him, as it is \"against regulations\". It is implied that he will live the rest of his natural life in his condition.\nAs Joe drifts between reality and fantasy, he remembers his old life with his family and girlfriend, and reflects upon the myths and realities of war.\nCharacters.\nJoe Bonham is the main character. He has all of his limbs amputated and his facial features removed (eyes, ears, nose, teeth, tongue.) Joe is also devoid of any senses except for that of touch. He is essentially a man trapped with his own thoughts.\nThe regular day nurse is described by Joe as a heavyset woman doing her job of care taking him. As Joe could not communicate, he squirms out of anticipation to be cared for, which she misreads for stress. She treats Joe as an animal rather than a human with a conscience; not accounting for the fact that Joe was trying to communicate. The nurse becomes agitated by Joe's tapping his head, unaware that he was communicating through Morse Code. She tries to alleviate what she misreads as Joe being stressed, and goes to the lengths of masturbating Joe once.\nJoe's father, Bill Bonham, courted Joe's mother and raised a family with her in Colorado. Bill is referenced throughout the novel during Joe's reminiscing of earlier times. In chapter one, it is said that Bill passes away. He is survived by Joe, his mother, and his younger sisters (one aged thirteen, one aged nine).\nJoe's mother, Marcia Bonham, was close to Joe and Bill. She was known for her cooking skills.\nKareen, aged 19 at Joe's departure, is mentioned throughout the book as Joe floats between reality and fantasy. In chapter three, Kareen and Joe, with her father's reluctant approval, have sexual intercourse for the first time on the night before he leaves.\nDiane is only mentioned in chapter four. In which it is mentioned that she, during her and Joe's relationship, began a relationship with a man named Glen Hogan. She also has an unfaithful relationship with Joe's best friend, Bill Harper.\nBill Harper warns Joe that Diane is in an unfaithful relationship with Hogan as she also has a relationship with Joe, to which Joe hits Bill. Joe later finds out that Bill was truthful and decides that he wants to renew their friendship. However, he finds Bill and Diane at her home and is hurt by both. The end of chapter four references how Bill was killed at Belleau Wood.\nAfter his troubles with Diane and Glen Hogan, Joe meets Howie during chapter nine. It was found that Howie was never capable of keeping a relationship with a woman; and his girlfriend, Onie, also had an unfaithful relationship with Glen Hogan. Joe and Howie decided to not only forget about their partners, but to also forget about Glen Hogan. Joe and Howie join a group of Mexicans working on a railroad. However, once Howie receives an apologetic telegram from Onie, the boys decide to return home.\nJos\u00e9 worked at a bakery with Joe. He was given the job at the bakery through the local homeless shelter. Jos\u00e9 has many stories that set him apart from the other homeless workers, including the fact that he refused marriage to a wealthy woman. Jos\u00e9 wanted to work in Hollywood. When the opportunity presented itself to work for a picture company, Jos\u00e9 purposely gets fired because he feels his own personal honor will not allow him to quit on the boss that gave him his original opportunity.\nThe new day nurse was the first person to successfully communicate with Joe after his injuries. She moved her finger on his bare chest in the shape of the letter M until Joe signaled that he understood \"M\". She then spelled out \"MERRY CHRISTMAS\" and Joe signaled that he understood. The new day nurse then deduced that Joe's head-banging was in Morse Code and fetched someone who knew Morse Code.\nTitle and context.\nThe title is a play on the phrase \"Johnny get your gun\",\na rallying call that was commonly used to encourage young American men to enlist in the military in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. That phrase was popularized in the George M. Cohan song \"Over There\", which was widely recorded in the first year of American involvement in World War I. \"Johnny Get Your Gun\" is also the name of a 1919 film directed by Donald Crisp.\nMany of protagonist Joe Bonham's early memories are based on Dalton Trumbo's early life in Colorado and Los Angeles. The novel is inspired by articles about two men with severe injuries that Trumbo read about: the tearful hospital visit of Edward, Prince of Wales to Curley Christian, considered to be the only Canadian soldier in WWI who was a quadruple amputee, and a British major whose body was damaged so horrifically that he was reported as MIA to his family. The family discovered the truth years after his death in the hospital. \"Though the novel was a pacifist piece published in wartime, it was well reviewed and won an American Booksellers Award in 1940.\"\nPublication.\nSerialized in the \"Daily Worker\" in March 1940, published by the Communist Party USA to which Trumbo belonged, the book became \"a rally point for the political left\" which had opposed involvement in World War II during the period of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact (1939\u20131941) when the USSR maintained a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany. Shortly after the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, Trumbo and his publishers decided to suspend reprinting the book until the end of the war, due to the Communist Party USA's support for the war so long as the US was allied with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany.\nIn his introduction to a 1959 reprinting, Trumbo describes receiving letters from right-wing isolationists requesting copies of the book when it was out of print. Trumbo contacted the FBI and turned these letters over to them. Trumbo regretted this decision, which he later called \"foolish,\" after two FBI agents showed up at his home and it became clear that \"their interest lay not in the letters but in me.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The widely followed contest originated in the pages of \"Social Science Quarterly\", where Simon challenged Ehrlich to put his money where his mouth was. In response to Ehrlich's published claim that \"If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000\", Simon offered to take that bet, or, more realistically, \"to stake US$10,000 ... on my belief that the cost of non-government-controlled raw materials (including grain and oil) will not rise in the long run\".\nSimon challenged Ehrlich to choose any raw material he wanted and a date more than a year away, and he would wager on the inflation-adjusted prices decreasing as opposed to increasing. Ehrlich chose copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten. The bet was formalized on September 29, 1980, with September 29, 1990, as the payoff date. Ehrlich lost the bet, as all five commodities that were bet on declined in price from 1980 through 1990, the wager period.\nBackground.\nIn 1968 Ehrlich published \"The Population Bomb\", which argued that mankind was facing a demographic catastrophe with the rate of population growth quickly outstripping growth in the supply of food and resources. Simon was highly skeptical of such claims, so he proposed a wager, telling Ehrlich to select any raw material he wanted and select \"any date more than a year away,\" and Simon would bet that the commodity's price on that date would be lower than what it was at the time of the wager.\nEhrlich and his colleagues picked five metals that they thought would undergo big price increases: chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten. Then, on paper, they bought $200 worth of each, for a total bet of $1,000, using the prices on September 29, 1980, as an index. They designated September 29, 1990, 10 years hence, as the payoff date. If the inflation-adjusted prices of the various metals rose in the interim, Simon would pay Ehrlich the combined difference. If the prices fell, Ehrlich et al. would pay Simon.\nBetween 1980 and 1990 the world's population grew by more than 800 million, the largest increase in one decade in all of history. But by September 1990, the price of each of Ehrlich's selected metals had fallen. Chromium, which had sold for $3.90 a pound in 1980 (), was down to $3.70 in 1990 (). Tin, which was $8.72 a pound in 1980 (), was down to $3.88 a decade later ().\nAs a result, in October 1990 Paul Ehrlich mailed Julian Simon a check for $576.07 () to settle the wager in Simon's favor.\nAnalysis.\nJulian Simon won because the price of three of the five metals went down in nominal terms and all five of the metals fell in price in inflation-adjusted terms, with both tin and tungsten falling by more than half. In his book \"Betrayal of Science and Reason\", Ehrlich wrote that Simon asserted \"that humanity would never run out of anything\". Ehrlich added that he and fellow scientists viewed renewable resources as more important indicators of the state of planet Earth, but that he decided to go along with the bet anyway. Afterward, Simon offered to raise the wager to $20,000 and to use any resources at any time that Ehrlich preferred. Ehrlich countered with a challenge to bet that temperatures would increase in the future. The two were unable to reach an agreement on the terms of a second wager before Simon died.\nSome observers have argued that Ehrlich could have won if the bet had been for a different period, or if the start date had been different. Ehrlich wrote that the five metals in question had increased in price between the years 1950 and 1975. Asset manager Jeremy Grantham wrote that if the Simon-Ehrlich wager had been for a longer period (from 1980 to 2011), then Simon would have lost on four of the five metals. Economist Mark J. Perry noted that for an even longer period of time, from 1934 to 2013, the inflation-adjusted price of the Dow Jones-AIG Commodities Index showed \"an overall significant downward trend\" and concluded that Simon was \"more right than lucky\".\nThe proposed second wager.\nUnderstanding that Simon wanted to bet again, Ehrlich and climatologist Stephen Schneider counter-offered, challenging Simon to bet on 15 current trends, betting $1,000 that each will get worse (as in the previous wager) over a ten-year future period.\nThe bets were:\nSimon declined Ehrlich and Schneider's offer to bet, and used the following analogy to explain why he did so:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let me characterize their offer as follows. I predict, and this is for real, that the average performances in the next Olympics will be better than those in the last Olympics. On average, the performances have gotten better, Olympics to Olympics, for a variety of reasons. What Ehrlich and others says [\"sic\"] is that they don't want to bet on athletic performances, they want to bet on the conditions of the track, or the weather, or the officials, or any other such indirect measure.\nIn his 1981 book \"The Ultimate Resource\", Simon noted that not all decreases in resources or increases in unwanted effects correspond to overall decreases in human wellbeing. Hence, there can be an \"optimal level of pollution\", which accepts some increases in certain kinds of pollution in a way that increases overall wellbeing while acknowledging that any increase in pollution is nevertheless a cost that must be considered in any such calculation.143 Simon's theory of resource development actually predicts some of the aforementioned trends, which do not in and of themselves even qualify as costs (unlike pollution). E.g., he pointed out that, due to increased efficiency, the amount of cropland required and actually used to grow food for each person has decreased over time and is likely to continue to do so 5. The same might potentially be true of decreased reliance on firewood in developing countries and per capita use of specific food sources like rice, wheat, and fish if economic development makes a diverse range of alternative foods available. Some have also proven false, e.g., the amount of ozone in the lower atmosphere has decreased from 1994 to 2004.\nIf Simon had taken the bet, he would have lost on 11 out of 15 trends.\nOther wagers.\nIn 1996 Simon bet $1,000 with David South, professor of the Auburn University School of Forestry, that the inflation-adjusted price of timber would decrease in the following five years. Simon paid out early on the bet in 1997 (before his death in 1998) based on his expectation that prices would remain above 1996 levels (which they did).\nIn 1999, when \"The Economist\" headlined an article entitled, \"$5 a barrel oil soon?\" and with oil trading in the $12/barrel range, David South offered $1,000 to any economist who would bet with him that the price of oil would be greater than $12/barrel in 2010. No economist took him up on the offer. However, in October 2000, Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with The University of the West Indies, bet $1,000 with David South that the inflation-adjusted price of oil would decrease to an inflation-adjusted price of $25 by 2010 (down from what was then $30/barrel). Madjd-Sadjadi paid South an inflation-adjusted $1,242 in January 2010. The price of oil at the time was $81/barrel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An alumnus of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, he was knighted for artistic achievements in 1893, the first such honour ever bestowed on an illustrator or cartoonist.\nTenniel is remembered mainly as the principal political cartoonist for \"Punch\" magazine for over 50 years and for his illustrations to Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865) and \"Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There\" (1871). Tenniel's detailed black-and-white drawings remain the definitive depiction of the \"Alice\" characters, with comic book illustrator and writer Bryan Talbot stating, \"Carroll never describes the Mad Hatter: our image of him is pure Tenniel.\"\nEarly life.\nTenniel was born in Bayswater, West London, to John Baptist Tenniel, a fencing and dancing master of Huguenot descent, and Eliza Maria Tenniel. Tenniel had five siblings; two brothers and three sisters. One sister, Mary, was later to marry Thomas Goodwin Green, owner of the pottery that produced Cornishware. Tenniel was a quiet and introverted person, both as a boy and as an adult. He was content to remain firmly out of the limelight and seemed unaffected by competition or change. His biographer Rodney Engen wrote that Tenniel's \"life and career was that of the supreme gentlemanly outsider, living on the edge of respectability.\"\nIn 1840, Tenniel, while practising fencing, received a serious eye wound from his father's foil, which had accidentally lost its protective tip. Over the years, Tenniel gradually lost sight in his right eye; he never told his father of the severity of the wound, as he did not wish to upset him further.\nIn spite of a tendency towards high art, Tenniel was already known and appreciated as a humourist. His early companionship with Charles Keene fostered his talent for scholarly caricature.\nTraining.\nTenniel became a student of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1842 by probation; he was admitted because he had made enough copies of classical sculptures to fill the necessary admission portfolio. So it was here that Tenniel returned to his earlier independent education.\nWhile Tenniel's more formal training at the Royal Academy and other institutions was beneficial in nurturing his artistic ambitions, he disagreed with the school's teaching methods, and so he set about educating himself. He studied classical sculptures through painting. However, he was frustrated in this because he lacked instruction in drawing. Tenniel would draw the classical statues at London's Townley Gallery, copy illustrations from books of costumes and armour in the British Museum, and draw animals from the zoo in Regent's Park, as well as actors from London theatres, which he drew from the pits. These studies taught Tenniel to love detail, yet he became impatient in his work and was happiest when he could draw from memory. Though he had a photographic memory, it undermined his early formal training and restricted his artistic ambitions.\nAnother \"formal\" means of training was Tenniel's participation in an artists' group, free from the rules of the academy that were stifling him. In the mid-1840s he joined the Artist's Society or Clipstone Street Life Academy, and it could be said that Tenniel first emerged there as a satirical draughtsman.\nEarly career.\nTenniel's first book illustration was for Samuel Carter Hall's \"The Book of British Ballads\", in 1842. While engaged with his first book illustrations, various contests were taking place in London, as a way in which the government could combat the growing Germanic Nazarenes style and promote a truly national English school of art. Tenniel planned to enter the 1845 House of Lords competition amongst artists to win the opportunity to design the mural decoration of the new Palace of Westminster. Despite missing the deadline, he submitted a cartoon, \"An Allegory of Justice\", to a competition for designs for the mural decoration of the new Palace of Westminster. For this he received a \u00a3200 premium and a commission to paint a fresco in the Upper Waiting Hall (or Hall of Poets) in the House of Lords.\n\"Punch\".\nAs the influential result of his position as the chief cartoon artist for \"Punch\", Tenniel remained a witness to Britain's sweeping changes. He furthered political and social reform through satirical, often radical, and at times vitriolic images of the world. At Christmas 1850 he was invited by Mark Lemon to fill the position of joint cartoonist (with John Leech) on \"Punch\", having been selected on the strength of recent illustrations to Aesop's \"Fables\". He contributed his first drawing in the initial letter appearing on p.\u00a0224, vol. xix. This was entitled \"Lord Jack the Giant Killer\" and showed Lord John Russell assailing Cardinal Wiseman.\nTenniel's first characteristic lion appeared in 1852, as did his first obituary cartoon. Gradually he took over altogether the weekly drawing of the political \"big cut,\" which Leech was happy to cede to Tenniel in order to restrict himself to his pictures of life and character.\nIn 1861, Tenniel was offered Leech's position at \"Punch\", as political cartoonist, but Tenniel still maintained a sense of decorum and restraint in the heated social and political issues of the day. When Leech died in 1864, Tenniel continued their work alone, rarely missing a single week.\nHis task was to follow the wilful choices of his \"Punch\" editors, who probably took their cue from \"The Times\" and would have felt the suggestions of political tensions from Parliament as well. Tenniel's work could be scathing in effect. The restlessness in the issues of working-class radicalism, labour, war, economy, and other national themes were the targets of \"Punch\", which in turn settled the nature of Tenniel's subjects. His cartoons of the 1860s popularised a portrait of the Irishman as a sub-human being, wanton in his appetites and resembling an orangutan in facial features and posture. Many of Tenniel's political cartoons expressed strong hostility to Irish Nationalism, with Fenians and Land leagues depicted as monstrous, ape-like brutes, while \"Hibernia\" \u2013 the personification of Ireland \u2013 was depicted as a beautiful, helpless girl threatened by such \"monsters\" and turning for protection to an \"elder sister\" in the shape of a powerful, armoured Britannia.\n\"An Unequal Match\", his drawing published in \"Punch\" on 8 October 1881, depicted a police officer fighting a criminal with only a baton for protection, trying to put a point across to the public that policing methods needed to be changed.\nWhen examined separately from the book illustrations he did over time, Tenniel's work at \"Punch\" alone, expressing decades of editorial viewpoints, often controversial and socially sensitive, was created to echo the voices of the British public. Tenniel drew 2,165 cartoons for \"Punch\", a liberal and politically active publication that mirrored the Victorian public's mood for liberal social changes; thus Tenniel, in his cartoons, represented for years the conscience of the British majority.\nTenniel contributed around 2,300 cartoons, innumerable minor drawings, many double-page cartoons for \"Punch's Almanac\" and other specials, and 250 designs for \"Punch's Pocket-books\". By 1866 he could \"command ten to fifteen guineas for the reworking of a single \"Punch\" cartoon as a pencil sketch,\" alongside his \"comfortable\" \"Punch\" salary \"of about \u00a3800 a year\".\nAlice.\nDespite the thousands of political cartoons and hundreds of illustrative works attributed to him, much of Tenniel's fame stems from his illustrations for \"Alice\". Tenniel drew 92 drawings for Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (London: Macmillan, 1865) and \"Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There\" (London: Macmillan, 1871).\nLewis Carroll originally illustrated \"Wonderland\" himself, but his artistic abilities were limited. Engraver Orlando Jewitt, who had worked for Carroll in 1859 and reviewed Carroll's drawings for \"Wonderland\", suggested that he employ a professional. Carroll was a regular reader of \"Punch\" and therefore familiar with Tenniel, who in 1865 had long talks with Carroll before illustrating the first edition of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\".\nThe first print run of 2,000 was sold in the United States, rather than England, because Tenniel objected to the print quality. A new edition was released in December 1865, carrying an 1866 date, and became an instant best-seller, increasing Tenniel's fame. His drawings for both books have become some of the most famous literary illustrations. After 1872, when the Carroll projects were finished, Tenniel largely abandoned literary illustration. Carroll did later approach Tenniel to undertake another project for him. To this Tenniel replied:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is a curious fact that with \"Looking-Glass\" the faculty of making drawings for book illustrations departed from me, and... I have done nothing in that direction since.\nTenniel's \"Alice\" illustrations were engraved onto blocks of deal wood by the Brothers Dalziel. These then served as masters for the electrotype copies for the actual printing of the books. The original wood blocks are held by the Bodleian Library in Oxford. They are not usually on public display, but were exhibited in 2003.\nThe bronze Alice in Wonderland sculpture (1959) in Central Park in Manhattan, New York City, is patterned on his illustrations.\nStyle.\nInfluence of German Nazarenes.\nThe style associated with the Nazarene movement of the 19th century influenced many later artists, including Tenniel. It can be characterised as \"shaded outlines\", where the lines on the side of figures or objects are given extra thickness or drawn double to suggest shading or volume. Furthermore, this style is extremely precise, with the artist making a hard clear outline for its figures, dignifying them and the compositions, while giving restraint in expression and paleness of tone. Though Tenniel's early illustrations in the Nazarene style were not well received, his encounter with the style pointed him in a good direction.\nEye for detail.\nAfter the 1850s, Tenniel's style was modernised to incorporate more detail in backgrounds and in figures. The inclusion of background details corrected the previously weak Germanic staging of his illustrations. Tenniel's more precisely-designed illustrations depicted specific moments of time, locale and individual character instead of just generalised scenes.\nIn addition to a change in specificity of background, Tenniel developed a new interest in human types, expressions, and individualised representation, something that would carry over into his illustrations of Wonderland. Referred to by many as theatricality, this hallmark of Tenniel's style probably stemmed from his earlier interest in caricature. In Tenniel's first years on \"Punch\" he developed this caricaturist's interest in the uniqueness of persons and things, almost giving a human like personality to the objects in the environment. For example, a comparison of one of John Everett Millais's illustrations of a girl in a chair with Tenniel's illustration of Alice in a chair shows clearly that Millais's chair is just a prop, whereas Tenniel's chair possesses a menacing and towering presence.\nAnother change in style was his shaded lines. These transformed from mechanical horizontal lines to vigorously hand-drawn hatching that greatly intensified darker areas.\nGrotesque.\nTenniel's \"grotesque\" was one reason why Lewis Carroll wanted Tenniel as his illustrator for the \"Alice\" books, in the sense of imparting a disturbing sense that the real world may have ceased to be reliable. Tenniel's style was characteristically grotesque through his dark, atmospheric compositions of exaggerated fantasy creatures carefully drawn in outline. Often the mechanism was to use animal heads on recognisable human bodies or vice versa, as Grandville had done in the Parisian satirical journal \"Charivari\". In Tenniel's illustrations, the grotesque is found also in mergers of beings and things, deformities in and violence to the human body (e. g. when Alice drinks the potion and grows huge), and a proclivity to deal with ordinary things of this world while presenting such phenomena. The most noticeably grotesque is Tenniel's famous Jabberwock drawing in \"Alice\".\nThe \"Alice\" illustrations combine fantasy and reality. Scholars such as Morris trace Tenniel's stylistic change to the late 1850s trend towards realism. For the grotesque to operate, \"it is our world which has to be transformed and not some fantasy realm.\" The illustrations constantly but subtly remind us of the real world, as do some of Tenniel's scenes derived from a medieval town, the portico of a Georgian town, or the checked jacket on the White Rabbit. Additionally, Tenniel closely follows Carroll's text, so that the reader sees the similitude between the written text and the illustrations. These touches of realism help to convince readers that all these seemingly grotesque inhabitants of Wonderland are simply themselves, simply real, not just performing.\nImage and text in \"Alice\".\nOne unusual aspect of the \"Alice\" books is the placing of Tenniel's illustrations on the pages. This physical relation of illustrations to text meshes them together. Carroll and Tenniel expressed this in various ways. One was bracketing: two relevant sentences would bracket an image as a way of imparting the moment that Tenniel was trying to illustrate. This bracketing of Tenniel's pictures with text adds to their \"dramatic immediacy.\" However, other, less frequent illustrations work with the texts as captions.\nAnother link between illustration and text is the use of broader and narrower illustrations. Broader ones are meant to be centred on the page, narrower to be \"let in\" or run flush to the margin, alongside a narrow column of continuing text. Still, words run in parallel with the depiction of those things. For example, when Alice says, \"Oh, my poor little feet!\", it not only occurs at the foot of the page but is right next to her feet in the illustration. Some of these narrower illustrations are L-shaped, and of great importance as some of his most memorable work. The top or base of these illustrations runs the full width of the page, but the other end leaves room on one side for text.\nBook illustrations.\nA selected list:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Column/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEntirely by Tenniel\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTenniel's different collaborations:\nRetirement and death.\nAn ultimate tribute came to an elderly Tenniel as he was knighted for public service in 1893 by Queen Victoria. It was the first such honour ever bestowed on an illustrator or cartoonist. His fellows saw his knighthood as gratitude for \"raising what had been a fairly lowly profession to an unprecedented level of respectability.\" With his knighthood, Tenniel elevated the social status of the black-and-white illustrator, and sparked a new sense of recognition of his profession. When he retired in January 1901, Tenniel was honoured with a farewell banquet (on 12 June), at which Arthur Balfour, then Leader of the House of Commons, presided and described Tenniel as \"a great artist and a great gentleman\".\nTenniel died of natural causes aged 93, at his home in West Kensington, London, on 25 February 1914.\nTenniel's funeral was held on 2 March 1914 and he was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.\nLegacy.\nThe \"Punch\" historian M. H. Spielmann, who knew Tenniel, wrote that the political clout contained in his \"Punch\" cartoons was capable of \"swaying parties and people, too\". Two days after his death, \"The Daily Graphic\" recalled how Tenniel \"had an influence on the political feeling of this time which is hardly measurable... While Tenniel was drawing them (his subjects), we always looked to the Punch cartoon to crystallize the national and international situation, and the popular feeling about it\u2014and never looked in vain.\" This social influence resulted from the weekly publishing of his political cartoons over 50 years, whereby Tenniel's fame allowed for a want and need for his particular illustrative work, away from the newspaper. Tenniel became not only one of Victorian Britain's most published illustrators, but as a \"Punch\" cartoonist one of the \"supreme social observers\" of British society and an integral component of a powerful journalistic force. The \"New-York Tribune\" journalist George W. Smalley referred to John Tenniel in 1914 as \"one of the greatest intellectual forces of his time, (who) understood social laws and political energies.\"\nPublic exhibitions of Sir John Tenniel's work were held in 1895 and 1900. Tenniel was also the author of one of the mosaics, \"Leonardo da Vinci\", in the South Court in the Victoria and Albert Museum. His stippled watercolour drawings appeared from time to time in the exhibitions of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, to which he had been elected in 1874.\nTenniel Close, a Bayswater street near his former studio, is named after him. In 2025 a commemorative plaque was installed on the exterior of Tenniel's house in West Kensington. The plaque, which had been commissioned in 1930 by London County Council was originally placed on his house in Maida Vale, but was removed when that building was demolished in the 1950s. After 65 years in storage, the plaque was restored and rehung by English Heritage.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15613", "revid": "49681265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15613", "title": "Jazz", "text": "Music genre\nJazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its roots are in blues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\nThe mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology and definition.\nThe origin of the word \"jazz\" has resulted in considerable research, and its history is well documented. It is believed to be related to \"jasm\", a slang term dating back to 1860 meaning 'pep, energy'. The earliest written record of the word is in a 1912 article in the \"Los Angeles Times\" in which a minor league baseball pitcher described a pitch which he called a 'jazz ball' \"because it wobbles and you simply can't do anything with it\".\nThe use of the word in a musical context was documented as early as 1915 in the \"Chicago Daily Tribune.\" Its first documented use in a musical context in New Orleans was in a November 14, 1916, \"Times-Picayune\" article about \"jas bands\". In an interview with National Public Radio, musician Eubie Blake offered his recollections of the slang connotations of the term, saying: \"When Broadway picked it up, they called it 'J-A-Z-Z'. It wasn't called that. It was spelled 'J-A-S-S'. That was dirty, and if you knew what it was, you wouldn't say it in front of ladies.\" The American Dialect Society named it the Word of the 20th Century.\nJazz is difficult to define because it encompasses a wide range of music spanning a period of over 100 years, from ragtime to rock-infused fusion. Attempts have been made to define jazz from the perspective of other musical traditions, such as European music history or African music. But critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt argues that its terms of reference and its definition should be broader, defining jazz as a \"form of art music which originated in the United States through the confrontation of the Negro with European music\" and arguing that it differs from European music in that jazz has a \"special relationship to time defined as 'swing'\". Jazz involves \"a spontaneity and vitality of musical production in which improvisation plays a role\" and contains a \"sonority and manner of phrasing which mirror the individuality of the performing jazz musician\".\nA broader definition that encompasses different eras of jazz has been proposed by Travis Jackson: \"it is music that includes qualities such as swing, improvising, group interaction, developing an 'individual voice', and being open to different musical possibilities\". Krin Gabbard argued that \"jazz is a construct\" which designates \"a number of musics with enough in common to be understood as part of a coherent tradition\". Duke Ellington, one of jazz's most famous figures, said, \"It's all music.\"\nElements.\nImprovisation.\nAlthough jazz is considered difficult to define, in part because it contains many subgenres, improvisation is one of its defining elements. The centrality of improvisation is attributed to the influence of earlier forms of music such as blues, a form of folk music which arose in part from the work songs and field hollers of African-American slaves on plantations. These work songs were commonly structured around a repetitive call-and-response pattern, but early blues was also improvisational. Classical music performance is evaluated more by its fidelity to the musical score, with less attention given to interpretation, ornamentation, and accompaniment. The classical performer's goal is to play the composition as it was written. In contrast, jazz is often characterized by the product of interaction and collaboration, placing less value on the contribution of the composer, if there is one, and more on the performer. The jazz performer interprets a tune in individual ways, never playing the same composition twice. Depending on the performer's mood, experience, and interaction with band members or audience members, the performer may change melodies, harmonies, and time signatures.\nIn early Dixieland, a.k.a. New Orleans jazz, performers took turns playing melodies and improvising countermelodies. In the swing era of the 1920s\u20131940s, big bands relied more on arrangements which were written or learned by ear and memorized. Soloists improvised within these arrangements. In the bebop era of the 1940s, big bands gave way to small groups and minimal arrangements in which the melody was stated briefly at the beginning and most of the piece was improvised. Modal jazz abandoned chord progressions to allow musicians to improvise even more. In many forms of jazz, a soloist is supported by a rhythm section of one or more chordal instruments (piano, guitar), double bass, and drums. The rhythm section plays chords and rhythms that outline the composition structure and complement the soloist. In avant-garde and free jazz, the separation of soloist and band is reduced, and there is license, or even a requirement, for the abandoning of chords, scales, and meters.\nTraditionalism.\nSince the emergence of bebop, forms of jazz that are commercially oriented or influenced by popular music have been criticized. According to Bruce Johnson, there has always been a \"tension between jazz as a commercial music and an art form\". Regarding the Dixieland jazz revival of the 1940s, Black musicians rejected it as being shallow nostalgia entertainment for white audiences. On the other hand, traditional jazz enthusiasts have dismissed bebop, free jazz, and jazz fusion as forms of debasement and betrayal. An alternative view is that jazz can absorb and transform diverse musical styles. By avoiding the creation of norms, jazz allows avant-garde styles to emerge.\nDiversity in jazz.\nJazz and race.\nFor some African Americans, jazz has drawn attention to African-American contributions to culture and history. For others, jazz is a reminder of \"an oppressive and racist society and restrictions on their artistic visions\". Amiri Baraka argues that there is a \"white jazz\" genre that expresses whiteness. White jazz musicians appeared in the Midwest and in other areas throughout the U.S. Papa Jack Laine, who ran the Reliance band in New Orleans in the 1910s, was called \"the father of white jazz\". The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, whose members were white, were the first jazz group to record, and Bix Beiderbecke was one of the most prominent jazz soloists of the 1920s. The Chicago Style was developed by white musicians such as Eddie Condon, Bud Freeman, Jimmy McPartland, and Dave Tough. Others from Chicago such as Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa became leading members of swing during the 1930s. Many bands included both Black and white musicians. These musicians helped change attitudes toward race in the U.S.\nRoles of women.\nFemale jazz performers and composers have contributed to jazz throughout its history. Although Betty Carter, Ella Fitzgerald, Adelaide Hall, Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee, Abbey Lincoln, Anita O'Day, Dinah Washington, and Ethel Waters were recognized for their vocal talent, less familiar were bandleaders, composers, and instrumentalists such as pianist Lil Hardin Armstrong, trumpeter Valaida Snow, and songwriters Irene Higginbotham and Dorothy Fields. Women began playing instruments in jazz in the early 1920s, drawing particular recognition on piano.\nWhen male jazz musicians were drafted during World War II, many all-female bands replaced them. The International Sweethearts of Rhythm, which was founded in 1937, was a popular band that became the first all-female integrated band in the U.S. and the first to travel with the USO, touring Europe in 1945. Women were members of the big bands of Woody Herman and Gerald Wilson. Beginning in the 1950s, many women jazz instrumentalists were prominent, some sustaining long careers. Some of the most distinctive improvisers, composers, and bandleaders in jazz have been women. Trombonist Melba Liston is acknowledged as the first female horn player to work in major bands and to make a real impact on jazz, not only as a musician but also as a respected composer and arranger, particularly through her collaborations with Randy Weston from the late 1950s into the 1990s.\nJews in jazz.\nJewish Americans played a significant role in jazz. As jazz spread, it developed to encompass many different cultures, and the work of Jewish composers in Tin Pan Alley helped shape the many different sounds that jazz came to incorporate.\nJewish Americans were able to thrive in Jazz because of the probationary whiteness that they were allotted at the time. George Bornstein wrote that African Americans were sympathetic to the plight of the Jewish American and vice versa. As disenfranchised minorities themselves, Jewish composers of popular music saw themselves as natural allies with African Americans.\n\"The Jazz Singer\" with Al Jolson is one example of how Jewish Americans were able to bring jazz, music that African Americans developed, into popular culture. Benny Goodman was a vital Jewish American to the progression of Jazz. Goodman was the leader of a racially integrated band named King of Swing. His jazz concert in the Carnegie Hall in 1938 was the first ever to be played there. The concert was described by Bruce Eder as \"the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history\".\nShep Fields also helped to popularize \"Sweet\" Jazz music through his appearances and big band remote broadcasts from such landmark venues as Chicago's Palmer House, Broadway's Paramount Theater and the Starlight Roof at the famed Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He entertained audiences with a light elegant musical style which remained popular with audiences for nearly three decades from the 1930s until the late 1950s.\nEarly development.\nJazz originated in the late-19th to early-20th century. It developed out of many forms of music, including blues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. It also incorporated interpretations of American and European classical music, entwined with African and slave folk songs and the influences of West African culture. Its composition and style have changed many times throughout the years with each performer's personal interpretation and improvisation, which is also one of the greatest appeals of the genre.\nBlended African and European music sensibilities.\nBy the 18th century, slaves in the New Orleans area gathered socially at a special market, in an area which later became known as Congo Square, famous for its African dances.\nBy 1866, the Atlantic slave trade had brought nearly 400,000 Africans to North America. The slaves came largely from West Africa and the greater Congo River basin and brought strong musical traditions with them. The African traditions primarily use a single-line melody and call-and-response pattern, and the rhythms have a counter-metric structure and reflect African speech patterns.\nAn 1885 account says that they were making strange music (Creole) on an equally strange variety of 'instruments'\u2014washboards, washtubs, jugs, boxes beaten with sticks or bones and a drum made by stretching skin over a flour-barrel.\nLavish festivals with African-based dances to drums were organized on Sundays at Place Congo, or Congo Square, in New Orleans until 1843. There are historical accounts of other music and dance gatherings elsewhere in the southern United States. Robert Palmer said of percussive slave music:\nUsually such music was associated with annual festivals, when the year's crop was harvested and several days were set aside for celebration. As late as 1861, a traveler in North Carolina saw dancers dressed in costumes that included horned headdresses and cow tails and heard music provided by a sheepskin-covered \"gumbo box\", apparently a frame drum; triangles and jawbones furnished the auxiliary percussion. There are quite a few [accounts] from the southeastern states and Louisiana dating from the period 1820\u20131850. Some of the earliest [Mississippi] Delta settlers came from the vicinity of New Orleans, where drumming was never actively discouraged for very long and homemade drums were used to accompany public dancing until the outbreak of the Civil War.\nAnother influence came from the harmonic style of hymns of the church, which black slaves had learned and incorporated into their own music as spirituals. The origins of the blues are undocumented, though they can be seen as the secular counterpart of the spirituals. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, whereas the spirituals are homophonic, rural blues and early jazz \"was largely based on concepts of heterophony\".\nDuring the early 19th century an increasing number of black musicians learned to play European instruments, particularly the violin, which they used to parody European dance music in their own cakewalk dances. In turn, European American minstrel show performers in blackface popularized the music internationally, combining syncopation with European harmonic accompaniment. In the mid-1800s the white New Orleans composer Louis Moreau Gottschalk adapted slave rhythms and melodies from Cuba and other Caribbean islands into piano salon music. New Orleans was the main nexus between the Afro-Caribbean and African American cultures.\nAfrican rhythmic retention.\nThe Black Codes outlawed drumming by slaves, which meant that African drumming traditions were not preserved in North America, unlike in Cuba, Haiti, and elsewhere in the Caribbean. African-based rhythmic patterns were retained in the United States in large part through \"body rhythms\" such as stomping, clapping, and patting juba dancing.\nIn the opinion of jazz historian Ernest Borneman, what preceded New Orleans jazz before 1890 was \"Afro-Latin music\", similar to what was played in the Caribbean at the time. A three-stroke pattern known in Cuban music as \"tresillo\" is a fundamental rhythmic figure heard in many different slave musics of the Caribbean, as well as the Afro-Caribbean folk dances performed in New Orleans Congo Square and Gottschalk's compositions (for example \"Souvenirs From Havana\" (1859)). Tresillo (shown below) is the most basic and most prevalent duple-pulse rhythmic cell in sub-Saharan African music traditions and the music of the African Diaspora.\n&lt;score override_audio=\"Tresillo divisive.mid\"&gt;\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n \\clef percussion\n \\time 2/4\n&lt;/score&gt;\nTresillo is heard prominently in New Orleans second line music and in other forms of popular music from that city from the turn of the 20th century to present. \"By and large the simpler African rhythmic patterns survived in jazz ... because they could be adapted more readily to European rhythmic conceptions,\" jazz historian Gunther Schuller observed. \"Some survived, others were discarded as the Europeanization progressed.\"\nIn the post-Civil War period (after 1865), African Americans were able to obtain surplus military bass drums, snare drums and fifes, and an original African-American drum and fife music emerged, featuring tresillo and related syncopated rhythmic figures. This was a drumming tradition that was distinct from its Caribbean counterparts, expressing a uniquely African-American sensibility. \"The snare and bass drummers played syncopated cross-rhythms,\" observed the writer Robert Palmer, speculating that \"this tradition must have dated back to the latter half of the nineteenth century, and it could have not have developed in the first place if there hadn't been a reservoir of polyrhythmic sophistication in the culture it nurtured.\"\nAfro-Cuban influence.\nAfrican-American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 19th century when the habanera (Cuban contradanza) gained international popularity. Musicians from Havana and New Orleans would take the twice-daily ferry between both cities to perform, and the habanera quickly took root in the musically fertile Crescent City. John Storm Roberts states that the musical genre habanera \"reached the U.S. twenty years before the first rag was published.\" For the more than quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime, and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the habanera was a consistent part of African-American popular music.\nHabaneras were widely available as sheet music and were the first written music which was rhythmically based on an African motif (1803). From the perspective of African-American music, the \"habanera rhythm\" (also known as \"congo\"), \"tango-congo\", or tango. can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat. The habanera was the first of many Cuban music genres which enjoyed periods of popularity in the United States and reinforced and inspired the use of tresillo-based rhythms in African-American music.\n &lt;score override_audio=\"Tresillo+ backbeat.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\"&gt;\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\relative c' {\n \\clef percussion\n \\time 2/4 \n \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nNew Orleans native Louis Moreau Gottschalk's piano piece \"Ojos Criollos (Danse Cubaine)\" (1860) was influenced by the composer's studies in Cuba: the habanera rhythm is clearly heard in the left hand. In Gottschalk's symphonic work \"A Night in the Tropics\" (1859), the tresillo variant cinquillo appears extensively. The figure was later used by Scott Joplin and other ragtime composers.\n&lt;score override_audio=\"Cinquillo.mid\"&gt;\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n \\clef percussion\n \\time 2/4\n&lt;/score&gt;\nComparing the music of New Orleans with the music of Cuba, Wynton Marsalis observes that tresillo is the New Orleans \"clav\u00e9\", a Spanish word meaning \"code\" or \"key\", as in the key to a puzzle, or mystery. Although the pattern is only half a clave, Marsalis makes the point that the single-celled figure is the guide-pattern of New Orleans music. Jelly Roll Morton called the rhythmic figure the Spanish tinge and considered it an essential ingredient of jazz.\nRagtime.\nThe abolition of slavery in 1865 led to new opportunities for the education of freed African Americans. Although strict segregation limited employment opportunities for most blacks, many were able to find work in entertainment. Black musicians were able to provide entertainment in dances, minstrel shows, and in vaudeville, during which time many marching bands were formed. Black pianists played in bars, clubs, and brothels, as ragtime developed.\nRagtime appeared as sheet music, popularized by African-American musicians such as the entertainer Ernest Hogan, whose hit songs appeared in 1895. Two years later, Vess Ossman recorded a medley of these songs as a banjo solo known as \"Rag Time Medley\". Also in 1897, the white composer William Krell published his \"Mississippi Rag\" as the first written piano instrumental ragtime piece, and Tom Turpin published his \"Harlem Rag\", the first rag published by an African-American.\nClassically trained pianist Scott Joplin produced his \"Original Rags\" in 1898 and, in 1899, had an international hit with \"Maple Leaf Rag\", a multi-strain ragtime march with four parts that feature recurring themes and a bass line with copious seventh chords. Its structure was the basis for many other rags, and the syncopations in the right hand, especially in the transition between the first and second strain, were novel at the time. The last four measures of Scott Joplin's \"Maple Leaf Rag\" (1899) are shown below.\n&lt;score override_audio=\"Maple Leaf Rag seventh chord resolution.mid\"&gt; {\n \\new PianoStaff \u00ab\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n \\clef treble \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n &lt;f aes&gt;16 bes &lt;f aes&gt;8 &lt;fes aes&gt; &lt;fes bes&gt;16 &lt;es aes&gt;~\n &lt;es aes&gt; bes' &lt;es, c'&gt; aes bes &lt;es, c'&gt;8 &lt;d aes'&gt;16~\n &lt;d aes'&gt; bes' &lt;d, c'&gt; aes' r &lt;des, bes'&gt;8 es16\n &lt;c aes'&gt;8 &lt;g' des' es&gt; &lt;aes c es aes&gt;\n \u00bb\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\relative c, {\n \\clef bass \\key aes \\major \\time 2/4\n &lt;des des'&gt;8 &lt;des des'&gt; &lt;bes bes'&gt; &lt;d d'&gt;\n &lt;es es'&gt; &lt;es' aes c&gt; &lt;es, es'&gt; &lt;e e'&gt;\n &lt;f f'&gt; &lt;f f'&gt; &lt;g g'&gt; &lt;g g'&gt; &lt;aes aes'&gt; &lt;es es'&gt; &lt;aes, aes'&gt; \\bar \"|.\"\n \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nAfrican-based rhythmic patterns such as tresillo and its variants, the habanera rhythm and cinquillo, are heard in the ragtime compositions of Joplin and Turpin. Joplin's \"Solace\" (1909) is generally considered to be in the habanera genre: both of the pianist's hands play in a syncopated fashion, completely abandoning any sense of a march rhythm. Ned Sublette postulates that the tresillo/habanera rhythm \"found its way into ragtime and the cakewalk,\" whilst Roberts suggests that \"the habanera influence may have been part of what freed black music from ragtime's European bass\".\nRagtime in other regions.\nIn the northeastern United States, a \"hot\" style of playing ragtime had developed, notably James Reese Europe's symphonic Clef Club orchestra in New York City, which played a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall in 1912. The Baltimore rag style of Eubie Blake influenced James P. Johnson's development of stride piano playing, in which the right hand plays the melody, while the left hand provides the rhythm and bassline.\nIn Ohio and elsewhere in the mid-west the major influence was ragtime, until about 1919. Around 1912, when the four-string banjo and saxophone came in, musicians began to improvise the melody line, but the harmony and rhythm remained unchanged. A contemporary account states that blues could only be heard in jazz in the gut-bucket cabarets, which were generally looked down upon by the Black middle-class.\nBlues.\nAfrican genesis.\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt; {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n \\clef treble \\time 6/4\n c4^\\markup { \"C blues scale\" } es f fis g bes c2\n&lt;/score&gt;\n&lt;score sound=\"1\"&gt; {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n\\relative c' {\n \\clef treble \\time 5/4\n c4^\\markup { \"C minor pentatonic scale\" } es f g bes c2\n&lt;/score&gt; A hexatonic blues scale on C, ascendingBlues is the name given to both a musical form and a music genre, which originated in African-American communities of primarily the Deep South of the United States at the end of the 19th century from their spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts and chants and rhymed simple narrative ballads.\nThe African use of pentatonic scales contributed to the development of blue notes in blues and jazz. As Kubik explains:\nMany of the rural blues of the Deep South are \"stylistically\" an extension and merger of basically two broad accompanied song-style traditions in the west central Sudanic belt:\nW. C. Handy: early published blues.\nW. C. Handy became interested in folk blues of the Deep South while traveling through the Mississippi Delta. In this folk blues form, the singer would improvise freely within a limited melodic range, sounding like a field holler, and the guitar accompaniment was slapped rather than strummed, like a small drum which responded in syncopated accents, functioning as another \"voice\". Handy and his band members were formally trained African-American musicians who had not grown up with the blues, yet he was able to adapt the blues to a larger band instrument format and arrange them in a popular music form.\nHandy wrote about his adopting of the blues:\nThe primitive southern Negro, as he sang, was sure to bear down on the third and seventh tone of the scale, slurring between major and minor. Whether in the cotton field of the Delta or on the Levee up St. Louis way, it was always the same. Till then, however, I had never heard this slur used by a more sophisticated Negro, or by any white man. I tried to convey this effect ... by introducing flat thirds and sevenths (now called blue notes) into my song, although its prevailing key was major ... , and I carried this device into my melody as well.\nThe publication of his \"Memphis Blues\" sheet music in 1912 introduced the 12-bar blues to the world (although Gunther Schuller argues that it is not really a blues, but \"more like a cakewalk\"). This composition, as well as his later \"St. Louis Blues\" and others, included the habanera rhythm, and would become jazz standards. Handy's music career began in the pre-jazz era and contributed to the codification of jazz through the publication of some of the first jazz sheet music.\nNew Orleans origins.\nThe music of New Orleans, Louisiana, had a profound effect on the creation of early jazz. In New Orleans, slaves could practice elements of their culture such as voodoo and playing drums. Many early jazz musicians played in the bars and brothels of the red-light district around Basin Street called Storyville. In addition to dance bands, there were marching bands which played at lavish funerals (later called jazz funerals). The instruments used by marching bands and dance bands became the instruments of jazz: brass, drums, and reeds tuned in the European 12-tone scale. Small bands contained a combination of self-taught and formally educated musicians, many from the funeral procession tradition. These bands traveled in black communities in the deep south. Beginning in 1914, Louisiana Creole and African-American musicians played in vaudeville shows which carried jazz to cities in the northern and western parts of the U.S. Jazz became international in 1914, when the Creole Band with cornettist Freddie Keppard performed the first ever jazz concert outside the United States, at the Pantages Playhouse Theatre in Winnipeg, Canada.\nIn New Orleans, a white bandleader named Papa Jack Laine integrated blacks and whites in his marching band. He was known as \"the father of white jazz\" because of the many top players he employed, such as George Brunies, Sharkey Bonano, and future members of the Original Dixieland Jass Band. During the early 1900s, jazz was mostly performed in African-American and mulatto communities due to segregation laws. Storyville brought jazz to a wider audience through tourists who visited the port city of New Orleans. Many jazz musicians from African-American communities were hired to perform in bars and brothels. These included Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton in addition to those from other communities, such as Lorenzo Tio and Alcide Nunez. Louis Armstrong started his career in Storyville and found success in Chicago. Storyville was shut down by the U.S. government in 1917.\nSyncopation.\nCornetist Buddy Bolden played in New Orleans from 1895 to 1906. No recordings by him exist. His band is credited with creating the big four: the first syncopated bass drum pattern to deviate from the standard on-the-beat march. As the example below shows, the second half of the big four pattern is the habanera rhythm.\n&lt;score override_audio=\"Big four Buddy Bolden.mid\" lang=\"lilypond\"&gt;\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\relative c' {\n \\clef percussion\n \\time 4/4 \n \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nAfro-Creole pianist Jelly Roll Morton began his career in Storyville. Beginning in 1904, he toured with vaudeville shows to southern cities, Chicago, and New York City. In 1905, he composed \"Jelly Roll Blues\", which became the first jazz arrangement in print when it was published in 1915. It introduced more musicians to the New Orleans style.\nMorton considered the tresillo/habanera, which he called the Spanish tinge, an essential ingredient of jazz. \"Now in one of my earliest tunes, 'New Orleans Blues,' you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can't manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz.\"\nAn excerpt of \"New Orleans Blues\" is shown below.

Morton's solos, however, were still close to ragtime, and were not merely improvisations over chord changes as in later jazz, but his use of the blues was of equal importance.\nSwing in the early 20th century.\n&lt;score override_audio=\"Shuffle feel straight.mid\"&gt;\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n \\clef percussion\n \\time 4/4\n&lt;/score&gt;\n&lt;score override_audio=\"Shuffle feel.mid\"&gt;\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n \\clef percussion\n \\time 4/4\n&lt;/score&gt; Morton loosened ragtime's rigid rhythmic feeling, decreasing its embellishments and employing a swing feeling. Swing is the most important and enduring African-based rhythmic technique used in jazz. An oft quoted definition of swing by Louis Armstrong is: \"if you don't feel it, you'll never know it.\" \"The New Harvard Dictionary of Music\" states that swing is: \"An intangible rhythmic momentum in jazz...Swing defies analysis; claims to its presence may inspire arguments.\" The dictionary does nonetheless provide the useful description of triple subdivisions of the beat contrasted with duple subdivisions: swing superimposes six subdivisions of the beat over a basic pulse structure or four subdivisions. This aspect of swing is far more prevalent in African-American music than in Afro-Caribbean music. One aspect of swing, which is heard in more rhythmically complex Diaspora musics, places strokes in-between the triple and duple-pulse \"grids\".\nNew Orleans brass bands are a lasting influence, contributing horn players to the world of professional jazz with the distinct sound of the city whilst helping black children escape poverty. The leader of New Orleans's Camelia Brass Band, D'Jalma Ganier, taught Louis Armstrong to play trumpet; Armstrong would then popularize the New Orleans style of trumpet playing, and then expand it. Like Jelly Roll Morton, Armstrong is also credited with the abandonment of ragtime's stiffness in favor of swung notes. Armstrong, perhaps more than any other musician, codified the rhythmic technique of swing in jazz and broadened the jazz solo vocabulary.\nThe Original Dixieland Jass Band made the music's first recordings early in 1917, and their \"Livery Stable Blues\" became the earliest released jazz record. That year, numerous other bands made recordings featuring \"jazz\" in the title or band name, but most were ragtime or novelty records rather than jazz. In February 1918 during World War I, James Reese Europe's \"Hellfighters\" infantry band took ragtime to Europe, then on their return recorded Dixieland standards including \"Darktown Strutters' Ball\".\nThe Jazz Age.\nFrom 1920 to 1933, Prohibition in the United States banned the sale of alcoholic drinks, resulting in illicit speakeasies which became lively venues of the \"Jazz Age\", hosting popular music, dance songs, novelty songs, and show tunes. Jazz began to get a reputation as immoral, and many members of the older generations saw it as a threat to the old cultural values by promoting the decadent values of the Roaring 20s. Henry van Dyke of Princeton University wrote, \"... it is not music at all. It's merely an irritation of the nerves of hearing, a sensual teasing of the strings of physical passion.\" \"The New York Times\" reported that Siberian villagers used jazz to scare away bears, but the villagers had used pots and pans; another story claimed that the fatal heart attack of a celebrated conductor was caused by jazz.\nIn 1919, Kid Ory's Original Creole Jazz Band of musicians from New Orleans began playing in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where in 1922 they became the first black jazz band of New Orleans origin to make recordings. During the same year, Bessie Smith made her first recordings. Chicago was developing \"Hot Jazz\", and King Oliver joined Bill Johnson. Bix Beiderbecke formed The Wolverines in 1924.\nDespite its Southern black origins, there was a larger market for jazzy dance music played by white orchestras. In 1918, Paul Whiteman and his orchestra became a hit in San Francisco. He signed a contract with Victor and became the top bandleader of the 1920s, giving hot jazz a white component, hiring white musicians such as Bix Beiderbecke, Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey, Frankie Trumbauer, and Joe Venuti. In 1924, Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin's \"Rhapsody in Blue\", which was premiered by his orchestra. Jazz began to be recognized as a notable musical form. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert in \"The New York Times\", wrote, \"This composition shows extraordinary talent, as it shows a young composer with aims that go far beyond those of his ilk, struggling with a form of which he is far from being master. ... In spite of all this, he has expressed himself in a significant and, on the whole, highly original form. ... His first theme ... is no mere dance-tune ... it is an idea, or several ideas, correlated and combined in varying and contrasting rhythms that immediately intrigue the listener.\"\nAfter Whiteman's band successfully toured Europe, huge hot jazz orchestras in theater pits caught on with other whites, including Fred Waring, Jean Goldkette, and Nathaniel Shilkret. According to Mario Dunkel, Whiteman's success was based on a \"rhetoric of domestication\" according to which he had elevated and rendered valuable (read \"white\") a previously inchoate (read \"black\") kind of music.\nWhiteman's success caused black artists to follow suit, including Earl Hines (who opened in The Grand Terrace Cafe in Chicago in 1928), Washington, D.C.-native Duke Ellington (who opened at the Cotton Club in Harlem in 1927), Lionel Hampton, Fletcher Henderson, Claude Hopkins, and Don Redman, with Henderson and Redman developing the \"talking to one another\" formula for \"hot\" swing music.\nIn 1924, Louis Armstrong joined the Fletcher Henderson dance band for a year, as featured soloist. By 1924, one of Armstrong's favorite \"Sweet Jazz\" Big bands was also formed in Canada by Guy Lombardo. His Royal Canadians Orchestra specialized in performances of \"the Sweetest music this side of Heaven\" which transcended racial boundaries. The original New Orleans style was polyphonic, with theme variation and simultaneous collective improvisation. Armstrong was a master of his hometown style, but by the time he joined Henderson's band, he was already a trailblazer in a new phase of jazz, with its emphasis on arrangements and soloists. Armstrong's solos went well beyond the theme-improvisation concept and extemporized on chords, rather than melodies. According to Schuller, by comparison, the solos by Armstrong's bandmates (including a young Coleman Hawkins), sounded \"stiff, stodgy\", with \"jerky rhythms and a grey undistinguished tone quality\". The following example shows a short excerpt of the straight melody of \"Mandy, Make Up Your Mind\" by George W. Meyer and Arthur Johnston (top), compared with Armstrong's solo improvisations (below) (recorded 1924). Armstrong's solos were a significant factor in making jazz a true 20th-century language. After leaving Henderson's group, Armstrong formed his Hot Five band, where he popularized scat singing.\nSwing in the 1920s and 1930s.\nThe 1930s belonged to popular swing big bands, in which some virtuoso soloists became as famous as the band leaders. Key figures in developing the \"big\" jazz band included bandleaders and arrangers Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Harry James, Jimmie Lunceford, Glenn Miller and Artie Shaw. Although it was a collective sound, swing also offered individual musicians a chance to \"solo\" and improvise melodic, thematic solos which could at times be complex \"important\" music.\nOver time, social strictures regarding racial segregation began to relax in America: white bandleaders began to recruit black musicians and black bandleaders white ones. In the mid-1930s, Benny Goodman hired pianist Teddy Wilson, vibraphonist Lionel Hampton and guitarist Charlie Christian to join small groups. In the 1930s, Kansas City Jazz as exemplified by tenor saxophonist Lester Young marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. An early 1940s style known as \"jumping the blues\" or jump blues used small combos, uptempo music and blues chord progressions, drawing on boogie-woogie from the 1930s.\nThe influence of Duke Ellington.\nWhile swing was reaching the height of its popularity, Duke Ellington spent the late 1920s and 1930s in Washington, D.C.'s jazz scene, developing an innovative musical idiom for his orchestra. Abandoning the conventions of swing, he experimented with orchestral sounds, harmony, and musical form with complex compositions that still translated well for popular audiences; some of his tunes became hits, and his own popularity spanned from the United States to Europe.\nEllington called his music \"American Music\", rather than \"jazz\", and liked to describe those who impressed him as \"beyond category\". These included many musicians from his orchestra, some of whom are considered among the best in jazz in their own right, but it was Ellington who melded them into one of the most popular jazz orchestras in the history of jazz. He often composed for the style and skills of these individuals, such as \"Jeep's Blues\" for Johnny Hodges, \"Concerto for Cootie\" for Cootie Williams (which later became \"Do Nothing Till You Hear from Me\" with Bob Russell's lyrics), and \"The Mooche\" for Tricky Sam Nanton and Bubber Miley. He also recorded compositions written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol's \"Caravan\" and \"Perdido\", which brought the \"Spanish Tinge\" to big-band jazz. Several members of the orchestra remained with him for several decades. The band reached a creative peak in the early 1940s, when Ellington and a small hand-picked group of his composers and arrangers wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices who displayed tremendous creativity.\nBeginnings of European jazz.\nAs only a limited number of American jazz records were released in Europe, European jazz traces many of its roots to American artists such as James Reese Europe, Paul Whiteman, and Lonnie Johnson, who visited Europe during and after World War I. It was their live performances which inspired European audiences' interest in jazz, as well as the interest in all things American (and therefore exotic) which accompanied the economic and political woes of Europe during this time. The beginnings of a distinct European style of jazz began to emerge in this interwar period.\nBritish jazz began with a tour by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1919. In 1926, Fred Elizalde and His Cambridge Undergraduates began broadcasting on the BBC. Thereafter jazz became an important element in many leading dance orchestras, and jazz instrumentalists became numerous.\nThis style entered full swing in France with the Quintette du Hot Club de France, which began in 1934. Much of this French jazz was a combination of African-American jazz and the symphonic styles in which French musicians were well-trained; in this, it is easy to see the inspiration taken from Paul Whiteman since his style was also a fusion of the two. Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt popularized gypsy jazz, a mix of 1930s American swing, French dance hall \"musette\", and Eastern European folk with a languid, seductive feel; the main instruments were steel stringed guitar, violin, and double bass. Solos pass from one player to another as guitar and bass form the rhythm section. Some researchers believe Eddie Lang and Joe Venuti pioneered the guitar-violin partnership characteristic of the genre, which was brought to France after they had been heard live or on Okeh Records in the late 1920s.\nPost-war jazz.\nThe outbreak of World War II marked a turning point for jazz. The swing-era jazz of the previous decade had challenged other popular music as being representative of the nation's culture, with big bands reaching the height of the style's success by the early 1940s; swing acts and big bands traveled with U.S. military overseas to Europe, where it also became popular. Stateside, however, the war presented difficulties for the big-band format: conscription shortened the number of musicians available; the military's need for shellac (commonly used for pressing gramophone records) limited record production; a shortage of rubber (also due to the war effort) discouraged bands from touring via road travel; and a demand by the musicians' union for a commercial recording ban limited music distribution between 1942 and 1944.\nMany of the big bands who were deprived of experienced musicians because of the war effort began to enlist young players who were below the age for conscription, as was the case with saxophonist Stan Getz's entry in a band as a teenager. This coincided with a nationwide resurgence in the Dixieland style of pre-swing jazz; performers such as clarinetist George Lewis, cornetist Bill Davison, and trombonist Turk Murphy were hailed by conservative jazz critics as more authentic than the big bands. Elsewhere, with the limitations on recording, small groups of young musicians developed a more uptempo, improvisational style of jazz, collaborating and experimenting with new ideas for melodic development, rhythmic language, and harmonic substitution, during informal, late-night jam sessions hosted in small clubs and apartments. Key figures in this development were largely based in New York and included pianists Thelonious Monk and Bud Powell, drummers Max Roach and Kenny Clarke, saxophonist Charlie Parker, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. This musical development became known as bebop.\nBebop and subsequent post-war jazz developments featured a wider set of notes, played in more complex patterns and at faster tempos than previous jazz. According to Clive James, bebop was \"the post-war musical development which tried to ensure that jazz would no longer be the spontaneous sound of joy ... Students of race relations in America are generally agreed that the exponents of post-war jazz were determined, with good reason, to present themselves as challenging artists rather than tame entertainers.\" The end of the war marked \"a revival of the spirit of experimentation and musical pluralism under which it had been conceived\", along with \"the beginning of a decline in the popularity of jazz music in America\", according to American academic Michael H. Burchett.\nWith the rise of bebop and the end of the swing era after the war, jazz lost its cachet as pop music. Vocalists of the famous big bands moved on to being marketed and performing as solo pop singers; these included Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Dick Haymes, and Doris Day. Older musicians who still performed their pre-war jazz, such as Armstrong and Ellington, were gradually viewed in the mainstream as pass\u00e9. Other younger performers, such as singer Big Joe Turner and saxophonist Louis Jordan, who were discouraged by bebop's increasing complexity, pursued more lucrative endeavors in rhythm and blues, jump blues, and eventually rock and roll. Some, including Gillespie, composed intricate yet danceable pieces for bebop musicians in an effort to make them more accessible, but bebop largely remained on the fringes of American audiences' purview. \"The new direction of postwar jazz drew a wealth of critical acclaim, but it steadily declined in popularity as it developed a reputation as an academic genre that was largely inaccessible to mainstream audiences\", Burchett said. \"The quest to make jazz more relevant to popular audiences, while retaining its artistic integrity, is a constant and prevalent theme in the history of postwar jazz.\" During its swing period, jazz had been an uncomplicated musical scene; according to Paul Trynka, this changed in the post-war years:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Suddenly jazz was no longer straightforward. There was bebop and its variants, there was the last gasp of swing, there were strange new brews like the progressive jazz of Stan Kenton, and there was a completely new phenomenon called revivalism \u2013 the rediscovery of jazz from the past, either on old records or performed live by aging players brought out of retirement. From now on it was no good saying that you liked jazz, you had to specify what kind of jazz. And that is the way it has been ever since, only more so. Today, the word 'jazz' is virtually meaningless without further definition.\nBebop.\nIn the early 1940s, bebop-style performers began to shift jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\". The most influential bebop musicians included saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianists Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown, and drummer Max Roach. Divorcing itself from dance music, bebop established itself more as an art form, thus lessening its potential popular and commercial appeal.\nComposer Gunther Schuller wrote: \"In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it and all those other great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Dizzy Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings.\"\nDizzy Gillespie wrote: \"People talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here...naturally each age has got its own shit.\"\nSince bebop was meant to be listened to, not danced to, it could use faster tempos. Drumming shifted to a more elusive and explosive style, in which the ride cymbal was used to keep time while the snare and bass drum were used for accents. This led to a highly syncopated music with a linear rhythmic complexity.\nBebop musicians employed several harmonic devices which were not previously typical in jazz, engaging in a more abstracted form of chord-based improvisation. Bebop scales are traditional scales with an added chromatic passing note; bebop also uses \"passing\" chords, substitute chords, and altered chords. New forms of chromaticism and dissonance were introduced into jazz, and the dissonant tritone (or \"flatted fifth\") interval became the \"most important interval of bebop\" Chord progressions for bebop tunes were often taken directly from popular swing-era tunes and reused with a new and more complex melody or reharmonized with more complex chord progressions to form new compositions, a practice which was already well-established in earlier jazz, but came to be central to the bebop style. Bebop made use of several relatively common chord progressions, such as blues (at base, I\u2013IV\u2013V, but often infused with ii\u2013V motion) and \"rhythm changes\" (I-vi-ii-V) \u2013 the chords to the 1930s pop standard \"I Got Rhythm\". Late bop also moved towards extended forms that represented a departure from pop and show tunes.\nThe harmonic development in bebop is often traced back to a moment experienced by Charlie Parker while performing \"Cherokee\" at Clark Monroe's Uptown House, New York, in early 1942. \"I'd been getting bored with the stereotyped changes that were being used...and I kept thinking there's bound to be something else. I could hear it sometimes. I couldn't play it...I was working over 'Cherokee,' and, as I did, I found that by using the higher intervals of a chord as a melody line and backing them with appropriately related changes, I could play the thing I'd been hearing. It came alive.\" Gerhard Kubik postulates that harmonic development in bebop sprang from blues and African-related tonal sensibilities rather than 20th-century Western classical music. \"Auditory inclinations were the African legacy in [Parker's] life, reconfirmed by the experience of the blues tonal system, a sound world at odds with the Western diatonic chord categories. Bebop musicians eliminated Western-style functional harmony in their music while retaining the strong central tonality of the blues as a basis for drawing upon various African matrices.\"\nSamuel Floyd states that blues was both the bedrock and propelling force of bebop, bringing about a new harmonic conception using extended chord structures that led to unprecedented harmonic and melodic variety, a developed and even more highly syncopated, linear rhythmic complexity and a melodic angularity in which the blue note of the fifth degree was established as an important melodic-harmonic device; and reestablishment of the blues as the primary organizing and functional principle. Kubik wrote:\nWhile for an outside observer, the harmonic innovations in bebop would appear to be inspired by experiences in Western \"serious\" music, from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg, such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing. And it is also true that Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz, but bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of all this is that the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to African-American music several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions.\nThese divergences from the jazz mainstream of the time met a divided, sometimes hostile response among fans and musicians, especially swing players who bristled at the new harmonic sounds. To hostile critics, bebop seemed filled with \"racing, nervous phrases\". But despite the friction, by the 1950s bebop had become an accepted part of the jazz vocabulary.\nAfro-Cuban jazz (cu-bop).\nMachito and Mario Bauza.\nThe general consensus among musicians and musicologists is that the first original jazz piece to be overtly based in clave was \"Tanga\" (1943), composed by Cuban-born Mario Bauza and recorded by Machito and his Afro-Cubans in New York City. \"Tanga\" began as a spontaneous descarga (Cuban jam session), with jazz solos superimposed on top.\nThis was the birth of Afro-Cuban jazz. The use of clave brought the African \"timeline\", or \"key pattern\", into jazz. Music organized around key patterns convey a two-celled (binary) structure, which is a complex level of African cross-rhythm. Within the context of jazz, however, harmony is the primary referent, not rhythm. The harmonic progression can begin on either side of clave, and the harmonic \"one\" is always understood to be \"one\". If the progression begins on the \"three-side\" of clave, it is said to be in \"3\u20132 clave\" (shown below). If the progression begins on the \"two-side\", it is in \"2\u20133 clave\".\n&lt;score override_audio=\"3-2 son clave.mid\"&gt;\n\\new RhythmicStaff {\n \\clef percussion\n \\time 4/4\n&lt;/score&gt;\nDizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo.\nMario Bauz\u00e1 introduced bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to Cuban conga drummer and composer Chano Pozo. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration produced some of the most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. \"Manteca\" (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: \"If I'd let it go like [Chano] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge.\" The bridge gave \"Manteca\" a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal \"Tanga\" of a few years earlier.\nGillespie's collaboration with Pozo brought specific African-based rhythms into bebop. While pushing the boundaries of harmonic improvisation, \"cu-bop\" also drew from African rhythm. Jazz arrangements with a Latin A section and a swung B section, with all choruses swung during solos, became common practice with many Latin tunes of the jazz standard repertoire. This approach can be heard on pre-1980 recordings of \"Manteca\", \"A Night in Tunisia\", \"Tin Tin Deo\", and \"On Green Dolphin Street\".\n\"Un Poco Loco\".\nAnother jazz composition critical to the development of Afro-Cuban jazz was Bud Powell's \"Un Poco Loco,\" recorded with Curley Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums. Noted for its \"frenetic energy\" and \"clanging cowbell and polyrhythmic accompaniment,\" the composition combined Afro-Cuban rhythm with polytonality and preceded further use of modality and avant-garde harmony in Latin jazz.\nAfrican cross-rhythm.\nCuban percussionist Mongo Santamaria first recorded his composition \"Afro Blue\" in 1959.\n\"Afro Blue\" was the first jazz standard built upon a typical African three-against-two (3:2) cross-rhythm, or hemiola. The piece begins with the bass repeatedly playing 6 cross-beats per each measure of , or 6 cross-beats per 4 main beats\u20146:4 (two cells of 3:2).\nThe following example shows the original ostinato \"Afro Blue\" bass line. The cross noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes).\n &lt;score&gt;\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\new voice \\relative c {\n \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"acoustic bass\"\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 105\n \\time 12/8\n \\clef bass \n \\new voice \\relative c {\n \\override NoteHead.style = #'cross\n \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nWhen John Coltrane covered \"Afro Blue\" in 1963, he inverted the metric hierarchy, interpreting the tune as a jazz waltz with duple cross-beats superimposed (2:3). Originally a B\u266d pentatonic blues, Coltrane expanded the harmonic structure of \"Afro Blue\".\nPerhaps the most respected Afro-cuban jazz combo of the late 1950s was vibraphonist Cal Tjader's band. Tjader had Mongo Santamaria, Armando Peraza, and Willie Bobo on his early recording dates.\nDixieland revival.\nIn the late 1940s, there was a revival of Dixieland, harking back to the contrapuntal New Orleans style. This was driven in large part by record company reissues of jazz classics by the Oliver, Morton, and Armstrong bands of the 1930s. There were two types of musicians involved in the revival: the first group was made up of those who had begun their careers playing in the traditional style and were returning to it (or continuing what they had been playing all along), such as Bob Crosby's Bobcats, Max Kaminsky, Eddie Condon, and Wild Bill Davison. Most of these players were originally Midwesterners, although there were a small number of New Orleans musicians involved. The second group of revivalists consisted of younger musicians, such as those in the Lu Watters band, Conrad Janis, and Ward Kimball and his Firehouse Five Plus Two Jazz Band. By the late 1940s, Louis Armstrong's Allstars band became a leading ensemble. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Dixieland was one of the most commercially popular jazz styles in the US, Europe, and Japan, although critics paid little attention to it.\nHard bop.\nHard bop is an extension of bebop (or \"bop\") music that incorporates influences from blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel, especially in saxophone and piano playing. Hard bop was developed in the mid-1950s, coalescing in 1953 and 1954; it developed partly in response to the vogue for cool jazz in the early 1950s and paralleled the rise of rhythm and blues. It has been described as \"funky\" and can be considered a relative of soul jazz. Some elements of the genre were simplified from their bebop roots.\nMiles Davis's 1954 performance of \"Walkin'\" at the first Newport Jazz Festival introduced the style to the jazz world. Further leaders of hard bop's development included the Clifford Brown/Max Roach Quintet, Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, the Horace Silver Quintet, and trumpeters Lee Morgan and Freddie Hubbard. The late 1950s to early 1960s saw hard boppers form their own bands as a new generation of blues- and bebop-influenced musicians entered the jazz world, from pianists Wynton Kelly and Tommy Flanagan to saxophonists Joe Henderson and Hank Mobley. Coltrane, Johnny Griffin, Mobley, and Morgan all participated on the album \"A Blowin' Session\" (1957), considered by Al Campbell to have been one of the high points of the hard bop era.\nHard bop was prevalent within jazz for about a decade spanning from 1955 to 1965, but has remained highly influential on mainstream or \"straight-ahead\" jazz. It went into decline in the late 1960s through the 1970s due to the emergence of other styles such as jazz fusion, but again became influential following the Young Lions Movement and the emergence of neo-bop.\nModal jazz.\nModal jazz is a development which began in the later 1950s which takes the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation. Previously, a solo was meant to fit into a given chord progression, but with modal jazz, the soloist creates a melody using one (or a small number of) modes. The emphasis is thus shifted from harmony to melody: \"Historically, this caused a seismic shift among jazz musicians, away from thinking vertically (the chord), and towards a more horizontal approach (the scale)\", explained pianist Mark Levine.\nThe modal theory stems from a work by George Russell. Miles Davis introduced the concept to the greater jazz world with \"Kind of Blue\" (1959), an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz which would become the best selling jazz album of all time. In contrast to Davis's earlier work with hard bop and its complex chord progression and improvisation, \"Kind of Blue\" was composed as a series of modal sketches in which the musicians were given scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style.\n\"I didn't write out the music for \"Kind of Blue\", but brought in sketches for what everybody was supposed to play because I wanted a lot of spontaneity,\" recalled Davis. The track \"So What\" has only two chords: D-7 and E\u266d-7.\nOther innovators in this style include Jackie McLean, and two of the musicians who had also played on \"Kind of Blue\": John Coltrane and Bill Evans.\nFree jazz.\nFree jazz, and the related form of avant-garde jazz, broke through into an open space of \"free tonality\" in which meter, beat, and formal symmetry all disappeared, and a range of world music from India, Africa, and Arabia were melded into an intense, even religiously ecstatic or orgiastic style of playing. While loosely inspired by bebop, free jazz tunes gave players much more latitude; the loose harmony and tempo was deemed controversial when this approach was first developed. The bassist Charles Mingus is also frequently associated with the avant-garde in jazz, although his compositions draw from myriad styles and genres.\nThe first major stirrings came in the 1950s with the early work of Ornette Coleman (whose 1960 album \"\" coined the term) and Cecil Taylor. In the 1960s, exponents included Albert Ayler, Gato Barbieri, Carla Bley, Don Cherry, Larry Coryell, John Coltrane, Bill Dixon, Jimmy Giuffre, Steve Lacy, Michael Mantler, Sun Ra, Roswell Rudd, Pharoah Sanders, and John Tchicai. In developing his late style, Coltrane was especially influenced by the dissonance of Ayler's trio with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, a rhythm section honed with Cecil Taylor as leader. In November 1961, Coltrane played a gig at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the classic \"Chasin' the 'Trane\", which \"DownBeat\" magazine panned as \"anti-jazz\". On his 1961 tour of France, he was booed, but persevered, signing with the new Impulse! Records in 1960 and turning it into \"the house that Trane built\", while championing many younger free jazz musicians, notably Archie Shepp, who often played with trumpeter Bill Dixon, who organized the 4-day \"October Revolution in Jazz\" in Manhattan in 1964, the first free jazz festival.\nA series of recordings with the Classic Quartet in the first half of 1965 show Coltrane's playing becoming increasingly abstract, with greater incorporation of devices like multiphonics, utilization of overtones, and playing in the altissimo register, as well as a mutated return to Coltrane's sheets of sound. In the studio, he all but abandoned his soprano to concentrate on the tenor saxophone. In addition, the quartet responded to the leader by playing with increasing freedom. The group's evolution can be traced through the recordings \"The John Coltrane Quartet Plays\", \"Living Space\" and \"Transition\" (both June 1965), \"New Thing at Newport\" (July 1965), \"Sun Ship\" (August 1965), and \"First Meditations\" (September 1965).\nIn June 1965, Coltrane and 10 other musicians recorded \"Ascension\", a 40-minute-long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avant-garde musicians as well as Coltrane, and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. Dave Liebman later called it \"the torch that lit the free jazz thing\". After recording with the quartet over the next few months, Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane used over-blowing frequently as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would opt to overblow his entire solo, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.\nFree jazz in Europe.\nFree jazz was played in Europe in part because musicians such as Ayler, Taylor, Steve Lacy, and Eric Dolphy spent extended periods of time there, and European musicians such as Michael Mantler and John Tchicai traveled to the U.S. to experience American music firsthand. European contemporary jazz was shaped by Peter Br\u00f6tzmann, John Surman, Krzysztof Komeda, Zbigniew Namys\u0142owski, Tomasz Sta\u0144ko, Lars Gullin, Joe Harriott, Albert Mangelsdorff, Kenny Wheeler, Graham Collier, Michael Garrick and Mike Westbrook. They were eager to develop approaches to music that reflected their heritage.\nSince the 1960s, creative centers of jazz in Europe have developed, such as the creative jazz scene in Amsterdam. Following the work of drummer Han Bennink and pianist Misha Mengelberg, musicians started to explore by improvising collectively until a form (melody, rhythm, a famous song) is found Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead documented the free jazz scene in Amsterdam and some of its main exponents such as the ICP (Instant Composers Pool) orchestra in his book \"New Dutch Swing\". Since the 1990s Keith Jarrett has defended free jazz from criticism. British writer Stuart Nicholson has argued European contemporary jazz has an identity different from American jazz and follows a different trajectory.\nLatin jazz.\nLatin jazz is jazz that employs Latin American rhythms and is generally understood to have a more specific meaning than simply jazz from Latin America. A more precise term might be \"Afro-Latin jazz\", as the jazz subgenre typically employs rhythms that either have a direct analog in Africa or exhibit an African rhythmic influence beyond what is ordinarily heard in other jazz. The two main categories of Latin jazz are Afro-Cuban jazz and Brazilian jazz.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, many jazz musicians had only a basic understanding of Cuban and Brazilian music, and jazz compositions which used Cuban or Brazilian elements were often referred to as \"Latin tunes\", with no distinction between a Cuban son montuno and a Brazilian bossa nova. Even as late as 2000, in Mark Gridley's \"Jazz Styles: History and Analysis\", a bossa nova bass line is referred to as a \"Latin bass figure\". It was not uncommon during the 1960s and 1970s to hear a conga playing a Cuban tumbao while the drumset and bass played a Brazilian bossa nova pattern. Many jazz standards such as \"Manteca\", \"On Green Dolphin Street\" and \"Song for My Father\" have a \"Latin\" A section and a swung B section. Typically, the band would only play an even-eighth \"Latin\" feel in the A section of the head and swing throughout all of the solos. Latin jazz specialists like Cal Tjader tended to be the exception. For example, on a 1959 live Tjader recording of \"A Night in Tunisia\", pianist Vince Guaraldi soloed through the entire form over an authentic mambo.\nAfro-Cuban jazz renaissance.\nFor most of its history, Afro-Cuban jazz had been a matter of superimposing jazz phrasing over Cuban rhythms. But by the end of the 1970s, a new generation of New York City musicians had emerged who were fluent in both salsa dance music and jazz, leading to a new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers Jerry (congas and trumpet) and Andy (bass). During 1974\u20131976, they were members of one of Eddie Palmieri's most experimental salsa groups: salsa was the medium, but Palmieri was stretching the form in new ways. He incorporated parallel fourths, with McCoy Tyner-type vamps. The innovations of Palmieri, the Gonzalez brothers and others led to an Afro-Cuban jazz renaissance in New York City.\nThis occurred in parallel with developments in Cuba The first Cuban band of this new wave was Irakere. Their \"Ch\u00e9kere-son\" (1976) introduced a style of \"Cubanized\" bebop-flavored horn lines that departed from the more angular guajeo-based lines which were typical of Cuban popular music and Latin jazz up until that time. It was based on Charlie Parker's composition \"Billie's Bounce\", jumbled together in a way that fused clave and bebop horn lines. In spite of the ambivalence of some band members towards Irakere's Afro-Cuban folkloric / jazz fusion, their experiments forever changed Cuban jazz: their innovations are still heard in the high level of harmonic and rhythmic complexity in Cuban jazz and in the jazzy and complex contemporary form of popular dance music known as timba.\nAfro-Brazilian jazz.\nBrazilian jazz, such as bossa nova, is derived from samba, with influences from jazz and other 20th-century classical and popular music styles. Bossa is generally moderately paced, with melodies sung in Portuguese or English, whilst the related jazz-samba is an adaptation of street samba into jazz.\nThe bossa nova style was pioneered by Brazilians Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim and was made popular by Elizete Cardoso's recording of \"Chega de Saudade\" on the \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Demais\" LP. Gilberto's initial releases, and the 1959 film \"Black Orpheus\", achieved significant popularity in Latin America; this spread to North America via visiting American jazz musicians. The resulting recordings by Charlie Byrd and Stan Getz cemented bossa nova's popularity and led to a worldwide boom, with 1963's \"Getz/Gilberto\", numerous recordings by famous jazz performers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Frank Sinatra, and the eventual entrenchment of the bossa nova style as a lasting influence in world music.\nBrazilian percussionists such as Airto Moreira and Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos also influenced jazz internationally by introducing Afro-Brazilian folkloric instruments and rhythms into a wide variety of jazz styles, thus attracting a greater audience to them.\nWhile bossa nova has been labeled as jazz by music critics, namely those from outside of Brazil, it has been rejected by many prominent bossa nova musicians such as Jobim, who once said \"Bossa nova is not Brazilian jazz.\"\nAfrican-inspired.\nRhythm.\nThe first jazz standard composed by a non-Latino to use an overt African cross-rhythm was Wayne Shorter's \"Footprints\" (1967). On the version recorded on \"Miles Smiles\" by Miles Davis, the bass switches to a tresillo figure at 2:20. \"Footprints\" is not, however, a Latin jazz tune: African rhythmic structures are accessed directly by Ron Carter (bass) and Tony Williams (drums) via the rhythmic sensibilities of swing. Throughout the piece, the four beats, whether sounded or not, are maintained as the temporal referent. The following example shows the and forms of the bass line. The slashed noteheads indicate the main beats (not bass notes), where one ordinarily taps their foot to \"keep time\".\n &lt;score lang=\"lilypond\"&gt;\n \\relative c, \u00ab\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\new voice {\n \\clef bass \\time 12/8 \\key c \\minor\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100 \n \\new voice {\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100 \n \\time 12/8\n \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { c'4 g'8~ g c4 es4.~ es4 g,8 } \\bar \":|.\"\n \\new Staff \u00ab\n \\new voice {\n \\clef bass \\time 12/8 \\key c \\minor\n \\set Staff.timeSignatureFraction = 4/4\n \\scaleDurations 3/2 {\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 8 = 100 \n \\new voice \\relative c' {\n \\time 12/8\n \\set Staff.timeSignatureFraction = 4/4\n \\scaleDurations 3/2 {\n \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\tempo 4 = 100 \n \\stemUp \\repeat volta 2 { c,8. g'16~ g8 c es4~ es8. g,16 } \\bar \":|.\"\n } \u00bb\n&lt;/score&gt;\nPentatonic scales.\nThe use of pentatonic scales was another trend associated with Africa. The use of pentatonic scales in Africa probably goes back thousands of years.\nMcCoy Tyner perfected the use of the pentatonic scale in his solos, and also used parallel fifths and fourths, which are common harmonies in West Africa.\nThe minor pentatonic scale is often used in blues improvisation, and like a blues scale, a minor pentatonic scale can be played over all of the chords in a blues. The following pentatonic lick was played over blues changes by Joe Henderson on Horace Silver's \"African Queen\" (1965).\nJazz pianist, theorist, and educator Mark Levine refers to the scale generated by beginning on the fifth step of a pentatonic scale as the \"V pentatonic scale\".\nLevine points out that the V pentatonic scale works for all three chords of the standard II\u2013V\u2013I jazz progression. This is a very common progression, used in pieces such as Miles Davis's \"Tune Up\". The following example shows the V pentatonic scale over a II\u2013V\u2013I progression.\nAccordingly, John Coltrane's \"Giant Steps\" (1960), with its 26 chords per 16 bars, can be played using only three pentatonic scales. Coltrane studied Nicolas Slonimsky's \"Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns\", which contains material that is virtually identical to portions of \"Giant Steps\". The harmonic complexity of \"Giant Steps\" is on the level of the most advanced 20th-century art music. Superimposing the pentatonic scale over \"Giant Steps\" is not merely a matter of harmonic simplification, but also a sort of \"Africanizing\" of the piece, which provides an alternate approach for soloing. Mark Levine observes that when mixed in with more conventional \"playing the changes\", pentatonic scales provide \"structure and a feeling of increased space\".\nSacred and liturgical jazz.\nAs noted above, jazz has incorporated from its inception aspects of African-American sacred music including spirituals and hymns. Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals and hymns as part of their repertoire or isolated compositions such as \"Come Sunday\", part of \"Black and Beige Suite\" by Duke Ellington. Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black gospel music. However, it was only after World War II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious settings or as religious expression. Since the 1950s, sacred and liturgical music has been performed and recorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians. The \"Abyssinian Mass\" by Wynton Marsalis (Blueengine Records, 2016) is a recent example.\nRelatively little has been written about sacred and liturgical jazz. In a 2013 doctoral dissertation, Angelo Versace examined the development of sacred jazz in the 1950s using disciplines of musicology and history. He noted that the traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the 1950s to produce a new genre, \"sacred jazz\". Versace maintained that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz. Most prominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams, known for her jazz masses in the 1950s and Duke Ellington. Prior to his death in 1974 in response to contacts from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, Duke Ellington wrote three Sacred Concerts: 1965 \u2013 A Concert of Sacred Music; 1968 \u2013 Second Sacred Concert; 1973 \u2013 Third Sacred Concert.\nThe most prominent form of sacred and liturgical jazz is the jazz mass. Although most often performed in a concert setting rather than church worship setting, this form has many examples. An eminent example of composers of the jazz mass was Mary Lou Williams. Williams converted to Catholicism in 1957, and proceeded to compose three masses in the jazz idiom. One was composed in 1968 to honor the recently assassinated Martin Luther King Jr. and the third was commissioned by a pontifical commission. It was performed once in 1975 in St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. However the Catholic Church has not embraced jazz as appropriate for worship. In 1966 Joe Masters recorded \"Jazz Mass\" for Columbia Records. A jazz ensemble was joined by soloists and choir using the English text of the Roman Catholic Mass. Other examples include \"Jazz Mass in Concert\" by Lalo Schiffrin (Aleph Records, 1998, UPC 0651702632725) and \"Jazz Mass\" by Vince Guaraldi (Fantasy Records, 1965). In England, classical composer Will Todd recorded his \"Jazz Missa Brevis\" with a jazz ensemble, soloists and the St Martin's Voices on a 2018 Signum Records release, \"Passion Music/Jazz Missa Brevis\" also released as \"Mass in Blue\", and jazz organist James Taylor composed \"The Rochester Mass\" (Cherry Red Records, 2015). In 2013, Versace put forth bassist Ike Sturm and New York composer Deanna Witkowski as contemporary exemplars of sacred and liturgical jazz.\nJazz fusion.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hybrid form of jazz-rock fusion was developed by combining jazz improvisation with rock rhythms, electric instruments and the highly amplified stage sound of rock musicians such as Jimi Hendrix and Frank Zappa. Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, odd time signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.\nAccording to AllMusic:\n... until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate. [However, ...] as rock became more creative and its musicianship improved, and as some in the jazz world became bored with hard bop and did not want to play strictly avant-garde music, the two different idioms began to trade ideas and occasionally combine forces.\nMiles Davis's new directions.\nIn 1969, Davis fully embraced the electric instrument approach to jazz with \"In a Silent Way\", which can be considered his first fusion album. Composed of two side-long suites edited heavily by producer Teo Macero, this quiet, static album would be equally influential to the development of ambient music.\nAs Davis recalls:\nThe music I was really listening to in 1968 was James Brown, the great guitar player Jimi Hendrix, and a new group who had just come out with a hit record, \"Dance to the Music\", Sly and the Family Stone ... I wanted to make it more like rock. When we recorded \"In a Silent Way\" I just threw out all the chord sheets and told everyone to play off of that.\nTwo contributors to \"In a Silent Way\" also joined organist Larry Young to create one of the early acclaimed fusion albums: \"Emergency!\" (1969) by The Tony Williams Lifetime.\nPsychedelic-jazz.\nWeather Report.\nWeather Report's self-titled electronic and psychedelic \"Weather Report\" debut album caused a sensation in the jazz world on its arrival in 1971, thanks to the pedigree of the group's members (including percussionist Airto Moreira), and their unorthodox approach to music. The album featured a softer sound than would be the case in later years (predominantly using acoustic bass with Shorter exclusively playing soprano saxophone, and with no synthesizers involved), but is still considered a classic of early fusion. It built on the avant-garde experiments which Joe Zawinul and Shorter had pioneered with Miles Davis on \"Bitches Brew\", including an avoidance of head-and-chorus composition in favor of continuous rhythm and movement \u2013 but took the music further. To emphasize the group's rejection of standard methodology, the album opened with the inscrutable avant-garde atmospheric piece \"Milky Way\", which featured by Shorter's extremely muted saxophone inducing vibrations in Zawinul's piano strings while the latter pedaled the instrument. \"DownBeat\" described the album as \"music beyond category\", and awarded it Album of the Year in the magazine's polls that year.\nWeather Report's subsequent releases were creative funk-jazz works.\nJazz-rock.\nAlthough some jazz purists protested against the blend of jazz and rock, many jazz innovators crossed over from the contemporary hard bop scene into fusion. As well as the electric instruments of rock (such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric piano and synthesizer keyboards), fusion also used the powerful amplification, \"fuzz\" pedals, wah-wah pedals and other effects that were used by 1970s-era rock bands. Notable performers of jazz fusion included Miles Davis, Eddie Harris, keyboardists Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, and Herbie Hancock, vibraphonist Gary Burton, drummer Tony Williams, violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, guitarists Larry Coryell, Al Di Meola, John McLaughlin, Ryo Kawasaki, and Frank Zappa, saxophonist Wayne Shorter and bassists Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke. Jazz fusion was also popular in Japan, where the band Casiopea released more than thirty fusion albums.\nAccording to jazz writer Stuart Nicholson, \"just as free jazz appeared on the verge of creating a whole new musical language in the 1960s ... jazz-rock briefly suggested the promise of doing the same\" with albums such as Williams's \"Emergency!\" (1970) and Davis's \"Agharta\" (1975), which Nicholson said \"suggested the potential of evolving into something that might eventually define itself as a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before.\" This development was stifled by commercialism, Nicholson said, as the genre \"mutated into a peculiar species of jazz-inflected pop music that eventually took up residence on FM radio\" at the end of the 1970s.\nElectronic music.\nAlthough jazz-rock fusion reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s, the use of electronic instruments and rock-derived musical elements in jazz continued in the 1990s and 2000s. Musicians using this approach include Pat Metheny, John Abercrombie, John Scofield and the Swedish group e.s.t. Since the beginning of the 1990s, electronic music had significant technical improvements that popularized and created new possibilities for the genre. Jazz elements such as improvisation, rhythmic complexities and harmonic textures were introduced to the genre and consequently had a big impact in new listeners and in some ways kept the versatility of jazz relatable to a newer generation that did not necessarily relate to what the traditionalists call real jazz (bebop, cool and modal jazz). Artists such as Squarepusher, Aphex Twin, Flying Lotus and sub genres like IDM, drum 'n' bass, jungle and techno ended up incorporating a lot of these elements. Squarepusher being cited as one big influence for jazz performers drummer Mark Guiliana and pianist Brad Mehldau, showing the correlations between jazz and electronic music are a two-way street.\nJazz-funk.\nBy the mid-1970s, the sound known as jazz-funk had developed, characterized by a strong back beat (groove), electrified sounds and, often, the presence of electronic analog synthesizers. Jazz-funk also draws influences from traditional African music, Afro-Cuban rhythms and Jamaican reggae, notably Kingston bandleader Sonny Bradshaw. Another feature is the shift of emphasis from improvisation to composition: arrangements, melody and overall writing became important. The integration of funk, soul, and R&amp;B music into jazz resulted in the creation of a genre whose spectrum is wide and ranges from strong jazz improvisation to soul, funk or disco with jazz arrangements, jazz riffs and jazz solos, and sometimes soul vocals.\nEarly examples are Herbie Hancock's Headhunters band and Miles Davis's \"On the Corner\" album, which, in 1972, began Davis's foray into jazz-funk and was, he claimed, an attempt at reconnecting with the young black audience which had largely forsaken jazz for rock and funk. While there is a discernible rock and funk influence in the timbres of the instruments employed, other tonal and rhythmic textures, such as the Indian tambora and tablas and Cuban congas and bongos, create a multi-layered soundscape. The album was a culmination of sorts of the \"musique concr\u00e8te\" approach that Davis and producer Teo Macero had begun to explore in the late 1960s.\nStraight-ahead jazz.\nThe 1980s saw something of a reaction against the fusion and free jazz that had dominated the 1970s. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis emerged early in the decade, and strove to create music within what he believed was the tradition, rejecting both fusion and free jazz and creating extensions of the small and large forms initially pioneered by artists such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, as well as the hard bop of the 1950s. It is debatable whether Marsalis's critical and commercial success was a cause or a symptom of the reaction against Fusion and Free Jazz and the resurgence of interest in the kind of jazz pioneered in the 1960s (particularly modal jazz and post-bop); nonetheless there were many other manifestations of a resurgence of traditionalism, even if fusion and free jazz were by no means abandoned and continued to develop and evolve.\nFor example, several musicians who had been prominent in the fusion genre during the 1970s began to record acoustic jazz once more, including Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock. Other musicians who had experimented with electronic instruments in the previous decade had abandoned them by the 1980s; for example, Bill Evans, Joe Henderson, and Stan Getz. Even the 1980s music of Miles Davis, although certainly still fusion, adopted a far more accessible and recognizably jazz-oriented approach than his abstract work of the mid-1970s, such as a return to a theme-and-solos approach.\nA similar reaction took place against free jazz. According to Ted Gioia:the very leaders of the avant garde started to signal a retreat from the core principles of free jazz. Anthony Braxton began recording standards over familiar chord changes. Cecil Taylor played duets in concert with Mary Lou Williams, and let her set out structured harmonies and familiar jazz vocabulary under his blistering keyboard attack. And the next generation of progressive players would be even more accommodating, moving inside and outside the changes without thinking twice. Musicians such as David Murray or Don Pullen may have felt the call of free-form jazz, but they never forgot all the other ways one could play African-American music for fun and profit.\nPianist Keith Jarrett\u2014whose bands of the 1970s had played only original compositions with prominent free jazz elements\u2014established his so-called 'Standards Trio' in 1983, which, although also occasionally exploring collective improvisation, has primarily performed and recorded jazz standards. Chick Corea similarly began exploring jazz standards in the 1980s, having neglected them for the 1970s.\nIn 1987, the United States House of Representatives and Senate passed a bill proposed by Democratic Representative John Conyers Jr. to define jazz as a unique form of American music, stating \"jazz is hereby designated as a rare and valuable national American treasure to which we should devote our attention, support and resources to make certain it is preserved, understood and promulgated.\" It passed in the House on September 23, 1987, and in the Senate on November 4, 1987.\nIn 2001, Ken Burns's documentary \"Jazz\" premiered on PBS, featuring Wynton Marsalis and other experts reviewing the entire history of American jazz to that time. It received some criticism, however, for its failure to reflect the many distinctive non-American traditions and styles in jazz that had developed, and its limited representation of US developments in the last quarter of the 20th century.\nNeo-bop.\nThe emergence of young jazz talent beginning to perform in older, established musicians' groups further impacted the resurgence of traditionalism in the jazz community. In the 1970s, the groups of Betty Carter and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers retained their conservative jazz approaches in the midst of fusion and jazz-rock, and in addition to difficulty booking their acts, struggled to find younger generations of personnel to authentically play traditional styles such as hard bop and bebop. In the late 1970s, however, a resurgence of younger jazz players in Blakey's band began to occur. This movement included musicians such as Valery Ponomarev and Bobby Watson, Dennis Irwin and James Williams. In the 1980s, in addition to Wynton and Branford Marsalis, the emergence of pianists in the Jazz Messengers such as Donald Brown, Mulgrew Miller, and later, Benny Green, bassists such as Charles Fambrough, Lonnie Plaxico (and later, Peter Washington and Essiet Essiet) horn players such as Bill Pierce, Donald Harrison and later Javon Jackson and Terence Blanchard emerged as talented jazz musicians, all of whom made significant contributions in the 1990s and 2000s.\nThe young Jazz Messengers' contemporaries, including Roy Hargrove, Marcus Roberts, Wallace Roney and Mark Whitfield were also influenced by Wynton Marsalis's emphasis toward jazz tradition. These younger rising stars rejected avant-garde approaches and instead championed the acoustic jazz sound of Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk and early recordings of the first Miles Davis quintet. This group of \"Young Lions\" sought to reaffirm jazz as a high art tradition comparable to the discipline of classical music.\nIn addition, Betty Carter's rotation of young musicians in her group foreshadowed many of New York's preeminent traditional jazz players later in their careers. Among these musicians were Jazz Messenger alumni Benny Green, Branford Marsalis and Ralph Peterson Jr., as well as Kenny Washington, Lewis Nash, Curtis Lundy, Cyrus Chestnut, Mark Shim, Craig Handy, Greg Hutchinson and Marc Cary, Taurus Mateen and Geri Allen. O.T.B. ensemble included a rotation of young jazz musicians such as Kenny Garrett, Steve Wilson, Kenny Davis, Renee Rosnes, Ralph Peterson Jr., Billy Drummond, and Robert Hurst.\nStarting in the 1990s, a number of players from largely straight-ahead or post-bop backgrounds emerged as a result of the rise of neo-traditionalist jazz, including pianists Jason Moran and Vijay Iyer, guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel, vibraphonist Stefon Harris, trumpeters Roy Hargrove and Terence Blanchard, saxophonists Chris Potter and Joshua Redman, clarinetist Ken Peplowski and bassist Christian McBride.\nSmooth jazz.\nIn the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called \"pop fusion\" or \"smooth jazz\" became successful, garnering significant radio airplay in \"quiet storm\" time slots at radio stations in urban markets across the U.S. This helped to establish or bolster the careers of vocalists including Al Jarreau, Anita Baker, Chaka Khan, and Sade, as well as saxophonists including Grover Washington Jr., Kenny G, Kirk Whalum, Boney James, and David Sanborn. In general, smooth jazz is downtempo (the most widely played tracks are of 90\u2013105 beats per minute), and has a lead melody-playing instrument (saxophone, especially soprano and tenor, and legato electric guitar are popular).\nIn his \"Newsweek\" article \"The Problem With Jazz Criticism\", Stanley Crouch considers Miles Davis's playing of fusion to be a turning point that led to smooth jazz. Critic Aaron J. West has countered the often negative perceptions of smooth jazz, stating:\nI challenge the prevalent marginalization and malignment of smooth jazz in the standard jazz narrative. Furthermore, I question the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.\nAcid jazz, nu jazz, and jazz rap.\nAcid jazz developed in the UK in the 1980s and 1990s, influenced by jazz-funk and electronic dance music. Acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including sampling or live DJ cutting and scratching), but it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. Richard S. Ginell of AllMusic considers Roy Ayers \"one of the prophets of acid jazz\".\nNu jazz is influenced by jazz harmony and melodies, and there are usually no improvisational aspects. It can be very experimental in nature and can vary widely in sound and concept. It ranges from the combination of live instrumentation with the beats of jazz house (as exemplified by St Germain, Jazzanova, and Fila Brazillia) to more band-based improvised jazz with electronic elements (for example, The Cinematic Orchestra, Kobol and the Norwegian \"future jazz\" style pioneered by Bugge Wesseltoft, Jaga Jazzist, and Nils Petter Molv\u00e6r).\nJazz rap developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and incorporates jazz influences into hip-hop. In 1988, Gang Starr released the debut single \"Words I Manifest\", which sampled Dizzy Gillespie's 1962 \"Night in Tunisia\", and Stetsasonic released \"Talkin' All That Jazz\", which sampled Lonnie Liston Smith. Gang Starr's debut LP \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" (1989) and their 1990 track \"Jazz Thing\" sampled Charlie Parker and Ramsey Lewis. The groups which made up the Native Tongues Posse tended toward jazzy releases: these include the Jungle Brothers' debut \"Straight Out the Jungle\" (1988), and A Tribe Called Quest's \"People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm\" (1990) and \"The Low End Theory\" (1991). Rap duo Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth incorporated jazz influences on their 1992 debut \"Mecca and the Soul Brother\". Rapper Guru's Jazzmatazz series began in 1993 using jazz musicians during the studio recordings.\nAlthough jazz rap had achieved little mainstream success, Miles Davis's final album \"Doo-Bop\" (released posthumously in 1992) was based on hip-hop beats and collaborations with producer Easy Mo Bee. Davis's ex-bandmate Herbie Hancock also absorbed hip-hop influences in the mid-1990s, releasing the album \"Dis Is da Drum\" in 1994.\nThe mid-2010s saw an increased influence of R&amp;B, hip-hop, and pop music on jazz. In 2015, Kendrick Lamar released his third studio album, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\". The album heavily featured prominent contemporary jazz artists such as Thundercat and redefined jazz rap with a larger focus on improvisation and live soloing rather than simply sampling. In that same year, saxophonist Kamasi Washington released his nearly three-hour long debut, \"The Epic\". Its hip-hop inspired beats and R&amp;B vocal interludes was not only acclaimed by critics for being innovative in keeping jazz relevant, but also sparked a small resurgence in jazz on the internet.\nPunk jazz and jazzcore.\nThe relaxation of orthodoxy which was concurrent with post-punk in London and New York City led to a new appreciation of jazz. In London, the Pop Group began to mix free jazz and dub reggae into their brand of punk rock. In New York, No Wave took direct inspiration from both free jazz and punk. Examples of this style include Lydia Lunch's \"Queen of Siam\", Gray, the work of James Chance and the Contortions (who mixed Soul with free jazz and punk) and the Lounge Lizards (the first group to call themselves \"punk jazz\").\nJohn Zorn took note of the emphasis on speed and dissonance that was becoming prevalent in punk rock, and incorporated this into free jazz with the release of the \"Spy vs. Spy\" album in 1986, a collection of Ornette Coleman tunes done in the contemporary thrashcore style. In the same year, Sonny Sharrock, Peter Br\u00f6tzmann, Bill Laswell, and Ronald Shannon Jackson recorded the first album under the name Last Exit, a similarly aggressive blend of thrash and free jazz. These developments are the origins of \"jazzcore\", the fusion of free jazz with hardcore punk.\nM-Base.\nThe M-Base movement started in the 1980s, when a loose collective of young African-American musicians in New York that included Steve Coleman, Greg Osby, and Gary Thomas developed a complex but grooving sound.\nIn the 1990s, most M-Base participants turned to more conventional music, but Coleman, the most active participant, continued developing his music in accordance with the M-Base concept.\nColeman's audience decreased, but his music and concepts influenced many musicians, according to pianist Vijay Iver and critic Ben Ratlifff of \"The New York Times\".\nM-Base changed from a movement of a loose collective of young musicians to a kind of informal Coleman \"school\", with a much advanced but already originally implied concept. Steve Coleman's music and M-Base concept gained recognition as \"next logical step\" after Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Ornette Coleman.\nJazz pluralism.\nSince the 1990s, jazz has been characterized by a pluralism in which no one style dominates, but rather a wide range of styles and genres are popular. Individual performers often play in a variety of styles, sometimes in the same performance. Pianist Brad Mehldau and The Bad Plus have explored contemporary rock music within the context of the traditional jazz acoustic piano trio, recording instrumental jazz versions of songs by rock musicians. The Bad Plus have also incorporated elements of free jazz into their music. A firm avant-garde or free jazz stance has been maintained by some players, such as saxophonists Greg Osby and Charles Gayle, while others, such as James Carter, have incorporated free jazz elements into a more traditional framework.\nHarry Connick Jr. began his career playing stride piano and the Dixieland jazz of his home, New Orleans, beginning with his first recording when he was 10 years old. Some of his earliest lessons were at the home of pianist Ellis Marsalis. Connick had success on the pop charts after recording the soundtrack to the movie \"When Harry Met Sally\", which sold over two million copies. Crossover success has also been achieved by Diana Krall, Norah Jones, Cassandra Wilson, Kurt Elling, and Jamie Cullum.\nAdditionally, the era saw the release of recordings and videos from the previous century, such as a Just Jazz tape broadcast by a band led by Gene Ammons and studio archives such as \"Just Coolin\"' by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.\nSocial media.\nAn internet-aided trend of 2010's jazz was that of extreme reharmonization, inspired by both virtuosic players known for their speed and rhythm such as Art Tatum, as well as players known for their ambitious voicings and chords such as Bill Evans. Supergroup Snarky Puppy adopted this trend, allowing players like Cory Henry to shape the grooves and harmonies of modern jazz soloing. YouTube phenomenon Jacob Collier also gained recognition for his ability to play an incredibly large number of instruments and his ability to use microtones, advanced polyrhythms, and blend a spectrum of genres in his largely homemade production process.\nOther jazz musicians gained popularity through social media during the 2010s and 2020s. These included Joan Chamorro, a bassist and bandleader based in Barcelona whose big band and jazz combo videos have received tens of millions of views on YouTube, and Emmet Cohen, who broadcast a series of performances live from New York starting in March 2020.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the author of the satirical prose novel \"Gulliver's Travels\" (1726) and the creator of the fictional island of Lilliput, and he is regarded by many as the greatest satirist of the Georgian era and one of the foremost prose satirists in both English and world literature.\nSwift also authored works such as \"A Tale of a Tub\" (1704) and \"An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity\" (1712). He originally published all of his works under pseudonyms\u2014including Lemuel Gulliver, Isaac Bickerstaff, M. B. Drapier\u2014or anonymously. He was a master of two styles of satire, the Horatian and Juvenalian styles. In 1713, he was appointed the dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and was given the sobriquet \"Dean Swift\". His trademark deadpan and ironic style of writing, particularly in later works such as \"A Modest Proposal\" (1729), has led to such satire being subsequently termed as \"Swiftian\". During the early part of his career, he travelled extensively in Ireland and Great Britain, and these trips helped develop his understanding of human nature and social conditions, which he would later depict in his satirical works. Swift was also very active in clerical circles, due to his affiliations to St Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin. He had supported the Glorious Revolution and joined the Whigs party early on. Swift was related to many prominent figures of his time, including John Temple, John Dryden, William Davenant, and Francis Godwin.\nIn 1700, Swift moved to Trim, County Meath, and many of his major works were written during this time. His writings reflected much of his political experiences of the previous decade, especially those with the British government under the Tories. Swift used several pseudonyms to publish his early works, with Isaac Bickerstaff being the most recognisable one. Scholars of his works have also suggested that these pseudonyms might have protected Swift from persecution in the politically sensitive conditions of England and Ireland under which he wrote many of his popular satires.\nSince the late 18th century, Swift has emerged as the most popular Irish author globally, and his novel \"Gulliver's Travels\", which is considered one of the most famous classics of both English and world literature, has retained its position as the most printed book by an Irish writer in libraries and bookstores worldwide. He continues to be held in high regard in Ireland with many streets, monuments, festivals, and regional tourist attractions named after him. Swift has also influenced several notable authors over the following centuries, including John Ruskin and George Orwell.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nJonathan Swift was born on 30 November 1667 in Dublin in the Kingdom of Ireland. He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift (1640\u20131667) and his wife Abigail Erick (or Herrick) of Frisby on the Wreake in Leicestershire. His father was a native of Goodrich, Herefordshire, but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their royalist father's estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War. His maternal grandfather, James Ericke, was the vicar of Thornton in Leicestershire. In 1634 the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices. Sometime thereafter, Ericke and his family, including his young daughter Abigail, fled to Ireland.\nSwift's father joined his elder brother, Godwin, in the practice of law in Ireland. He died in Dublin about seven months before his namesake was born. He died of syphilis, which he said he got from dirty sheets when out of town.\nHis mother returned to England after his birth, leaving him in the care of his uncle Godwin Swift (1628\u20131695), a close friend and confidant of Sir John Temple, whose son later employed Swift as his secretary.\nAt the age of one, child Jonathan was taken by his wet nurse to her hometown of Whitehaven, Cumberland, England. He said that there he learned to read the Bible. His nurse returned him to his mother, still in Ireland, when he was three.\nSwift's family had several interesting literary connections. His grandmother Elizabeth (Dryden) Swift was the niece of Sir Erasmus Dryden, grandfather of poet John Dryden. The same grandmother's aunt Katherine (Throckmorton) Dryden was a first cousin of Elizabeth, wife of Sir Walter Raleigh. His great-great-grandmother Margaret (Godwin) Swift was the sister of Francis Godwin, author of \"The Man in the Moone\" which influenced parts of Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\". His uncle Thomas Swift married a daughter of poet and playwright Sir William Davenant, a godson of William Shakespeare. \nSwift's benefactor and uncle Godwin Swift took primary responsibility for the young man, sending him with one of his cousins to Kilkenny College (also attended by philosopher George Berkeley). He arrived there at the age of six, where he was expected to have already learned the basic declensions in Latin. He had not and thus began his schooling in a lower form. Swift left the school in 1682, when he was 15.\nHe entered Trinity College Dublin in 1682, financed by Godwin's son Willoughby. The four-year course followed a curriculum largely set in the Middle Ages for the priesthood. The lectures were dominated by Aristotelian logic and philosophy. The basic skill taught to students was debate, and they were expected to be able to argue both sides of any argument or topic. Swift was an above-average student but not exceptional, and received his B.A. in 1686 \"by special grace\".\nAdult life.\nSwift was studying for his master's degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the Glorious Revolution forced him to leave for England in 1688, where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of Sir William Temple at Moor Park, Farnham. Temple was an English diplomat who had arranged the Triple Alliance of 1668. He had retired from public service to his country estate, to tend his gardens and write his memoirs. Gaining his employer's confidence, Swift \"was often trusted with matters of great importance.\" Within three years of their acquaintance, Temple introduced his secretary to William\u00a0III and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments. \nSwift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met Esther Johnson, then eight years old, the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temple's sister Lady Giffard. Swift was her tutor and mentor, giving her the nickname \"Stella\", and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esther's life.\nIn 1690, Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health, but returned to Moor Park the following year. The illness consisted of fits of vertigo or giddiness, now believed to be M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and it continued to plague him throughout his life. During this second stay with Temple, Swift received his M.A. from Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1692. He then left Moor Park, apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temple's patronage, in order to become an ordained priest in the Established Church of Ireland. He was appointed to the prebend of Kilroot in the Diocese of Connor in 1694, with his parish located at Kilroot, near Carrickfergus in County Antrim. \nSwift appears to have been miserable in his new position, being isolated in a small, remote community far from the centres of power and influence. While at Kilroot, however, he may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring, whom he called \"Varina\", the sister of an old college friend. \nA letter from him survives, offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused. She presumably refused, because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temple's service at Moor Park in 1696, and he remained there until Temple's death. There he was employed in helping to prepare Temple's memoirs and correspondence for publication. During this time, Swift wrote \"The Battle of the Books\", a satire responding to critics of Temple's \"Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning\" (1690), though \"Battle\" was not published until 1704. \nTemple died on 27 January 1699. Swift, normally a harsh judge of human nature, said that all that was good and amiable in mankind had died with Temple. He stayed on briefly in England to complete editing Temple's memoirs, and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England. His eventual publication of the third volume of Temple's memoirs, in 1709, made enemies among some of Temple's family and friends, in particular Temple's formidable sister Martha, Lady Giffard, who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs. Moreover, she noted that Swift had borrowed from her own biography, an accusation that Swift denied. Swift's next move was to approach King William directly, based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position. This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley, one of the Lords Justice of Ireland. However, when he reached Ireland, he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another, though he soon obtained the living of Laracor, Agher, and Rathbeggan, and the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.\nSwift ministered to a congregation of about 15 at Laracor, which was just over from Summerhill, County Meath, and from Dublin. He had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden, making a canal after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park, planting willows, and rebuilding the vicarage. As chaplain to Lord Berkeley, he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years. In 1701, he anonymously published the political pamphlet \"A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome\". \nWriter.\nSwift resided in Trim, County Meath after 1700. He wrote many of his works during this period. In February 1702, Swift received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Trinity College Dublin. That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October, accompanied by Esther Johnson\u2014now 20\u2014and his friend Rebecca Dingley, another member of William Temple's household. There is a great mystery and controversy over Swift's relationship with Esther Johnson, nicknamed \"Stella\". Many, notably his close friend Thomas Sheridan, believed that they were secretly married in 1716; others, like Swift's housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley, who lived with Stella all through her years in Ireland, dismissed the story as absurd. Yet Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else: in 1704, when their mutual friend William Tisdall informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella, Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea. Although the tone of the letter was courteous, Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an \"interloper\", and they were estranged for many years. In 1713, Swift was appointed as Dean of St Patrick's Cathdral, Dublin, a position he held until his death. \nDuring his visits to England in these years, Swift published \"A Tale of a Tub\" and \"The Battle of the Books\" (1704) and began to gain a reputation as a writer. This led to close, lifelong friendships with Alexander Pope, John Gay, and John Arbuthnot, forming the core of the Martinus Scriblerus Club (founded in 1713). \nSwift became increasingly active politically in these years. Swift had supported the Glorious Revolution and early in his life belonged to the Whigs. As a member of the Anglican Church, he feared a return of the Catholic monarchy and \"Papist\" absolutism. From 1707 to 1709 and again in 1710, Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the Whig administration of Lord Godolphin the claims of the Irish clergy to the First-Fruits and Twentieths (\"Queen Anne's Bounty\"), which brought in about \u00a32,500 a year, already granted to their brethren in England. He found the opposition Tory leadership more sympathetic to his cause, and when they came to power in 1710, he was recruited to support their cause as editor of \"The Examiner\". In 1711, Swift published the political pamphlet \"The Conduct of the Allies\", attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France. The incoming Tory government conducted secret (and illegal) negotiations with France, resulting in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) ending the War of the Spanish Succession. \nSwift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government, and often acted as mediator between Henry St John (Viscount Bolingbroke), the secretary of state for foreign affairs (1710\u201315), and Robert Harley (Earl of Oxford), lord treasurer and prime minister (1711\u201314). Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson, collected and published after his death as \"A Journal to Stella\". The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in 1714. With the death of Queen Anne and the accession of George I that year, the Whigs returned to power, and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France. \nSwift has been described by scholars as \"a Whig in politics and Tory in religion\" and Swift related his own views in similar terms, stating that as \"a lover of liberty, I found myself to be what they called a Whig in politics\u00a0... But, as to religion, I confessed myself to be an High-Churchman.\" In his \"Thoughts on Religion\", fearing the intense partisan strife waged over religious belief in seventeenth-century England, Swift wrote that \"Every man, as a member of the commonwealth, ought to be content with the possession of his own opinion in private.\" However, it should be borne in mind that, during Swift's time period, terms like \"Whig\" and \"Tory\" both encompassed a wide array of opinions and factions, and neither term aligns with a modern political party or modern political alignments.\nAlso during these years in London, Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family, Dutch merchants who had settled in Ireland, then moved to London, and \"became involved with\" one of the daughters, Esther. Swift furnished Esther with the nickname \"Vanessa\"\u2014derived by adding \"Essa\", a pet form of Esther, to the \"Van\" of her surname, Vanhomrigh\u2014and she features as one of the main characters in his poem \"Cadenus and Vanessa\". This poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift and that he may have reciprocated her affections, only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship. Esther followed Swift to Ireland in 1714 and settled at her old family home, Celbridge Abbey. Their uneasy relationship continued for some years; then there appears to have been a confrontation, possibly involving Esther Johnson. Esther Vanhomrigh died in 1723 at the age of 35, after having destroyed the will she had made in Swift's favour. Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was Anne Long, a \"toast\" of the Kit-Cat Club. \nFinal years.\nBefore the fall of the Tory government, Swift had hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England. However, Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts. Her dislike has been attributed to \"A Tale of a Tub\", which she thought blasphemous, compounded by \"The Windsor Prophecy\", where Swift, with a surprising lack of tact, advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and should not trust. The best position his friends could secure for him was the Deanery of St Patrick's; while this appointment was not in the Queen's gift, Anne, who could be a bitter enemy, made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it. With the return of the Whigs, Swift's best move was to leave England, and he returned to Ireland in disappointment, a virtual exile, to live \"like a rat in a hole\".\nOnce in Ireland, however, Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes, producing some of his most memorable works: \"Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture\" (1720), \"Drapier's Letters\" (1724), and \"A Modest Proposal\" (1729), earned him the status of an Irish patriot. This new role was unwelcome to the Government, which made clumsy attempts to silence him. His printer, Edward Waters, was convicted of seditious libel in 1720, but four years later a grand jury refused to find that the \"Drapier's Letters\", which though written under a pseudonym were universally known to be Swift's work, were seditious. Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity, his principal target being the \"vile and profligate villain\" William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.\nAlso during these years, he began writing his masterpiece, \"Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World, in Four Parts, by Lemuel Gulliver, first a surgeon, and then a captain of several ships\", better known as \"Gulliver's Travels\". Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade. For instance, the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories' illegal peace treaty, a treaty he regarded as a good thing accomplished in an unfortunate manner. In 1726 he paid a long-deferred visit to London, taking with him the manuscript of \"Gulliver's Travels\". During his visit, he stayed with his old friends Alexander Pope, John Arbuthnot and John Gay, who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book in November 1726. It was an immediate hit, with a total of three printings that year and another in early 1727. French, German, and Dutch translations appeared in 1727, and pirated copies were printed in Ireland. \nIn 1727, Swift returned to England one more time and stayed once again with Alexander Pope. The visit was cut short when Swift, receiving word that Esther Johnson was dying, rushed back home to be with her. On 28 January 1728, Johnson died; Swift had prayed at her bedside, even composing prayers for her comfort. Swift could not bear to be present at the end, but on the night of her death he began to write his \"The Death of Mrs Johnson\". He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patrick's. Many years later, a lock of hair, assumed to be Johnson's, was found in his desk, wrapped in a paper bearing the words, \"Only a woman's hair.\" \nDeath.\nDeath became a persistent preoccupation in Swift's mind from this point. In 1731 he wrote \"Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift\", his own obituary, published in 1739. In 1732, his good friend and collaborator John Gay had died. In 1735, John Arbuthnot, another friend from his days in London, also died, and in 1738 Swift too began to show signs of illness, perhaps even suffering a stroke in 1742, losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled. (\"I shall be like that tree\", he once said. \"I shall die at the top.\") He became increasingly quarrelsome, and long-standing friendships, like that with Thomas Sheridan, ended without sufficient cause. To protect him from unscrupulous hangers-on, who had begun to prey on the great man, his closest companions had him declared of \"unsound mind and memory.\" However, it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point. In his book \"Literature and Western Man\", author J. B. Priestley even cites the final chapters of \"Gulliver's Travels\" as proof of Swift's approaching \"insanity\". Bewley attributes his decline to 'terminal dementia'.\nIn part VIII of his series, \"The Story of Civilization\", Will Durant describes the final years of Swift's life as exhibiting:\nDefinite symptoms of madness ... [first appearing] in 1738. In 1741, guardians were appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of violence, he should do himself harm. In 1742, he suffered great pain from the inflammation of his left eye, which swelled to the size of ... [a chicken's] egg; five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye. He went a whole year without uttering a word.\nIn 1744, Alexander Pope died. Then on 19 October 1745, Swift died, at nearly 78. After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects, he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnson's side, in accordance with his wishes. The bulk of his fortune (\u00a312,000) was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill, originally known as St Patrick's Hospital for Imbeciles, which opened in 1757, and which still exists as a psychiatric hospital.\n \"(Text extracted from the introduction to \"The Journal to Stella\" by George A. Aitken and from other sources).\"\nJonathan Swift wrote his own epitaph:\nW. B. Yeats poetically translated it from the Latin as:\n Swift has sailed into his rest;\n Savage indignation there\n Cannot lacerate his breast.\n Imitate him if you dare,\n World-besotted traveller; he\n Served human liberty.\nHis library is known through sale catalogues.\nSwift, Stella and Vanessa \u2013 an alternative view.\nBritish politician Michael Foot was a great admirer of Swift and wrote about him extensively. In \"Debts of Honour\" he cites with approbation an explanation propounded by Denis Johnston of Swift's behaviour towards Stella and Vanessa.\nPointing to contradictions in the received information about Swift's origins and parentage, Johnston postulates that Swift's real father was Sir William Temple's father, Sir John Temple, who was Master of the Rolls in Dublin at the time. It is widely thought that Stella was Sir William Temple's illegitimate daughter. So, if these speculations are to be credited, Swift was Sir William's brother and Stella's uncle. Marriage or close relations between Swift and Stella would therefore have been incestuous, an unthinkable prospect. \nIt follows that Swift could not have married Vanessa without Stella appearing to be a cast-off mistress, which appearance he would not contemplate leaving. Johnston's theory is expounded fully in his book \"In Search of Swift\". He is also cited in the \"Dictionary of Irish Biography\" and the theory is presented without attribution in the \"Concise Cambridge History of English Literature\".\nWorks.\nSwift was a prolific writer. The collection of his prose works (Herbert Davis, ed. Basil Blackwell, 1965\u2013) comprises fourteen volumes. A 1983 edition of his complete poetry (Pat Rodges, ed. Penguin, 1983) is 953 pages long. One edition of his correspondence (David Woolley, ed. P. Lang, 1999) fills three volumes.\nMajor prose works.\nSwift's first major prose/satire work, \"A Tale of a Tub\" (1704, 1710), demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work. It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets. In its main thread, the \"Tale\" recounts the exploits of three sons, representing the main threads of Christianity, who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each, with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever. However, the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion, and begin to look for loopholes in their father's will that will let them make the needed alterations. As each finds his own means of getting around their father's admonition, they struggle with each other for power and dominance. Inserted into this story, in alternating chapters, the narrator includes a series of whimsical \"digressions\" on various subjects.\nIn 1690, Sir William Temple, Swift's patron, published \"An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning\" a defence of classical writing (see Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns), holding up the \"Epistles of Phalaris\" as an example. William Wotton responded to Temple with \"Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning\" (1694), showing that the \"Epistles\" were a later forgery. A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by Charles Boyle (later the 4th Earl of Orrery and father of Swift's first biographer). A further retort on the Modern side came from Richard Bentley, one of the pre-eminent scholars of the day, in his essay \"Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris\" (1699). The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his \"Battle of the Books\" (1697, published 1704) in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients. \nIn 1708, a cobbler named John Partridge published a popular almanac of astrological predictions. Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials, Swift attacked Partridge in \"Predictions for the Ensuing Year\" by Isaac Bickerstaff, a parody predicting that Partridge would die on 29 March. Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on 30 March claiming that Partridge had in fact died, which was widely believed despite Partridge's statements to the contrary. According to other sources, Richard Steele used the persona of Isaac Bickerstaff, and was the one who wrote about the \"death\" of John Partridge and published it in \"The Spectator\", not Jonathan Swift.\nThe \"Drapier's Letters\" (1724) was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to William Wood to mint copper coinage for Ireland. It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order to make a profit. In these \"letters\", Swift posed as a shopkeeper or draper to criticise the plan. Swift's writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author. Though hardly a secret (on returning to Dublin after one of his trips to England, Swift was greeted with a banner, \"Welcome Home, Drapier\") no one turned Swift in, although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher John Harding. General outcry against the coinage caused Wood's patent to be rescinded in September 1725, and the coins were kept out of circulation. In \"Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift\" (1739) Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements.\n\"Gulliver's Travels\", a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois, was published in 1726 and is regarded as his masterpiece. As with his other writings, the \"Travels\" was pseudonymously published under the name of the fictional eponymous character Lemuel Gulliver, who is described in the book's long title as a ship's surgeon and later a sea captain. Some of the correspondence between printer Benjamin Motte and Gulliver's also-fictional cousin negotiating the book's publication has survived. A satire of human nature based on Swift's experience of his times, \"Gulliver's Travels\" has often been mistakenly thought of (and published in bowdlerised form) as a children's book, and it has been criticised for its apparent misanthropy. Each of the four books\u2014recounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic lands\u2014has a different theme. Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought. \nIn 1729, Swift's \"A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick\" was published in Dublin by Sarah Harding. It is a satire in which the narrator, with intentionally grotesque arguments, recommends that Ireland's poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich: \"I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food\u00a0...\" Following the satirical form, he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them:\nTherefore let no man talk to me of other expedients\u00a0... taxing our absentees\u00a0... using [nothing] except what is of our own growth and manufacture\u00a0... rejecting\u00a0... foreign luxury\u00a0... introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance\u00a0... learning to love our country\u00a0... quitting our animosities and factions\u00a0... teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants.\u00a0... Therefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.\nLegacy.\nLiterary.\n Since his death, Swift came to be regarded by many as the greatest satirist of the Georgian era, and among the foremost writers of satire in the English language. John Ruskin named him as one of the three people in history who were the most influential for him. George Orwell named him as one of the writers he most admired, despite disagreeing with him on almost every moral and political issue. Modernist poet Edith Sitwell wrote a fictional biography of Swift, titled \"I Live Under a Black Sun\" and published in 1937. A. L. Rowse wrote a biography of Swift, essays on his works, and edited the Pan Books edition of \"Gulliver's Travels\".\nLiterary scholar Frank Stier Goodwin wrote a full biography of Swift: \"Jonathan Swift \u2013 Giant in Chains\", issued by Liveright Publishing Corporation, New York (1940, 450pp, with Bibliography).\nIn 1982, Soviet playwright Grigory Gorin wrote a theatrical fantasy called \"The House That Swift Built\" based on the last years of Jonathan Swift's life and episodes of his works. The play was filmed by director Mark Zakharov in the 1984 two-part television movie of the same name. Jake Arnott features him in his 2017 novel \"The Fatal Tree\". A 2017 analysis of library holdings data revealed that Swift is the most popular Irish author, and that \"Gulliver's Travels\" is the most widely held work of Irish literature in libraries globally.\nThe first woman to write a biography of Swift was Sophie Shilleto Smith, who published \"Dean Swift\" in 1910.\nEponymous places.\nSwift crater, a crater on Mars's moon Deimos, is named after Jonathan Swift, who predicted the existence of the moons of Mars.\nIn honour of Swift's long-term residence in Trim, there are several monuments, statues and streets in the town. Most notable is Swift's Street, named after him. Trim also held a recurring festival in honour of Swift, called the Trim Swift Festival. In 2020, the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has not been held since.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is the former lead singer and songwriter for the San Francisco punk rock band Dead Kennedys.\nInitially active from 1979 to 1986, Dead Kennedys were known for rapid-fire music topped with Biafra's sardonic lyrics and biting social commentary, delivered in his \"unique quiver of a voice\". When the band broke up in 1986, he took over the influential independent record label Alternative Tentacles, which he had founded in 1979 with Dead Kennedys bandmate East Bay Ray. In a 2000 lawsuit, upheld on appeal in 2003 by the California Supreme Court, Biafra was found liable for breach of contract, fraud, and malice in withholding a decade's worth of royalties from his former bandmates and ordered to pay over $200,000 in compensation and punitive damages; the band subsequently reformed without Biafra. Although now focused primarily on spoken word performances, Biafra has continued as a musician in numerous collaborations. From 1979 to 1981, he contributed to the San Francisco punk zine \"Damage\". He has also occasionally appeared in cameo roles in films.\nPolitically, Biafra is a member of the Green Party of the United States and supports various political causes. He ran for the party's presidential nomination in the 2000 presidential election, finishing a distant second to Ralph Nader. In 1979 he ran for mayor of San Francisco, California. He is a supporter of a free society and utilizes shock value and advocates direct action and pranksterism in the name of political causes. Biafra uses absurdist media tactics, in the leftist tradition of the Yippies, to highlight issues of civil rights and social justice.\nEarly life.\nEric Reed Boucher was born in Boulder, Colorado, the son of Virginia Boucher (n\u00e9e Parker), a librarian, and Stanley Wayne Boucher, a psychiatric social worker and poet. His sister, Julie J. Boucher, was Associate Director of the Library Research Service at the Colorado State Library; she died in a mountain-climbing accident on October 12, 1996.\nAs a child, Boucher developed an interest in international politics that was encouraged by his parents. He became a fan of rock music after his parents accidentally tuned in to a rock radio station. As a teenager, his high school guidance counselor advised him to spend his adolescence preparing to become a dental hygienist.\nMusical career.\nColorado bands.\nIn 1977, he worked as a roadie for a local band called the Ravers (who later changed their name to the Nails), helping set up their equipment at shows, including as an opener for the Ramones. The job ended shortly after the Ramones show, when the Ravers were offered a record contract and left Colorado. Boucher credits seeing Joey Ramone as inspiration to become a singer, and the Ramones lyrics for inspiring the use of humor in his own songs.\nShortly after graduating high school, he formed a band called the Healers, with John Greenway and third musician. Boucher has described the Healers' music as \"banging on instruments we didn't know how to play when our parents weren't home\". While never playing a show, the band made recordings, including an early version of \"California \u00dcber Alles\", but did not want any of it to be released to the public. Some of their music was made available on a 2009 compilation of late 1970s Colorado punk bands titled \"Rocky Mountain Low\", including the original version of \"California \u00dcber Alles\", which Maximum Rocknroll described as experimental improv in their review.\nBoucher left Boulder to attend the University of California, Santa Cruz but dropped out after the first quarter of the school year.\nDead Kennedys.\nIn June 1978, Boucher responded to an advertisement placed in a store by guitarist East Bay Ray, stating \"guitarist wants to form punk band\", and together they formed Dead Kennedys. He began performing with the band under the stage name Occupant, but soon began to use the stage name Jello Biafra, a combination of the brand name Jell-O and the short-lived African state of Biafra.\nBiafra initially attempted to compose music on guitar, but his lack of experience on the instrument and his own admission of being \"a fumbler with my hands\" led Dead Kennedys bassist Klaus Flouride to suggest that Biafra simply sing the parts he envisioned to the band.&lt;ref name=\"re/search\"&gt;V. Vale, \"Incredibly Strange Music, Vol. 2\", RE/Search Publications, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra sang his riffs and melodies into a tape recorder, which he brought to the band's rehearsal and/or recording sessions. By all accounts, including his own, Biafra is not a conventionally skilled musician, though he and his collaborators (Joey Shithead of D.O.A. in particular) attest that he is a skilled composer and his work, particularly with Dead Kennedys, is highly respected by punk-oriented critics and fans.\nThe first single by Dead Kennedys was \"California \u00dcber Alles\". The song, which spoofed California governor Jerry Brown, was the first of many political songs by the group and Biafra. Its popularity resulted in being covered by other musicians, such as the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (who rewrote the lyrics to parody Pete Wilson), John Linnell of They Might Be Giants and Six Feet Under on their \"Graveyard Classics\" album of cover versions. Not long after, Dead Kennedys had a second and bigger hit with \"Holiday in Cambodia\" from their debut album \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\". \"AllMusic\" cites this song as \"possibly the most successful single of the American hardcore scene\" and Biafra counts it as his personal favorite Dead Kennedy's song.\nDead Kennedys received some controversy in the spring of 1981 over the single \"Too Drunk to Fuck\". The song became a hit in Britain, and the BBC feared that it would manage to be a big enough hit to appear among the top 30 songs on the national charts, requiring a mention on \"Top of the Pops\". However, the single peaked at number 36 in the charts.\nThe EP \"In God We Trust, Inc.\" contained the song \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off!\" as well as \"We've Got A Bigger Problem Now\", a rewritten version of \"California \u00fcber alles\" about Ronald Reagan. Punk musician and scholar Vic Bondi considers the latter song to be the song that \"defined the lyrical agenda of much of hardcore music, and represented its break with punk\". The band's most controversial album, \"Frankenchrist\", brought with it the song \"MTV Get Off the Air,\" which accused MTV of promoting poor quality music and sedating the public. The album also contained a controversial poster by Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger entitled \"Penis Landscape\".\nDead Kennedys toured widely during their career, starting in the late 1970s. They began playing at San Francisco's Mabuhay Gardens (their home base) and other Bay Area venues, later branching out to shows in southern Californian clubs (most notably the Whisky a Go Go), but eventually they moved to major clubs across the country, including CBGB in New York. Later, they played to larger audiences such as at the 1980 Bay Area Music Awards (where they played the notorious \"Pull My Strings\" for the only time), and headlined the 1983 Rock Against Reagan festival.\nOn May 7, 1994, punk rock fans who believed Biafra was a \"sell out\" attacked him at the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. Biafra claims that he was attacked by a man nicknamed Cretin, who crashed into him while moshing. The crash injured Biafra's leg, causing an argument between the two men. During the argument, Cretin pushed Biafra to the floor and five or six friends of Cretin assaulted Biafra while he was down, yelling \"Sellout rock star, kick him\", and attempting to pull out his hair. Biafra was later hospitalized with serious injuries. The attack derailed Biafra's plans for both a Canadian spoken-word tour and an accompanying album, and the production of \"Pure Chewing Satisfaction\" was halted. However, Biafra returned to the Gilman club a few months after the incident to perform a spoken-word performance as an act of reconciliation with the club.\nBiafra has been a prominent figure in the Californian punk scene and was one of the third-generation members of the San Francisco punk community. Many later hardcore bands have cited Dead Kennedys as a major influence. Hardcore punk author Steven Blush describes Biafra as hardcore's \"biggest star\" who was a \"powerful presence whose political insurgence and rabid fandom made him the father figure of a burgeoning subculture [and an] inspirational force [who] could also be a real prick ... Biafra was a visionary, incendiary [performer].\"\nAfter Dead Kennedys disbanded, Biafra's new songs were recorded with other bands, and he released only spoken word albums as solo projects. These collaborations had less popularity than Biafra's earlier work. However, his song \"That's Progress\", originally recorded with D.O.A. for the album \"Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors\", received considerable exposure when it appeared on the album \"Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1\".\nObscenity prosecution.\nIn April 1986, police officers raided Biafra's house in response to complaints by the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In June 1986, L.A. deputy city attorney Michael Guarino, working under City Attorney James Hahn, brought Biafra to trial in Los Angeles for distributing \"harmful material to minors\" in the Dead Kennedys album \"Frankenchrist\". However, the dispute was about neither the music nor the lyrics from the album, but rather the print of the H. R. Giger poster \"Landscape XX\" (\"Penis Landscape\") included with the album.\nMusic author Reebee Garofalo argued that Biafra and Alternative Tentacles may have been targeted because the label was a \"small, self-managed and self-supported company that could ill afford a protracted legal battle.\" Facing the possible sentence of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine, Biafra, Dirk Dirksen, and Suzanne Stefanac founded the No More Censorship Defense Fund, a benefit featuring several punk rock bands, to help pay for his legal fees, which neither he nor his record label could afford. The jury deadlocked 5 to 7 in favor of acquittal, prompting a mistrial; despite a motion to retry the case, the judge ordered all charges dropped. Dead Kennedys disbanded during the trial, in December 1986, due to the mounting legal costs; in the wake of their disbandment, Biafra made a career of his spoken word performances.\nBiafra has a cameo role in the 1988 film \"Tapeheads\". He plays an FBI agent who arrests the two protagonists (played by Tim Robbins and John Cusack). While arresting them, his character asks \"Remember what we did to Jello Biafra?\" lampooning the obscenity prosecution.\nOn March 25, 2005, Biafra appeared on the U.S. radio program \"This American Life\", http://, which featured a phone call between Jello Biafra and Michael Guarino, the prosecutor in the \"Frankenchrist\" trial.\n\"Porn Rock: The Obscenity Trial of Jello Biafra\", a play written by Lawrence Meyers, was staged in Los Angeles in February 2025, depicting the obscenity prosecution and its implications.\nLawsuit and reunion activities.\nIn October 1998, three former members of Dead Kennedys sued Biafra for nonpayment of royalties. The other members of Dead Kennedys alleged that Biafra, in his capacity as the head of Alternative Tentacles records, discovered an accounting error amounting to some $75,000 in unpaid royalties over almost a decade. Rather than informing his bandmates of this mistake, the suit alleged, Biafra knowingly concealed the information until a whistleblower employee at the record label notified the band.\nAccording to Biafra, the suit resulted from his refusal to allow one of the band's most well-known singles, \"Holiday in Cambodia\", to be used in a commercial for Levi's Dockers; Biafra opposes Levi's because of his belief that they use unfair business practices and sweatshop labor. Biafra maintained that he had never denied them royalties and that he himself had not even received royalties for re-releases of their albums or \"posthumous\" live albums which had been licensed to other labels by the Decay Music partnership. Decay Music denied this charge and have posted what they say are his cashed royalty checks, written to his legal name of Eric Boucher. Biafra also complained about the songwriting credits in new reissues and archival live albums of songs, alleging that he was the sole composer of songs that were wrongly credited to the entire band.\nIn May 2000, a jury found Biafra and Alternative Tentacles liable by not promptly informing his former bandmates of the accounting error and instead withholding the information during subsequent discussions and contractual negotiations. Biafra was ordered to pay $200,000, including $20,000 in punitive damages. After an appeal by Biafra's lawyers, in June 2003, the California Court of Appeals unanimously upheld all the conditions of the 2000 verdict against Biafra and Alternative Tentacles. Furthermore, the plaintiffs were awarded the rights to most of Dead Kennedys recorded works\u2014which accounted for about half the sales for Alternative Tentacles. Now in control of the Dead Kennedys name, Biafra's former bandmates went on tour with a new lead vocalist.\nIn a May 2025 interview with \"Guitar World\", East Bay Ray discussed a potential reunion with Jello Biafra saying that he and Klaus Fluoride were open to a reunion however it would never happen and that Biafra was to blame. He said that over the years lucrative offers such as one in 2017 from Riot Fest were proposed to the band but Biafra was against it. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue for me or Klaus. It\u2019s Biafra that turns down any offers for us to do something; we don\u2019t have any problem.\u201d East Bay Ray went on criticize Biafra's post Dead Kennedys career and how Biafra took credit for writing most of the band's songs in which he took exception to Biafra's claims by saying \u201cWe actually wrote as a band, where in effect, due to the chemistry between us, it was a case of two and two equaling five. None of us has had a solo career that was bigger than Dead Kennedys, which, to me, shows the power of a bunch of talented people getting together and creating something that was far greater than the sum of its parts. Jello didn\u2019t bring in the songs. I know he\u2019s created the myth that he wrote them all, but the question here is that if he did, why didn\u2019t he ever do anything significant after leaving the band?,\u201d adding, \u201cIggy left the Stooges and had a career; ditto Lou Reed with the Velvet Underground or Morrissey with the Smiths. Where\u2019s Biafra\u2019s solo career with a bunch of great songs? The songs were written in numerous different ways. \u201cHoliday in Cambodia\u201d started as a jam in the rehearsal studio\u201d he said.\nBiafra, in a 2012 interview with the \"Tampa Bay Times\", stated he was not happy with the current direction of his former bandmates, nor did he want to restart Dead Kennedys for nostalgia purposes:\nWe haven't talked in a dozen years. In their hearts they've become Republicans and I just wouldn't do something like that unless we can bring back the real thing. In a way getting me back into the band would be their worst nightmare, like make them rehearse. When people tell me that I owe it to the fans to regurgitate nothing but old music with the people I used to play with, that's totally the opposite of what punk and Dead Kennedys means to me. The true spirit of the whole thing is to keep going, keep moving and make more new stuff. Nobody was more cynical than the original punks about nostalgia and retro because of all the rage on TV and people started to get nostalgic in goofy ass ways for the sixties and they were thinking, \"Yeah, that will never happen to us.\" That's not what I'm here for, sorry. It's not as if the people who come to the Guantanamo School of Medicine shows wanting nothing but old Dead Kennedys songs don't leave with a smile on their face once they've heard the new songs. It's not like I've forgot how to write this shit.\nOther bands.\nIn the early 1980s, Biafra collaborated with musicians Christian Lunch and Adrian Borland (of the Sound) and Morgan Fisher (of Mott the Hoople) for the electropunk musical project the Witch Trials, releasing one self-titled EP in its lifetime.\nIn 1988, Biafra, with Al Jourgensen and Paul Barker of the band Ministry, and Jeff Ward, formed Lard. The band became yet another side project for Ministry, with Biafra providing vocals and lyrics. According to a March 2009 interview with Jourgensen, he and Biafra are working on a new Lard album, which is being recorded in Jourgensen's El Paso studio. Jourgensen also claimed in 2021 that Biafra was in the works on a new Lard album. While working on the film \"Terminal City Ricochet\" in 1989, Biafra did a song for the film's soundtrack with D.O.A.. As a result, Biafra worked with D.O.A. on the album \"Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors\". Biafra also worked with Nomeansno on the soundtrack, which led to their collaboration on the album \"The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy\" the following year. Biafra also provided lyrics for the song \"Biotech is Godzilla\" for Sepultura's 1993 album \"Chaos A.D.\".\nIn 1999, Biafra and other members of the anti-globalization movement protested the WTO Meeting of 1999 in Seattle. Along with other prominent West Coast musicians, he formed the short-lived band No WTO Combo to help promote the movement's cause. The band was originally scheduled to play during the protest, but the performance was canceled due to riots. The band performed a short set the following night at the Showbox in downtown Seattle (outside the designated area), along with the hip-hop group Spearhead. No WTO Combo later released a CD of recordings from the concert, entitled \"Live from the Battle in Seattle\".\nAs of late 2005, Biafra was performing with the band the Melvins under the name \"Jello Biafra and the Melvins\", though fans sometimes refer to them as \"the Jelvins\". Together they have released two albums, and worked on material for a third collaborative release, much of which was premiered live at two concerts at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco during an event called Biafra Five-O, commemorating Biafra's 50th birthday, the 30th anniversary of the founding of Dead Kennedys, and the beginning of legalized same-sex marriage in California. Biafra was also working with a band known as Jello Biafra and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, which included Ralph Spight of Victims Family on guitar and Billy Gould of Faith No More on bass. This group debuted during Biafra Five-O.\nIn 2011, Biafra appeared in a singular concert event with an all-star cast of Southern musicians including members from Cowboy Mouth, Dash Rip Rock, Mojo Nixon, and Down entitled, \"Jello Biafra and the New Orleans Raunch &amp; Soul All Stars\" who performed an array of classic Soul covers to a packed house at the 12-Bar in New Orleans, Louisiana. He would later reunite with many of the same musicians during the Carnival season 2014 to revisit many of these classics in Siberia, New Orleans. A live album from the 2011 performance, \"Walk on Jindal's Splinters\", and a companion single, \"Fannie May\"/\"Just a Little Bit\", were released in 2015.\nIn 2025, as part of their \"Field of Vision\" Jello Biafra performed a rendition of \"Police Truck\" with King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard.\nAlternative Tentacles.\nIn June 1979, Biafra co-founded the record label Alternative Tentacles, with which Dead Kennedys released their first single, \"California \u00fcber alles\". The label was created to allow the band to release albums without having to deal with pressure from major labels to change their music, although the major labels were not willing to sign the band due to their songs being deemed too controversial. After dealing with Cherry Red in the UK and IRS Records in the US for their first album \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\", the band released all later albums, and later pressings of \"Fresh Fruit\" on Alternative Tentacles. The exception was live albums released after the band's break-up, which the other band members compiled from recordings in the band partnership's vaults without Biafra's input or endorsement.. Biafra has been the owner of the company since its founding, though he does not receive a salary for his position; Biafra has referred to his position in the company as \"absentee thoughtlord\".\nBiafra is a collector of unusual vinyl records of all kinds, from 1950s and 1960s ethno-pop recordings by the likes of Les Baxter and Esquivel to vanity pressings that have circulated regionally, to German crooner Heino (for whom he would later participate in the documentary \"Heino: Made In Germany\"); he cites his always growing collection as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1993 he gave an interview to RE/Search Publications for their second \"Incredibly Strange Music\" book focusing primarily on these records, and later participated in a two-part episode of Fuse TV's program \"Crate Diggers\" on the same subject. His interest in such recordings, often categorized as outsider music, led to his discovery of the prolific (and schizophrenic) singer/songwriter/artist Wesley Willis, whom he signed to Alternative Tentacles in 1994, preceding Willis' major label deal with American Recordings. His collection grew so large that on October 1, 2005, Biafra donated a portion of his collection to an annual yard sale co-promoted by Alternative Tentacles and held at their warehouse in Emeryville, California.\nIn 2006, along with Alternative Tentacles employee and the Frisk lead singer Jesse Luscious, Biafra began co-hosting \"The Alternative Tentacles Batcast\", a downloadable podcast hosted by alternativetentacles.com. The show primarily focuses on interviews with artists and bands that are currently signed to the Alternative Tentacles label, although there are also occasional episodes where Biafra devoted the show to answering fan questions.\nSpoken word.\nBiafra became a spoken word artist in January 1986 with a performance at University of California, Los Angeles. In his performance, he combined humor with his political beliefs, much in the same way that he did with the lyrics to his songs. Despite his continued spoken word performances, he did not begin recording spoken word albums until after the disbanding of Dead Kennedys.\nHis ninth spoken word album, \"In the Grip of Official Treason\", was released in October 2006.\nBiafra was also featured in the British band Pitchshifter's song \"As Seen on TV\" reciting the words of dystopian futuristic radio advertisements.\nPolitics.\nBiafra has resisted identifying with any particular ideology, saying, \"I don't label myself strictly an anarchist or a socialist or let alone a libertarian or something like that,\" In a 2012 interview, Biafra said \"I'm very pro-tax as long as it goes for the right things. I don't mind paying more money as long as it's going to provide shelter for people sleeping in the street or getting the schools fixed back up, getting the infrastructure up to the standards of other countries, including a high-speed rail system. I'm totally down with that.\"\nMayoral campaign.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor those of them who have seen my candidacy as a publicity stunt or a joke, they should keep in mind that it is no more of a joke, and no less of a joke, than anyone else they care to name.\n\u2014Jello Biafra, \"Dead Kennedys: The Early Years\"\nIn the autumn of 1979, Biafra ran for mayor of San Francisco, using the Jell-O ad campaign catchphrase, \"There's always room for Jello\", as his campaign slogan. Having entered the race before creating a campaign platform, Biafra later wrote his platform on a napkin while attending a Pere Ubu concert where Dead Kennedys drummer Ted told Biafra, \"Biafra, you have such a big mouth that you should run for Mayor.\" As he campaigned, Biafra wore campaign T-shirts from his opponent Quentin Kopp's previous campaign and at one point vacuumed leaves off the front lawn of another opponent, Dianne Feinstein, to mock her publicity stunt of sweeping streets in downtown San Francisco for a few hours. He also made a whistlestop campaign tour along the BART line. Supporters committed equally odd actions; two well-known signs held by supporters said \"If he doesn't win I'll kill myself\" and \"What if he does win?\"\nAt the time, in San Francisco, any individual could legally run for mayor if a petition was signed by 1500 people or if $1500 was paid. Biafra paid $900 and got signatures over time and eventually became a legal candidate, meaning he received statements put in voters' pamphlets and equal news coverage.\nHis platform included unconventional points such as forcing businessmen to wear clown suits within city limits, erecting statues of Dan White, who assassinated Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk in 1978, around the city and allowing the parks department to sell eggs and tomatoes with which people could pelt the statues, hiring workers who had lost their jobs due to a tax initiative to panhandle in wealthy neighborhoods (including Feinstein's), and a citywide ban on cars. Biafra has expressed irritation that these parts of his platform attained such notoriety, preferring instead to be remembered for serious proposals such as legalizing squatting in vacant, tax-delinquent buildings and requiring police officers to run for election by the people of the neighborhoods they patrol.\nBiafra finished fourth out of a field of ten in the first round of voting, receiving 3.79 percent of the vote (6,591 votes); he failed to advance to the runoff and Dianne Feinstein won the second round of the voting.\nPresidential campaign.\nIn 2000, the New York State Green Party drafted Biafra as a candidate for the Green Party presidential nomination, and a few supporters were elected to the party's nominating convention in Denver, Colorado. Biafra chose death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal as his running mate. The party overwhelmingly chose Ralph Nader as the presidential candidate with 295 of the 319 delegate votes. Biafra received 10 votes.\nBiafra, along with a camera crew (dubbed by Biafra as \"The Camcorder Truth Jihad\"), later reported for the Independent Media Center at the Republican and Democratic conventions.\nPost-2000.\nAfter losing the 2000 nomination, Biafra became highly active in Nader's presidential campaign, as well as in 2004 and 2008. During the 2008 campaign Jello played at rallies and answered questions for journalists in support of Nader. When gay rights activists accused Nader of costing Al Gore the 2000 election, Biafra reminded them that Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center wanted warning stickers on albums with content referencing homosexuality.\nAfter Barack Obama won the general election, Biafra wrote an open letter making suggestions on how to run his term as president. Biafra criticized Obama during his term, stating that \"Obama even won the award for best advertising campaign of 2008.\" Biafra dubbed Obama \"Barackstar O'Bummer\". Biafra refused to support Obama in 2012. Biafra has stated that he feels that Obama continued many of George W. Bush's policies, summarizing Obama's policies as containing \"worse and worse laws against human rights and more and more illegal unconstitutional spying.\"\nOn September 18, 2015, it was announced that Biafra would be supporting Bernie Sanders in his campaign for the 2016 presidential election. He has strongly criticized the political position of Donald Trump, saying \"how can people be so fucking stupid\" on hearing the election result. He also criticized Trump's cabinet picks, saying of then-Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, \"The last person we want with their finger on the nuclear button is somebody connected to this extreme Christianist doomsday cult.\"\nOn February 28, 2020, Jello announced that he would be supporting both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential election. \"I personally like Warren slightly better than Bernie because: 1) She\u2019s done her homework. Bernie too, but not to quite the same depth or degree. 2) Think about it\u2014who really has a better chance of actually beating Trump, and helping flip Congress and state legislatures? It\u2019s Elizabeth Warren, hands down.\" He went on to say that he considered Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg \"almost as bad as Trump\".\nOn April 12, 2020, Biafra expressed disappointment that Sanders had suspended his campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination.\nBoycott of Israel.\nIn mid-2011 Jello Biafra and his band were scheduled to play at the Barby Club in Tel Aviv. They came under pressure by the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, and finally decided to cancel the concert \u2013 after a debate which according to Biafra \"deeply tore at the fabric of our band ... This whole controversy has been one of the most intense situations of my life \u2013 and I thrive on intense situations\".\nBiafra then decided to travel to Israel and Palestine, at his own expense, and talk with Israeli and Palestinian activists as well as with fans disappointed at his cancellation. In the article stating his conclusions he wrote:\n\"I will not perform in Israel unless it is a pro-human rights, anti-occupation event, that does not violate the spirit of the boycott. Each musician, artist, etc. must decide this for themselves. I am staying away for now, but am also really creeped out by the attitudes of some of the hardliners and hope someday to find a way to contribute something positive here. I will not march or sign on with anyone who runs around calling people Zionazis and is more interested in making threats than making friends.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15621", "revid": "44719641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15621", "title": "John Grierson", "text": "Scottish documentary film-maker (1898\u20131972)\nJohn Grierson (26 April 1898 \u2013 19 February 1972) was a Scottish documentary maker, often considered the father of British and Canadian documentary film. In 1926, Grierson coined the term \"documentary\" in a review of Robert J. Flaherty's \"Moana\". In 1939, Grierson established the all-time Canadian film institutional production and distribution company The National Film Board of Canada controlled by the Government of Canada.\nEarly life and education.\nGrierson was born in the old schoolhouse in Deanston, near Doune, Scotland, to schoolmaster Robert Morrison Grierson from Boddam, near Peterhead, and Jane Anthony, a teacher from Ayrshire. His mother, a suffragette and ardent Labour Party activist, often took the chair at Tom Johnston's election meetings.\nThe family moved to Cambusbarron, Stirling, in 1900, when the children were still young, after Grierson's father was appointed headmaster of Cambusbarron school. When the family moved, John had three elder sisters, Agnes, Janet, and Margaret, and a younger brother, Anthony. John and Anthony were enrolled at Cambusbarron school in November 1903. His sister Margaret died in 1906; however, the family continued to grow as John gained three younger sisters, Dorothy, Ruby, and finally Marion in 1907.\nBoth parents steeped their son in liberal politics, humanistic ideals, and Calvinist moral and religious philosophies, particularly that education was essential to individual freedom and that hard and meaningful work was the way to prove oneself worthy in the sight of God. John was enrolled in the High School at Stirling in September 1908, and he played football and rugby for the school.\nWorld War I.\nIn July 1915, Grierson left school with an overall subject mark of 82%; John had sat the bursary examination at Gilmorehill the month before, as his parents wanted him to follow his elder sisters, Janet and Agnes, in going to the University of Glasgow. The results for the bursary examination were not posted until October 1915; Grierson applied to work at the munitions at Alexandria; the munitions building had been the original home of the Argyll Motor Company which had earlier in the twentieth century built the first complete motor car in Scotland.\nGrierson was the second name on the bursary list and received the John Clark bursary, which was tenable for four years. Grierson entered the University of Glasgow in 1916; however, he was unhappy that his efforts to help in World War I were only through his work at the munitions. Grierson wanted to join the navy; his family on his father's side had long been lighthouse keepers, and John had many memories of visiting lighthouses and being beside the sea. He went to the Crystal Palace in London to train with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. In his recruitment letter he had added a year to his age so that he could attend.\nOn 7 January 1916, Grierson was sent to the wireless telegraphy station at Aultbea, Cromarty, as an ordinary telegraphist but was promoted to telegraphist on 2 June 1916. On 23 January 1917, he became a telegraphist on the minesweeper H.M.S \"Surf\" and served there until 13 October 1917. The next day he joined H.M.S \"Rightwhale\", where he was promoted to leading telegraphist on 2 June 1918 and remained on the vessel until he was demobilised with a British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nUniversity of Glasgow.\nGrierson returned to university in 1919; he joined the Fabian Society in 1919 and dissolved it in 1921. The New University Labour Club was initiated by John as well as the Critic's Club; he also had poetry published in the Glasgow University magazine from November 1920 until February 1923. Grierson received the Buchan Prize in the Ordinary Class of English Language in the academic year of 1919\u201320, he also received the prize and first-class certificate in the academic year of 1920\u201321 in the Ordinary Class of Moral Philosophy and graduated with a Master of Arts in English and moral philosophy in 1923.\nIn 1923, Grierson received a Rockefeller Research Fellowship to study in the United States at the University of Chicago, and later at Columbia and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. His research focus was the psychology of propaganda\u2014the impact of the press, film, and other mass media on forming public opinion. Grierson was particularly interested in the popular appeal and influence of the \"yellow\" (tabloid) press, and the influence and role of these journals on the education of new American citizens from abroad.\nSocial critic.\nIn his review of Robert Flaherty's film \"Moana\" (1926) in the \"New York Sun\" (8 February 1926), Grierson wrote that it had 'documentary' value.\nIn his essay \"First Principles of Documentary\" (1932), Grierson argued that the principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the \"original\" actor and \"original\" scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials \"thus taken from the raw\" can be more real than the acted article. In this regard, Grierson's views align with the Soviet filmmaker Dziga Vertov's contempt for dramatic fiction as \"bourgeois excess\", though with considerably more subtlety. Grierson's definition of documentary as \"creative treatment of actuality\" has gained some acceptance, though it presents philosophical questions about documentaries containing stagings and reenactments.\nLike many social critics of the time, Grierson was profoundly concerned about what he perceived to be clear threats to democracy. In the US, he encountered a marked tendency toward political reaction, anti-democratic sentiments, and political apathy. He read and agreed with the journalist and political philosopher Walter Lippmann's book \"Public Opinion\" which blamed the erosion of democracy in part on the fact that the political and social complexities of contemporary society made it difficult if not impossible for the public to comprehend and respond to issues vital to the maintenance of democratic society.\nIn Grierson's view, a way to counter these problems was to involve citizens in their government with the kind of engaging excitement generated by the popular press, which simplified and dramatized public affairs. It was during this time that Grierson developed a conviction that motion pictures could play a central role in promoting this process. (It has been suggested film scholar Paul Swann that some of Grierson's notions regarding the social and political uses of film were influenced by reading Lenin's writing about film as education and propaganda.)\nGrierson's emerging view of film was as a form of social and political communication\u2014a mechanism for social reform, education, and perhaps spiritual uplift. His view of Hollywood movie-making was considerably less sanguine:\n\"In an age when the faiths, the loyalties, and the purposes have been more than usually undermined, mental fatigue--or is it spiritual fatigue?--represents a large factor in everyday experience. Our cinema magnate does no more than exploit the occasion. He also, more or less frankly, is a dope pedlar.\"\nFilm critic.\nGrierson's emerging and outspoken film philosophies caught the attention of New York film critics at the time. He was asked to write criticism for the \"New York Sun\". At the \"Sun\", Grierson wrote articles on film aesthetics and audience reception, and developed broad contacts in the film world. According to popular myth, in the course of this writing stint, Grierson coined the term \"documentary\" in writing about Robert J. Flaherty's film \"Moana\" (1926): \"Of course \"Moana\", being a visual account of events in the daily life of a Polynesian youth and his family, has documentary value.\"\nDuring this time, Grierson was also involved in scrutinizing the film industries of other countries. He may have been involved in arranging to bring Sergei Eisenstein's groundbreaking film \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (1925) to US audiences for the first time. Eisenstein's editing techniques and film theories, particularly the use of montage, would have a significant influence on Grierson's own work.\nFilmmaker.\nGrierson returned to Great Britain in 1927 armed with the sense that film could be enlisted to build national morale and consensus, and to deal with social problems, a theory he would enact especially during the Great Depression. Filmmaking for Grierson was an exalted, patriotic calling. Grierson's thinking was elitist in some ways, which he exposed with his many dicta of the time, such as \"The elect have their duty\" and \"I look on cinema as a pulpit, and use it as a propagandist.\"\nGrierson was also a cultural relativist. In the US, he had met pioneering documentary filmmaker Robert Flaherty and respected Flaherty immensely for his contributions to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and events. Less commendable in Grierson's view was Flaherty's invalidating focus on exotic and faraway cultures. (\"In the profounder kind of way\", wrote Grierson of Flaherty, \"we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other\"). In Grierson's view, the focus of film should be on the everyday drama of ordinary people. As Grierson wrote in his diaries: \"Beware the ends of the earth and the exotic: the drama is on your doorstep wherever the slums are, wherever there is malnutrition, wherever there is exploitation and cruelty.\" \"'You keep your savages in the far place Bob; we are going after the savages of Birmingham,' I think I said to him pretty early on. And we did.\")\nEmpire Marketing Board.\nOn his return to England, Grierson was employed on a temporary basis as an Assistant Films Officer of the Empire Marketing Board (EMB), a governmental agency which had been established in 1926 to promote British world trade and British unity throughout the empire. One of the major functions of the EMB was publicity, which the Board accomplished through exhibits, posters, and publications and films. It was within the context of this State-funded organisation that the \"documentary\" as we know it today got its start.\nIn late 1929 Grierson and his cameraman, Basil Emmott completed his first film, \"Drifters\", which he wrote, produced and directed. The film, which follows the heroic work of North Sea herring fishermen, was a radical departure from anything being made by the British film industry or Hollywood. A large part of its innovation lies in the fierce boldness in bringing the camera to rugged locations such as a small boat in the middle of a gale while leaving relatively less of the action staged. The choice of topic was chosen less from Grierson's curiosity than the fact that he discovered that the Financial Secretary had made the herring industry his hobbyhorse. It premiered in a private film club in London in November 1929 on a double-bill with Eisenstein's -then controversial- film \"The Battleship Potemkin\" (which was banned from general release in Britain until 1954) and received high praise from both its sponsors and the press. The film was shown from 9 December 1929, in the Stoll in Kingsway and then was later screened throughout Britain.\nAfter this success, Grierson moved away from film direction into a greater focus on production and administration within the EMB. He became a tireless organizer and recruiter for the EMB, enlisting a stable of energetic young filmmakers into the film unit between 1930 and 1933. Those enlisted included filmmakers Basil Wright, Edgar Anstey, Stuart Legg, Paul Rotha, Arthur Elton, Humphrey Jennings, Harry Watt, and Alberto Cavalcanti. This group formed the core of what was to become known as the British Documentary Film Movement. Robert Flaherty himself also worked briefly for the unit. In 1933 the EMB Film Unit was disbanded, a casualty of Depression-era economics.\nGeneral Post Office.\nGrierson's boss at the EMB moved to the General Post Office (GPO) as its first public relations officer, with the stipulation that he could bring the EMB film unit with him. Grierson's crew were charged with demonstrating how the Post Office facilitated modern communication and brought the nation together, a task aimed as much at GPO workers as the general public. During Grierson's administration, the GPO Film Unit produced a series of groundbreaking films, including \"Night Mail\" (dir. Basil Wright and Harry Watt, 1936) and \"Coal Face\" (dir. Alberto Cavalcanti, 1935). In 1934 he produced at the GPO Film Unit the award-winning \"The Song of Ceylon\" (dir. Basil Wright) which was sponsored jointly by the Ceylon Tea Propaganda Bureau and the EMB.\nIn 1934, Grierson sailed on the \"Isabella Greig\" out of Granton to film \"Granton Trawler\" on Viking Bank which is between Shetland and the Norwegian coast. The footage from his voyage was handed over to Edgar Anstey, who pulled footage of when the camera had fallen over on the deck of the boat to create a storm scene. \"Granton Trawler\" was a favourite film of Grierson's, he saw it as a homage to the \"Isabella Greig\" that was sunk in 1941 by German bombs when it went out to fish and was never seen again. \"The Private Life of Gannets\" was also filmed on the \"Isabella Greig;\" the film was shot on Grassholm with Grierson shooting the slow-motion sequence of the gannets diving for fish which took only one afternoon to shoot near Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The Private Life of Gannets went on to pick up an Academy Award in 1937.\nGrierson eventually grew restless with having to work within the bureaucratic and budgetary confines of government sponsorship. Grierson resigned from the G.P.O. on 30 June 1937, which gave him more time to pursue his passions and the freedom to speak his mind on issues around the world. In response, he sought out private industry sponsorship for film production. He was finally successful in getting the British gas industry to underwrite an annual film program. Perhaps the most significant works produced during this time were \"Housing Problems\" (dir. Arthur Elton, Edgar Anstey, John Taylor, and Grierson's sister Ruby Grierson, 1935).\nCanada.\nIn 1938, Grierson was invited by the Canadian government to study the country's film production. Grierson sailed at the end of May in 1938 for Canada and arrived on 17 June. Grierson met with the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King and also spoke with many important figures across Canada, they were all in agreement of the importance of film in reducing sectionalism and in promoting the relationship of Canada between home and abroad. The head of the Motion Picture Bureau for Canada, Frank Badgley, did not appreciate Grierson's assessment and criticism of the films made by the Bureau which was that they focused too much on Canada as a place to holiday. Grierson delivered his report on government film propaganda and the weaknesses he had found in Canadian film production; his suggestion was to create a national coordinating body for the production of films. An abridged version of the report ran to 66 pages, which was prepared by August in London. Grierson returned to Britain but was invited back to Canada on 14 October 1938; he returned in November.\nNational Film Board of Canada and Wartime Information Board.\nIn 1939, Canada created the National Film Commission, which would later become the National Film Board of Canada. The bill to create a National Film Board was drafted by Grierson; the bill was introduced in March 1939 and given Royal Assent on 2 May 1939. Grierson was appointed the first Commissioner of the National Film Board in October 1939. When Canada entered World War II in 1939, the NFB focused on the production of propaganda films, many of which Grierson directed. For example, captured footage of German war activity was incorporated in documentaries that were distributed to the then-neutral United States.\nGrierson grieved the death of his sister Ruby in 1940; she was on the \"SS City of Benares\" while it was evacuating one hundred children to Canada. The \"Benares\" was torpedoed four days after its sailing, and sank within thirty-one minutes in a Force 10 Gale. Ruby Grierson had managed to enter Lifeboat 8, full with more than thirty people, including eighteen girls and two female escorts, but as it was lowering, a wave crashed into the lifeboat, sending it into a vertical position, and throwing everyone in that boat into the sea. No one from Boat 8 survived. In the end, of 406 people on board, only 148 people survived, including only 19 of 100 children. Grierson resigned from his position in January 1941. Over his year as Commissioner at the National Film Board 40 films were made; the year before the Motion Picture Bureau had made only one and a half. Recommendations for the future running were made for the National Film Board, and Grierson was persuaded to stay for a further six months to oversee the changes.\nDuring WWII, Grierson was a consultant to prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King as a minister of the Wartime Information Board. He remained on the National Film Board and managed to complete his duties to Wartime Information Board as well through his deputies that aided him in the task. Grierson was asked to keep his dual role until January 1944, however, he resigned in 1943 as the job he had been asked to complete had been finished as far as he was concerned. Before he finished with the Wartime Information Bureau Grierson was also offered the role of chairman of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation but turned it down as he believed that this would give him too much power.\nOn 26 February 1942, Grierson attended the Academy Awards and received the award on behalf of the National Film Board for \"Churchill's Island\". Grierson also presented the award for the best documentary, the first time that this award was given by the Academy. After the Dieppe Raid, there were reports that Canadians that had been taken as prisoners of war had been manacled under Hitler's orders. Grierson proposed that the Film Board show how the German prisoners of war were being treated in Canada through a film. Ham Wright directed the film showing the German sailors that had been captured; playing football, enjoying meals and looking healthy. Only one copy of the film was made, it was sent to the Swiss Red Cross who deliberately let it fall into German hands. Grierson was to learn at a later date that Hitler had indeed watched the film and ordered that the Canadian prisoners of war released from their manacles.\nAfter the war, the National Film Board focused on producing documentaries that reflected the lives of Canadians. The National Film Board has become recognized around the world for producing quality films, some of which have won Academy Awards. The National Film Board had become one of the largest film studios and was respected around the world for what it had achieved; it had especially had influence in Czechoslovakia and China.\nIn December 1943 Grierson was elected by the Permanent Film Committee of the National Council for Canadian-Soviet Friendship to become honorary chairman. One of the tasks at the National Film Board that Grierson strongly pushed for the films being produced to be in French as well as English. He also pushed for a French unit in the National Film Board.\nGrierson concentrated on documentary film production in New York after resigning his post following in August 1945; his resignation was to take effect in November 1945. In 1946 Grierson was asked to testify as part of the investigation of the Gouzenko Affair regarding communist spies in the National Film Board and the Wartime Information Board, rumours spread that he had been a leader of a spy ring during his offices with the Canadian government, a rumour he denied. Due to the rumours, the projects that Grierson had been trying to put together were not commissioned and he was barred from taking an important position at the United Nations.\nCommission on Freedom of the Press.\nGrierson was appointed as a foreign adviser to the Commission on Freedom of the Press in December 1943, which had been set up by the University of Chicago. Grierson was able to make a large contribution to the committee which included Robert M. Hutchins, William E. Hocking, Harold D. Lasswell, Archibald McLeish and Charles Merriam. \"A Free and Responsible Press\" was published in 1947.\nUNESCO.\nGrierson was offered the position of head of information at UNESCO at the end of 1946; he attended the first General Conference of UNESCO from 26 November until 10 December in Paris. He had the idea for the \"Unesco Courier\" which was published in several languages across the world, first as a tabloid and later as a magazine. Grierson was invited to open the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 1947, from 31 August to 7 September. At the start of 1948 he resigned from his position as director for Mass Communications and Public Information, he left in April to return to Britain.\nCentral Office of Information.\nIn February 1948, Grierson was appointed the controller of the Central Office of Information's film operations to co-ordinate the work of the Crown Film Unit and Films Division, and to take overall charge of the planning, production and distribution of government films. On 23 June 1948, he accepted an honorary degree, an LL.D from the University of Glasgow. He left in 1950 due to financial restrictions on the documentaries that he wished to make.\nGroup 3.\nGrierson was appointed to the position of executive producer of Group 3 at the end of 1950; it was a film production enterprise that received loans of government money through the National Film Finance Corporation. They filmed at Southall Studios in West London but later moved to Beaconsfield Studios. Group 3 was to have continuous production from 1951 until 1955 when it stopped producing films, the organisation had made a loss of over \u00a3400,000 as production of the films usually ran over the time allocated, and there had also been difficulty getting the films shown in cinemas.\nDuring this time Grierson had been diagnosed with tuberculosis in May 1953, he spent a fortnight in hospital and then had a year of convalescing at his home, Tog Hill in Calstone. Grierson spent much of his time corresponding with the directors at Group 3, as well as commenting on scripts and story ideas. He had recovered enough to attend the Cannes Film Festival in April 1954, taking the production of \"Man of Africa\". At the Edinburgh Film Festival in the same year, a dinner was held in Grierson's honour to celebrate twenty-five years of documentary.\nFilms of Scotland Committee.\nGrierson joined the newly revived Films of Scotland Committee in 1955. Also on the committee were Norman Wilson, Forsyth Hardy, George Singleton, C. A. Oakley and Neil Paterson. In 1956, Grierson was the president of the Venice Film Festival's jury; he was also jury president at the Cork Film Festival and the South American Film Festival in 1958. In 1957, Grierson received a special Canadian Film Award. Grierson wrote the script for, \"Seawards the Great Ships,\" which was directed by Hilary Harris and awarded an Academy Award in 1961, a feat for the Films of Scotland Committee.\nThis Wonderful World.\nThe first programme of This Wonderful World was aired on 11 October 1957 in Scotland; it was on \"The Culbin Sands\" which focused on how the Forestry Commission had replanted six thousand acres of woodland along the mouth of Findhorn. In the seventeenth century wild sand had blown into the mouth and covered the land, the successful replanting of the forest was a great success for the commission. This Wonderful World was shown weekly, other topics for episodes included Leonardo da Vinci, ballet, king penguins and Norman McLaren's \"Boogie Doodle\".\nThis Wonderful World began to be aired in England in February 1959, it ran for a further eight years and was in the Top Ten programmes for the week for the UK in 1960. In 1961, Grierson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours. In 1962, he was a member of the jury for the Vancouver Film Festival, during his visit to Canada he also received the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Medal for his contribution to the visual arts. In 1963, he was busy with This Wonderful World and the Films of Scotland Committee but still found time to attend the twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Film Board in Montreal.\nIn 1965, Grierson was the patron of the Commonwealth Film Festival which took place in Cardiff in that year. In 1966, he was offered the role of Governor of the British Film Institute; however, he turned down the position. This Wonderful World changed the title to John Grierson Presents.\nIn 1967, after returning from the Oberhausen Film Festival where he had been the President of Honour of the jury, Grierson suffered a bout of bronchitis which lasted eight days. His brother Anthony, who had trained to be a doctor was called and diagnosed Grierson with emphysema, his coughing fits were a cause for concern, and he was admitted to Manor Hospital. Grierson decided to give up smoking and drinking to benefit his health.\nLater life.\nGrierson opened the new primary school at Cambusbarron on 10 October 1967; his sister Dorothy attended the day with him. The BBC expressed their wishes to make a programme about Grierson in the year of his seventieth birthday, which he turned down three times In the year of his seventieth birthday, Grierson received many tributes from across the globe. He was made an honorary member of the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians; he pressed for the ceremony to be held in Glasgow. He also received the Golden Thistle Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Art of Cinema at the Edinburgh Film Festival.\nIn January 1969, Grierson left for Canada to lecture at McGill University; enrollment for his classes grew to around seven hundred students. He also lectured at Carleton University once a fortnight. At Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh on 8 July 1969, Grierson received an Honorary Doctorate of Literature. A few days earlier on 4 July 1969, Grierson had opened the Scottish Fisheries Museum in Anstruther.\nGrierson was a member of the jury for the Canadian Film Awards in 1970. He spent a few months in 1971, travelling around India instilling the importance of having small production units throughout the country. He returned to the UK in December 1971 and was meant to travel back to India; however, his trip was delayed by the Indo-Pakistani War. Grierson went into hospital for a health check-up in January 1972; he was diagnosed with lung and liver cancer and was given months to live. During his time in hospital he spent time dictating letters to his wife, Margaret, and received visitors; however, he fell unconscious on 18 February and died on the 19th. In his wishes for his funeral he had detailed his desire to be cremated. Also according to his wishes, his urn was placed in the sea off the Old Head in Kinsale, and his brother Anthony, who had died in August 1971, had his ashes placed at the same time.

A major figure in the post-New Hollywood era, his films combine cutting-edge film technology with classical filmmaking techniques and have grossed over $8\u00a0billion worldwide, making him the second-highest-grossing film director of all time. Cameron has received numerous accolades including three Academy Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards, as well as nominations for six British Academy Film Awards.\nBorn and raised in Canada, Cameron moved to California aged 17 and enrolled at Fullerton College. Beginning his career with the short film \"Xenogenesis\" (1978), he first gained recognition for writing and directing the science fiction action film \"The Terminator\" (1984). He had further success with \"Aliens\" (1986), \"The Abyss\" (1989), \"\" (1991), and \"True Lies\" (1994), as well as the \"Avatar\" franchise (2009\u2013present). He directed, wrote, co-produced, and co-edited the historical romance epic \"Titanic\" (1997), winning Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Film Editing.\nThree of Cameron's films\u2014\"Avatar\" (2009), ' (2022) and the aforementioned \"Titanic\"\u2014are amongst the top four highest-grossing films of all time, with \"Avatar\" in the top spot until it was surpassed by ' (2019), before returning to first place in 2021. He directed the first film to gross over $1\u00a0billion, the first two films to gross over $2\u00a0billion each, and is the only director to have had three films gross over $2 billion each. \"The Terminator\", \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\", and \"Titanic\" have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. Cameron also co-founded the production companies Lightstorm Entertainment, Digital Domain, and Earthship Productions. In 2010, \"Time\" named Cameron one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\nIn addition to filmmaking, he is a National Geographic explorer-in-residence and has produced many documentaries on deep-ocean exploration, including \"Ghosts of the Abyss\" (2003) and \"Aliens of the Deep\" (2005). Cameron has also contributed to underwater filming and remote vehicle technologies, and helped create the new digital 3D Fusion Camera System. In 2012, he became the first person to complete a solo descent to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of Earth's ocean, in the \"Deepsea Challenger\" submersible. He is also an environmentalist and runs several sustainability businesses.\nEarly life and education.\nJames Francis Cameron was born on August 16, 1954, in Kapuskasing, Ontario, to Philip Cameron, an electrical engineer, and Shirley (n\u00e9e\u00a0Lowe), an artist and nurse. He is the first of five children, with two brothers and two sisters. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825. Cameron spent summers on his grandfather's farm in southern Ontario. He attended Stamford Collegiate in Niagara Falls. At age 17, Cameron and his family moved from Chippawa to Brea, California. He attended Sonora High School and then moved to Brea Olinda High School. Classmates recalled that he was not a sportsman but instead enjoyed building things that \"either went up into the air or into the deep\".\nAfter high school, Cameron enrolled at Fullerton College, a community college, in 1973 to study physics. He switched subjects to English, but left the college at the end of 1974. Cameron worked odd jobs, including as a truck driver and a high school janitor. He drank beer, frequently consumed cannabis and LSD, and wrote in his free time. During this period, he learned about special effects by reading other students' work on \"optical printing, or front screen projection, or dye transfers, anything that related to film technology\" at the University of Southern California library. After the excitement of seeing \"Star Wars\" in 1977, Cameron quit his job as a truck driver to enter the film industry.\nCareer.\n1978\u20131989: Career beginnings and rise to prominence.\nCameron's directing career began in 1978. After borrowing money from a consortium of dentists, he learned to direct, write and produce his first short film, \"Xenogenesis\" (1978), with a friend. Learning as he went, Cameron said he felt like a doctor doing his first surgical procedure. He then served as a production assistant for \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\" (1979). While educating himself about filmmaking techniques, Cameron started a job as a miniature model maker at Roger Corman Studios. He was soon employed as an art director for the science-fiction film \"Battle Beyond the Stars\" (1980). He carried out the special effects for John Carpenter's \"Escape from New York\" (1981), served as production designer for \"Galaxy of Terror\" (1981), and consulted on the design for \"Android\" (1982).\nCameron was hired as the visual effects director for the sequel to \"Piranha\" (1978), titled \"\" in 1982. The original director, Miller Drake, left the project due to creative differences with producer Ovidio Assonitis. Shot in Rome, Italy, and on Grand Cayman Island, the film gave Cameron the opportunity to become director for a major film for the first time. Cameron later said that it did not feel like his first film due to power-struggles with Assonitis. Upon release of \"Piranha II: The Spawning\", critics were not impressed; author Tim Healey called it \"a marvellously bad movie which splices clich\u00e9s from every conceivable source\".\nIn 1982, inspired by John Carpenter's horror film \"Halloween\" (1978), as well as a nightmare about an invincible robot hit-man sent from the future to assassinate him, Cameron wrote the script for \"The Terminator\" (1984), a sci-fi action film about a cyborg sent from the future to carry out a lethal mission. Cameron wanted to sell the script so that he could direct the film. While some film studios expressed interest in the project, many executives were unwilling to let a new and unfamiliar director make the film. Gale Anne Hurd, a colleague and founder of Pacific Western Productions, agreed to buy Cameron's script for one dollar, on the condition that Cameron direct the film. He convinced the president of Hemdale Pictures to make the film, with Cameron as director and Hurd as a producer. Lance Henriksen, who starred in \"Piranha II: The Spawning\", was considered for the lead role, but Cameron decided that Arnold Schwarzenegger was more suitable as the cyborg villain due to his bodybuilder appearance. Henriksen was given a smaller role instead. Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton also joined the cast. \"The Terminator\" was a box office success, exceeding expectations set by Orion Pictures, and earning over $78\u00a0million worldwide. George Perry of the BBC praised Cameron's direction, writing \"Cameron laces the action with ironic jokes, but never lets up on hinting that the terror may strike at any moment\". In 2008, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nIn 1984, Cameron was hired to write a sequel to \"First Blood\"; it was rewritten by Sylvester Stallone and released as \"\". Cameron was then hired to write and direct a sequel to \"Alien\" (1979), a science fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott. Like the original, the sequel \"Aliens\" (1986) featured Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley. \"Aliens\" follows Ripley as she helps a group of marines fight off extraterrestrials. Despite conflicts with cast and crew during production, and having to replace one of the lead actors \u2014 James Remar with Michael Biehn \u2014 \"Aliens\" was a box office success, generating over $130\u00a0million worldwide. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1987; Best Actress, Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score and Best Sound. It won awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. In addition, Weaver and the film made the cover of \"Time\" in July 1986.\nAfter \"Aliens\", Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd decided to make \"The Abyss\", a story about oil-rig workers who discover strange intelligent life in the ocean. Based on an idea which Cameron had conceived of during high school, the film was initially budgeted at $41\u00a0million, although it ran considerably over this amount. It starred Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Michael Biehn. The production process began in the Cayman Islands and in South Carolina, in two huge water tanks \"reclaimed from\" an unfinished nuclear power plant. The cast and crew recall Cameron's dictatorial behavior, and the filming of water scenes which were mentally and physically exhausting. Upon the film's release, \"The Abyss\" was praised for its special effects, and earned $90\u00a0million at the worldwide box office. \"The Abyss\" received four Academy Award nominations, and won Best Visual Effects.\n1990\u20131999: \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day\", \"True Lies\", and \"Titanic\".\nIn 1990, Cameron co-founded the firm Lightstorm Entertainment with collaborator Lawrence Kasanoff. In 1991, Cameron served as executive producer for \"Point Break\" (1991), directed by Kathryn Bigelow. After the success of \"The Terminator\", there were discussions for a sequel, and by the late 1980s, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures secured the rights to the sequel, allowing Cameron to begin production of the film, \"\" (1991). Written by Cameron and William Wisher Jr., Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles. The story follows on from \"Terminator\", depicting a new villain (T-1000), with shape-shifting abilities who hunts for Sarah Connor's son, John (Edward Furlong). Cameron cast Robert Patrick as T-1000 because of his lean and thin appearance \u2014 a sharp contrast to Schwarzenegger. Cameron explained: \"I wanted someone who was extremely fast and agile. If the T-800 is a human Panzer tank, then the T-1000 is a Porsche\". \"Terminator 2\" was one of the most expensive films to be produced, costing at least $ ($ in 2024). Despite the challenging use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), the film was completed on time and released on July 3, 1991. \"Terminator 2\" broke box office records (including the opening weekend record for an R-rated film), earning over $ in North America and being the first to earn over $ worldwide (respectively over $ and $ in 2024). It won four Academy Awards: Best Makeup, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. It also received nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing.\nIn subsequent years, Cameron planned to do a third \"Terminator\" film, but plans never materialized. The rights to the \"Terminator\" franchise were eventually purchased by Kassar from a bankruptcy sale of Carolco's assets. Cameron moved on to other projects and, in 1993, co-founded Digital Domain, a visual effects production company. In 1994, Cameron and Schwarzenegger reunited for their third collaboration, \"True Lies,\" a remake of the 1991 French comedy \"La Totale!\" The story depicts an American secret agent who leads a double life as a married man, whose wife believes he is a computer salesman. The film co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Eliza Dushku and Tom Arnold. Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment signed a deal with 20th Century Fox for the production of \"True Lies\". Budgeted at a minimum of $100\u00a0million, the film earned $146\u00a0million in the United States and Canada. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and Curtis won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. It was during the production of \"True Lies\" that he would first meet Jon Landau, who at the time oversaw the film's production for Fox. In July 2024, Cameron stated that he \"lured\" Landau away from Fox to Lightstorm.\nIn 1995, Cameron co-produced \"Strange Days\", a science fiction thriller. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and co-written by Jay Cocks, \"Strange Days\" was critically and financially unsuccessful. In 1996, Cameron reunited with the cast of \"Terminator 2\" to film \"\", an attraction at Universal Studios Florida, and in other parks around the world.\nHis next major project was \"Titanic\" (1997), an epic about the , which sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg. With a production budget of $200\u00a0million, at the time it was the most expensive film ever made. Starting in 1995, Cameron took several dives to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to capture footage of the wreck, which would later be used in the film. A replica of the ship was built in Rosarito Beach and principal photography began in September 1996. \"Titanic\" made headlines before its release, for being over-budget and exceeding its schedule. In a radical departure from Cameron's previous work, his completed screenplay depicts two star-crossed lovers, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, from different social classes who fall in love amid the backdrop of the ship's tragedy. The supporting cast includes Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, David Warner and Bill Paxton. The film was also Cameron's first large-scale production with Landau as a co-producer.\nAfter months of delay, \"Titanic\" premiered on December 19, 1997. The film received strong critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing film of all time, holding this position for twelve years, until Cameron's \"Avatar\" beat the record in 2010. The costumes and sets were praised, and \"The Washington Post\" considered the CGI graphics to be spectacular. \"Titanic\" received a record-tying fourteen nominations (tied with \"All About Eve\" in 1950) at the 1998 Academy Awards. It won eleven of the awards, tying the record for most wins with 1959's \"Ben-Hur\" (now also tied with 2003's \"\") including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, Best Original Score and Best Original Song. Upon receiving Best Picture, Cameron and producer Jon Landau asked for a moment of silence to remember the 1,500 people who died when the ship sank. Film critic Roger Ebert praised Cameron's storytelling, writing: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding\". Authors Kevin Sandler and Gaylyn Studlar wrote in 1999 that the romance, historical nostalgia and James Horner's music contributed to the film's cultural phenomenon. In 2017, on its 20th anniversary, \"Titanic\" became Cameron's second film to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nAfter the huge success of \"Titanic\", Cameron kept a low profile. In 1998, he and his brother, John, formed Earthship Productions, to stream documentaries about the deep sea, one of Cameron's interests. Again during 1998, Cameron considered doing a large-scale technological/religious film by an unknown writer, but after three tries was forced to personally pass on the project \"due to his secular nature.\" Cameron had also planned to make a film about Spider-Man, a project developed by Menahem Golan of Cannon Films. Columbia hired David Koepp to adapt Cameron's ideas into a screenplay, but due to various disagreements, Cameron abandoned the project. In 2002, \"Spider-Man\" was released with the screenplay credited solely to Koepp.\n2000\u20132009: Television debut, documentaries, and \"Avatar\".\nIn 2000, Cameron made his debut in television and, with Charles H. Eglee, co-created \"Dark Angel\", a television series influenced by cyberpunk, biopunk, contemporary superheroes and third-wave feminism. \"Dark Angel\" starred Jessica Alba as Max Guevara, a genetically enhanced super-soldier created by a secretive organization. While the first season was moderately successful, the second season did less well, which led to its cancellation.\nIn 2002, Cameron served as producer on the 2002 film \"Solaris\", a science fiction drama directed by Steven Soderbergh. The film gained mixed reviews and failed at the box office. Keen to make documentaries, Cameron directed \"\", about the German Battleship \"Bismarck\". In 2003, he directed \"Ghosts of the Abyss\", a documentary about RMS \"Titanic\" which was released by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, and designed for 3D theaters. Cameron told \"The Guardian\" his intention for filming everything in 3D. In 2005, Cameron co-directed \"Aliens of the Deep\", a documentary about the various forms of life in the ocean. He also starred in \"Titanic Adventure\" with Tony Robinson, another documentary about the \"Titanic\" shipwreck. In 2006, Cameron co-created and narrated \"The Exodus Decoded\", a documentary exploring the Biblical account of the Exodus. In 2007, Cameron and fellow director Simcha Jacobovici, produced \"The Lost Tomb of Jesus\". It was broadcast on Discovery Channel on March 4, 2007; the documentary was controversial for arguing that the Talpiot Tomb was the burial place of Jesus of Nazareth.\nBy the mid-2000s, Cameron returned to directing and producing his first mainstream film since \"Titanic\". Cameron had displayed interest in making \"Avatar\" (2009) and \"\" (2019) as early as June 2005, with both films to be shot using 3D technology. He wanted to make \"Alita: Battle Angel\" first, followed by \"Avatar\", but switched the order in February 2006. Although Cameron had written an 80-page treatment for \"Avatar\" in 1995, Cameron stated that he wanted the necessary technology to improve before starting production. \"Avatar\", with the story line set in the mid-22nd century, had an estimated budget in excess of $300\u00a0million. The cast includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez and Sigourney Weaver. It was composed with a mix of live-action footage and computer-generated animation, using an advanced version of the motion capture technique, previously used by director Robert Zemeckis in \"The Polar Express\". Cameron intended \"Avatar\" to be 3D-only but decided to adapt it for conventional viewing as well.\nIntended for release in May 2009, \"Avatar\" premiered on December 18, 2009. This delay allowed more time for post-production and the opportunity for theaters to install 3D projectors. \"Avatar\" broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed $749.7\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and more than $2.74\u00a0billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing \"Titanic\". It was the first film to earn more than $2\u00a0billion worldwide. \"Avatar\" was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three: Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. In July 2010, an extended theatrical re-release generated an additional $33.2\u00a0million worldwide () at the box office. In his mixed review, Sukhdev Sandhu of \"The Telegraph\" complimented the 3D, but opined that Cameron \"should have been more brutal in his editing\". That year, \"Vanity Fair\" reported that Cameron's earnings were US$257\u00a0million, making him the highest earner in Hollywood. As of 2022, \"Avatar\" and \"Titanic\" hold the achievement for being the first two of the six films in history to gross over $2\u00a0billion worldwide. As with \"Titanic\", Landau would greatly assist Cameron as the co-producer of the \"Avatar\" films as well.\n2010\u2013present.\nIn 2011, Cameron served as an executive producer for \"Sanctum\", a disaster-survival film about a cave diving expedition which turns deadly. Although receiving mixed reviews, the film earned a fair $108\u00a0million at the worldwide box office. Cameron re-investigated the sinking of RMS \"Titanic\" with eight experts in a 2012 TV documentary special, \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron\", which premiered on April 8 on the National Geographic channel. In the feature, the experts revised the CGI animation of the sinking conceived in 1995. In March 2010, Cameron announced that \"Titanic\" will be converted and re-released in 3D to commemorate the centennial anniversary of the tragedy. On March 27, 2012, \"Titanic\" 3D premiered at London's Royal Albert Hall. He also served as executive producer of \"\" and \"Deepsea Challenge 3D\" in 2012 and 2014, respectively.\nCameron starred in the 2017 documentary \"Atlantis Rising,\" with collaborator Simcha Jacobovici. The pair goes on an adventure to explore the existence of the city of Atlantis. The programme aired on January 29 on National Geographic. Next, Cameron produced and appeared in a documentary about the history of science fiction. \"James Cameron's Story of Science Fiction,\" the six-episodic series was broadcast on AMC in 2018. The series featured interviews with guests including Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan. He stated \"Without Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, there wouldn't have been Ray Bradbury or Robert A. Heinlein, and without them, there wouldn't be [George] Lucas, [Steven] Spielberg, Ridley Scott or me\".\n' was finally released in 2019, after being in parallel development with \"Avatar\". Written by Cameron and friend Jon Landau, the film was directed by Robert Rodriguez and produced by Cameron. The film is based on a 1990s Japanese manga series \"Battle Angel Alita,\" depicting a cyborg who cannot remember anything of her past life and tries to uncover the truth. Produced with similar techniques and technology as in \"Avatar,\" the film starred Rosa Salazar, Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Jackie Earle Haley and Keean Johnson. The film premiered on January 31, 2019, to generally positive reviews and $404\u00a0million () at the worldwide box office. In her review, Monica Castillo of \"RogerEbert.com\" called it \"an awe-inspiring jump for [Rodriguez]\" and \"a visual bonanza\", despite the bulky script. Cameron then returned to the \"Terminator\" franchise as producer and writer for Tim Miller's ' (2019).\nIn August 2013, Cameron announced plans to direct three sequels to \"Avatar\" simultaneously, for release in December 2016, 2017, and 2018. However, the release dates were adjusted due to Cameron's other priorities, with \"Avatar\" \"3\", \"4\" and \"5\" to be released, respectively, on December 20, 2024, December 18, 2026, and December 22, 2028. \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimated that the budget for these would be over $1\u00a0billion. \"Avatar 2\" (later given the subtitle ') and \"Avatar 3\" (later given the subtitle ') began simultaneous production in Manhattan Beach, California on August 15, 2017. Principal photography began in New Zealand on September 25, 2017. Parts of \"Avatar 4\" were also filmed during this time. Cameron stated in a 2017 interview: \"Let's face it, if \"Avatar 2\" and \"3\" don't make enough money, there's not going to be a \"4\" and \"5\"\". \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" had its world premiere in London on December 6, 2022. It became the highest-grossing film released in 2022, and as of 2023 stood as the 3rd highest-grossing film of all time, behind only \"Avatar\" and \"\", and just ahead of \"Titanic\".\nLightstorm Entertainment bought the film rights to the Taylor Stevens novel \"The Informationist\", a thriller set in Africa with Cameron planning to direct. In 2010, he indicated he would adapt the Charles R. Pellegrino book \"The Last Train from Hiroshima\", which is about the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Cameron met with survivor Tsutomu Yamaguchi before his death in 2010. In 2024, \"Deadline Hollywood\" confirmed that Cameron had purchased the rights of not only \"The Last Train from Hiroshima\", but also of Pellegrino's forthcoming \"Ghosts of Hiroshima\", to make an \"uncompromising theatrical epic motion picture\" titled \"Last Train From Hiroshima\" about a Japanese man who survives Hiroshima's bombing at the height of World War II only to then take a train to Nagasaki's bombing, which he will shoot as soon as the \"Avatar\" sequels' production permits. Feeling that he and Pellegrino owe Yamaguchi for handing the baton of his personal story to them so they could pass his unique and harrowing experience to future generations, Cameron was assisted by the \"Avatar\" sequels co-writer Shane Salerno and Pellegrino, who previously served as Cameron's science consultant on \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\".\nIn 2025, Cameron announced that Lightstorm Entertainment had acquired the rights to Joe Abercrombie's novel \"The Devils\" and that he would begin working on a screenplay for a film based on the novel after completion of \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\".\nIn June 2010, Cameron met with officials of the Environmental Protection Agency to discuss possible solutions to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It was reported that he offered his assistance to help stop the oil well from leaking. He is a member of the NASA Advisory Council and he worked with the space agency to build cameras for the Curiosity rover sent for Mars. NASA launched the rover without Cameron's technology due to a lack of time during testing. He has expressed interest in a project about Mars, stating: \"I've been very interested in the Humans to Mars movement ... and I've done a tremendous amount of personal research for a novel, a miniseries, and a 3D film.\" Cameron is a member of the Mars Society, a non-profit organization lobbying for the colonization of Mars. Cameron endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the 2016 United States presidential election.\nDeep-sea exploration.\nCameron has experience with deep-sea exploration, in part because of his work on \"The Abyss,\" \"Titanic\", and \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" and his childhood fascination with shipwrecks. He has contributed to advancements in underwater filming and remotely operated vehicles, and helped develop the 3D Fusion Camera System. In 2011, Cameron became a \"National Geographic\" explorer-in-residence. In this role, on March 7, 2012, he dived five miles deep to the bottom of the New Britain Trench with the \"Deepsea Challenger\". 19 days later, Cameron reached the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the Mariana Trench. He spent more than three hours exploring the ocean floor, becoming the first to accomplish the trip alone. During his dive to the Challenger Deep, he discovered new species of sea cucumber, squid worm and a giant single-celled amoeba. He was preceded by unmanned dives in 1995 and 2009, as well as by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh, the first men to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench aboard the bathyscaphe \"Trieste\" in 1960.\nIn the aftermath of the \"Titan\" submersible implosion, Cameron said he was \"struck by the similarity\" between the submersible's implosion and the events that resulted in the \"Titanic\" disaster. He noted that both disasters seemed preventable, and were caused indirectly by someone deliberately ignoring safety warnings from others. Cameron criticized the company OceanGate and its late CEO Stockton Rush for their choice of carbon-fibre composite construction of the pressure vessel, saying it has \"no strength in compression\" when subject to the immense pressures at depth. Cameron said that pressure hulls should be made out of contiguous materials such as steel, titanium, ceramic, or acrylic, and that the wound carbon fibre of \"Titan\"'s hull had seemed like a bad idea to him from the beginning. He stated that it was long known that composite hulls were vulnerable to microscopic water ingress, delamination, and progressive failure over time. He also criticized Rush's real-time monitoring of the hull as an inadequate solution that would do little to prevent an implosion. Cameron expressed regret for not being more outspoken about these concerns before the accident, and criticized what he termed \"false hopes\" being presented to the victims' families; he and his colleagues realized early on that for communication and tracking (the latter housed in a separate pressure vessel, with its own battery) to be lost simultaneously, the cause was almost certainly a catastrophic implosion.\nPersonal life.\nCameron has been married five times. He was married to Sharon Williams from 1978 to 1984. A year after he and Williams divorced, Cameron married film producer Gale Anne Hurd, a close collaborator for his 1980s films. They divorced in 1989. Soon after separating from Hurd, Cameron met the director Kathryn Bigelow, whom he wed in 1989; they divorced in 1991. Cameron then began a relationship with Linda Hamilton, the lead actress in \"The Terminator\" series. Their daughter was born in 1993. Cameron married Hamilton in 1997. Amid speculation of an affair between Cameron and actress Suzy Amis, Cameron and Hamilton separated after two years of marriage, with Hamilton receiving a settlement of $50\u00a0million. He married Amis, his fifth wife, in 2000. They have one son and two daughters together.\nCameron applied for American citizenship in 2004, but withdrew his application after George W. Bush won the presidential election. Cameron resided in the United States, but after filming \"Avatar\" in New Zealand, Cameron bought a home and a farm there in 2012. He divided his time between Malibu, California and New Zealand until 2020, after which he sold his Malibu home and decided to live in New Zealand permanently. He said in August 2020: \"I plan to make all my future films in New Zealand, and I see the country having an opportunity to demonstrate to the international film industry how to safely return to work. Doing so with \"Avatar\" [sequels] will be a beacon that, when this is over [COVID-19 pandemic], will attract more production to New Zealand and continue to stimulate the screen industry and the economy for years.\" In February 2025, Cameron was planning to formally become a New Zealand citizen. He was formally granted New Zealand citizenship at a ceremony on August 13, 2025.\nCameron is an atheist; he formerly associated himself with agnosticism, a stance he said he had come to see as \"cowardly atheism.\" Since 2011, he is vegan. Cameron met close friend Guillermo del Toro on the production of his 1993 film, \"Cronos\". In 1997, del Toro's father Federico was kidnapped in Guadalajara and Cameron gave del Toro more than $1\u00a0million () in cash to pay a ransom and have his father released. Cameron had been friends with \"Titanic\" expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet for over 25 years before the latter's death.\nCameron had a strong interest in visiting the space stations Mir and International Space Station (ISS). He spent the summer of 2000 in Moscow getting ready for a potential trip to space, and was offered an opportunity to go by NASA. However, the trip did not include a visit to the space station, so he declined the offer as it did not align with his terms. The shuttle flight he turned down was the tragic 2003 Space Shuttle \"Columbia\" disaster. Cameron attended the memorial service for the victims of the disaster.\nIn June 2013, British artist Roger Dean filed a copyright complaint against Cameron, seeking damages of $50\u00a0million (). Relating to \"Avatar\", Cameron was accused of \"wilful and deliberate copying, dissemination and exploitation\" of Dean's original images; the case was dismissed by US district judge Jesse Furman in 2014. \nIn 2016, Premier Exhibitions, owner of many RMS \"Titanic\" artifacts, filed for bankruptcy. Cameron supported the UK's National Maritime Museum and National Museums Northern Ireland decision to bid for the artifacts, but they were acquired by an investment group before a formal bid took place.\nCameron joined the board of directors of AI company Stability AI in September 2024.\nFilmmaking style.\nThemes.\nCameron's films are often based on themes which explore the conflicts between intelligent machines and humanity or nature, dangers of corporate greed, strong female characters, and a romance subplot. Cameron has further stated in an interview with The Talks, \"All my movies are love stories\". Both \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\" are noted for featuring star-crossed lovers. Characters suffering from emotionally intense and dramatic environments in the sea wilderness are explored in \"The Abyss\" and \"Titanic\". The \"Terminator\" series amplifies technology as an enemy which could lead to devastation of mankind. Similarly, \"Avatar\" views tribal people as an honest group, whereas a \"technologically advanced imperial culture is fundamentally evil\". The danger of nuclear war, as featured in \"The Terminator\", \"\" and in his forthcoming \"Last Train From Hiroshima\" film, has been one of Cameron's fears since he watched the Cuban Missile Crisis unfold when he was eight years old.\nMethod.\nCameron is regarded as an innovative filmmaker in the industry, with a classical filmmaking style, as well as not easy to work for. \"Radio Times\" critic John Ferguson described Cameron as \"the king of hi-tech thrillers\". Dalin Rowell of \"/Film\" stated: \"Known for his larger-than-life creations and unique filmmaking style, director James Cameron is in a league all of his own. With his genre-spanning work, lofty ambitions, and unrestrained energy, Cameron has carved out a name for himself in Hollywood as an artist willing to do anything to see his vision come true.\" Rebecca Keegan, author of \"The Futurist: The Life and Films of James Cameron,\" describes Cameron as \"comically hands-on\", and as someone who would try to do every job on the set. Andrew Gumbel of \"The Independent\" says Cameron \"is a nightmare to work with. Studios fear his habit of straying way over schedule and over budget. He is notorious on set for his uncompromising and dictatorial manner, as well as his flaming temper\". Author Alexandra Keller writes that Cameron is an egomaniac, obsessed with vision, but praises his \"technological ingenuity\" at creating a \"visceral viewing experience\".\nAccording to Ed Harris, who starred in Cameron's film \"The Abyss\", Cameron behaved in an autocratic manner. Orson Scott Card, who novelized \"The Abyss\", stated that Cameron \"made everyone around him miserable, and his unkindness did nothing to improve the film in any way. Nor did it motivate people to work faster or better\". Harris later said: \"I like Jim. He's an incredibly talented, intelligent guy\", adding that \"it was always good to see him\" in later years. Speaking of her experience on \"Titanic\", Kate Winslet said that she admired Cameron, but \"there were times I was genuinely frightened of him\". Describing him as having \"a temper like you wouldn't believe\", she had said she would not work with him again unless it was \"for a lot of money\". Despite this, Winslet and Cameron still looked for future projects and Winslet was eventually cast in \"Avatar 2\". Her co-star Leonardo DiCaprio told \"Esquire\": \"When somebody felt a different way on the set, there was a confrontation. He lets you know exactly how he feels\", but complimented Cameron, \"he's of the lineage of John Ford. He knows what he wants his film to be.\" Sam Worthington, who starred in \"Avatar\", said that if a mobile phone rang during filming, Cameron would \"nail it to the wall with a nail gun\". Composer James Horner was also not immune to Cameron's demands; he recalls having to write music in a short time frame for \"Aliens.\" After the experience, Horner did not work with Cameron for a decade. In 1996, they reconciled their friendship and Horner produced the soundtracks for \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\".\nDespite this reputation, Sigourney Weaver has praised Cameron's perfectionism and attention to detail, saying: \"He really does want us to risk our lives and limbs for the shot, but he doesn't mind risking his own\". In 2015, Weaver and Jamie Lee Curtis both applauded Cameron in an interview. Curtis remarked: \"He can do every other job [than acting]. I'm talking about every single department, from art direction to props to wardrobe to cameras, he knows more than everyone doing the job\". Curtis also said Cameron \"loves actors\", while Weaver referred to Cameron as \"so generous to actors\" and a \"genius\". Michael Biehn, a frequent collaborator, also praised Cameron, saying he \"is a really passionate person. He cares more about his movies than other directors care about their movies\", adding, \"I've never seen him yell at anybody\". Biehn acknowledged that Cameron is \"not real sensitive when it comes to actors and their trailers, and waiting for actors to come to the set\". Worthington commented: \"He demands excellence. If you don't give it to him, you're going to get chewed out. And that's a good thing\". When asked in 2012 about his reputation, Cameron dryly responded: \"I don't have to shout any more, because the word is out there already\".\nIn 2021, while giving a MasterClass during a break from his work on the \"Avatar\" sequels, Cameron acknowledged his past demanding behaviour, opining that if he could go back in time, he would improve the working relationship with his cast and crew members by being less autocratic, thinking of himself as a \"tinpot dictator\"; Cameron stated that when he visited one of Ron Howard's sets, he was \"dumbfounded\" at how much time Howard took to compliment his crew, aspiring to become \"his inner Ron Howard\".\nInfluence.\nCameron's work has had an impact in the Hollywood film industry. \"The Avengers\" (2012), directed by Joss Whedon, was inspired by Cameron's approach to action sequences. Whedon also admires Cameron's ability for writing heroic female characters such as Ellen Ripley of \"Aliens\", adding that he is \"the leader and the teacher and the Yoda\". Director Michael Bay idolizes Cameron and was convinced by him to use 3D cameras for filming \"\" (2011). Cameron's approach to 3D inspired Baz Luhrmann during the production of \"The Great Gatsby\" (2013). Other directors that have been inspired by Cameron include Peter Jackson, Neill Blomkamp, and Xavier Dolan.\nAwards and recognition.\nCameron received the inaugural Ray Bradbury Award from the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1992 for \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\". In recognition of \"a distinguished career as a Canadian filmmaker\", Carleton University awarded Cameron the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts on June 13, 1998. Cameron received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1998, presented by Awards Council member George Lucas. He also received an honorary doctorate in 1998 from Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, for his accomplishments in the international film industry. In 1998, Cameron attended a convocation to receive an honorary degree from Ryerson University, Toronto. The university awards its highest honor to those who have made extraordinary contributions in Canada or internationally. A year later, Cameron received the honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from California State University, Fullerton. He accepted the degree at the university's summer annual commencement exercise.\nCameron's work has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences; as one of the few directors to have won three Academy Awards in a single year. For \"Titanic\", he won Best Director, Best Picture (shared with Jon Landau) and Best Film Editing (shared with Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris). In 2009, he was nominated for awards in Best Film Editing (shared with John Refoua and Stephen E. Rivkin, Best Director and Best Picture for \"Avatar.\" Cameron has won two Golden Globes: Best Director for \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\".\nIn recognition of his contributions to underwater filming and remote vehicle technology, University of Southampton awarded Cameron the honorary degree of doctor of the university in July 2004. Cameron accepted the award at the National Oceanography Centre. In 2008, Cameron received a star on Canada's Walk of Fame and a year later, received the 2,396th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On February 28, 2010, Cameron was honored with a Visual Effects Society (VES) Lifetime Achievement Award. In June 2012, Cameron was inducted to The Science Fiction Hall of Fame at the Museum of Pop Culture for his contribution to the science fiction and fantasy field. Cameron collaborated with Walt Disney Imagineering and served as a creative consultant on Pandora \u2013 The World of \"Avatar\", an \"Avatar\"-themed land at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida which opened to the public on May 27, 2017. A species of frog, \"Pristimantis jamescameroni,\" was named after Cameron for his work in promoting environmental awareness and advocacy of veganism.\nIn 2010, \"Time\" magazine named Cameron one of the 100 most influential people in the world. That same year, he was ranked at the top of the list in \"The Guardian\" Film Power 100 and in 30th place in \"New Statesman's\" list of \"The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010\". In 2013, Cameron received the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the Public, which is annually awarded by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In 2019, Cameron was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada by Governor General Julie Payette, giving him the Post Nominal Letters \"CC\" for life.\nIn 2020, Cameron was the subject of the second season of the Epicleff Media dramatic podcast \"Blockbuster\". The audio drama, created and narrated by Emmy Award-winning journalist and filmmaker Matt Schrader, chronicles Cameron's life and career (leading up to the creation and release of \"Titanic\"), and stars actor Ross Marquand in the lead voice role as Cameron.\nCameron was appointed as an Officer of the Legion of Honour in February 2025, the highest and most prestigious order of merit in France. He will officially be presented with the award at the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, where he will be one of the guests of honour.\nDirected Academy Award performancesUnder Cameron's direction, these actors have received Academy Award nominations for their performances in their respective roles."}
{"id": "15624", "revid": "48523215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15624", "title": "Judaism", "text": "Religion of the Jewish people\nJudaism () is an Abrahamic, monotheistic, ethnic religion that comprises the collective spiritual, cultural, and legal traditions of the Jewish people. Religious Jews regard Judaism as their means of observing the Mosaic covenant, which they believe was established between God and the Jewish people. The religion is considered one of the earliest monotheistic religions.\nJudaism as a religion and culture is founded upon a diverse body of texts, traditions, theologies, and worldviews. Among Judaism's core texts are the Torah (), the \"Nevi'im\" (), and the \"Ketuvim\" (), which together compose the Hebrew Bible. In Modern Hebrew, the Hebrew Bible is often referred to as the Tanakh ()\u2014an acronym of its constituent divisions\u2014or the Miqra (). The Hebrew Bible has the same books as Protestant Christianity's Old Testament, with some differences in order and content. \nIn addition to scripture, Jewish religious texts include the Oral Torah (), comprising the Mishnah, Talmud, Tosefta, and Jewish legal \"Midrashim\" (, 'Studies' or 'Expositions'); \"Halakha\" (), or Jewish law; \"Aggadah\" (); and responsa. The Hebrew word \"torah\" can mean \"teaching\", \"law\", or \"instruction\", but \"Torah\" can also be used as a general term for any Jewish text or teaching that expands or elaborates on the original Five Books of Moses. Representing the core of the Jewish spiritual and religious tradition, the Torah is both a term and a set of teachings that are explicitly self-positioned as encompassing at least seventy\u2014and potentially infinite\u2014facets and interpretations. Judaism's texts, traditions, and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity and Islam. Hebraism, like Hellenism, significantly influenced Western civilization as a key background element in the development of early Christianity.\nThere are a variety of Jewish religious movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in both the Written Torah () and Oral Torah. Historically, all or part of this assertion was challenged by groups like the Sadducees and practitioners of Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period; the Karaites; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Some modern branches of Judaism, such as Humanistic Judaism, may be considered secular or nontheistic. Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (including Haredi and Modern Orthodox Jews), Conservative Judaism, and Reform Judaism. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to \"Halakha\" (Jewish law), rabbinic authority, and Rabbinic literature, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and \"Halakha\" are explicitly divine in origin, eternal, and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that \"Halakha\" should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews. Historically, rabbinical courts known as \"batei din\" (; sg. \"beit din\") enforced \"Halakha\". \"Batei din\" are still existent, but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary. Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization but in the Jewish texts and the rabbis and scholars who interpret them.\nJews are an ethnoreligious group including those born Jewish and those who have converted to Judaism. In 2025, the world Jewish population was estimated at 14.8 million, although religious observance varies from strict to non-existent.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"Judaism\" derives from \"Iudaismus\", a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \"Ioudaismos\" (, from the verb 'to side with or imitate the [Judeans]'). Its ultimate source is the biblical \"Yehudah\" (), the Hebrew name for Judah, son of Jacob, and the namesake of the tribe of Judah, the region of Judah, and the Kingdom of Judah. The term \"Ioudaismos\" first appears in the Koine Greek book of 2 Maccabees in the 2nd century BCE (specifically 2 Maccabees 2:21, 8:1 and 14:38). In the context of the age and period, it meant \"seeking or forming part of a cultural entity\". It resembled its antonym \"Hellenismos\", a word signifying submission to Hellenistic cultural norms. The conflict between \"Ioudaismos\" and \"Hellenismos\" lay behind the Maccabean Revolt; hence, the term \"Ioudaismos\".\nRabbi Shaye J. D. Cohen writes in his book \"The Beginnings of Jewishness\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are tempted, of course, to translate [\"Iouda\u00efsm\u00f3s\"] as \"Judaism,\" but this translation is too narrow, because in this first occurrence of the term, \"Iouda\u00efsm\u00f3s\" has not yet been reduced to the designation of a religion. It means rather \"the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans Judaean (or Jews Jewish).\" Among these characteristics, to be sure, are practices and beliefs that we would today call \"religious,\" but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term. Thus \"Iouda\u00efsm\u00f3s\" should be translated not as \"Judaism\" but as Judaeanness.\nDaniel R. Schwartz, however, argues that \"Judaism\", especially in the context of the books of the Maccabees, refers to the religion, not the culture and politics of the Judean state. He believes it reflected the ideological divide between the Pharisees and Sadducees and, implicitly, anti-Hasmonean and pro-Hasmonean factions in Judean society.\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the earliest citation of the term in English was in Robert Fabyan's 1516 book \"The New Chronicles of England and France\", in which \"Judaism\" is gives as \"the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or polity of the Jews\". \"Judaism\" as a direct translation of the Latin \"Iudaismus\" first appears in a Christian 1611 English translation of 2 Maccabees 2:21: \"Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for \"Iudaisme\".\"\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe covenant with Abraham in the book of Genesis.\nA large portion of the Hebrew Bible recounts the Hebrews' relationship with God from their earliest traditions through the Second Temple period (i.e., until roughly 70 CE, when the Temple was destroyed). Abraham, initially called Abram (), is presented as the ancestor of the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob\u2014whose name is changed to Israel () in Genesis 32:29\u2014and thus the Hebrews. In the patriarchal age, God establishes a covenant with Abraham that includes the institution of circumcision () as a sign of that covenant, established when Abraham was 99 years old; the requirement to circumcise the males of his household is recorded in Genesis 17:10\u201314. God changes Abram's name to Abraham in Genesis 17:5 and Sarai's () name to Sarah (). Sarah is promised to bear a son in her old age, and that son, Isaac (), will be the child of the covenant and Abraham's heir, whose descendants will inherit the land often called Canaan.\nThe Torah, \"Nevi'im\", and \"Ketuvim\".\nIn the book of Exodus, the second book of the Hebrew Bible, the descendants of Isaac's son Jacob were enslaved in Egypt during a period of harsh oppression. God, appearing to Moses in a divine vision through a burning bush on Mount Horeb, commands him to lead the Hebrews out of bondage. God inflicts ten plagues upon Egypt\u2014such as the Nile turning to blood, swarms of locusts, and the death of the firstborn\u2014to persuade Pharaoh to release the Hebrews. After the final plague, Pharaoh relents, and the Hebrews begin their escape, known as the Exodus. They travel across the desert and arrive at Mount Sinai, where God bestows the commandments, laws, and teachings that will define the moral and spiritual foundation of the Israelite community, as recounted in the subsequent chapters. These books, together with the \"Nevi'im\" and \"Ketuvim\", are known as Written Torah, as opposed to the Oral Torah, which refers to the Mishnah, Talmud, and halakhic \"Midrashim\". The \"Nevi'im\" are comprised of historical narratives and prophetic writings, focusing on the Israelites' settlements in Canaan. The \"Ketuvim\", a diverse collection of books including the book of Psalms, book of Proverbs, and book of Esther, covers poetic and prose philosophical writings that deviate from the more literalist style of the other books.\nThe Talmud.\nRabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the Oral Torah were originally unwritten traditions based on the Law given to Moses at Sinai. However, as the persecution of Jews increased in intensity and frequency and the details of the Oral Torah were in danger of being forgotten, Judah ha-Nasi compiled them into the Mishnah, which was redacted c.\u2009200 CE. The Talmud is a compilation of the Mishnah and Gemara, rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship: Palestine and Babylonia (Lower Mesopotamia). Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two compilations of the Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in Palestine.\nHistorical analysis.\nAccording to critical scholars, the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts. Several of these scholars, such as Martin Rose and John Bright, suggest that during the First Temple period the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own version of a god viewed as superior to all other gods. Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian captivity following the First Temple\u2019s destruction, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism. In this view, it was only by the Hellenistic period that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed. John Day argues that the origins of biblical Yahweh, El, Asherah, and Ba'al, may be rooted in earlier Canaanite religion, which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like in Greek mythology.\nAntiquity.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the United Kingdom of Israel was established under Saul the King and continued under King David and Solomon, with its capital being Jerusalem. After Solomon's reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south. The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE, when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire; many people were taken captive from the capital Samaria to Media and the Khabur River valley. The Kingdom of Judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar II of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586\u201387 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and the First Temple, forcing the Israelites into the Babylonian captivity in what is regarded as the first Jewish diaspora. Many of the Israelites returned to their homeland\u2014an known as the return to Zion\u2014after the subsequent fall of Babylon accomplished by the Persian Achaemenid Empire seventy years later. A Second Temple was constructed, and religious practices were resumed.\nDuring the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly led by Ezra. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Hebrew Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed. Hellenistic Judaism spread to Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BCE, and its creation sparked widespread controversy in Jewish communities, starting \"conflicts within Jewish communities about accommodating the cultures of occupying powers.\"\nDuring the First Jewish\u2013Roman War (66\u201373 CE), the Romans sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Second Temple. Later, Roman emperor Hadrian built a pagan idol on the Temple Mount and prohibited circumcision. These acts of ethnocide provoked the Bar Kokhba revolt (132\u2013136 CE), after which the Romans banned the study of the Torah and the celebration of Jewish holidays and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a \"religio licita\" (\"legitimate religion\") until the rise of Gnosticism and early Christianity in the fourth century.\nFollowing the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple; prayer took the place of sacrifice; worship was conducted within the Jewish communities of the diaspora; and the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities was established.\nJudaism in pre-Islamic Arabia goes back to the pre-Christian period, and was concentrated in the northwest and south. In the fourth century, the ruling class of the Himyarite Kingdom of pre-Islamic South Arabia converted to Judaism. This situation lasted until the early sixth century, when the Aksumite invasion of Himyar, instigated by the massacre of Najran, led to a transition to Christian domination.\nDefining characteristics and principles of faith.\nUnlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's principal relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created. Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of humankind. According to the Hebrew Bible, God promised Abraham that he would make of his offspring a great nation. Many generations later, he commanded the Israelites to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world. He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people.\nThus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism in Kabbalah, Conservative rabbi and scholar Max Kadushin has characterized normative Judaism as \"normal mysticism\", because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews. This is played out through the observance of the \"Halakha\" and given verbal expression in the \"Birkhot Ha-Mizvot\" (), the short blessings recited every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The ordinary, familiar, everyday things and occurrences we have, constitute occasions for the experience of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the \"Berakhot\". \"Kedushah\", holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The \"Birkat Ha-Mitzwot\" evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are non-theurgic. And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a \"Berakah\" is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the \"occasions\" for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.\nWhereas Jewish philosophers often debate whether God is immanent or transcendent, and whether people have free will or their lives are determined, \"Halakha\" is a system through which Jews act to recognize God in the world. Ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism. However, monotheism has not always been followed in practice. The Hebrew Bible records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in ancient Israel. In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity.\nMoreover, some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in God. For some, observance of \"Halakha\" is more important than belief in God \"per se\". The debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate among religious Jews but also among historians.\nCore tenets.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMaimonides' 13 principles of faith, summarized:\nJudaism does not possess fixed, universally binding articles of faith, in the same sense as those instituted by Christianity and Islam, though some are incorporated into the liturgy to a certain extent. Scholars throughout Jewish history have proposed numerous formulations of Judaism's core tenets, all of which have met with criticism. In the 12th century, Maimonides developed his 13 principles of faith, which is the most widely accepted formulation. According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic. Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides' principles. Thus, within Reform Judaism only the first five principles are endorsed.\nIn Maimonides' time, his list of tenets was criticized by Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo. Albo and Abraham ben David argued that Maimonides' principles contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith. Along these lines, the ancient Jewish historian Josephus emphasized practice and observances rather than theology, associating apostasy with a failure to observe \"Halakha\" and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included circumcision and adherence to traditional customs. Maimonides' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries. Later, two poetic restatements of these principles (\"\"Ani Ma'amin\" and \"Yigdal\"\") became integrated into many Jewish liturgies, leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance.\nThe oldest instance of the Karaite movement's formulation of articles of faith is found in the work of the 12th century figure Judah Hadassi:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(1) God is the Creator of all created beings; (2) He is premundane and has no peer or associate; (3) the whole universe is created; (4) God called Moses and the other Prophets of the Biblical canon; (5) the Law of Moses alone is true; (6) to know the language of the Bible is a religious duty; (7) the Temple at Jerusalem is the palace of the world's Ruler; (8) belief in Resurrection contemporaneous with the advent of the Messiah; (9) final judgment; (10) retribution.\u2014\u200a\nIn modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that dictates orthodoxies. Because of this, many variations on basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism. Even so, all Jewish religious movements are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the principles of the Hebrew Bible and various commentaries, including the Talmud and \"Midrash\". Judaism also universally recognizes the biblical covenant between God and the patriarch Abraham, as well as the additional aspects of the covenant revealed to Moses, who is considered Judaism's greatest prophet. In the Mishnah, a core text of Rabbinic Judaism, acceptance of the divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism, and those who reject the covenant forfeit their share in the world to come.\nEstablishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more challenging, given the numerous and diverse contemporary Jewish religious movements. Even if restricting the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the matter remains complicated. Thus, for instance, Rav Joseph B. Soloveitchik's (associated with Modern Orthodox Judaism) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the \"Halakha\", whereas its ultimate goal is to bring holiness down to the world. Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the originator of Reconstructionist Judaism, abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism as a civilization, and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish movements as possible. In turn, Solomon Schechter's Conservative Judaism was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the creative interpretation and reinterpretation of the Hebrew Bible and \"Halakha\". Finally, David Philipson draws the outlines of the Reform movement by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to conclusions somewhat similar to that of the Conservative movement.\nReligious texts.\nThe following is a basic, structured list of the central works of Jewish practice and thought:\nLegal literature.\nThe basis of \"halakha\" and tradition is the Torah (also known as the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition, there are 613 commandments in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the Kohanim and Leviyim (members of the tribe of Levi), some only to farmers within the Land of Israel. Many laws were only applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem existed, and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today.\nWhile there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs and practices were based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the Sadducees, and the Karaites), most Jews follow the oral law. These oral traditions were transmitted by the Pharisee school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.\nAccording to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the Torah) and the Oral Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages (rabbinic leaders) of each subsequent generation.\nFor centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten, Rabbi Judah haNasi undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the \"Mishnah\".\nThe Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying \"halakha\", which are the basis of the Talmud. According to Abraham ben David, the \"Mishnah\" was compiled by Rabbi Judah haNasi after the destruction of Jerusalem, in anno mundi 3949, which corresponds to 189 CE.\nOver the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and Babylonia). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two Talmuds, the Jerusalem Talmud (\"Talmud Yerushalmi\") and the Babylonian Talmud (\"Talmud Bavli\"). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.\nIn the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined, and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.\n\"Halakha\", the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition\u2014the Mishnah, the halakhic Midrash, the Talmud and its commentaries. The \"halakha\" has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as responsa (Hebrew ). Over time, as practices develop, codes of \"halakha\" are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the Shulchan Aruch, largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.\nJewish philosophy.\nJewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include Philo of Alexandria, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Saadia Gaon, Judah Halevi, Maimonides, and Gersonides. Major changes occurred in response to the Enlightenment (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Yitzchok Hutner. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, Mordecai Kaplan, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Will Herberg, and Emmanuel L\u00e9vinas.\nRabbinic hermeneutics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n13 Principles of Hermeneutics:\n \u2014R. Ishmael\nOrthodox and many other Jews do not believe that the revealed Torah consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations as well. The study of Torah (in its widest sense, to include both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud, and for their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God's revelation, but an end in itself. According to the Talmud:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come; they are: honoring parents, loving deeds of kindness, and making peace between one person and another. But the study of the Torah is equal to them all. (Talmud Shabbat 127a).\nIn Judaism, \"the study of Torah can be a means of experiencing God\". Reflecting on the contribution of the Amoraim and Tanaim to contemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The rabbi's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic-chopping. It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world.\u00a0... Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism: the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification.\nTo study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study \"how\" to study the word of God.\nIn the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various logical and hermeneutical principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations. According to the Talmud:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A single verse has several meanings, but no two verses hold the same meaning. It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael: 'Behold, My word is like fire\u2014declares the Lord\u2014and like a hammer that shatters rock' (Jer 23:29). Just as this hammer produces many sparks (when it strikes the rock), so a single verse has several meanings.\" (Talmud Sanhedrin 34a).\nObservant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a host of interpretations.\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the written Torah were revealed to Moses at Sinai in oral form, and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.\nThus, Hillel called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws (baraita at the beginning of Sifra); R. Ishmael, thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel). Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in \"Ayyelet ha-Shachar\", the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism's earliest, contributions to logic, hermeneutics, and jurisprudence. Judah Hadassi incorporated Ishmael's principles into Karaite Judaism in the 12th century. Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.\nJewish identity.\nDistinction between Jews as a people and Judaism.\nAccording to Daniel Boyarin, the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in Platonic philosophy and that permeated Hellenistic Judaism. Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Jewish diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see Haskalah) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel. Thus, Boyarin has argued that \"Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension.\"\nIn contrast to this point of view, practices such as Humanistic Judaism reject the religious aspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.\nWho is a Jew?\nAccording to Rabbinic Judaism, a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who converted to Judaism in accordance with \"halakha\". Reconstructionist Judaism and the larger denominations of worldwide Progressive Judaism (also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the smaller regional branches. All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge. Converts are called \"ben Abraham\" or \"bat Abraham\", (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on occasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.\nRabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to some sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew, and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes. However, the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and different situations call for consideration and differing actions. For example, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism \"without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community\" and \"A proselyte who has become an apostate remains, nevertheless, a Jew\".\nKaraite Judaism believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.\nThe question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, David Ben-Gurion requested opinions on \"mihu Yehudi\" (\"Who is a Jew\") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally resurfaces in Israeli politics.\nHistorical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on \"halakhic\" definitions of matrilineal descent, and \"halakhic\" conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the Oral Torah into the Babylonian Talmud, around 200 CE. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as Deuteronomy 7:1\u20135, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and Canaanites because \"[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others.\" Leviticus 24 says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is \"of the community of Israel.\" This is complemented by Ezra 10, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children. A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period. Since the anti-religious \"Haskalah\" movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, \"halakhic\" interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.\nJewish demographics.\nThe total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of \"who is a Jew\" is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the \"Jewish Year Book\" (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3\u00a0million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6\u00a0million. It is 0.25% of world population.\nJewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001. The overall growth rate of Jews in Israel is 1.7% annually, and is consistently growing through natural population growth and extensive immigration. The diaspora countries, by contrast, have low Jewish birth rates, an increasingly elderly age composition, high rates of interreligious marriage and a negative balance of people leaving Judaism versus those joining.\nIn 2022, the world Jewish population was estimated at 15.2 million, with the majority living in one of two countries: Israel and the United States. About 46.6% of all Jews resided in Israel (6.9 million) and another 6 million Jews resided in the United States, with most of the remainder living in Europe, and other groups spread throughout Canada, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.\nJewish demographics represent diverse historical and cultural trajectories. Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel), Mizrahi Jews, and Romaniote Jews, may possess unique customs and practices.\nIn Israel, the classification of Jewish observance into categories like Haredi, Dati, Masorti, and Hiloni was developed by sociologists and researchers studying the religious and cultural landscape of Israeli society. These distinctions emerged from surveys and studies conducted by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics and scholars such as Shmuel Sandler, who explored how religious practices varied among different segments of the Jewish population. The categories were created to better understand the range of religious adherence, from the ultra-Orthodox Haredim to the secular Hilonim, with Dati and Masorti representing intermediary groups.\nJewish religious movements.\nRabbinic Judaism.\nRabbinic Judaism (or in some older sources, Rabbinism; Hebrew: \"Yahadut Rabanit\" \u2013 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e8\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05ea) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the Talmud. It is characterised by the belief that the Written Torah (Written Law) cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the Oral Torah and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the Law.\nThe Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century resulted in the division of Western Jewry (primarily, the Ashkenazi, but also western part of Sephardim and Italian rite Jews, a.k.a. \"Italkim\", and Greek Romaniote Jews\u2014both last groups are considered distinct from Ashkenazim and Sephardim) into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone countries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is rather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform. The notion \"traditional Judaism\" includes the Orthodox with Conservative or solely the Orthodox Jews:\nOrthodoxy is often divided into Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism. Haredi is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from Modern Orthodox Judaism in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices. Subsets of Haredi Judaism along both ethnic and ideological lines include Hardal (\"Nationalist Haredi\" within Religious Zionism); Hasidic Judaism, which is rooted in the Kabbalah and distinguished by reliance on a Rebbe or religious teacher; their traditionalist opponents the \"Misnagdim\" (also known as Lithuanian or \"Lita'im\"); and Sephardic Haredi Judaism, which emerged among Sephardic and Mizrahi (Asian and North African) Jews in Israel. \"Centrist\" Orthodoxy (Joseph B. Soloveitchik) is sometimes also distinguished.\nSephardi and Mizrahi Judaism.\nWhile traditions and customs vary between discrete communities, it can be said that Sephardi (Iberian, for example, most Jews from France and the Netherlands) and Mizrahi (Oriental) Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the \"movement\" framework popular in and among Ashkenazi Jewry. Historically, Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a \"big tent\" approach. This is particularly the case in contemporary Israel, which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However, individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews or some their communities may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.) Among the pioneers of Reform Judaism in the 1820s there was the Sephardic congregation Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina. A part of the European Sephardim were also linked with the Judaic modernization.\nSephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the traditional (Orthodox) and prayer rites are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel.\nJewish movements in Israel.\nIn Israel, as in the West, Judaism is also divided into major Orthodox, Conservative and Reform traditions. At the same time, for statistical and practical purposes, a different division of society is used there on the basis of a person's attitude to religion.\nMost Jewish Israelis classify themselves as \"secular\" (\"hiloni\"), \"traditional\" (\"masorti\"), \"religious\" (\"dati\") or \"ultra-religious\" (\"haredi\"). The term \"secular\" is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).\nThe term \"traditional\" (\"masorti\") is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of \"eastern\" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with Conservative Judaism, which also names itself \"Masorti\" outside North America. Only a few authors, like Elliot Nelson Dorff, consider the American Conservative (masorti) movement and Israeli masorti sector to be one and the same. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways \"secular\" and \"traditional\" are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term \"Orthodox\" is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the Jewish diaspora. What would be called \"Orthodox\" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called \"dati\" (religious, including religious zionist) or \"haredi\" (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called \"religious Zionism\" or the \"National Orthodox\" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as \"haredi-leumi\" (nationalist \"haredi\"), or \"Hardal\", which combines a largely \"haredi\" lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in Yiddish, also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as \"frum\", as opposed to \"frei\" (more liberal Jews)).\nKaraites and Samaritans.\nKaraite Judaism defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the Second Temple period, such as the Sadducees. The Karaites (\"Scripturalists\") accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the Peshat (\"simple\" meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all, although most do.\nThe Samaritans, a very small community located entirely around Mount Gerizim in the Nablus/Shechem region of the West Bank and in Holon, near Tel Aviv in Israel, regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age kingdom of Israel. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written Torah (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the Samaritan Book of Joshua).\nHaymanot (Ethiopian Judaism).\nHaymanot (meaning \"religion\" in Ge'ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge'ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like Sigd.\nNoahide (\"B'nei Noah\" movement).\nNoahidism is a Jewish religious movement based on the Seven Laws of Noah and their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism. According to the \"halakha\", non-Jews (gentiles) are not obligated to convert to Judaism, but they are required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah to be assured of a place in the world to come (olam ha-ba), the final reward of the righteous. The divinely ordained penalty for violating any of the Laws of Noah is discussed in the Talmud, but in practical terms it is subject to the working legal system which is established by the society at large. Those who subscribe to the observance of the Noahide covenant are referred to as (Hebrew: , 'Children of Noah') or \"Noahides\" (). Supporting organizations have been established around the world over the past decades by both Noahides and Orthodox Jews.\nHistorically, the Hebrew term \"B'nei Noach\" has applied to all non-Jews as descendants of Noah. However, nowadays it's primarily used to refer specifically to those non-Jews who observe the Seven Laws of Noah.\nJewish observances.\nJewish ethics.\nJewish ethics may be guided by \"halakhic\" traditions, by customs of etiquette, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness (chesed), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity (tzedakah) and refraining from negative speech (lashon hara). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.\nPrayers.\nTraditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, Shacharit, Mincha, and Ma'ariv with a fourth prayer, Mussaf added on Shabbat and holidays. At the heart of each service is the \"Amidah\" or \"Shemoneh Esrei\". Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the \"Shema Yisrael\" (or \"Shema\"). The \"Shema\" is the recitation of a verse from the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:4): \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad\"\u2014\"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!\"\nMost of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a quorum of ten adult Jews, called a \"minyan\". In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a \"minyan\"; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.\nIn addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite prayers and benedictions throughout the day when performing various acts. Prayers are recited upon waking up in the morning, before eating or drinking different foods, after eating a meal, and so on.\nThe approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an equal basis with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as reading from the Torah. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.\nReligious clothing.\nA \"kippah\" (Hebrew: \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4, plural \"kippot\"; Yiddish: \u05d9\u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05de\u05dc\u05e7\u05e2, \"yarmulke\") is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. \"Kippot\" range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.\n\"Tzitzit\" (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05b4\u05ea) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: \"tzitzis\") are special knotted \"fringes\" or \"tassels\" found on the four corners of the \"tallit\" (Hebrew: \u05d8\u05b7\u05dc\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: \"tallis\"), or prayer shawl. The \"tallit\" is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A \"tallit katan\" (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.\nTefillin (Hebrew: \u05ea\u05b0\u05e4\u05b4\u05dc\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, meaning \"safeguard\" or \"amulet\"), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.\nA \"kittel\" (Yiddish: \u05e7\u05d9\u05d8\u05dc), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the High Holidays. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a \"tallit\" and sometimes also a \"kittel\" which are part of the \"tachrichim\" (burial garments).\nJewish holidays.\nJewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate moments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as creation, revelation, and redemption.\nShabbat.\n\"Shabbat\", the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night, commemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation. It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have challah, two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under 39 categories of \"melakhah\", translated literally as \"work\". In fact, the activities banned on the Sabbath are not \"work\" in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel and using electricity.\nThree pilgrimage festivals.\nJewish holy days (\"chaggim\"), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called \"regalim\" (derived from the Hebrew word \"regel\", or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple:\nHigh Holy Days.\nThe High Holidays (\"Yamim Noraim\" or \"Days of Awe\") revolve around judgment and forgiveness:\nPurim.\nPurim (Hebrew: \"lots\") is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Persian Jews from the plot of the evil Haman, who sought to exterminate them, as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, charity to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called hamantashen, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.\nPurim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of Adar, which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar.\nHanukkah.\nHanukkah (, \"dedication\") also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of Kislev (Hebrew calendar). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.\nThe holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning \"dedication\") because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the \"Miracle of the Oil\". According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem following the victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucid Empire, there was only enough consecrated oil to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days\u2014which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.\nHanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.\nFast days.\nTisha B'Av ( or , \"the Ninth of Av\") is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples, and in later times, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain.\nThere are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples. They are the 17th Tamuz, the 10th of Tevet and Tzom Gedaliah (the 3rd of Tishrei).\nIsraeli holidays.\nThe modern holidays of Yom Ha-shoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day), Yom Hazikaron (Israeli Memorial Day) and Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate the horrors of the Holocaust, the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.\nThere are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the 10th of Tevet.\nTorah readings.\nThe core of festival and Shabbat prayer services is the public reading of the Torah, along with connected readings from the other books of the Tanakh, called Haftarah. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on Simchat Torah.\nSynagogues and religious buildings.\nSynagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study. They usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are:\nIn addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include yeshivas, or institutions of Jewish learning, and mikvahs, which are ritual baths.\nDietary laws: \"kashrut\".\nThe Jewish dietary laws are known as \"kashrut\". Food prepared in accordance with them is termed kosher, and food that is not kosher is also known as \"treifah\" or \"treif\". People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be \"keeping kosher\".\nMany of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be considered kosher, mammals must have split hooves and chew their cud. The pig is arguably the most well-known example of a non-kosher animal. Although it has split hooves, it does not chew its cud. For seafood to be kosher, the animal must have fins and scales. Certain types of seafood, such as shellfish, crustaceans, and eels, are therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher species is given in the Torah. The exact translations of many of the species have not survived, and some non-kosher birds' identities are no longer certain. However, traditions exist about the \"kashrut\" status of a few birds. For example, both chickens and turkeys are permitted in most communities. Other types of animals, such as amphibians, reptiles, and most insects, are prohibited altogether.\nIn addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as \"shechitah\". Without the proper slaughtering practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered \"treif\". The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the blood, some fats, and the area in and around the sciatic nerve.\n\"Halakha\" also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk, this rule is mostly derived from the Oral Torah, the Talmud and Rabbinic law. Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of \"kashrut\", but the prohibition is rabbinic, not biblical.\nThe use of dishes, serving utensils, and ovens may make food \"treif\" that would otherwise be kosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food \"treif\" under certain conditions.\nFurthermore, all Orthodox and some Conservative authorities forbid the consumption of processed grape products made by non-Jews, due to ancient pagan practices of using wine in rituals. Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.\nThe Torah does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of \"kashrut\". However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing cruelty to animals and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community. The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained. In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because \"they are unclean\". The Kabbalah describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.\nSurvival concerns supersede all the laws of \"kashrut\", as they do for most \"halakhot\".\nLaws of ritual purity.\nThe Tanakh describes circumstances in which a person who is \"tahor\" or ritually pure may become \"tamei\" or ritually impure. Some of these circumstances are contact with human corpses or graves, seminal flux, vaginal flux, menstruation, and contact with people who have become impure from any of these. In Rabbinic Judaism, Kohanim, members of the hereditary caste that served as priests in the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies. During the Temple period, such priests (Kohanim) were required to eat their bread offering (Terumah) in a state of ritual purity, which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as hand-washing which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.\nFamily purity.\nAn important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating women. These laws are also known as \"niddah\", literally \"separation\", or family purity. Vital aspects of \"halakha\" for traditionally observant Jews, they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.\nEspecially in Orthodox Judaism, the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the Torah mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped. The Rabbis conflated ordinary \"niddah\" with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as \"zavah\", and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband from the time she begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh\nTraditional Ethiopian Jews keep menstruating women in separate huts and, similar to Karaite practice, do not allow menstruating women into their temples because of a temple's special sanctity. Emigration to Israel and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices.\nLife-cycle events.\nLife-cycle events, or rites of passage, occur throughout a Jew's life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community:\nCommunity leadership.\nClassical priesthood.\nThe role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honoured in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future Third Temple and need to remain in readiness for future duty:\nPrayer leaders.\nFrom the time of the Mishnah and Talmud to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities\u2014reading the Torah and \"haftarah\" (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals\u2014require a \"minyan\", the presence of ten Jews.\nThe most common professional clergy in a synagogue are:\nJewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:\nMany congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:\nThe three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honour. Since the Enlightenment large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as \"shatz\" and \"baal kriyah\", and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.\nHistorical Jewish groupings (to 1700).\nAround the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the Pharisees, Sadducees, Zealots, Essenes, and Christians. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished. Christianity survived, but by breaking with Judaism and becoming a separate religion; the Pharisees survived but in the form of Rabbinic Judaism (today, known simply as \"Judaism\"). The Sadducees rejected the divine inspiration of the Prophets and the Writings, relying only on the Torah as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The Samaritans practiced a similar religion, which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)\nLike the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the oral law as recorded in the Mishnah (and developed by later rabbis in the two Talmuds), relying instead only upon the Tanakh. These included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the Malikites, and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the Karaite sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.\nOver a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas\u2014amongst others, the Ashkenazi Jews (of central and Eastern Europe), the Sephardi Jews (of Spain, Portugal, and North Africa), the Beta Israel of Ethiopia, the Yemenite Jews from the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, and the Malabari and Cochin Jews from Kerala. Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.\nPersecutions.\nAntisemitism arose during the Middle Ages, in the form of persecutions, pogroms, forced conversions, expulsions, social restrictions and ghettoization.\nThis was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism. During the Middle Ages, Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration, but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like Almohad's persecutions.\nHasidism.\nHasidic Judaism was founded by Yisroel ben Eliezer (1700\u20131760), also known as the \"Ba'al Shem Tov\" (or \"Besht\"). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too \"academic\", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favoured small and informal gatherings called Shtiebel, which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing. Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to Tzadiks, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a \"refreshment\" of original Judaism. As some have put it: \"they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost\". Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as Misnagdim, (lit.\u2009'opponents'). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism.\nThe Enlightenment and new religious movements.\nIn the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, Haskalah or the \"Jewish Enlightenment\", began, especially in Central Europe and Western Europe, in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason. With the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe \"halakha\" and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend.\nIn Central Europe, followed by Great Britain and the United States, Reform (or Liberal) Judaism developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating Protestant decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. Modern Orthodox Judaism developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of \"halakha\". Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that \"halakha\" should not be entirely abandoned, to form the Conservative movement. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed Haredi Orthodox Judaism. After massive movements of Jews following The Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel, these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.\nSpectrum of observance.\nJewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the National Jewish Population Survey, in the United States' Jewish community\u2014the world's second largest\u20144.3\u00a0million Jews out of 5.1\u00a0million had some sort of connection to the religion. Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation, and fewer than 16% attend regularly.\nJudaism and ecology.\nEcological concerns are deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition. The natural world plays a central role in Jewish law, literature, liturgy, and other practices. In Jewish law (halakhah), ecological concerns are reflected in several instances. These include, the Biblical protection for fruit trees, rules in the Mishnah against harming the public domain, Talmudic debate over noise and smoke damages, and contemporary responsa on agricultural pollution. The rule of \"tza'ar ba'alei hayyim\" is a restriction on cruelty to animals.\nAlthough the Bible and rabbinic tradition have put Judaism on an anthropocentric path, creation-centered or eco-centric interpretations of Judaism can also be found throughout Jewish history. Many theologians regard the land as a primary partner of Jewish covenant, and Judaism, especially the practices described in the Torah, may be regarded as the expression of a fully indigenous, earth-centered tradition.\nSince the 1970s, hundreds of articles and books have been written on the topic of Judaism and environmentalism, and the moral obligation to care for God\u2019s Earth and its creatures. The article \"Judaism and the Ecological Crisis\" and Dr. Eilon Schwartz\u2019s \"Bal Tashchit: A Jewish Environmental Precept\" note about the Jewish concept of Bal Tashchit, which prohibits unnecessary waste and encourages the sustainable use of resources. Dr. Hava Tirosh-Samuelson, in a 2001 essay titled \"Nature in the Sources of Judaism\", notes how a Jewish perspective on nature is rooted in the belief that the universe is the creation of God.\nScores of books have been published on Jewish teachings and environmental stewardship. Among them are \"Eco Bible: Volume 1: An Ecological Commentary on Genesis and Exodus\", and \"Eco Bible: Volume 2: An Ecological Commentary on Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy\".\nJudaism and other religions.\nChristianity and Judaism.\nChristianity was originally a sect of Second Temple Judaism, but the two religions diverged in the first century. The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah, but eventually became irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah, of atonement and sin, the status of God's commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the nature of God himself. Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as \"shituf\" (), or worship of the God of Israel in an incompletely monotheistic manner (e.g., deifying Jesus in addition to the one God). Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in dual-covenant theology emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how the religion's theology influenced the Holocaust and Nazism.\nSince the time of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church upheld the \"Constitutio pro Jud\u00e6is\" (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUntil Jewish emancipation in the late 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the Jewish hat and the yellow badge, restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns (ghettos), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (e.g., selling new clothes in medieval Sweden). Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews\u2014for example, the English Edict of Expulsion in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 (who were readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664, Jewish rights remained unchanged; by 1671, Asser Levy was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America. In 1791, Revolutionary France was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by Prussia in 1848. Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, with Jews given the right to sit in parliament with the passing of the Jews Relief Act 1858. The newly created German Empire in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were reinstated in the Nuremberg Laws in 1935.\nJewish life in Christian lands was marred by blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions, and massacres. Religious prejudice fueled hostility against Jews in Europe. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the early years of Christianity and was reinforced by ever-increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence and murder, culminating in the Holocaust. These attitudes were reinforced by Christian preaching, in art and popular teaching for two millennia which expressed contempt for Jews, as well as statutes which were designed to humiliate and stigmatise Jews, such as those of the \"Judensau\" motif. The Nazi Party was known for its persecution of Christian churches; many of them, such as the Protestant Confessing Church and the Catholic Church, as well as Quakers and Jehovah's Witnesses, aided and rescued Jews who were being targeted by the antireligious r\u00e9gime.\nThe attitude of Christians and Christian churches toward the Jewish people and Judaism has changed in a mostly positive direction since World War II. Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church have \"upheld the Church's acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people\" as well as a reaffirmation of the covenant between God and the Jews. In December 2015, the Vatican released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.\nIn continental Europe, Judaism is heavily associated with and most often thought of as Orthodox Judaism.\nIslam and Judaism.\nBoth Judaism and Islam trace their origins to the patriarch Abraham, and they are therefore considered Abrahamic religions. In both Jewish and Muslim tradition, the Jewish and Arab peoples are descended from the two sons of Abraham\u2014Isaac and Ishmael, respectively. While both religions are monotheistic and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider Jesus or Muhammad to be prophets, among many other reasons. The adherents of the religions have interacted with each other since the 7th century, when Islam originated and spread in the Arabian Peninsula. The period under the Ummayad and the Abbasid caliphates between 712 and 1066 has been called the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries, including Jews, were known as \"dhimmis\". Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims. For example, they had to pay the jizya, a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males, and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims. Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic. For example, dhimmis in some countries were required to wear distinctive clothing, a practice not found in either the Quran or the hadiths but invented in early medieval Baghdad and inconsistently enforced. Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution\u2014for example, many were killed, exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century, in Persia, and by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in North Africa and Al-Andalus, as well as by the Zaydi imams of Yemen in the 17th century (see Mawza Exile). At times, Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence\u2014in Morocco, for example, Jews were confined to walled quarters (mellahs) beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century.\nIn the mid-20th century, Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab countries. Most have chosen to live in Israel. Today, antisemitic themes including Holocaust denial have become commonplace in the propaganda of Islamic movements such as Hizbullah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Refah Partisi.\nSyncretic movements incorporating Judaism.\nSome movements in other religions include elements of Judaism. Among Christianity, there are a number of denominations of ancient and contemporary Judaizers. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s, In this, elements of the messianic traditions in Judaism, are incorporated in, and melded with the tenets of Christianity. The movement generally states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, that he is one of the Three Divine Persons, and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Some members of Messianic Judaism argue that it is a sect of Judaism. Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity, and because the conditions for the Messiah to have come accordingly within traditional Jewish thought have not yet been met. Another religious movement is the Black Hebrew Israelite group, which not to be confused with less syncretic Black Judaism (a constellation of movements which, depending on their adherence to normative Jewish tradition, receive varying degrees of recognition by the broader Jewish community).\nOther examples of syncretism include Semitic neopaganism, loosely organized sects which incorporate pagan, Goddess movement or Wiccan beliefs with some Jewish religious practices; Jewish Buddhists, another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Buddhism and other Asian spirituality in their faith.\nSome Renewal Jews borrow freely and openly from Buddhism, Sufism, Native American religions, and other faiths.\nThe Kabbalah Centre, which employs teachers from multiple religions, is a one of \"New Age Judaism\" movements that claims to popularize the kabbalah, part of the Jewish esoteric tradition.\nCriticism.\nCriticism of Judaism may include those that require revisionism to classical Orthodox Judaism, such as that of the modernized denomination of Reconstructionist Judaism as established by American rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, who believed that classical Orthodox Judaism is outdated as a religious belief on its own, and should represent the Jewish culture as a progressive civilization.\nOn the other hand, proponents of classical Orthodox Judaism such as Neturei Karta and similar groups strongly oppose the growing accommodation to political Zionism by Haredi Jewish groups such as Agudat Yisrael; a previously anti-Zionist proponent of Orthodox Haredi Judaism whom the Neturei Karta see as betrayal by the Agudat Yisrael against the Orthodoxy, in the belief that Judaism should never be conflated with the politics of Zionism.\nOrthodox Jewish public intellectual and polymath Yeshayahu Leibowitz believed in the separation of church and state, and regarded Reform Judaism as a \"historical distortion of the Jewish religion\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nSelected cited works.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nEncyclopedias\nGeneral works\nRegional contemporary\nExternal links.\nGeneral\nOrthodox/Haredi\nTraditional/Conservadox\nConservative\nReform/Progressive\nReconstructionist\nRenewal\nHumanistic\nKaraite\nJewish religious literature and texts\nSee also Torah database for links to more Judaism e-texts.\nWikimedia Torah study projects\nText study projects at .

{"id": "15626", "revid": "47826859", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15626", "title": "John Stuart Mill", "text": "English philosopher and author (1806\u20131873)\nJohn Stuart Mill (20 May 1806 \u2013 7 May 1873) was an English philosopher, political economist, politician and civil servant. One of the most influential thinkers in the history of liberalism and social liberalism, he contributed widely to social theory, political theory, and political economy. Dubbed \"the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century\" by the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", he conceived of liberty as justifying the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control. He advocated political and social reforms such as proportional representation, the emancipation of women, and the development of labour organisations and farm cooperatives.\nThe \"Columbia Encyclopedia\" describes Mill as occasionally coming \"close to socialism, a theory repugnant to his predecessors\". He was a proponent of utilitarianism, an ethical theory developed by his predecessor Jeremy Bentham. He contributed to the investigation of scientific methodology, though his knowledge of the topic was based on the writings of others, notably William Whewell, John Herschel, and Auguste Comte, and research carried out for Mill by Alexander Bain. He engaged in written debate with Whewell. \nA member of the Liberal Party and author of the early feminist work \"The Subjection of Women\", Mill was also the second Member of Parliament to call for women's suffrage after Henry Hunt in 1832. The ideas presented in his 1859 essay \"On Liberty\" have remained the basis of much political thought, and a copy is passed to the president of the Liberal Democrats (the successor party to Mill's own) as a symbol of office.\nBiography.\nJohn Stuart Mill was born at 13 Rodney Street in Pentonville, then on the edge of the capital and now in central London, the eldest son of Harriet Barrow and the Scottish philosopher, historian, and economist James Mill. John Stuart was educated by his father, with the advice and assistance of Jeremy Bentham for whom he had worked as a ghostwriter and Francis Place. He was given an extremely rigorous upbringing, and was deliberately shielded from association with children his own age other than his siblings. His father, a follower of Bentham and an adherent of associationism, had as his explicit aim to create a genius intellect that would carry on the cause of utilitarianism and its implementation after he and Bentham had died.\nMill was a notably precocious child. He describes his education in his autobiography. At the age of three he was taught Greek. By the age of eight, he had read \"Aesop's Fables\", Xenophon's \"Anabasis\", and the whole of Herodotus, and was acquainted with Lucian, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Isocrates and six dialogues of Plato. He had also read a great deal of history in English and had been taught arithmetic, physics and astronomy.\nAt the age of eight, Mill began studying Latin, the works of Euclid, and algebra, and was appointed schoolmaster to the younger children of the family. His main reading was still history, but he went through all the commonly taught Latin and Greek authors and by the age of ten could read Plato and Demosthenes with ease. His father also thought that it was important for Mill to study and compose poetry. One of his earliest poetic compositions was a continuation of the \"Iliad\". In his spare time he also enjoyed reading about natural sciences and popular novels, such as \"Don Quixote\" and \"Robinson Crusoe\".\nHis father's work, \"The History of British India\", was published in 1818; immediately thereafter, at about the age of twelve, Mill began a thorough study of the scholastic logic, at the same time reading Aristotle's logical treatises in the original language. In the following year he was introduced to political economy and studied Adam Smith and David Ricardo with his father, ultimately completing their classical economic view of factors of production. Mill's \"comptes rendus\" of his daily economy lessons helped his father in writing \"Elements of Political Economy\" in 1821, a textbook to promote the ideas of Ricardian economics; however, the book lacked popular support. Ricardo, who was a close friend of his father, used to invite the young Mill to his house for a walk to talk about political economy.\nAt the age of fourteen, Mill stayed a year in France with the family of Sir Samuel Bentham, brother of Jeremy Bentham and in the company of George Ensor, then pursuing his polemic against the political economy of Thomas Malthus. The mountain scenery he saw led to a lifelong taste for mountain landscapes. The lively and friendly way of life of the French also left a deep impression on him. In Montpellier, he attended the winter courses on chemistry, zoology, logic of the \"Facult\u00e9 des Sciences\", as well as taking a course in higher mathematics. While coming and going from France, he stayed in Paris for a few days in the house of the renowned economist Jean-Baptiste Say, a friend of Mill's father. There he met many leaders of the Liberal party, as well as other notable Parisians, including Henri Saint-Simon.\nMill went through months of sadness and contemplated suicide at twenty years of age. According to the opening paragraphs of Chapter V of his autobiography, he had asked himself whether the creation of a just society, his life's objective, would actually make him happy. His heart answered \"no\", and unsurprisingly he lost the happiness of striving towards this objective. Eventually, the poetry of William Wordsworth showed him that beauty generates compassion for others and stimulates joy. With renewed vigour, he continued to work towards a just society, but with more relish for the journey. He considered this one of the most pivotal shifts in his thinking. In fact, many of the differences between him and his father stemmed from this expanded source of joy.\nMill met Thomas Carlyle during one of the latter's visits to London in the early 1830s, and the two quickly became companions and correspondents. Mill offered to print Carlyle's works at his own expense and encouraged Carlyle to write his , supplying him with materials in order to do so. In March 1835, while the manuscript of the completed first volume was in Mill's possession, Mill's housemaid unwittingly used it as tinder, destroying all \"except some three or four bits of leaves\". Mortified, Mill offered Carlyle \u00a3200 (\u00a317,742.16 in 2021) as compensation (Carlyle would only accept \u00a3100). Ideological differences would put an end to the friendship during the 1840s, though Carlyle's early influence on Mill would colour his later thought.\nMill had been engaged in a pen-friendship with Auguste Comte, the founder of positivism and sociology, since Mill first contacted Comte in November 1841. Comte's \"sociologie\" was more an early philosophy of science than modern sociology is. Comte's positivism motivated Mill to eventually reject Bentham's psychological egoism and what he regarded as Bentham's cold, abstract view of human nature focused on legislation and politics, instead coming to favour Comte's more sociable view of human nature focused on historical facts and directed more towards human individuals in all their complexities.\nAs a nonconformist who refused to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England, Mill was not eligible to study at the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge. Instead he followed his father to work for the East India Company, and attended University College, London, to hear the lectures of John Austin, the first Professor of Jurisprudence. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1856.\nMill's career as a colonial administrator at the East India Company spanned from when he was 17 years old in 1823 until 1858, when the company's territories in India were directly annexed by the Crown, establishing direct Crown control over India. In 1836, he was promoted to the company's political department, where he was responsible for correspondence pertaining to the company's relations with the princely states, and, in 1856, was finally promoted to the position of Examiner of Indian Correspondence. In \"On Liberty\", \"A Few Words on Non-Intervention\", and other works, he opined that \"To characterize any conduct whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the law of nations, only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the subject.\" (However, Mill immediately added that \"A violation of the great principles of morality it may easily be.\") Mill viewed places such as India as having once been progressive in their outlook, but had now become stagnant in their development; he opined that this meant these regions had to be ruled via a form of \"benevolent despotism...provided the end is improvement.\" When the Crown proposed to take direct control over the territories of the East India Company, Mill was tasked with defending Company rule and penned \"Memorandum on the Improvements in the Administration of India during the Last Thirty Years\", among other petitions. He was offered a seat on the Council of India, the body created to advise the new Secretary of State for India, but declined, citing disapproval of the new system of administration in India.\nOn 21 April 1851, Mill married Harriet Taylor after 21 years of intimate friendship. Taylor was married when they met, and their relationship was close but generally believed to be chaste during the years before her first husband died in 1849. The couple waited two years before marrying in 1851. Upon marriage, he made a declaration to repudiate the rights conferred upon him over her by virtue of the marriage under Victorian law. John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor Mill were foundational figures in feminist economic thought. Their collaborative works, particularly The Subjection of Women (1869) and Taylor Mill's The Enfranchisement of Women (1851), argued that gender inequality was both a moral injustice and an economic inefficiency (Hansson, 2022; McCabe, 2021). Rejecting classical economic assumptions that marginalized women, they advocated for legal reforms, educational access, and women's autonomy. Their ideas laid groundwork for modern feminist economists who critique unpaid labor, gender wage gaps, and structural oppression (Munte &amp; Monica, 2023; Kn\u00fcfer, 2023). Taylor Mill's Unitarian and rationalist views enriched this critique, while stylometric evidence supports her significant role in Mill's writings (Schmidt-Petri et al., 2021). Today, their arguments resonate in debates on digital capitalism, care work, and reproductive rights, offering a lens to assess economic justice through the interplay of gender, labor, and autonomy (Hampton, 2021; Smajdor, 2021).\n Accomplished in her own right, Taylor was a significant influence on Mill's work and ideas during both friendship and marriage. His relationship with Taylor reinforced Mill's advocacy of women's rights. He said that in his stand against domestic violence, and for women's rights he was \"chiefly an amanuensis to my wife\". He called her mind a \"perfect instrument\", and said she was \"the most eminently qualified of all those known to the author\". He cites her influence in his final revision of \"On Liberty\", which was published shortly after her death. Taylor died in 1858 after developing severe lung congestion, after only seven years of marriage to Mill.\nBetween the years 1865 and 1868 Mill served as Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews. At his inaugural address, delivered to the university on 1 February 1867, he made the now-famous (but often wrongly attributed) remark that \"Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.\" That Mill included that sentence in the address is a matter of historical record, but it by no means follows that it expressed a wholly original insight. During the same period, 1865\u201368, he was also a Member of Parliament (MP) for City of Westminster. He was sitting for the Liberal Party. During his time as an MP, Mill advocated easing the burdens on Ireland. In 1866, he became the first person in the history of Parliament to call for women to be given the right to vote, vigorously defending this position in subsequent debate. He also became a strong advocate of such social reforms as labour unions and farm cooperatives. In \"Considerations on Representative Government\", he called for various reforms of Parliament and voting, especially proportional representation, the single transferable vote, and the extension of suffrage. In April 1868, he favoured in a Commons debate the retention of capital punishment for such crimes as aggravated murder; he termed its abolition \"an effeminacy in the general mind of the country\". (It is said in 1868, when his first term ended, no party would nominate him due to his independent spirit.)\nHe was elected to membership of the American Philosophical Society in 1867.\nHe was godfather to the philosopher Bertrand Russell.\nIn his views on religion, Mill was an agnostic and a sceptic.\nLike other philosophers of his time, Mill was interested in botany. It is believed that approximately 1,000 of his specimens are held by the Museum Requien in Avignon, France, and Mill's stepdaughter, Helen Taylor, donated specimens to the Kew Herbarium after his death. In the southern hemisphere, there are also specimens at the National Herbarium of Victoria, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, Australia.\nMill died on 7 May 1873, at the age of 66, of erysipelas in Avignon, where his body was buried alongside his wife's. He bequeathed his estate to his step-daughter, Helen Taylor, and designated her his literary executor.\nWorks and theories.\nAchieving happiness.\nMill believed that for the majority of people (those with but a moderate degree of sensibility and of capacity for enjoyment) happiness is best achieved en passant, rather than striving for it directly. This meant no self-consciousness, scrutiny, self-interrogation, dwelling on, thinking about, imagining or questioning on one's happiness. Then, if otherwise fortunately circumstanced, one would \"inhale happiness with the air you breathe.\"\n\"A System of Logic\".\nMill joined the debate over the scientific method which followed on from John Herschel's 1830 publication of \"A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy\", which incorporated inductive reasoning from the known to the unknown, discovering general laws in specific facts and verifying these laws empirically. William Whewell expanded on this in his 1837 \"History of the Inductive Sciences, from the Earliest to the Present Time\", followed in 1840 by \"The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon their History\", presenting induction as the mind superimposing concepts on facts. Laws were self-evident truths, which could be known without need for empirical verification.\nMill countered this in 1843 in \"A System of Logic\" (fully titled \"A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive, Being a Connected View of the Principles of Evidence, and the Methods of Scientific Investigation\"). In \"Mill's Methods\" (of induction), as in Herschel's, laws were discovered through observation and induction, and required empirical verification. Matilal remarks that Dign\u0101ga analysis is much like John Stuart Mill's Joint Method of Agreement and Difference, which is inductive. He suggested that it was very likely that during his stay in India he came across the tradition of logic, in which scholars started taking interest after 1824, though it is unknown whether it influenced his work.\nColonialism.\nLike his father James, Mill was a supporter of British colonialism. He was a member of Edward Gibbon Wakefield's Colonization Society, and in his own work, \"Principles of Political Economy\" (1848), he praised Wakefield for his \"important writings on colonization\". Later on in his essay \"On Liberty\" (1859) he stated that the principles of liberty espoused therein did not apply to \"those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage\". Mill praised the colonies of ancient Greece for \"flourishing so rapidly and so wonderfully\", seeing them as a model to be emulated.\nMill, an employee of the East India Company from 1823 to 1858, argued in support of what he called a \"benevolent despotism\" with regard to the administration of overseas colonies. Mill argued:To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and barbarians, is a grave error. ... To characterize any conduct whatever towards a barbarous people as a violation of the law of nations, only shows that he who so speaks has never considered the subject.\nFor Mill, India was \"a burden\" for England and British colonialism \"a blessing of unspeakable magnitude to the population\" of India. He also stated his support for settler colonialism. Mill expressed general support for Company rule in India, but expressed reservations on specific Company policies in India which he disagreed with.\nHe also supported colonialism in other places, such as Australia. Mill was among the founding members of the South Australian Association in 1833, which was set up to lobby the government to establish colonies in Australia.\nMill saw federal systems of politics as a solution to contemporary political crises and as an ideal for the future organization of humanity.\nEconomic philosophy.\nMill's early economic philosophy was one of free markets. However, he accepted interventions in the economy, such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare. He originally believed that \"equality of taxation\" meant \"equality of sacrifice\" and that progressive taxation penalized those who worked harder and saved more and was therefore \"a mild form of robbery\".\nGiven an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that inheritance should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes\u2014some charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others.\nLater he altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his \"Principles of Political Economy\" in defence of a socialist outlook, and defending some socialist causes. Within this revised work he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained, albeit altered in the third edition of the \"Principles of Political Economy\" to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on \"unearned\" incomes, which he favoured, and those on \"earned\" incomes, which he did not favour.\nIn his autobiography, Mill stated that in relation to his later views on political economy, his \"ideal of ultimate improvement... would class [him] decidedly under the general designation of Socialists.\" His views shifted partly due to reading the works of utopian socialists, but also from the influence of Harriet Taylor. In his 1879 work \"Socialism\", Mill argued that the prevalence of poverty in contemporary industrial capitalist societies was \"\"pro tanto\" a failure of the social arrangements\", and that attempts to condone this state of affairs as being the result of individual failings did not represent a justification of them but instead were \"an irresistible claim upon every human being for protection against suffering\".\nMill's \"Principles\", first published in 1848, was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period. As Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\" had during an earlier period, \"Principles\" came to dominate economics teaching. In the case of Oxford University it was the standard text until 1919, when it was replaced by Marshall's \"Principles of Economics\".\nCriticism.\nKarl Marx, in his critique of political economy, mentioned Mill in the \"Grundrisse\". Marx contended that Mill's thinking posited the categories of capital in an ahistorical fashion.\nEconomic democracy and market socialism.\nMill's main objection to socialism focused on what he saw as its destruction of competition. He wrote, \"[W]hile I agree and sympathize with socialists in this practical portion of their aims, I utterly dissent from the most conspicuous and vehement part of their teaching\u2014their declamations against competition.\" Though he was an egalitarian, Mill argued more for equal opportunity and placed meritocracy above all other ideals in this regard. He further argued that a socialist society would only be attainable through the provision of basic education for all, promoting economic democracy instead of capitalism, in the manner of substituting capitalist businesses with worker cooperatives. He wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.\nIn his later thought, he advocated for a cooperative economic order, an economy based on enterprises run by workers themselves in an open market, rather than the employment-wage relationship of capitalist companies, and Mill's ideas led him to be classified as an early proponent of market socialism theory.\nPolitical democracy.\nMill's major work on political democracy, \"Considerations on Representative Government\", defends two fundamental principles: extensive participation by citizens and enlightened competence of rulers. The two values are obviously in tension, and some readers have concluded that he is an elitist democrat, while others count him as an earlier participatory democrat. In one section, he appears to defend a type of plural voting where more competent citizens are given extra votes (a view he later repudiated). However, in another chapter he argues cogently for the value of participation by all citizens. He believed that the incompetence of the masses could eventually be overcome if they were given a chance to take part in politics, especially at the local level.\nMill is one of the few political philosophers ever to serve in government as an elected official. In his three years in Parliament, he was more willing to compromise than the \"radical\" principles expressed in his writing would lead one to expect.\nMill was a major proponent of the diffusion and use of public education to the working class. He saw the value of the individual person, and believed that \"man had the inherent capability of guiding his own destiny-but only if his faculties were developed and fulfilled\", which could be achieved through education. He regarded education as a pathway to improve human nature which to him meant \"to encourage, among other characteristics, diversity and originality, the energy of character, initiative, autonomy, intellectual cultivation, aesthetic sensibility, non-self-regarding interests, prudence, responsibility, and self-control.\" Education allowed for humans to develop into full informed citizens that had the tools to improve their condition and make fully informed electoral decisions. The power of education lay in its ability to serve as a great equalizer among the classes allowing the working class the ability to control their own destiny and compete with the upper classes. Mill recognised the paramount importance of public education in avoiding the tyranny of the majority by ensuring that all the voters and political participants were fully developed individuals. It was through education, he believed, that an individual could become a full participant within representative democracy.\nIn regards to higher education, Mill defended liberal education against contemporary arguments for models of higher education focused on religion or science. His 1867 St. Andrews Address called on elites educated in reformed universities to work towards education policy committed to liberal principles.\nTheories of wealth and income distribution.\nIn \"Principles of Political Economy\", Mill offered an analysis of two economic phenomena often linked together: the laws of production and wealth and the modes of their distribution. Regarding the former, he believed that it was not possible to alter the laws of production, \"the ultimate properties of matter and mind... only to employ these properties to bring about events we are interested in.\" The modes of distribution of wealth is a matter of human institutions solely, starting with what Mill believed to be the primary and fundamental institution: Individual Property. He believed that all individuals must start on equal terms, with division of the instruments of production fairly among all members of society. Once each member has an equal amount of individual property, they must be left to their own exertion not to be interfered with by the state. Regarding inequality of wealth, Mill believed that it was the role of the government to establish both social and economic policies that promote the equality of opportunity.\nThe government, according to Mill, should implement three tax policies to help alleviate poverty:\nInheritance of capital and wealth plays a large role in the development of inequality, because it provides greater opportunity for those receiving the inheritance. Mill's solution to inequality of wealth brought about by inheritance was to implement a greater tax on inheritances, because he believed the most important authoritative function of the government is taxation, and taxation judiciously implemented could promote equality.\nThe environment.\nIn Book IV, chapter VI of \"Principles of Political Economy\": \"Of the Stationary State\", Mill recognised wealth beyond the material and argued that the logical conclusion of unlimited growth was destruction of the environment and a reduced quality of life. He concluded that a stationary state could be preferable to unending economic growth:\nI cannot, therefore, regard the stationary states of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested towards it by political economists of the old school.\nIf the earth must lose that great portion of its pleasantness which it owes to things that the unlimited increase of wealth and population would extirpate from it, for the mere purpose of enabling it to support a larger, but not a better or a happier population, I sincerely hope, for the sake of posterity, that they will be content to be stationary, long before necessity compel them to it.\nRate of profit.\nAccording to Mill, the ultimate tendency in an economy is for the rate of profit to decline due to diminishing returns in agriculture and increase in population at a Malthusian rate.\nSlavery and racial equality.\nIn 1850, Mill sent an anonymous letter in rebuttal to Thomas Carlyle's letter to \"Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country\" (which came to be known under the title \"The Negro Question\"), in which Carlyle argued for slavery. Mill supported abolishing slavery in the United States, expressing his opposition to slavery in his essay of 1869, \"The Subjection of Women\":\nThis absolutely extreme case of the law of force, condemned by those who can tolerate almost every other form of arbitrary power, and which, of all others, presents features the most revolting to the feeling of all who look at it from an impartial position, was the law of civilized and Christian England within the memory of persons now living: and in one half of Anglo-Saxon America three or four years ago, not only did slavery exist, but the slave trade, and the breeding of slaves expressly for it, was a general practice between slave states. Yet not only was there a greater strength of sentiment against it, but, in England at least, a less amount either of feeling or of interest in favour of it, than of any other of the customary abuses of force: for its motive was the love of gain, unmixed and undisguised: and those who profited by it were a very small numerical fraction of the country, while the natural feeling of all who were not personally interested in it, was unmitigated abhorrence.\nMill corresponded with John Appleton, an American legal reformer from Maine, extensively on the topic of racial equality. Appleton influenced Mill's work on such, especially swaying him on the optimal economic and social welfare plan for the Antebellum South. In a letter sent to Appleton in response to a previous letter, Mill expressed his view on antebellum integration:I cannot look forward with satisfaction to any settlement but complete emancipation\u2014land given to every negro family either separately or in organized communities under such rules as may be found temporarily necessary\u2014the schoolmaster set to work in every village &amp; the tide of free immigration turned on in those fertile regions from which slavery has hitherto excluded it. If this be done, the gentle &amp; docile character which seems to distinguish the negroes will prevent any mischief on their side, while the proofs they are giving of fighting powers will do more in a year than all other things in a century to make the whites respect them &amp; consent to their being politically &amp; socially equals.Unlike many of his peers, Mill supported the Union in the American Civil War, seeing it as a necessary evil that would deliver a vital \"salutary shock\" to the national conscience and help preserve liberal ideals while eradicating the \"stain\" of slavery in the United States. Mill expressed his views in an article for \"Fraser's Magazine\", arguing against the defenders of the Confederate States of America.There are people who tell us that, on the side of the North, the question is not one of slavery at all. The North, it seems, have no more objection to slavery than the South have. [...] If this be the true state of the case, what are the Southern chiefs fighting about? Their apologists in England say that it is about tariffs, and similar trumpery. They say nothing of the kind. They tell the world, and they told their own citizens when they wanted their votes, that the object of the fight was slavery. [...] The world knows what the question between the North and South has been for many years, and still is. Slavery alone was thought of, alone talked of.\nTheory of liberty.\nMill's \"On Liberty\" (1859) addresses the nature and limits of the power that can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. Mill's idea is that only if a democratic society follows the Principle of Liberty can its political and social institutions fulfill their role of shaping national character so that its citizens can realise the permanent interests of people as progressive beings. (Rawls, Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy, p. 289)\nMill states the Principle of Liberty as: \"the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection.\" \"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.\"\nOne way to read Mill's Principle of Liberty as a principle of public reason is to see it excluding certain kinds of reasons from being taken into account in legislation, or in guiding the moral coercion of public opinion. (Rawls, Lectures on the History of Political Philosophy, p. 291) These reasons include those founded in other persons good; reasons of excellence and ideals of human perfection; reasons of dislike or disgust, or of preference.\nMill states that \"harms\" which may be prevented include acts of omission as well as acts of commission. Thus, failing to rescue a drowning child counts as a harmful act, as does failing to pay taxes, or failing to appear as a witness in court. All such harmful omissions may be regulated, according to Mill. By contrast, it does not count as harming someone if\u2014without force or fraud\u2014the affected individual consents to assume the risk: thus one may permissibly offer unsafe employment to others, provided there is no deception involved. He does, however, recognise one limit to consent: society should not permit people to sell themselves into slavery.\nThe question of what counts as a self-regarding action and what actions, whether of omission or commission, constitute harmful actions subject to regulation, continues to exercise interpreters of Mill. He did not consider giving offence to constitute \"harm\"; an action could not be restricted because it violated the conventions or morals of a given society.\nSocial liberty and tyranny of majority.\nMill believed that \"the struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history.\" For him, liberty in antiquity was a \"contest...between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government.\"\nMill defined \"social liberty\" as protection from \"the tyranny of political rulers\". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny, and \"tyranny of the majority\". \"Social liberty\" for Mill meant putting limits on the ruler's power so that he would not be able to use that power to further his own wishes and thus make decisions that could harm society. In other words, people should have the right to have a say in the government's decisions. He said that \"social liberty\" was \"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.\" It was attempted in two ways: first, by obtaining recognition of certain immunities (called \"political liberties\" or \"rights\"); and second, by establishment of a system of \"constitutional checks\".\nHowever, in Mill's view, limiting the power of government was not enough:Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself.\nLiberty.\nMill's view on liberty, which was influenced by Joseph Priestley and Josiah Warren, is that individuals ought to be free to do as they wished unless they caused harm to others. Individuals are rational enough to make decisions about their well-being. Government should interfere when it is for the protection of society. Mill explained:\nThe sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. ... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns him, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\nFreedom of speech.\n\"On Liberty\" involves an impassioned defence of free speech. Mill argues that free discourse is a necessary condition for intellectual and social progress. We can never be sure, he contends, that a silenced opinion does not contain some element of the truth. He also argues that allowing people to air false opinions is productive for two reasons. First, individuals are more likely to abandon erroneous beliefs if they are engaged in an open exchange of ideas. Second, by forcing other individuals to re-examine and re-affirm their beliefs in the process of debate, these beliefs are kept from declining into mere dogma. It is not enough for Mill that one simply has an unexamined belief that happens to be true; one must understand why the belief in question is the true one. Along those same lines Mill wrote, \"unmeasured vituperation, employed on the side of prevailing opinion, really does deter people from expressing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who express them.\"\nAs an influential advocate of freedom of speech, Mill objected to censorship:\nI choose, by preference the cases which are least favourable to me\u2014in which the argument opposing freedom of opinion, both on truth and that of utility, is considered the strongest. Let the opinions impugned be the belief in God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality. ... But I must be permitted to observe, that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question \"for others\", without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However positive any one's persuasion may be, not only of the falsity, but of the pernicious consequences\u2013not only of the pernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogether condemn) the immorality and impiety of an opinion; yet if, in pursuance of that private judgment, though backed by the public judgment of his country or his contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heard in its defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumption being less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is called immoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is most fatal.\nMill outlines the benefits of \"searching for and discovering the truth\" as a way to further knowledge. He argued that even if an opinion is false, the truth can be better understood by refuting the error. And as most opinions are neither completely true nor completely false, he points out that allowing free expression allows the airing of competing views as a way to preserve partial truth in various opinions. Worried about minority views being suppressed, he argued in support of freedom of speech on political grounds, stating that it is a critical component for a representative government to have to empower debate over public policy. He also eloquently argued that freedom of expression allows for personal growth and self-realization. He said that freedom of speech was a vital way to develop talents and realise a person's potential and creativity. He repeatedly said that eccentricity was preferable to uniformity and stagnation.\nHarm principle.\nThe belief that freedom of speech would advance society presupposed a society sufficiently culturally and institutionally advanced to be capable of progressive improvement. If any argument is really wrong or harmful, the public will judge it as wrong or harmful, and then those arguments cannot be sustained and will be excluded. Mill argued that even any arguments which are used in justifying murder or rebellion against the government should not be politically suppressed or socially persecuted. According to him, if rebellion is really necessary, people should rebel; if murder is truly proper, it should be allowed. However, the way to express those arguments should be a public speech or writing, not in a way that causes actual harm to others. Such is the \"harm principle\": \"That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\"\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Associate justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. made the standard of \"clear and present danger\" based on Mill's idea. In the majority opinion, Holmes writes:\n The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent.\nHolmes suggested that falsely shouting out \"Fire!\" in a dark theatre, which evokes panic and provokes injury, would be such a case of speech that creates an illegal danger. But if the situation allows people to reason by themselves and decide to accept it or not, any argument or theology should not be blocked.\nHere is Mill on the same topic: \"No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions. On the contrary, even opinions lose their immunity, when the circumstances in which they are expressed are such as to constitute their expression a positive instigation to some mischievous act. An opinion that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor, or that private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated through the press, but may justly incur punishment when delivered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same mob in the form of a placard\" (\"On LIberty\", chapter 3).\nMill's argument is now generally accepted by many democratic countries, and they have laws at least guided by the harm principle. For example, in American law some exceptions limit free speech such as obscenity, defamation, breach of peace, and \"fighting words\".\nFreedom of the press.\nIn \"On Liberty\", Mill thought it was necessary for him to restate the case for press freedom. He considered that argument already won. Almost no politician or commentator in mid-19th-century Britain wanted a return to Tudor and Stuart-type press censorship. However, Mill warned new forms of censorship could emerge in the future. Indeed, in 2013 the Cameron Tory government considered setting up an independent official regulator of the UK press. This prompted demands for better basic legal protection of press freedom. A new British Bill of Rights could include a US-type constitutional ban on governmental infringement of press freedom and block other official attempts to control freedom of opinion and expression.\n\"Utilitarianism\".\nThe canonical statement of Mill's utilitarianism can be found in his book, \"Utilitarianism\". Although this philosophy has a long tradition, Mill's account is primarily influenced by Jeremy Bentham and Mill's father James Mill.\nJohn Stuart Mill believed in the philosophy of \"utilitarianism\", which he would describe as the principle that holds \"that actions are right in the proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.\" By \"happiness\" he means, \"intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure\". It is clear that we do not all value virtues as a path to happiness and that we sometimes only value them for selfish reasons. However, Mill asserts that upon reflection, even when we value virtues for selfish reasons we are in fact cherishing them as a part of our happiness.\nBentham's famous formulation of utilitarianism is known as the \"greatest-happiness principle\". It holds that one must always act so as to produce the greatest aggregate happiness among all sentient beings, within reason. In a similar vein, Mill's method of determining the best utility is that a moral agent, when given the choice between two or more actions, ought to choose the action that contributes most to (maximizes) the total happiness in the world. \"Happiness\", in this context, is understood as the production of pleasure or privation of pain. Given that determining the action that produces the most utility is not always so clear-cut, Mill suggests that the utilitarian moral agent, when attempting to rank the utility of different actions, should refer to the general experience of persons. That is, if people generally experience more happiness following action \"X\" than they do action \"Y\", the utilitarian should conclude that action \"X\" produces more utility than action \"Y\", and so is to be preferred.\nUtilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory, meaning that it holds that acts are justified insofar as they produce a desirable outcome. The overarching goal of utilitarianism\u2014the ideal consequence\u2014is to achieve the \"greatest good for the greatest number as the result of human action\". In \"Utilitarianism,\" Mill states that \"happiness is the sole end of human action.\" This statement aroused some controversy, which is why Mill took it a step further, explaining how the very nature of humans wanting happiness, and who \"take it to be reasonable under free consideration\", demands that happiness is indeed desirable. In other words, free will leads everyone to make actions inclined on their own happiness, unless reasoned that it would improve the happiness of others, in which case, the greatest utility is still being achieved. To that extent, the \"utilitarianism\" that Mill is describing is a default lifestyle that he believes is what people who have not studied a specific opposing field of ethics would naturally and unconsciously use when faced with a decision.\nUtilitarianism is thought of by some of its activists to be a more developed and overarching ethical theory of Immanuel Kant's belief in goodwill, and not just some default cognitive process of humans. Where Kant (1724\u20131804) would argue that reason can only be used properly by goodwill, Mill would say that the only way to universally create fair laws and systems would be to step back to the consequences, whereby Kant's ethical theories become based around the ultimate good\u2014utility. By this logic the only valid way to discern what is the proper reason would be to view the consequences of any action and weigh the good and the bad, even if on the surface, the ethical reasoning seems to indicate a different train of thought.\nHigher and lower pleasures.\nMill's major contribution to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of pleasures. Bentham treats all forms of happiness as equal, whereas Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures (\"higher pleasures\") are superior to more physical forms of pleasure (\"lower pleasures\"). He distinguishes between happiness and contentment, claiming that the former is of higher value than the latter, a belief wittily encapsulated in the statement that, \"it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.\"\nThis made Mill believe that \"our only ultimate end\" is happiness. One unique part of his utilitarian view, that is not seen in others, is the idea of higher and lower pleasures. Mill explains the different pleasures as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a pleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one possible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference [...] that is the more desirable pleasure.\nHe defines \"higher pleasures\" as mental, moral, and aesthetic pleasures, and \"lower pleasures\" as being more sensational. He believed that higher pleasures should be seen as preferable to lower pleasures since they have a greater quality in virtue. He holds that pleasures gained in activity are of a higher quality than those gained passively.\nMill defines the difference between higher and lower forms of pleasure with the principle that those who have experienced both tend to prefer one over the other. This is, perhaps, in direct contrast with Bentham's statement that \"Quantity of pleasure being equal, push-pin is as good as poetry\", that, if a simple child's game like hopscotch causes more pleasure to more people than a night at the opera house, it is more incumbent upon a society to devote more resources to propagating hopscotch than running opera houses. Mill's argument is that the \"simple pleasures\" tend to be preferred by people who have no experience with high art, and are therefore not in a proper position to judge. He also argues that people who, for example, are noble or practise philosophy, benefit society more than those who engage in individualist practices for pleasure, which are lower forms of happiness. It is not the agent's own greatest happiness that matters \"but the greatest amount of happiness altogether\".\nChapters.\nMill separated his explanation of Utilitarianism into five different sections:\nIn the \"General Remarks\" portion of his essay, he speaks about how next to no progress has been made when it comes to judging what is right and what is wrong in morality and if there is such a thing as moral instinct (which he argues that there may not be). However, he agrees that in general, \"Our moral faculty, according to all those of its interpreters who are entitled to the name of thinkers, supplies us only with the general principles of moral judgments.\"\nIn \"What Utilitarianism Is\", he focuses no longer on background information but on utilitarianism itself. He quotes utilitarianism as \"the greatest happiness principle\", defining this theory by saying that pleasure and no pain are the only inherently good things in the world and expands on it by saying that \"actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.\" He views it not as an animalistic concept because he sees seeking out pleasure as a way of using our higher facilities. He also says in this chapter that the happiness principle is based not exclusively on the individual but mainly on the community.\nMill also defends the idea of a \"strong utilitarian conscience (i.e., a strong feeling of obligation to the general happiness)\". He argued that humans have a desire to be happy and that that desire causes us to want to be in unity with other humans. This causes us to care about the happiness of others, as well as the happiness of complete strangers. But this desire also causes us to experience pain when we perceive harm to other people. He believes in internal sanctions that make us experience guilt and appropriate our actions. These internal sanctions make us want to do good because we do not want to feel guilty for our actions. Happiness is our ultimate end because it is our duty. He argues that we do not need to be constantly motivated by the concern of people's happiness because most of the actions done by people are done out of good intention, and the good of the world is made up of the good of the people.\nIn Mill's fourth chapter, \"Of What Sort of Proof the Principle of Utility is Susceptible\", he speaks of what proofs of Utility are affected. He starts this chapter off by saying that all of his claims cannot be backed up by reasoning. He claims that the only proof that something brings one pleasure is if someone finds it pleasurable. Next, he talks about how morality is the basic way to achieve happiness. He also discusses in this chapter that utilitarianism is beneficial for virtue. He says that \"it maintains not only that virtue is to be desired, but that it is to be desired disinterestedly, for itself.\" In his final chapter he looks at the connection between utilitarianism and justice. He contemplates the question of whether justice is something distinct from utility or not. He reasons this question in several different ways and finally comes to the conclusion that in certain cases justice is essential for utility, but in others, social duty is far more important than justice. Mill believes that \"justice must give way to some other moral principle, but that what is just in ordinary cases is, by reason of that other principle, not just in the particular case.\"\nThe qualitative account of happiness that Mill advocates thus sheds light on his account presented in \"On Liberty\". As he suggests in that text, utility is to be conceived in relation to humanity \"as a progressive being\", which includes the development and exercise of rational capacities as we strive to achieve a \"higher mode of existence\". The rejection of censorship and paternalism is intended to provide the necessary social conditions for the achievement of knowledge and the greatest ability for the greatest number to develop and exercise their deliberative and rational capacities.\nMill redefines the definition of happiness as \"the ultimate end, for the sake of which all other things are desirable (whether we are considering our own good or that of other people) is an existence as free as possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments.\" He firmly believed that moral rules and obligations could be referenced to promoting happiness, which connects to having a noble character. While Mill is not a standard act utilitarian or rule utilitarian, he is a minimizing utilitarian, which \"affirms that it would be \"desirable\" to maximize happiness for the greatest number, but not that we are morally \"required\" to do so.\"\nWomen's rights.\nMill's view of history was that right up until his time \"the whole of the female\" and \"the great majority of the male sex\" were simply \"slaves\". He countered arguments to the contrary, arguing that relations between sexes simply amounted to \"the legal subordination of one sex to the other \u2013 [which] is wrong itself, and now one of the chief hindrances to human improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect equality.\" Here, then, we have an instance of Mill's use of \"slavery\" in a sense which, compared to its fundamental meaning of absolute unfreedom of person, is an extended and arguably a rhetorical rather than a literal sense.\nWith this, Mill can be considered among the earliest male proponents of gender equality, having been recruited by American feminist John Neal during his stay in London circa 1825\u20131827. His book \"The Subjection of Women\" (1861, publ.1869) is one of the earliest written on this subject by a male author. In \"The Subjection of Women\", Mill attempts to make a case for perfect equality.\nIn his proposal for a universal education system sponsored by the state, Mill expands benefits for many marginalized groups, especially for women. For Mill, a universal education held the potential to create new abilities and novel types of behaviour of which the current receiving generation and their descendants could both benefit from. Such a pathway to opportunity would enable women to gain \"industrial and social independence\" that would allow them the same movement in their agency and citizenship as men. Mill's view of opportunity stands out in its reach, but even more so for the population he foresees who could benefit from it. Mill was hopeful of the autonomy such an education could allow for its recipients and especially for women. Through the consequential sophistication and knowledge attained, individuals are able to properly act in ways that recedes away from those leading towards overpopulation. This stands directly in contrast with the view held by many of Mill's contemporaries and predecessors who viewed such inclusive programs to be counter-intuitive. Aiming such help at marginalized groups, such as the poor and working class, would only serve to reward them with the opportunity to move to a higher status, thus encouraging greater fertility which at its extreme could lead to overproduction.\nHe talks about the role of women in marriage and how it must be changed. Mill comments on three major facets of women's lives that he felt are hindering them:\nHe argues that the oppression of women was one of the few remaining relics from ancient times, a set of prejudices that severely impeded the progress of humanity. As a Member of Parliament, Mill introduced an unsuccessful amendment to the Reform Bill to substitute the word \"person\" in place of \"man\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nMill's work.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "15627", "revid": "50435832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15627", "title": "Junk science", "text": "Scientific data considered to be spurious or fraudulent\nJunk science is spurious or fraudulent scientific data, research, or analysis. The concept is often invoked in political and legal contexts where facts and scientific results have a great amount of weight in making a determination. It usually conveys a pejorative connotation that the research has been untowardly driven by political, ideological, financial, or otherwise unscientific motives.\nThe concept was popularized in the 1990s in relation to expert testimony in civil litigation. More recently, invoking the concept has been a tactic to criticize research on the harmful environmental or public health effects of corporate activities, and occasionally in response to such criticism.\nIn some contexts, junk science is counterposed to the \"sound science\" or \"solid science\" that favors one's own point of view. Junk science has been criticized for undermining public trust in real science. Junk science is not the same as pseudoscience.\nDefinition.\nJunk science has been defined as:\nMotivations.\nJunk science happens for different reasons: researchers believing that their ideas are correct before proper analysis (a sort of scientific self-delusion or drinking the Kool-Aid), researchers biased with their study designs, and/or a \"plain old lack of ethics\". Being overly attached to one's own ideas can cause research to veer from ordinary junk science (e.g., designing an experiment that is expected to produce the desired results) into scientific fraud (e.g., lying about the results) and pseudoscience (e.g., claiming that the unfavorable results actually proved the idea correct).\nJunk science can occur when the perpetrator has something to gain from arriving at the desired conclusion. It can often happen in the testimony of expert witnesses in legal proceedings, and especially in the self-serving advertising of products and services. These situations may encourage researchers to make sweeping or overstated claims based on limited evidence.\nHistory.\nThe phrase \"junk science\" appears to have been in use prior to 1985. A 1985 United States Department of Justice report by the Tort Policy Working Group noted:\nThe use of such invalid scientific evidence (commonly referred to as 'junk science') has resulted in findings of causation which simply cannot be justified or understood from the standpoint of the current state of credible scientific or medical knowledge.\nIn 1989, the climate scientist Jerry Mahlman (Director of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) characterized the theory that global warming was due to solar variation (presented in \"Scientific Perspectives on the Greenhouse Problem\" by Frederick Seitz et al.) as \"noisy junk science.\"\nPeter W. Huber popularized the term with respect to litigation in his 1991 book \"Galileo's Revenge: Junk Science in the Courtroom.\" The book has been cited in over 100 legal textbooks and references; as a consequence, some sources cite Huber as the first to coin the term. By 1997, the term had entered the legal lexicon as seen in an opinion by Supreme Court of the United States Justice John Paul Stevens:\nAn example of 'junk science' that should be excluded under the Daubert standard as too unreliable would be the testimony of a phrenologist who would purport to prove a defendant's future dangerousness based on the contours of the defendant's skull. Lower courts have subsequently set guidelines for identifying junk science, such as the 2005 opinion of United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit Judge Frank H. Easterbrook:\nPositive reports about magnetic water treatment are not replicable; this plus the lack of a physical explanation for any effects are hallmarks of junk science.\nAs the subtitle of Huber's book, \"Junk Science in the Courtroom\", suggests, his emphasis was on the use or misuse of expert testimony in civil litigation. One prominent example cited in the book was litigation over casual contact in the spread of AIDS. A California school district sought to prevent a young boy with AIDS, Ryan Thomas, from attending kindergarten. The school district produced an expert witness, Steven Armentrout, who testified that a possibility existed that AIDS could be transmitted to schoolmates through yet undiscovered \"vectors\". However, five experts testified on behalf of Thomas that AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact, and the court affirmed the \"solid science\" (as Huber called it) and rejected Armentrout's argument.\nIn 1999, Paul Ehrlich and others advocated public policies to improve the dissemination of valid environmental scientific knowledge and discourage junk science:\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports offer an antidote to junk science by articulating the current consensus on the prospects for climate change, by outlining the extent of the uncertainties, and by describing the potential benefits and costs of policies to address climate change.\nIn a 2003 study about changes in environmental activism regarding the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, Pedynowski noted that junk science can undermine the credibility of science over a much broader scale because misrepresentation by special interests casts doubt on more defensible claims and undermines the credibility of all research.\nIn his 2006 book \"Junk Science\", Dan Agin emphasized two main causes of junk science: fraud, and ignorance. In the first case, Agin discussed falsified results in the development of organic transistors:\nAs far as understanding junk science is concerned, the important aspect is that both Bell Laboratories and the international physics community were fooled until someone noticed that noise records published by Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n in several papers were identical\u2014which means physically impossible.\nIn the second case, he cites an example that demonstrates ignorance of statistical principles in the lay press:\nSince no such proof is possible [that genetically modified food is harmless], the article in \"The New York Times\" was what is called a \"bad rap\" against the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2014a bad rap based on a junk-science belief that it's possible to prove a null hypothesis.\nAgin asks the reader to step back from the rhetoric, as \"how things are labeled does not make a science junk science.\" In its place, he offers that junk science is ultimately motivated by the desire to hide undesirable truths from the public.\nThe rise of open-access (free to read) journals has resulted in economic pressure on academic publishers to publish junk science. Even when the journal is peer-reviewed, the authors, rather than the readers, become the customer and the source of funding for the journal, so the publisher is incentivized to publish as many papers as possible, including those that are methodologically unsound.\nMisuse in public relations.\nJohn Stauber and Sheldon Rampton of \"PR Watch\" say the concept of junk science has come to be invoked in attempts to dismiss scientific findings that stand in the way of short-term corporate profits. In their book \"Trust Us, We're Experts\" (2001), they write that industries have launched multimillion-dollar campaigns to position certain theories as junk science in the popular mind, often failing to employ the scientific method themselves. For example, the tobacco industry has described research demonstrating the harmful effects of smoking and second-hand smoke as junk science, through the vehicle of various astroturf groups.\nTheories more favorable to corporate activities are portrayed in words as \"sound science\". Past examples where \"sound science\" was used include the research into the toxicity of Alar, which was heavily criticized by antiregulatory advocates, and Herbert Needleman's research into low dose lead poisoning. Needleman was accused of fraud and personally attacked.\nFox News commentator Steven Milloy often denigrates credible scientific research on topics like global warming, ozone depletion, and passive smoking as \"junk science\". The credibility of Milloy's website junkscience.com was questioned by Paul D. Thacker, a writer for \"The New Republic\", in the wake of evidence that Milloy had received funding from Philip Morris, RJR Tobacco, and ExxonMobil. Thacker also noted that Milloy was receiving almost $100,000 a year in consulting fees from Philip Morris while he criticized the evidence regarding the hazards of second-hand smoke as junk science. Following the publication of this article, the Cato Institute, which had hosted the junkscience.com site, ceased its association with the site and removed Milloy from its list of adjunct scholars.\nTobacco industry documents reveal that Philip Morris executives conceived of the \"Whitecoat Project\" in the 1980s as a response to emerging scientific data on the harmfulness of second-hand smoke. The goal of the Whitecoat Project, as conceived by Philip Morris and other tobacco companies, was to use ostensibly independent \"scientific consultants\" to spread doubt in the public mind about scientific data through invoking concepts like junk science. According to epidemiologist David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environment, Safety, and Health in the Clinton Administration, the tobacco industry invented the \"sound science\" movement in the 1980s as part of their campaign against the regulation of second-hand smoke.\nDavid Michaels has argued that, since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in \"Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\", lay judges have become \"gatekeepers\" of scientific testimony and, as a result, respected scientists have sometimes been unable to provide testimony so that corporate defendants are \"increasingly emboldened\" to accuse adversaries of practicing junk science.\nNotable cases.\nAmerican psychologist Paul Cameron has been designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as an anti-gay extremist and a purveyor of \"junk science\". Cameron's research has been heavily criticized for unscientific methods and distortions which attempt to link homosexuality with pedophilia. In one instance, Cameron claimed that lesbians are 300 times more likely to get into car accidents. The SPLC states his work has been continually cited in some sections of the media despite being discredited. Cameron was expelled from the American Psychological Association in 1983.\nCombatting junk science.\nIn 1995, the Union of Concerned Scientists launched the Sound Science Initiative, a national network of scientists committed to debunking junk science through media outreach, lobbying, and developing joint strategies to participate in town meetings or public hearings. In its newsletter on Science and Technology in Congress, the American Association for the Advancement of Science also recognized the need for increased understanding between scientists and lawmakers: \"Although most individuals would agree that sound science is preferable to junk science, fewer recognize what makes a scientific study 'good' or 'bad'.\" The American Dietetic Association, criticizing marketing claims made for food products, has created a list of \"Ten Red Flags of Junk Science\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He completed the first recorded circumnavigation of the main islands of New Zealand, and led the first recorded visit by Europeans to the east coast of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands.\nCook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager before enlisting in the Royal Navy in 1755. He first saw combat during the Seven Years' War, when he fought in the Siege of Louisbourg. Later in the war he surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the St. Lawrence River during the Siege of Quebec. In the 1760s he mapped the coastline of Newfoundland and made important astronomical observations which brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and the Royal Society. This acclaim came at a pivotal moment in British overseas exploration, and it led to his commission in 1768 as commander of for the first of his three voyages. \nDuring these voyages he sailed tens of thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas, mapping coastlines, islands, and features across the globe in greater detail than previously charted\u00a0\u2013 including Easter Island, Alaska, and South Georgia Island. He made contact with numerous indigenous peoples, and claimed several territories for the Kingdom of Great Britain. Renowned for exceptional seamanship and courage in times of danger, he was patient, persistent, sober, and competent, but sometimes hot-tempered. His contributions to the prevention of scurvy, a disease common among sailors, led the Royal Society to award him the Copley Gold Medal.\nIn 1779, during his second visit to Hawaii, Cook was killed when a dispute with Native Hawaiians turned violent. His voyages left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge that influenced his successors well into the 20th century. Numerous memorials have been dedicated to him worldwide.\nEarly life.\nJames Cook was born on 7 November 1728 in the village of Marton, located in the North Riding of Yorkshire, approximately from the sea. He was the second of eight children of James Cook, a Scottish farm labourer from Ednam in Roxburghshire, and his wife, Grace Pace, from Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at Great Ayton, where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for Cook to attend a school run by a charitable foundation. In 1741, after five years of schooling, he began work for his father who had been promoted to farm manager.\nIn 1745, when he was 16, Cook moved to the fishing village of Staithes to be apprenticed as a shopboy to grocer and haberdasher William Sanderson. After 18 months, Cook, proving not suited for shop work, travelled to the nearby port town of Whitby and was introduced to Sanderson's friends John and Henry Walker. The Walkers were prominent local ship-owners in the coal trade.\nCook was taken on as a merchant navy apprentice in the Walkers' small fleet of vessels, plying coal along the English coast. His first assignment was aboard the collier \"Freelove\", and he spent several years on this and various other coasters, sailing between the Tyne and London. As part of his apprenticeship, Cook applied himself to the study of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, navigation and astronomy \u2013 all skills needed to command a ship.\nUpon completing his three-year apprenticeship, Cook began working on merchant ships in the Baltic Sea. After obtaining his mariner licence in 1752 he was promoted to the rank of and began serving on the collier brig \"Friendship\". He served as mate on the \"Friendship\" for two and a half years, visiting ports in Norway and Netherlands, learning to navigate in shallow waters along the east coast of Britain, and traversing the Irish Sea and the English Channel.\nRoyal Navy.\nAt the age of 26, Cook was offered a promotion to captain of \"Friendship\", but he declined and instead joined the Royal Navy at Wapping on 17 June 1755. He entered the navy when Britain was expanding its naval forces in anticipation of the conflict that became known as the Seven Years' War. Cook's first posting was two years aboard , serving as able seaman and master's mate under Captain Joseph Hamar and, later, Captain Hugh Palliser. In October and November 1755 he took part in \"Eagle\"'s capture of one French warship and the sinking of another. Following the death of \"Eagle\"'s boatswain, Cook was unofficially promoted to fill that role in January 1756. His first command was in March 1756 when he was briefly in charge of \"Cruizer\", a small cutter attached to \"Eagle\". In June 1757, Cook passed his master's examinations at Trinity House, Deptford, qualifying him to navigate and handle a ship of the King's fleet. He then joined the sixth-rate frigate HMS \"Solebay\" as ship's master under Captain Robert Craig.\nSeven Years' War.\nDuring the Seven Years' War, Cook served in North America as master aboard the fourth-rate Navy vessel . With others in \"Pembroke\"'s crew, he took part in the major amphibious assault that captured the Fortress of Louisbourg in Nova Scotia from the French in 1758.\nThe day after the fall of Louisbourg, Cook met an army officer, Samuel Holland, who was using a plane table to survey the area. The two men had an immediate connection through their interest in surveying, and Holland taught Cook the methods he was using. They collaborated on developing preliminary charts of the entrance to the Saint Lawrence River, with Cook writing the accompanying sailing directions. Cook's first map to be engraved and printed was of Gasp\u00e9 Bay, drawn in 1758 and published in 1759. The integration of Holland's land-surveying techniques with Cook's hydrographic expertise enabled Cook, from that point forward, to produce nautical charts of coastal regions that significantly exceeded the accuracy of most contemporary charts.\nAs Major-General James Wolfe's advance on Quebec progressed in 1759, Cook and other ships' masters took soundings, marked shoals, and updated charts\u00a0\u2013 particularly around Quebec. This information enabled Wolfe to mount a stealthy nighttime attack by transporting troops across the river, leading to victory in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.\nNewfoundland.\nAs the Seven Years' War came to a close, Cook was tasked with charting the rugged coast of Newfoundland. He was appointed master of , and spent five seasons producing charts. He surveyed the north-west stretch in 1763 and 1764, the south coast between the Burin Peninsula and Cape Ray in 1765 and 1766, and the west coast in 1767. Cook employed local pilots to point out the rocks and hidden dangers.\nCook severely injured his right hand in August 1764 when a powder horn he was carrying exploded. In July 1765, Cook experienced the first of several ship groundings he faced during his career: \"Grenville\" struck an uncharted rock, and cargo had to be unloaded before she could be refloated.\nWhile in Newfoundland, Cook precisely recorded apparent (or local) time of the start and end of the solar eclipse of 5 August 1766. He sent the results to the English astronomer John Bevis, who compared them with the same data from an observation of the eclipse carried out in Oxford and calculated the difference in longitude between the two locations. The results were communicated to the Royal Society in 1767 and the longitude position obtained was used by Cook in his printed sailing directions for Newfoundland.\nAt the end of the 1767 surveying season, while HMS \"Grenville\" was returning to her home port of Deptford, Cook encountered a storm at the entrance to the Thames. He anchored \"Grenville\" off the Nore lighthouse and prepared the ship to ride out the weather. An anchor cable snapped, causing the ship to run aground on a shoal. Despite efforts to refloat her, Cook and his crew were forced to abandon ship. They returned when the storm abated, lightened and rerigged the ship, and continued into Deptford.\nExploration of the Pacific Ocean.\nCook's achievements in North America\u00a0\u2013 hydrographic and astronomical\u00a0\u2013 were noticed by the Admiralty, and came at a pivotal moment in British overseas exploration. Europeans had started exploring the Pacific Ocean in the early 16th century, and by the mid-18th century they had charted much of the ocean's perimeter, and were actively engaged in trade with the Philippines, Spice Islands, and Mexico. Yet vast regions of the ocean remained largely unexplored by Europeans, including the coastlines of Canada and Alaska, much of the southern Pacific, and the central oceanic expanse. Several major questions persisted: Did a North-West Passage connect the North Pacific with the North Atlantic? Did the hypothesised continent of \"Terra Australis Incognita\" (undiscovered southern land) exist? And were there yet-undiscovered cultures or lands in the central Pacific?\nThe Treaty of Paris\u00a0\u2013 signed when the Seven Years' War ended in 1763\u00a0\u2013 enabled the Royal Navy to redirect resources from warfare to exploration. Britain soon dispatched several explorers to the Pacific Ocean, including John Byron, Samuel Wallis, and Philip Carteret. They returned with accounts of Tahiti, and reported sightings of \"Terra Australis\" \u00a0\u2013 setting the stage for Cook's first voyage.\nFirst voyage (1768\u200d\u2013\u200d1771).\nCook's first scientific voyage was a three-year expedition to the south Pacific Ocean aboard HMS \"Endeavour\", conducted from 1768 to 1771. The voyage was jointly sponsored by the Royal Navy and Royal Society. The publicly stated goal was to observe the 1769 transit of Venus from the vantage point of Tahiti. Additional objectives\u00a0\u2013 outlined in secret orders\u00a0\u2013 were searching for the postulated \"Terra Australis\" and claiming lands for Britain.\nIn early 1768, the Admiralty asked the shipwright Adam Hayes to select a vessel for the expedition; he chose the merchant collier \"Earl of Pembroke\", which the Royal Navy renamed \"Endeavour\". On 5 May 1768\u00a0\u2013 based on the recommendation of Hugh Palliser\u00a0\u2013 Cook, aged 39, was selected by the Admiralty to lead the voyage. The next day he took his examination for the rank of lieutenant\u00a0\u2013 a rank which was required to command a ship armed with the number of guns planned for \"Endeavour\".\nLike most colliers, \"Endeavour\" had a large hold, a sturdy construction that would tolerate grounding, was small enough to be careened (laid on her side for repairs), and had a shallow draught that enabled navigating in shallows. Upon completion of the first voyage, Cook wrote: \"It was to these properties in her, those on board owe their Preservation. Hence I was enabled to prosecute Discoveries in those Seas so much longer than any other Man ever did or could do.\" When selecting ships for his second voyage in 1772, Cook chose the same type of ship, from the same shipbuilder.\nThe Admiralty authorised a ship's company of 73 sailors and 12 marines. Cook's second lieutenant was Zachary Hicks, and his third lieutenant was John Gore, a 16-year naval veteran who had already circumnavigated the world twice aboard HMS \"Dolphin\". Also on the ship were astronomer Charles Green and 25-year-old naturalist Joseph Banks. Banks provided funding for seven others to join the journey: the naturalists Daniel Solander and Herman Sp\u00f6ring, the artists Alexander Buchan and Sydney Parkinson, two black servants, and a secretary.\nTierra del Fuego.\nThe expedition departed England on 25 August 1768 and headed south to round Cape Horn into the Pacific. They made a stop in Tierra del Fuego, where Cook composed his first anthropological essay, detailing his observations of the indigenous Haush people. Banks went ashore with several members of his party to collect botanical specimens. During the overnight excursion, his two black servants, Thomas Richmond and George Dorlton, froze to death.\nTahiti.\nThe ship continued westward across the Pacific, arriving at Tahiti on 13 April 1769, where the observations of the transit of Venus were made. In May, Cook and some of his crew observed Tahitians surfing\u00a0\u2013 becoming the first Europeans to witness the practice.\nIn June, two incidents happened that recurred in various forms throughout Cook's voyages: Tahitians were offended when some of his crew took rocks\u00a0\u2013 to use as ship's ballast\u00a0\u2013 from a sacred marae without permission. In a separate event, Tahitians took various items from the crew, prompting Cook to seize 22 canoes\u00a0\u2013 many of which did not belong to the individuals responsible\u00a0\u2013 as ransom until the stolen property was returned.\nIn July, two marines deserted by taking local wives and going into hiding, intending to remain on the island. In response, Cook detained a Tahitian chief as a hostage to compel the local community to locate and return the deserters. Cook then sailed from Tahiti to the nearby island of Huahine, then to Raiatea where he claimed Raiatea-Taha'a and the islands of Huahine, Borabora, Tupai, and Maupiti for Britain, naming them the Society Islands.\nNew Zealand.\nAs directed by his secret orders, Cook began his search for the postulated southern continent of \"Terra Australis\". He sailed to New Zealand and\u00a0\u2013 in October 1769\u00a0\u2013 landed at Poverty Bay near the T\u016branganui River. With the aid of Tupaia, a Tahitian priest who had joined the expedition, Cook was the first European to communicate with the M\u0101ori. However, encounters with them on the first two days turned violent, the British shooting several dead. Cook's approach to interactions with the M\u0101ori was to offer greetings and exchange gifts, in an attempt to establish friendly relations. But if his crew was threatened, he often ordered a quick and decisive use of force, despite his instructions from the Royal Society.\nSailing north, \"Endeavour\" anchored at Mercury Bay on 9 November where Cook observed the transit of Mercury and claimed the bay for Britain. In January 1770, Cook arrived in Queen Charlotte Sound, on the north coast of New Zealand's South Island. He claimed the location for Britain and it became a favourite base for his future voyages. While there, Cook came upon M\u0101ori eating the flesh of enemies they had recently killed, which confirmed stories of cannibalism his crew had heard in Poverty Bay. Cook established that a strait separated the North Island from the South Island and then completed the circumnavigation of New Zealand's main islands, mapping almost the complete coastline.\nAustralia.\nConvinced that no unknown southern continent existed in those latitudes, Cook continued west. On 19 April 1770, Point Hicks was sighted, and the crew became the first Europeans to encounter Australia's eastern coastline. \"Endeavour\" continued northwards along the coastline, keeping the land in sight, while Cook charted and named landmarks along the way. During this stretch, Cook saw several Aboriginal Australians on shore, but was unable to draw close enough to make contact.\nOn 29 April they made their first landfall on the continent in Botany Bay. In the expedition's first direct encounter with Aboriginal Australians, two Gweagal men opposed the landing and in the following confrontation one warrior was wounded with small shot. Cook and his crew stayed at Botany Bay for a week, exploring the surrounding area and collecting water, timber, fodder, and botanical specimens. Cook attempted to establish relations with the Aboriginal people but concluded that they only wanted the British to leave.\nAfter departing Botany Bay they continued northwards, hugging the coast and charting it. They stopped at Bustard Bay in May 1770, then proceeded north through the shallow and extremely dangerous Great Barrier Reef. On 11 June \"Endeavour\" ran aground on the reef at high tide. The ship was stuck fast, so Cook ordered all excess weight thrown overboard, including six cannons. She was eventually hauled off after 27 hours. The ship was leaking badly, so the crew fothered the damage (hauling a spare sail under the ship to cover and slow the leak). Cook then careened the ship on a beach at the mouth of the Endeavour River for seven weeks while repairs were made.\nThe crew explored the surrounding area, where Cook observed a kangaroo for the first time. One was killed and the species was documented by Banks. The local Guugu Yimithirr people generally avoided the British, although following a dispute over green turtles Cook ordered shots to be fired and one local was lightly wounded.\nThe expedition continued northward until they reached the north-east tip of Australia: Cape York. Cook proceeded to a nearby island where he scanned the surrounding waters for a route forward. There he claimed the entire Australian coast that he had surveyed as British territory and named the island Possession Island. The expedition then turned west and continued homewards through the shallow and dangerous waters of the Torres Strait.\nReturn to England.\nIn October 1770, Cook stopped in Batavia (modern Jakarta, Indonesia), where the Dutch dockyard facilities were used to inspect and repair the damage from running aground on the Great Barrier Reef.\nAfter departing Batavia in late December 1770, the expedition sailed to the Cape of Good Hope, then to the island of Saint Helena, arriving on 30 April 1771.\nThe stay in Batavia marked the onset of the most severe outbreak of illness and death endured during any of Cook's voyages: seven crew members died in Batavia, and a further 23 perished on the return journey to England. The majority of the deaths were caused by dysentery (with some attributed to tuberculosis and possibly typhoid fever) often worsened by malaria.\nThe ship finally returned to England on 12 July 1771, anchoring in the Downs. In August, Cook was promoted to the rank of commander. A book about the voyage, based on the journals of Cook and Banks, was published in 1773.\nSecond voyage (1772\u200d\u2013\u200d1775).\nIn 1772, Cook was commissioned to lead a second scientific expedition on behalf of the Royal Society, with the objective of determining the existence of the hypothetical continent \"Terra Australis\". Cook created a plan to probe southward in the southern summer, then retreat to more northerly, warmer, regions in the frigid southern winter.\nThis voyage would have two ships and, unlike the first voyage, Cook selected them himself: commanded by him, and , commanded by Tobias Furneaux. \"Resolution\" began her career as the North Sea collier \"Marquis of Granby\", launched at Whitby in 1770. She was fitted out at Deptford with some of the most advanced equipment available, including an azimuth compass, ice anchors, and an apparatus for distilling fresh water from sea water.\nBanks planned to travel with Cook in the second voyage, but Banks' excessive demands for modifications to the ship conflicted with the Admiralty's constraints, so he withdrew from the voyage before it departed. Banks was replaced by the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster and his son, Georg Forster. The crew also included the astronomer William Wales (responsible for the new K1 chronometer carried on \"Resolution\"), lieutenant Charles Clerke, and the artist William Hodges.\nSearch for \"Terra Australis\".\nAfter departing England, the ships travelled south to South Africa and stopped at Cape Town in November 1772. From there they sailed eastwards, planning to circumnavigate the globe roughly between latitude 50\u00b0S and 70\u00b0S. In late November 1772, the ships sighted their first icebergs and Cook performed an experiment: his crew retrieved blocks of ice and melted them on board the ships, producing good quality fresh water, proving that drinking water could be obtained from sea ice. On 17 January 1773 the crews became the first recorded Europeans to cross the Antarctic Circle. Despite his mission to find \"Terra Australis\", Cook never sighted Antarctica in any of his voyages, but on 18 January\u00a0\u2013 unbeknownst to him\u00a0\u2013 the ships approached within of that continent.\nIn February 1773, in dense Antarctic fog, \"Resolution\" and \"Adventure\" became separated. Furneaux made his way\u00a0\u2013 via Tasmania\u00a0\u2013 to a pre-arranged rendezvous point to be used in the event of separation: Queen Charlotte Sound in New Zealand. Cook joined Furneaux there in May. The crews traded with the M\u0101ori people, and in his journal, Cook expressed concern that crew members might be transmitting diseases to the M\u0101ori people and encouraging prostitution.\nTahiti and New Zealand.\nThe ships departed New Zealand in June\u00a0\u2013 the southern winter\u00a0\u2013 to resume their eastward search for \"Terra Australis\". About a month after leaving New Zealand, twenty crewmen aboard \"Adventure\" contracted scurvy\u00a0\u2013 one of whom died\u00a0\u2013 because Furneaux had failed to follow Cook's dietary instructions. The ships proceeded in a small anti-clockwise loop, visiting Tahiti and Tonga, planning to return to New Zealand together. Before reaching New Zealand, in the night of 29\u201330 October, the ships became separated for a second time\u00a0\u2013 this time due to a storm. Cook proceeded to the rendezvous point, and waited three weeks, then departed to continue the voyage alone.\nDelayed by storms, Furneaux arrived at the designated rendezvous point in Queen Charlotte Sound five weeks after they separated, missing Cook by four days. In December 1773, while ten members of \"Adventure\"'s crew were ashore gathering provisions, a violent altercation occurred with a group of M\u0101ori, resulting in the deaths of all the crewmen and two M\u0101ori. Furneaux discovered the bodies of the crew members, partially burned in preparation for cannibalism. Many members of \"Adventure\"'s crew wanted to exact revenge on the M\u0101ori, but Furneaux thought it prudent to avoid additional violence, so they left New Zealand and returned to Britain without Cook. When learning about the deaths much later, Cook wondered if Furneaux's crew was at fault, writing \"I must ... observe in favour of the New Zealanders that I have always found them of a brave, noble, open and benevolent disposition\".\nCircuit around the South Pacific.\nAfter the missed rendezvous, \"Resolution\" made a large anti-clockwise loop in the south Pacific: heading far south, then visiting Easter Island, Tonga, and finally returning to New Zealand. In the first stretch of this large loop, \"Resolution\" continued her search for \"Terra Australis\" by heading south-east, reaching her most southern latitude of 71\u00b010\u2032S in January 1774. At this point, the ship's progress was blocked by impenetrable pack ice, and Cook wrote in his private diary: \"I will not say it was impossible anywhere to get in among this Ice, but I will assert that the bare attempting of it would be a very dangerous enterprise and what I believe no man in my situation would have thought of. I whose ambition leads me not only farther than any other man has been before me, but as far as I think it possible for man to go...\"\nIn early 1774, Cook experienced a severe gastrointestinal illness, marked by prolonged abdominal pain and constipation. By February, his condition had worsened to the point where he became bedridden, causing considerable distress among the crew. The ship was out of fresh provisions and meat, so the Forsters offered their pet dog to be made into a soup, which Cook consumed. His bowel movements resumed in late February, but he remained weak for another month.\nIn June 1774, the ship stopped to resupply at the island of Nomuka in Tonga, where most of the crew engaged in intimate relations with women. Cook was berated by an older woman after he declined\u00a0\u2013 consistent with his usual conduct\u00a0\u2013 to engage in sexual relations with a young woman who had been offered to him. Cook was the first European to set foot on New Caledonia, in September 1774, and he claimed the land in the name of his king. While there, Cook\u00a0\u2013 despite warnings from Georg Forster\u00a0\u2013 ate the liver of a poisonous pufferfish, and became numb and unable to walk without assistance; he recovered after taking emetics.\nWhen Cook completed the large anti-clockwise circuit and returned to Queen Charlotte Sound, the M\u0101ori welcomed his arrival. In conversations with them, Cook heard confusing stories about a conflict with the crew of a ship. Upon making inquiries, Cook learned that \"Adventure\" had visited the area approximately eleven months earlier, but he remained unaware of the violent encounter that had led to the deaths of ten of its crew.\nReturn to England.\nLeaving New Zealand, \"Resolution\" proceeded home, sailing south of Tierra del Fuego, and stopping at South Georgia Island in January 1775, where Cook charted the coast and claimed the island group in the name of his king. From there they continued eastward and discovered the South Sandwich Islands, then stopped in South Africa, and\u00a0\u2013 finally\u00a0\u2013 sailed north back to Britain.\nBased on Cook's observations made during the second voyage, the general consensus was that \"Terra Australis\" did not exist. If the continent did exist, it should have extended into the temperate latitudes\u00a0\u2013 yet Cook had demonstrated that no polar landmass reached beyond about 50\u00b0S.\nCook was promoted to the rank of post-captain and given an honorary retirement from the Royal Navy, with a posting as an officer of the Greenwich Hospital. He reluctantly accepted, insisting that he be allowed to quit the post if an opportunity for active duty should arise. His fame extended beyond the Admiralty: he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and awarded the Copley Gold Medal for a paper he wrote describing methods to prevent scurvy. Nathaniel Dance-Holland painted his portrait; he was described as \"the first navigator in Europe\", and he met with noted author James Boswell. Two books were published in 1777 about the expedition: one by Cook, and another by the Forsters.\nThird voyage (1776\u200d\u2013\u200d1779).\nThe primary objective of Cook's third expedition was to search for a North-West Passage connecting the north Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic. Simultaneously, the Admiralty was organising a second expedition\u00a0\u2013 commanded by Richard Pickersgill, who had accompanied Cook on his first two voyages\u00a0\u2013 to search for the North-West Passage from the Atlantic side. To keep the goal of the mission secret, the Admiralty publicly declared that its aim was to return Polynesian native Mai to his home in Tahiti.\nOn this voyage, Cook again commanded \"Resolution\", while Captain Charles Clerke commanded . Cook's lieutenants included John Gore and James King. William Bligh was the master. William Anderson was the surgeon (and also served as the voyage's botanist), William Bayly was the astronomer, and the official artist was John Webber. Among the midshipmen was George Vancouver. Welshman David Samwell served as the surgeon's mate.\nTahiti and Hawaii.\nThe third expedition began by sailing south from England, around South Africa into the Indian Ocean, where they stopped, in December 1776, at the desolate Kerguelen Island. On the shore, the crew discovered a message in a bottle that had been left in 1774 by the French explorer Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr\u00e9marec. Cook appended details of his own visit to the note, raised the British flag, and gave the island its current name.\nContinuing eastward to New Zealand, they anchored in February 1777 near the location where ten crew members of \"Adventure\" had been killed during the second voyage. Despite knowledge of the deaths, Cook treated the M\u0101ori with respect, even inviting them into his cabin. Some members of Cook's crew were confused and angered by their leader's failure to take revenge.\nThe expedition then completed its first objective by returning Mai to his homeland of Tahiti. While on Tahiti, Cook was allowed to observe a multi-day ritual involving a human sacrifice. In October 1777, on the Tahitian island of Mo'orea, a goat belonging to the expedition was stolen by a local inhabitant. Cook organised a large search party and spent two days conducting an intensive search, destroying a large number of canoes and huts, until the goat was returned. Although several members of his crew considered the retaliation excessive, Cook did not record his reasoning for the destruction.\nThey continued northward and\u00a0\u2013 after a brief stop at Kiritimati\u00a0\u2013 became the first recorded Europeans to see the Hawaiian Islands, on 18 January 1778. During this first visit to Hawaii they made landfall at two locations: Waimea harbour on the island of Kaua\u02bbi, and the nearby island of Ni\u02bbihau. When he first stepped ashore, the Hawaiians prostrated themselves in front of Cook. One of Cook's crew, John Williamson, shot and killed a Hawaiian man while ashore collecting provisions, infuriating Cook. On Ni\u02bbihau, Cook left a pair of pigs for breeding, and pumpkin, melon, and onion seeds\u00a0\u2013 continuing a practice he had followed on various islands throughout his voyages. Cook observed remarkable similarities between the cultures of Hawaii and Tahiti, including language, marae structures, religion, and treatment of the dead. He named the archipelago the \"Sandwich Islands\" after the fourth Earl of Sandwich\u00a0\u2013 the First Lord of the Admiralty.\nNorth America.\nFrom Hawaii, Cook sailed north-east to reach the west coast of North America and begin his search for a North-West Passage. He sighted the Oregon coast at approximately latitude 44\u00b030\u2032N, naming it Cape Foulweather, after the bad weather which forced his ships south to about 43\u00b0N before they could begin their exploration of the coast northward. He unwittingly sailed past the Strait of Juan de Fuca and soon after entered Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. Cook's two ships remained in Nootka Sound from 29 March to 26 April 1778, in a cove at the south end of Bligh Island. After leaving Nootka Sound, Cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the Bering Strait, on the way identifying what came to be known as Cook Inlet in Alaska.\nBy the second week of August 1778, Cook had sailed through the Bering Strait, crossed the Arctic Circle, and sailed into the Chukchi Sea. He headed north-east up the coast of Alaska until he was blocked by sea ice at latitude 70\u00b041\u2032N. Cook then sailed west to the Siberian coast, and then south-east down the Siberian coast back to the Bering Strait. During this voyage, Cook charted the majority of the North American north-west coastline for the first time, determined the extent of Alaska, and closed the gap between earlier explorations of the north Pacific: Russian from the west, and Spanish from the south. By early September 1778 he was back in the Bering Sea on his way to return to Hawaii.\nCook became increasingly tired, harsh and volatile during his final voyage. Tensions between Cook and his crew increased, his reprisals against crew members and indigenous people were more severe, and some officers began to question his judgement.\nReturn to Hawaii.\nCook returned to Hawaii in late November 1778, stopping first in Maui. The ships sailed around the eastern portion of the archipelago for seven weeks, surveying and trading. Cook made landfall at Kealakekua Bay on Hawai\u02bbi Island\u00a0\u2013 the largest island in the archipelago\u00a0\u2013 where the ships were met by 10,000 Hawaiians and 1,000 canoes. On Hawai\u02bbi Island, Cook met with the Hawaiian king Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu, who treated Cook with respect, and invited him to participate in several ceremonies. The king and Cook exchanged gifts and names, and the king presented Cook with a feathered cloak. Several members of the expedition speculated that Hawaiians thought Cook was a deity. Later scholars confirmed the suspicions, and concluded that Hawaiians considered Cook to be the Polynesian god Lono. Cook's arrival coincided with the \"Makahiki\", a Hawaiian harvest festival of worship for Lono. Some scholars believe that the form of HMS \"Resolution\"\u00a0\u2013 specifically, the mast formation, sails and rigging\u00a0\u2013 resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship.\nDeath.\nAfter a month on Hawai\u02bbi Island, Cook set sail to resume his exploration of the northern Pacific, but shortly after departure a strong gale caused \"Resolution\"'s foremast to break, so the ships returned to Kealakekua Bay for repairs. Relations between the crew and the Hawaiians were already strained before the departure, and they grew worse when the ship returned for repairs. Numerous quarrels broke out and petty thefts were common. On 13 February 1779, a group of Hawaiians stole one of Cook's cutters.\nThe following day, Cook attempted to recover the cutter by kidnapping and ransoming the king, Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu. Cook and a small party marched through the village to retrieve the king. Cook led Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu away; as they got to the boats, one of Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu's favourite wives, K\u0101nekap\u014dlei, and two chiefs approached the group. They pleaded with the king not to go and a large crowd began to form at the shore. News reached the Hawaiians that a high-ranking Hawaiian chief had been shot (on the other side of the bay) while trying to break through a British blockade, which exacerbated the already tense situation. Hawaiian warriors confronted the landing party and threatened them with stones, clubs, and daggers. Cook fired a warning shot, then shot one of the Hawaiians dead. The Hawaiians continued to attack and the British fired more shots before retreating to the boats. Cook and four marines were killed in the affray and left on the shore. Seventeen Hawaiians were killed.\nAftermath.\nHawaiians took the bodies of Cook and the marines inland to a village. James King took a boat to the opposite side of the bay, and was approached by a priest who offered to intercede and ask for Cook's remains to be returned; King consented. Some crewmen returned to the shore to collect water, and skirmishes broke out, resulting in the death of several Hawaiians. On 19 February, a truce was arranged, and some of Cook's remains were returned to \"Resolution\", including several bones, the skull, some charred flesh, and the hands with the skin still attached. A large scar on the right hand\u00a0\u2013 from his 1764 powder horn injury\u00a0\u2013 confirmed that the remains belonged to Cook. The crew placed the remains in a weighted box, and buried their captain at sea.\nClerke had assumed leadership of the expedition and the ships left the bay on 23 February 1779. They spent five weeks charting the coasts of the islands\u00a0\u2013 in accordance with a plan set out by Cook before his death. They travelled through the archipelago, stopping at Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai. On 1 April they departed the Hawaiian islands and sailed north to again try to locate the North-West Passage. Clerke stopped in Kamchatka and entrusted Cook's journal, with a cover letter describing Cook's death, to the local military commander, Magnus von Behm. Behm had the package delivered, overland, from Siberia to England. The Admiralty, and all of England, learned of Cook's death when the package arrived in London\u00a0\u2013 eleven months after he died. The package had arrived in England before the surviving crew.\nContinuing north, the expedition returned to the Bering Strait, but was again blocked by pack ice, and they were unable to discover a North-West Passage. Clerke died of tuberculosis on 22 August 1779 and John Gore, a veteran of Cook's first voyage, took command of \"Resolution\" and the expedition. James King replaced Gore in command of \"Discovery\". The ships returned home, reaching England on 4 October 1780.\nScience, technology, and seamanship.\nCook's seamanship and navigation skills enabled him to lead three expeditions which travelled tens of thousands of miles across mostly uncharted oceans and successfully gathered vast amounts of scientific and geographic knowledge, without the loss of a single ship. His three voyages vastly expanded Europeans' knowledge of the Pacific Ocean, and revealed the existence of several lands and cultures previously unknown to Europeans, including the Hawaiian archipelago.\nSignificant observations and discoveries were made by the scientists that Cook carried on each of his voyages: naturalists on the first voyage collected over 3,000 plant species; and those on the second voyage published \"Observations Made During a Voyage Round the World\", one of the first works which utilised a modern, interdisciplinary approach to geography. Cook and Banks were among the first Europeans to interact with a wide variety of cultures in the Pacific. They identified similarities between peoples and languages across many Pacific Islands, leading them to suggest that the populations shared a common origin in Asia.\nCook was an expert surveyor, cartographer, and hydrographer, and was well-versed in the use of instruments such as the theodolite, plane table, and sextant. The charts of Newfoundland compiled by Cook were more accurate than new charts produced by the Royal Navy one hundred years later. The charting skills he displayed in Newfoundland were a significant factor in his selection to lead the first Pacific voyage.\nCook's naval career coincided with the advent of practical methods of determining longitude. On his first voyage, Cook took with him the 1768 and 1769 editions of the recently developed \"Nautical Almanac\", which significantly reduced the time taken to calculate longitude from lunar distance observations. The data in the almanacs only reached a few years into the future, and each of Cook's voyages lasted longer than the data in the almanac\u00a0\u2013 so the crew had to revert to using slower calculations near the end of the voyages.\nOn his second and third voyages, Cook carried Larcum Kendall's K1 chronometer\u00a0\u2013 a copy of John Harrison's H4\u00a0\u2013 to test if it could accurately keep time for extended periods while withstanding the violent motions of a ship and the temperature changes of different climates. It performed well and thus made a key contribution to solving the longitude problem that had plagued mariners for centuries. Cook praised the timepiece profusely.\nHealth and disease.\nCook was among the pioneers in the early efforts to prevent scurvy, implementing various strategies including the provision of wort to the crew and the regular resupply of fresh food during voyages. During his first circumnavigation of the globe he did not lose a single crew member to the disease\u00a0\u2013 an uncommon outcome at the time. In addition to diet, Cook also promoted general hygiene by having the crew wash themselves frequently and air out their bedding, clothes, and quarters. He presented a paper on scurvy prevention to the Royal Society, and he was awarded their prestigious Copley Medal for contributions to medical and naval science.\nIndigenous peoples.\nConflict and cooperation.\nIn his three Pacific voyages, Cook encountered numerous indigenous peoples, many with little or no previous contact with Europeans. Cook's instructions from the Admiralty required him to cultivate friendships with indigenous peoples, treat them with civility, trade with them for provisions, and to report on the natural products of their lands and the \"genius, temper, disposition and number\" of the people. Before the first voyage the Royal Society advised Cook that he should avoid violence against indigenous people, use lethal force only as a last resort, and\u00a0\u2013 after tempers had calmed\u00a0\u2013 explain to them that the British considered them the \"Lords of the Country\".\nUpon initial contact with an indigenous people, Cook usually sought to establish amicable relations by engaging in local friendship rituals such as gift-giving, exchanging names, presenting green boughs, or \"hongi\" (rubbing noses). He also relied on his Polynesian ship guests\u00a0\u2013 Tupaia, Hitihiti, and Mai\u00a0\u2013 to act as interpreters, advisers, and cultural intermediaries.\nThe anthropologist Nicholas Thomas argues that despite Cook's peaceful intentions, violence was sometimes inevitable when indigenous people resisted contact by the British. Following a violent encounter in 1774, Cook wrote, \"we attempt to land in a peaceable manner, if this succeeds it's well, if not we land nevertheless and maintain the footing we thus got by the Superiority of our fire arms, in what other light can they than at first look upon us but as invaders of their Country\".\nWhen conflict was likely, Cook implemented measures to minimise harm, such as instructing his crew to first fire warning shots, and to load their firearms with small shot, which was generally non-lethal. When Cook was not present, his crew sometimes disobeyed his orders and changed their weapons to use more fatal musket balls.\nThe level of violence fluctuated throughout the three voyages. Many encounters were almost entirely peaceful while in other cases generally friendly relations were punctuated by sporadic violence. Overall, at least 45 indigenous people were killed by Cook's crew, including two killed by Cook. Fifteen of the crew were killed by indigenous people, including Cook himself. The worst incidents of deadly violence occurred in New Zealand during the first and second voyages, and in Hawaii during the third voyage.\nThe British often resorted to violence when they felt threatened or believed that indigenous people were engaging in theft or dishonest trade. Cook generally overlooked minor thefts, but punished thefts of official property\u00a0\u2013 especially essential equipment\u00a0\u2013 more severely. To avoid excessive bloodshed he usually responded to thefts with warning shots, floggings, the seizure of canoes, or by holding indigenous leaders hostage until the stolen items were returned. Cook was criticised by various crew members for being too lenient in his punishment of indigenous people for violence, theft, and defiance. Local indigenous people and Cook's Polynesian advisers sometimes encouraged him to impose more severe punishments on other indigenous groups or commoners.\nThese advisers were dismayed when\u00a0\u2013 during the third voyage\u00a0\u2013 he refused to punish the M\u0101ori group that killed ten crew members of \"Adventure\". Cook's handling of the incident also caused resentment among crew members. Subsequently he increasingly resorted to harsher non-lethal punishments against indigenous people\u00a0\u2013 which some crew members considered excessive. These measures included the destruction of canoes and dwellings, extreme floggings, and cropping their ears.\nCook's ceremonial friendships with Polynesian high chiefs sometimes caused tensions. While they brought Cook prestige among the local population and a place in their culture, they involved cultural obligations\u00a0\u2013 such as generous gift-giving, defending local customs, avenging insults, and acting as an ally against the chief's enemies\u00a0\u2013 which Cook did not always fully understand and which embroiled him in internal politics. Cook's need to gather supplies of food, water and timber during his stays caused tension with the local population when he arrived during seasonal scarcity, or in areas ravaged by wars, or when chiefs withheld supplies for political reasons.\nCook and his crew caused offence when they inadvertently or deliberately violated customs involving rituals, shrines, high chiefs, and sacred wildlife. Cook's actions in taking high chiefs hostage for the return of stolen goods caused particular offence and almost resulted in violence in Tonga and Tahiti before the deadly violence in Hawaii.\nCook as chief or deity.\nCook was considered by some indigenous peoples to be an \"ariki\" (high chief), and therefore the embodiment of the powers and attributes of certain \"atua\" (Polynesian gods). Cook's status as a \"ariki\" in much of Polynesia was due to his leadership role when making contact with indigenous people, the deference crew members displayed towards him, the power of the weapons he commanded, and the respect he gained by becoming ceremonial friends with local chiefs. Ceremonial friendships typically involved Cook and a chief exchanging genealogies, names, and symbols of their status (for example, uniforms and weapons), by which their ancestries and \"mana\" (life force) would be merged. In Hawaii, Cook's status as an \"akua\" (the Hawaiian version of \"atua\") derived partly from the time and manner of his arrival during his second visit in late 1778. Many Hawaiians thought Cook was an embodiment of the Polynesian god Lono.\nTrading and commerce.\nCook's orders instructed him to barter with indigenous peoples to replenish his ship's provisions. When bartering, Cook primarily received food from the indigenous peoples, including fish, pigs, plantains, bananas, coconuts, and breadfruit. In return Cook gave items such as iron nails, beads, copper, knives, and cloth. The crew also bartered individually with indigenous peoples, often to purchase \"curiosities\", hatchets, and other souvenirs, and also for sex.\nCook carried a wide variety of livestock on his ships including pigs, goats, cattle, horses, rabbits, turkeys, and sheep. The ships also carried cats and dogs as pets. The livestock were used for a variety of purposes: for consumption by the crew, to place onto lands they visited to establish breeding pairs, and to give to indigenous individuals as gifts.\nCook also brought plants and seeds on his ships, and planted gardens on several islands. The plants included wheat, carrots, peas, mustard, cabbages, strawberry, parsley, potatoes, oranges, lemons, pomelo, limes, watermelons, turnips, onions, beans, and parsnip. The crops were intended for the benefit of the indigenous peoples, and also to feed future British visitors. The crew also planted pineapple and grape (from vines planted earlier by Spaniards) that were obtained from Pacific islands.\nCross-cultural exchanges.\nCook's expeditions resulted in considerable cultural exchanges with the indigenous peoples of the Pacific region. Several members of his crew learnt to speak Polynesian languages, and Polynesian words such as \"tabu\" (taboo) and \"tatu\" (tattoo) entered the English language. Crew members called Cook's fits of anger \"\" (the Tahitian word for a public performance), and they called Cook \"Toote\" (the Tahitian transliteration of his name). Many Polynesians also learnt some English, Tupaia and Mai becoming fairly proficient. \"Cookees\" became a Tahitian word for Europeans.\nPolynesians adopted some European foods and Cook's crew also developed a taste for local foods. Dog was a common food in Polynesia and Cook's crew came to eat it with enjoyment. The M\u0101ori enjoyed the ship's salted meat and Mai tried to produce wine on his island. Cook brought European livestock and crops to the Pacific and brought exotic plants back to England.\nCook's crew embraced the practice of tattooing, which later became a tradition among sailors worldwide. Tahitians extended the meaning of their word \"tatau\" to include European writing. Polynesians admired the work of the crew's artists and Tupaia learnt to draw and paint in the English style. Tahitians, Tongans and Hawaiians staged boxing and wrestling matches in which crew members sometimes participated, and they often exchanged musical performances and dancing.\nSeveral Polynesians joined Cook's expeditions as ship guests. Tupaia advised Banks on Polynesian culture and explained Polynesian navigational methods to Cook, helping him make a chart of South Pacific islands. Mai, in his two years in England, became a celebrity and an unofficial cultural ambassador for his homeland. On his return to the Tahitian islands he attempted to spread knowledge of England.\nCook and his officers attended Polynesian ceremonies and sacred rituals while Polynesians, in turn, occasionally observed and participated in the British religious services and burials. When one crew member died in Hawaii the Hawaiian priests agreed that he should be buried in their local shrine and they turned the funeral into as cross-cultural ritual. After Cook's death, his memory and physical remains were incorporated into Hawaiian rituals for decades.\nMany Polynesians became friends or lovers with their visitors, and some crew members attempted desertion to be with their Polynesian lovers. Cook entered into ceremonial friendships with Polynesian chiefs for practical reasons but also developed emotional attachments to some of them.\nEuropean knowledge of the indigenous cultures of the Pacific region increased with the publication of accounts of the voyages. These accounts were popular but spread some misconceptions about indigenous peoples. The art of the voyages also proved popular, many works being reproduced in cheap editions and as book illustrations. The artists strove for scientific accuracy but sometimes distorted actual events and fostered a particularly European vision of the Pacific and its cultures.\nHealth and sexual relations.\nMany European explorers\u00a0\u2013 including members of Cook's crews\u00a0\u2013 carried communicable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, malaria, dysentery, smallpox, influenza, and hepatitis. These diseases caused a significant decline in some local populations, who often had no natural resistance. Cook's crews transmitted some of these diseases to indigenous peoples in Tahiti, Hawaii, British Columbia, and New Zealand. In Hawaii, Cook's crews were the first Europeans to introduce some diseases to the local population.\nSexual mores differed greatly between Britain and the places visited by Cook. Of Hawaii, the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins writes: \"We can see why Hawaiians are so interested in sex. Sex was everything: rank, power, wealth, land, and the security of all these.\" Most sexual encounters were consensual, but they often involved payment in the form of trinkets, feathers, or iron nails. In Hawaii, some women believed that sex with white men would increase their \"mana\" (spiritual power). In New Zealand during the second voyage, M\u0101ori men forced women to have sex with the crewmen.\nCook took measures to mitigate the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including issuing orders that prohibited women from boarding his ships and instructing his crew to refrain from sexual relations with indigenous women. In Hawaii he specifically ordered that \"no woman was to board either of the ships\" and that any crew member known to have an STD was forbidden from engaging in sexual activity, stating these directives were intended \"to prevent as much as possible the communicating [of] this fatal disease to a set of innocent people\". However, Cook's orders were frequently disregarded by members of his crew.\nCook's observations.\nCook's instructions required him to report on the indigenous peoples he encountered. Over time he developed an interest in their cultures and his observations became more sophisticated as he attempted to understand cultural differences and describe them in a detached manner.\nCook described the M\u0101ori as brave, noble, open, benevolent, devoid of treachery, and having few vices. He believed that Aboriginal Australians were happier than Europeans because they enjoyed social equality in a warm climate and were provided with all the necessities of life, and therefore had no need of trade with Britain (see the manuscript page). While such views partly reflected Enlightenment ideas of the noble savage living in a state of nature, they were contrary to the popular notion in Britain and among Cook's crew members that indigenous people were savages living in societies inferior to British civilisation.\nCook sometimes questioned the idea that contact with Europeans would benefit indigenous people. In 1773 he wrote: \"we debauch their Morals already too prone to vice and we introduce among them wants and perhaps diseases which they never before knew and which serves only to disturb that happy tranquility they and their fore Fathers had enjoyed. If any one denies the truth of this assertion let him tell me what the Natives of the whole extent of America have gained by the commerce they have had with Europeans.\"\nWhereas his crew saw the cannibalism of the M\u0101ori as a sign of their savagery, Cook viewed it as merely a custom that they would discard when they became more united and less prone to internal wars. He reported that the Polynesian peoples shared a common ancestry, a tradition of long sea voyages, and had developed into different nations over time. According to Thomas, his comments reflect a more historical and less idealised approach to understanding indigenous cultures than was common in this period.\nCook sought to refute misconceptions about indigenous peoples. His comments on Aboriginal Australians were a rebuttal of William Dampier's disparaging account. He corrected Bougainville's implication that all property on Tahiti was communally owned, noting that fruit trees belonged to individuals. He countered the British belief in the promiscuity of Tahitian women, arguing that while they had a different attitude to sex, married women and many unmarried women did not provide sex for gifts. Nevertheless, Cook himself sometimes used derogatory terms for indigenous people and made adverse judgements without observing their cultures closely and questioning them on their practices and beliefs.\nPersonal life and character.\nOn 21 December 1762, Cook married Elizabeth Batts at St Margaret's Church, Barking, Essex. She was the daughter of Samuel Batts, keeper of the Bell Inn in Wapping and one of Cook's mentors. When not at sea, Cook lived in the East End of London and attended St Paul's Church, Shadwell.\nThe couple had six children. Four were born before the first voyage: James (1763\u200d\u2013\u200d1794), Nathaniel (1764\u200d\u2013\u200d1780), Elizabeth (1767\u200d\u2013\u200d1771), and Joseph (1768\u200d\u2013\u200d1768). George (1772\u200d\u2013\u200d1772) was born before the second voyage, and Hugh (1776\u200d\u2013\u200d1793) was born before the third voyage. Cook has no direct descendants \u2013 all of his children died before having children of their own. \nSix years after Cook's death, his widow petitioned for a coat of arms to preserve the memory of her late husband and to be placed on monuments and memorials. The coat of arms was granted in September 1785 and is the only known example of a posthumously granted coat of arms.\nThe historian John Beaglehole characterises Cook as profoundly competent, a man of action, obedient, patient, persistent, ambitious (but not overly so), and hot tempered when confronted with incompetence or disobedience. Cook did not often confide in fellow officers about his private thoughts or plans; nor did he make major decisions by consensus. Cook was not religious, mystical, romantic, or dramatic. The anthropologist Anne Salmond, based on the journals of Heinrich Zimmermann, describes Cook as chaste with regard to women, strict, and frugal. He did not swear or get drunk, and did not tolerate priests aboard his ships. He was fearless and calm in times of danger. Nicholas Thomas writes that Cook could demonstrate self-denial when needed, and he practised celibacy on voyages. He could sense the mood of his crew, but he could also be obstinate, even when flexibility was called for.\nLegacy.\nCommemorations.\nImportant monuments to Cook include one in the church of St Andrew the Great in Cambridge, where his wife and two of his sons are buried, and statues of Cook in Hyde Park in Sydney, and at St Kilda in Melbourne. \nThe Royal Research Ship RRS \"James Cook\" was built in 2006, and serves in the UK's Royal Research Fleet. NASA named several spacecraft after Cook's ships. Cook has appeared on many stamps and coins: Over four hundred stamps have been issued in his honour, and dozens of coins have been issued with Cook's image. Many institutions are named after him, including James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, and James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, England.\nSince 1959, an annual reenactment of Cook's 1770 landing has been held near the site of the original event in Cooktown, with the support and participation of many of the local Guugu Yimithirr people. The reenactments celebrate an act of reconciliation when a local elder presented Cook with a broken-tipped spear as a peace offering, after a conflict over sharing green turtles which Cook's men had taken in violation of local custom.\nIn the years surrounding the 250th anniversary of Cook's first voyage of exploration, various memorials to Cook in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Hawaii were vandalised, and there were public calls for their removal or modification due to their perceived association with British colonialism.\nEthnographic collections.\nThe largest collection of artefacts from Cook's voyages is the Cook-Forster Collection held at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany. The Australian Museum in Sydney holds over 250 objects associated with Cook's voyages. The objects are mostly from Polynesia, although there are also artefacts from the Solomon Islands, North America and South America.\nIndigenous people have campaigned for the return of indigenous artefacts taken during Cook's voyages. The art historian Alice Proctor argues that the controversies over public representations of Cook and the display of indigenous artefacts from his voyages are part of a broader debate over resistance to colonialist narratives and the decolonisation of museums and public spaces.\nReputation and influence.\nWhen news of Cook's death reached Britain and continental Europe, obituaries, poems and tributes emphasised his humble birth, technical skills, leadership qualities, contributions to science and trade, and his concern for the well-being of his crew and indigenous people. William Cowper and Goethe wrote tributes, and there were many theatrical and artistic representations of his death.\nOne of the earliest monuments to Cook in the United Kingdom was erected in 1780 at The Vache by Hugh Palliser, a friend of Cook. In 1780 Joseph Banks, now president of the Royal Society, publicised Cook's legacy, and he had the society mint a commemorative medal. Praise for Cook was almost universal in England, although Alexander Dalrymple (a rival of Cook for leadership of the first voyage) remarked on the adulation of Cook: \"I cannot admit of a Pope in Geography or Navigation\". There were no notable commemorations in England to mark the centenary of Cook\u2019s death in 1879.\nBanks used the fame surrounding Cook's voyages to help promote a new colony in Australia, and in 1788 the First Fleet arrived in what is now Sydney. After Britain established colonies in Australia and New Zealand, the colonists began to consider Cook as a founding father. In 1822, the Philosophical Society of Australia placed a monument at Cook\u2019s supposed landing place in Botany Bay. The treatment, with overtly heroic overtones, of Cook as a founder continued in the early 1900s when the Commonwealth of Australia was established.\nEuropean visitors to Hawaii in the decades following Cook's death found many Hawaiians carrying fond memories of Cook. In the 1830s American missionaries in Hawaii discovered that Cook had been worshiped as a kind of deity, and embarked on a campaign to disparage his memory. An early written history of Hawaii was derived from Hawaiian oral histories by missionary Sheldon Dibble. It portrayed Cook as an idolator and spreader of STDs, and greatly influenced native Hawaiian historians. \nThe bicentennial of Cook's voyages in the 1970s brought a resurgence of interest and numerous commemorations. In the late 20th century increasing attention was given to the perspectives of Indigenous peoples and public discourse began to acknowledge the detrimental impacts of European contact on Indigenous communities.\nIn the 21st century Cook is widely regarded as one of the greatest sea explorers. His voyages greatly expanded geographical knowledge and paved the way for later British engagement in the Pacific. But for many people \u2013 particularly indigenous people of the lands he visited \u2013 he is a symbol of the adverse consequences of European contact and colonisation. Critics, such as the Native Hawaiian scholar Haunani-Kay Trask, highlight violent encounters, the spread of infectious diseases, and the claiming of indigenous lands without consent. The scholars Robert Tombs, Nicholas Thomas, and Glyndwr Williams\u00a0\u2013 while acknowledging the negative impacts of the expeditions\u00a0\u2013 contend that Cook should not be held responsible for the consequences of colonialist policies that were initiated after his death.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks and journals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWebsites and newspapers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWebsites and newspapers (author unknown).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

He was also responsible for inventing \"wove paper\", which was considerably smoother than \"laid paper\", allowing for sharper printing results.\nLife.\nBaskerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster in Worcestershire, and baptised on 28 January 1706OS(1707 NS) at Wolverley church. Baskerville established an early career teaching handwriting, and is known to have offered his services cutting gravestones (a demonstration slab by him survives in the Library of Birmingham) before making a considerable fortune from the manufacture of lacquerwork items (japanning).\nHe practised as a printer in Birmingham, England. Baskerville was a member of the Royal Society of Arts, and an associate of some of the members of the Lunar Society. \nBaskerville directed his punchcutter, John Handy, in the design of many typefaces of broadly similar appearance. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a fellow printer, but were criticised by jealous competitors and soon fell out of favour. He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and leading between each line.\nIn 1757, Baskerville published a remarkable quarto edition of Virgil on wove paper, using his own type. It took three years to complete, but it made such an impact that he was appointed printer to the University of Cambridge the following year. An atheist, he nonetheless printed \"The Book of Common Prayer\" in 1762 and a splendid folio Bible in 1763. \nBaskerville innovated in printing, paper, and ink production. He worked with paper maker James Whatman to produce a smoother whiter paper, sometimes called wove paper, which showcased his strong black type.\nDeath and interments.\nBaskerville died in January 1775 at his home, \"Easy Hill\". He requested that his body be placed\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in a Conical Building in my own premises Hearetofore used as a mill which I have lately Raised Higher and painted and in a vault which I have prepared for It. This Doubtless to many may appear a Whim perhaps It is so\u2014But it is a whim for many years Resolve'd upon, as I have a Hearty Contempt for all Superstition the Farce of a Consecrated Ground the Irish Barbarism of Sure and Certain Hopes &amp;c I also consider Revelation as it is call'd Exclusive of the Scraps of Morality casually Intermixt with It to be the most Impudent Abuse of Common Sense which Ever was Invented to Befool Mankind.\nHowever, in 1821 a canal was built through the land and his body was placed on show by the landowner until Baskerville's family and friends arranged to have it moved to the crypt of Christ Church, Birmingham. Christ Church was demolished in 1897 so his remains were then moved, with other bodies from the crypt, to consecrated catacombs at Warstone Lane Cemetery. In 1963 a petition was presented to Birmingham City Council requesting that he be reburied in unconsecrated ground, according to his wishes.\nLegacy.\nThe 20th century renewed interest in and appreciation for Baskerville's typefaces. His most notable typeface, Baskerville, is held to represent the peak of transitional type face and a bridge between Old Style and Modern type design. Since the 1920s, many fonts based on his work\u2014mostly called 'Baskerville'\u2014 have been released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries. In 1996, Emigre released a popular revival of this typeface called Mrs Eaves after Baskerville's wife, Sarah Eaves. \nCommemoration.\nIn the 1930s, Baskerville House was built on the grounds of \"Easy Hill\".\nIn 1947, BBC radio broadcast a radio play about his burial, named \"Hic Jacet: or The Corpse in the Crescent\" by Neville Brandon Watts. The original recording was not preserved but a performance was staged by students at the Birmingham School of Acting in 2013 at the Typographic Hub Centre of Birmingham City University. A copy of the script is in the Norman Painting Archives at the University of Birmingham.\nA Portland stone sculpture of the Baskerville typeface, \"Industry and Genius\", in his honour stands in front of Baskerville House in Centenary Square, Birmingham. It was created by local artist David Patten in 1990.\nGallery.\nSome examples of volumes published by Baskerville.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
