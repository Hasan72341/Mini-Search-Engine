{"id": "7252", "revid": "18174831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7252", "title": "Cell cycle", "text": "Events leading to cell division\nThe cell cycle, or cell-division cycle, is the sequential series of events that take place in a cell that causes it to divide into two daughter cells. These events include the growth of the cell, duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) and some of its organelles, and subsequently the partitioning of its cytoplasm, chromosomes and other components into two daughter cells in a process called cell division.\nIn eukaryotic cells (having a cell nucleus) including animal, plant, fungal, and protist cells, the cell cycle is divided into two main stages: interphase, and the M phase that includes mitosis and cytokinesis. During interphase, the cell grows, accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis, and replicates its DNA and some of its organelles. During the M phase, the replicated chromosomes, organelles, and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells. To ensure the proper replication of cellular components and division, there are control mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints after each of the key steps of the cycle that determine if the cell can progress to the next phase.\nIn cells without nuclei the prokaryotes, bacteria and archaea, the cell cycle is divided into the B, C, and D periods. The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication. DNA replication occurs during the C period. The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells.\nIn single-celled organisms, a single cell-division cycle is how the organism reproduces to ensure its survival. In multicellular organisms such as plants and animals, a series of cell-division cycles is how the organism develops from a single-celled fertilized egg into a mature organism, and is also the process by which hair, skin, blood cells, and some internal organs are regenerated and healed (with possible exception of nerves; see nerve damage). After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the interphase of a new cell cycle. Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of the cell division.\nPhases.\nThe eukaryotic cell cycle consists of four distinct phases: G1 phase, S phase (synthesis), G2 phase (collectively known as interphase) and M phase (mitosis and cytokinesis). M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: mitosis, in which the cell's nucleus divides, and cytokinesis, in which the cell's cytoplasm and cell membrane divides forming two daughter cells. Activation of each phase is dependent on the proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of quiescence known as G0 phase or \"resting phase\".\nG0 phase (quiescence).\nG0 is a resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing. The cell cycle starts with this phase. Non-proliferative (non-dividing) cells in multicellular eukaryotes generally enter the quiescent G0 state from G1 and may remain quiescent for long periods of time, possibly indefinitely (as is often the case for neurons). This is very common for cells that are fully differentiated. Some cells enter the G0 phase semi-permanently and are considered post-mitotic, e.g., some liver, kidney, and stomach cells. Many cells do not enter G0 and continue to divide throughout an organism's life, e.g., epithelial cells.\nThe word \"post-mitotic\" is sometimes used to refer to both quiescent and senescent cells. Cellular senescence occurs in response to DNA damage and external stress and usually constitutes an arrest in G1. Cellular senescence may make a cell's progeny nonviable; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self-destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis.\nInterphase.\nInterphase represents the phase between two successive M phases. Interphase is a series of changes that takes place in a newly formed cell and its nucleus before it becomes capable of division again. It is also called preparatory phase or intermitosis. Typically interphase lasts for at least 91% of the total time required for the cell cycle.\nInterphase proceeds in three stages, G1, S, and G2, followed by the cycle of mitosis and cytokinesis. The cell's nuclear DNA contents are duplicated during S phase.\nG1 phase (First growth phase or Post mitotic gap phase).\nThe first phase within interphase, from the end of the previous M phase until the beginning of DNA synthesis, is called G1 (G indicating \"gap\"). It is also called the growth phase. During this phase, the biosynthetic activities of the cell, which are considerably slowed down during M phase, resume at a high rate. The duration of G1 is highly variable, even among different cells of the same species. In this phase, the cell increases its supply of proteins, increases the number of organelles (such as mitochondria, ribosomes), and grows in size. In G1 phase, a cell has three options. \nThe deciding point is called check point (Restriction point). This check point is called the restriction point or START and is regulated by G1/S cyclins, which cause transition from G1 to S phase. Passage through the G1 check point commits the cell to division.\nS phase (DNA replication).\nThe ensuing S phase starts when DNA synthesis commences; when it is complete, all of the chromosomes have been replicated, i.e., each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids. Thus, during this phase, the amount of DNA in the cell has doubled, though the ploidy and number of chromosomes are unchanged. Rates of RNA transcription and protein synthesis are very low during this phase. An exception to this is histone production, most of which occurs during the S phase.\nG2 phase (growth).\nG2 phase occurs after DNA replication and is a period of protein synthesis and rapid cell growth to prepare the cell for mitosis. During this phase microtubules begin to reorganize to form a spindle (preprophase). Before proceeding to mitotic phase, cells must be checked at the G2 checkpoint for any DNA damage within the chromosomes. The G2 checkpoint is mainly regulated by the tumor protein p53. If the DNA is damaged, p53 will either repair the DNA or trigger the apoptosis of the cell. If p53 is dysfunctional or mutated, cells with damaged DNA may continue through the cell cycle, leading to the development of cancer.\nMitotic phase (chromosome separation).\nThe relatively brief \"M phase\" consists of nuclear division (karyokinesis) and division of cytoplasm (cytokinesis). M phase is complex and highly regulated. The sequence of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities and the start of the next. These phases are sequentially known as:\nMitosis is the process by which a eukaryotic cell separates the chromosomes in its cell nucleus into two identical sets in two nuclei. During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense (chromosome condensation) and attach to microtubules that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell.\nMitosis occurs exclusively in eukaryotic cells, but occurs in different ways in different species. For example, animal cells undergo an \"open\" mitosis, where the nuclear envelope breaks down before the chromosomes separate, while fungi such as \"Aspergillus nidulans\" and \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" (yeast) undergo a \"closed\" mitosis, where chromosomes divide within an intact cell nucleus.\nCytokinesis phase (separation of all cell components).\nMitosis is immediately followed by cytokinesis, which divides the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Cytokinesis occurs differently in plant and animal cells. While the cell membrane forms a groove that gradually deepens to separate the cytoplasm in animal cells, a cell plate is formed to separate it in plant cells. The position of the cell plate is determined by the position of a preprophase band of microtubules and actin filaments. Mitosis and cytokinesis together define the division of the parent cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical to each other and to their parent cell. This accounts for approximately 10% of the cell cycle.\nBecause cytokinesis usually occurs in conjunction with mitosis, \"mitosis\" is often used interchangeably with \"M phase\". However, there are many cells where mitosis and cytokinesis occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei in a process called endoreplication. This occurs most notably among the fungi and slime molds, but is found in various groups. Even in animals, cytokinesis and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of fruit fly embryonic development. Errors in mitosis can result in cell death through apoptosis or cause mutations that may lead to cancer.\nRegulation of eukaryotic cell cycle.\nRegulation of the cell cycle involves processes crucial to the survival of a cell, including the detection and repair of genetic damage as well as the prevention of uncontrolled cell division. The molecular events that control the cell cycle are ordered and directional; that is, each process occurs in a sequential fashion and it is impossible to \"reverse\" the cycle.\nRole of cyclins and CDKs.\nTwo key classes of regulatory molecules, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine a cell's progress through the cell cycle. Leland H. Hartwell, R. Timothy Hunt, and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules. Many of the genes encoding cyclins and CDKs are conserved among all eukaryotes, but in general, more complex organisms have more elaborate cell cycle control systems that incorporate more individual components. Many of the relevant genes were first identified by studying yeast, especially \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\"; genetic nomenclature in yeast dubs many of these genes \"cdc\" (for \"cell division cycle\") followed by an identifying number, e.g. \"cdc25\" or \"cdc20\".\nCyclins form the regulatory subunits and CDKs the catalytic subunits of an activated heterodimer; cyclins have no catalytic activity and CDKs are inactive in the absence of a partner cyclin. When activated by a bound cyclin, CDKs perform a common biochemical reaction called phosphorylation that activates or inactivates target proteins to orchestrate coordinated entry into the next phase of the cell cycle. Different cyclin-CDK combinations determine the downstream proteins targeted. CDKs are constitutively expressed in cells whereas cyclins are synthesised at specific stages of the cell cycle, in response to various molecular signals.\nGeneral mechanism of cyclin-CDK interaction.\nUpon receiving a pro-mitotic extracellular signal, G1 cyclin-CDK complexes become active to prepare the cell for S phase, promoting the expression of transcription factors that in turn promote the expression of S cyclins and of enzymes required for DNA replication. The G1 cyclin-CDK complexes also promote the degradation of molecules that function as S phase inhibitors by targeting them for ubiquitination. Once a protein has been ubiquitinated, it is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the proteasome. Results from a study of E2F transcriptional dynamics at the single-cell level argue that the role of G1 cyclin-CDK activities, in particular cyclin D-CDK4/6, is to tune the timing rather than the commitment of cell cycle entry.\nActive S cyclin-CDK complexes phosphorylate proteins that make up the pre-replication complexes assembled during G1 phase on DNA replication origins. The phosphorylation serves two purposes: to activate each already-assembled pre-replication complex, and to prevent new complexes from forming. This ensures that every portion of the cell's genome will be replicated once and only once. The reason for prevention of gaps in replication is fairly clear, because daughter cells that are missing all or part of crucial genes will die. However, for reasons related to gene copy number effects, possession of extra copies of certain genes is also deleterious to the daughter cells.\nMitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, which are synthesized but inactivated during S and G2 phases, promote the initiation of mitosis by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and mitotic spindle assembly. A critical complex activated during this process is a ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal kinetochore. APC also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, ensuring that telophase and cytokinesis can proceed.\nSpecific action of cyclin-CDK complexes.\nCyclin D is the first cyclin produced in the cells that enter the cell cycle, in response to extracellular signals (e.g. growth factors). Cyclin D levels stay low in resting cells that are not proliferating. Additionally, CDK4/6 and CDK2 are also inactive because CDK4/6 are bound by INK4 family members (e.g., p16), limiting kinase activity. Meanwhile, CDK2 complexes are inhibited by the CIP/KIP proteins such as p21 and p27, When it is time for a cell to enter the cell cycle, which is triggered by a mitogenic stimuli, levels of cyclin D increase. In response to this trigger, cyclin D binds to existing CDK4/6, forming the active cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex. Cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes in turn mono-phosphorylates the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (Rb) to pRb. The un-phosphorylated Rb tumour suppressor functions in inducing cell cycle exit and maintaining G0 arrest (senescence).\nIn the last few decades, a model has been widely accepted whereby pRB proteins are inactivated by cyclin D-Cdk4/6-mediated phosphorylation. Rb has 14+ potential phosphorylation sites. Cyclin D-Cdk 4/6 progressively phosphorylates Rb to hyperphosphorylated state, which triggers dissociation of pRB\u2013E2F complexes, thereby inducing G1/S cell cycle gene expression and progression into S phase.\nScientific observations from a study have shown that Rb is present in three types of isoforms: (1) un-phosphorylated Rb in G0 state; (2) mono-phosphorylated Rb, also referred to as \"hypo-phosphorylated' or 'partially' phosphorylated Rb in early G1 state; and (3) inactive hyper-phosphorylated Rb in late G1 state. In early G1 cells, mono-phosphorylated Rb exists as 14 different isoforms, one of each has distinct E2F binding affinity. Rb has been found to associate with hundreds of different proteins and the idea that different mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms have different protein partners was very appealing. A later report confirmed that mono-phosphorylation controls Rb's association with other proteins and generates functional distinct forms of Rb. All different mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms inhibit E2F transcriptional program and are able to arrest cells in G1-phase. Different mono-phosphorylated forms of Rb have distinct transcriptional outputs that are extended beyond E2F regulation.\nIn general, the binding of pRb to E2F inhibits the E2F target gene expression of certain G1/S and S transition genes including E-type cyclins. The partial phosphorylation of Rb de-represses the Rb-mediated suppression of E2F target gene expression, begins the expression of cyclin E. The molecular mechanism that causes the cell switched to cyclin E activation is currently not known, but as cyclin E levels rise, the active cyclin E-CDK2 complex is formed, bringing Rb to be inactivated by hyper-phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylated Rb is completely dissociated from E2F, enabling further expression of a wide range of E2F target genes are required for driving cells to proceed into S phase [1]. It has been identified that cyclin D-Cdk4/6 binds to a C-terminal alpha-helix region of Rb that is only distinguishable to cyclin D rather than other cyclins, cyclin E, A and B. This observation based on the structural analysis of Rb phosphorylation supports that Rb is phosphorylated in a different level through multiple Cyclin-Cdk complexes. This also makes feasible the current model of a simultaneous switch-like inactivation of all mono-phosphorylated Rb isoforms through one type of Rb hyper-phosphorylation mechanism. In addition, mutational analysis of the cyclin D- Cdk 4/6 specific Rb C-terminal helix shows that disruptions of cyclin D-Cdk 4/6 binding to Rb prevents Rb phosphorylation, arrests cells in G1, and bolsters Rb's functions in tumor suppressor. This cyclin-Cdk driven cell cycle transitional mechanism governs a cell committed to the cell cycle that allows cell proliferation. A cancerous cell growth often accompanies with deregulation of Cyclin D-Cdk 4/6 activity.\nThe hyperphosphorylated Rb dissociates from the E2F/DP1/Rb complex (which was bound to the E2F responsive genes, effectively \"blocking\" them from transcription), activating E2F. Activation of E2F results in transcription of various genes like cyclin E, cyclin A, DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, etc. Cyclin E thus produced binds to CDK2, forming the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, which pushes the cell from G1 to S phase (G1/S, which initiates the G2/M transition). Cyclin B-cdk1 complex activation causes breakdown of nuclear envelope and initiation of prophase, and subsequently, its deactivation causes the cell to exit mitosis. A quantitative study of E2F transcriptional dynamics at the single-cell level by using engineered fluorescent reporter cells provided a quantitative framework for understanding the control logic of cell cycle entry, challenging the canonical textbook model. Genes that regulate the amplitude of E2F accumulation, such as Myc, determine the commitment in cell cycle and S phase entry. G1 cyclin-CDK activities are not the driver of cell cycle entry. Instead, they primarily tune the timing of E2F increase, thereby modulating the pace of cell cycle progression.\nInhibitors.\nEndogenous.\nTwo families of genes, the \"cip/kip\" (\"CDK interacting protein/Kinase inhibitory protein\") family and the INK4a/ARF (\"In\"hibitor of \"K\"inase 4/\"A\"lternative \"R\"eading \"F\"rame) family, prevent the progression of the cell cycle. Because these genes are instrumental in prevention of tumor formation, they are known as tumor suppressors.\nThe \"cip/kip\" family includes the genes p21, p27 and p57. They halt the cell cycle in G1 phase by binding to and inactivating cyclin-CDK complexes. p21 is activated by p53 (which, in turn, is triggered by DNA damage e.g. due to radiation). p27 is activated by Transforming Growth Factor \u03b2 (TGF \u03b2), a growth inhibitor.\nThe INK4a/ARF family includes p16INK4a, which binds to CDK4 and arrests the cell cycle in G1 phase, and p14ARF which prevents p53 degradation.\nSynthetic.\nSynthetic inhibitors of Cdc25 could also be useful for the arrest of cell cycle and therefore be useful as antineoplastic and anticancer agents.\nMany human cancers possess the hyper-activated Cdk 4/6 activities. Given the observations of cyclin D-Cdk 4/6 functions, inhibition of Cdk 4/6 should result in preventing a malignant tumor from proliferating. Consequently, scientists have tried to invent the synthetic Cdk4/6 inhibitor as Cdk4/6 has been characterized to be a therapeutic target for anti-tumor effectiveness. Three Cdk4/6 inhibitors \u2013 palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib \u2013 currently received FDA approval for clinical use to treat advanced-stage or metastatic, hormone-receptor-positive (HR-positive, HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. For example, palbociclib is an orally active CDK4/6 inhibitor which has demonstrated improved outcomes for ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The main side effect is neutropenia which can be managed by dose reduction.\nCdk4/6 targeted therapy will only treat cancer types where Rb is expressed. Cancer cells with loss of Rb have primary resistance to Cdk4/6 inhibitors.\nTranscriptional regulatory network.\nCurrent evidence suggests that a semi-autonomous transcriptional network acts in concert with the CDK-cyclin machinery to regulate the cell cycle. Several gene expression studies in \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" have identified 800\u20131200 genes that change expression over the course of the cell cycle. They are transcribed at high levels at specific points in the cell cycle, and remain at lower levels throughout the rest of the cycle. While the set of identified genes differs between studies due to the computational methods and criteria used to identify them, each study indicates that a large portion of yeast genes are temporally regulated.\nMany periodically expressed genes are driven by transcription factors that are also periodically expressed. One screen of single-gene knockouts identified 48 transcription factors (about 20% of all non-essential transcription factors) that show cell cycle progression defects. Genome-wide studies using high throughput technologies have identified the transcription factors that bind to the promoters of yeast genes, and correlating these findings with temporal expression patterns have allowed the identification of transcription factors that drive phase-specific gene expression. The expression profiles of these transcription factors are driven by the transcription factors that peak in the prior phase, and computational models have shown that a CDK-autonomous network of these transcription factors is sufficient to produce steady-state oscillations in gene expression).\nExperimental evidence also suggests that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery. Orlando \"et al.\" used microarrays to measure the expression of a set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (\"clb1,2,3,4,5,6\"). Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells at the same time as in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between G1 and S phase. However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events. Other work indicates that phosphorylation, a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by Cdk1 may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes.\nWhile oscillatory transcription plays a key role in the progression of the yeast cell cycle, the CDK-cyclin machinery operates independently in the early embryonic cell cycle. Before the midblastula transition, zygotic transcription does not occur and all needed proteins, such as the B-type cyclins, are translated from maternally loaded mRNA.\nDNA replication and DNA replication origin activity.\nAnalyses of synchronized cultures of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" under conditions that prevent DNA replication initiation without delaying cell cycle progression showed that origin licensing decreases the expression of genes with origins near their 3' ends, revealing that downstream origins can regulate the expression of upstream genes. This confirms previous predictions from mathematical modeling of a global causal coordination between DNA replication origin activity and mRNA expression, and shows that mathematical modeling of DNA microarray data can be used to correctly predict previously unknown biological modes of regulation.\nCheckpoints.\nCell cycle checkpoints are used by the cell to monitor and regulate the progress of the cell cycle. Checkpoints prevent cell cycle progression at specific points, allowing verification of necessary phase processes and repair of DNA damage. The cell cannot proceed to the next phase until checkpoint requirements have been met. Checkpoints typically consist of a network of regulatory proteins that monitor and dictate the progression of the cell through the different stages of the cell cycle.\nIt is estimated that in normal human cells about 1% of single-strand DNA damages are converted to about 50 endogenous DNA double-strand breaks per cell per cell cycle. Although such double-strand breaks are usually repaired with high fidelity, errors in their repair are considered to contribute significantly to the rate of cancer in humans.\nThere are several checkpoints to ensure that damaged or incomplete DNA is not passed on to daughter cells. Three main checkpoints exist: the G1/S checkpoint, the G2/M checkpoint and the metaphase (mitotic) checkpoint. Another checkpoint is the Go checkpoint, in which the cells are checked for maturity. If the cells are not ready, they do not pass this checkpoint and will be discarded from dividing.\nG1/S transition is a rate-limiting step in the cell cycle and is also known as restriction point. This is where the cell checks whether it has enough raw materials to fully replicate its DNA (nucleotide bases, DNA synthase, chromatin, etc.). An unhealthy or malnourished cell will get stuck at this checkpoint.\nThe G2/M checkpoint is where the cell ensures that it has enough cytoplasm and phospholipids for two daughter cells. But sometimes more importantly, it checks to see if it is the right time to replicate. There are some situations where many cells need to all replicate simultaneously (for example, a growing embryo should have a symmetric cell distribution until it reaches the mid-blastula transition). This is done by controlling the G2/M checkpoint.\nThe metaphase checkpoint is a fairly minor checkpoint because a cell in metaphase has already committed to undergo mitosis. Nevertheless, it is important because in this checkpoint, the cell checks to ensure that the spindle has formed and that all of the chromosomes are aligned at the spindle equator before anaphase begins.\nWhile these are the three \"main\" checkpoints, not all cells have to pass through each of these checkpoints in this order to replicate. Many types of cancer are caused by mutations that allow the cells to speed through the various checkpoints or even skip them altogether, going from the S to M to S phase almost consecutively. Because these cells have lost their checkpoints, any DNA mutations that may have occurred are disregarded and passed on to the daughter cells. This is one reason why cancer cells have a tendency to exponentially acquire mutations. Aside from cancer cells, many fully differentiated cell types no longer replicate so they leave the cell cycle and stay in G0 until their death, thus removing the need for cellular checkpoints. An alternative model of the cell cycle response to DNA damage has also been proposed, known as the postreplication checkpoint.\nCheckpoint regulation plays an important role in an organism's development. In sexual reproduction, when egg fertilization occurs, when the sperm binds to the egg, it releases signalling factors that notify the egg that it has been fertilized. Among other things, this induces the now fertilized oocyte to return from its previously dormant G0 state back into the cell cycle and on to mitotic replication and division.\np53 plays an important role in triggering the control mechanisms at both G1/S and G2/M checkpoints. In addition to p53, checkpoint regulators are being heavily researched for their roles in cancer growth and proliferation.\nFluorescence imaging of the cell cycle.\nPioneering work by Atsushi Miyawaki and coworkers developed the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (http://), which enables fluorescence imaging of the cell cycle. Originally, a green fluorescent protein, mAG, was fused to hGem(1/110) and an orange fluorescent protein (mKO2) was fused to hCdt1(30/120). Note, these fusions are fragments that contain a nuclear localization signal and ubiquitination sites for degradation, but are not functional proteins. The green fluorescent protein is made during the S, G2, or M phase and degraded during the G0 or G1 phase, while the orange fluorescent protein is made during the G0 or G1 phase and destroyed during the S, G2, or M phase. A far-red and near-infrared FUCCI was developed using a cyanobacteria-derived fluorescent protein (smURFP) and a bacteriophytochrome-derived fluorescent protein (http://).\nSeveral modifications have been made to the original FUCCI system to improve its usability in several in vitro systems and model organisms. These advancements have increased the sensitivity and accuracy of cell cycle phase detection, enabling more precise assessments of cellular proliferation.\nRole in tumor formation.\nA disregulation of the cell cycle components may lead to tumor formation. As mentioned above, when some genes like the cell cycle inhibitors, RB, p53 etc. mutate, they may cause the cell to multiply uncontrollably, forming a tumor. Although the duration of cell cycle in tumor cells is equal to or longer than that of normal cell cycle, the proportion of cells that are in active cell division (versus quiescent cells in G0 phase) in tumors is much higher than that in normal tissue. Thus there is a net increase in cell number as the number of cells that die by apoptosis or senescence remains the same.\nThe cells which are actively undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage by drugs or radiation. This fact is made use of in cancer treatment; by a process known as debulking, a significant mass of the tumor is removed which pushes a significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G0 to G1 phase (due to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.\nThe fastest cycling mammalian cells in culture, crypt cells in the intestinal epithelium, have a cycle time as short as 9 to 10 hours. Stem cells in resting mouse skin may have a cycle time of more than 200 hours. Most of this difference is due to the varying length of G1, the most variable phase of the cycle. M and S do not vary much.\nIn general, cells are most radiosensitive in late M and G2 phases and most resistant in late S phase. For cells with a longer cell cycle time and a significantly long G1 phase, there is a second peak of resistance late in G1. The pattern of resistance and sensitivity correlates with the level of sulfhydryl compounds in the cell. Sulfhydryls are natural substances that protect cells from radiation damage and tend to be at their highest levels in S and at their lowest near mitosis.\nHomologous recombination (HR) is an accurate process for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. HR is nearly absent in G1 phase, is most active in S phase, and declines in G2/M. Non-homologous end joining, a less accurate and more mutagenic process for repairing double strand breaks, is active throughout the cell cycle.\nCell cycle evolution.\nEvolution of the genome.\nThe cell cycle must duplicate all cellular constituents and equally partition them into two daughter cells. Many constituents, such as proteins and ribosomes, are produced continuously throughout the cell cycle (except during M-phase). However, the chromosomes and other associated elements like MTOCs, are duplicated just once during the cell cycle. A central component of the cell cycle is its ability to coordinate the continuous and periodic duplications of different cellular elements, which evolved with the formation of the genome.\nThe pre-cellular environment contained functional and self-replicating RNAs. All RNA concentrations depended on the concentrations of other RNAs that might be helping or hindering the gathering of resources. In this environment, growth was simply the continuous production of RNAs. These pre-cellular structures would have had to contend with parasitic RNAs, issues of inheritance, and copy-number control of specific RNAs. \nPartitioning \"genomic\" RNA from \"functional\" RNA helped solve these problems. The fusion of multiple RNAs into a genome gave a template from which functional RNAs were cleaved. Now, parasitic RNAs would have to incorporate themselves into the genome, a much greater barrier, in order to survive. Controlling the copy number of genomic RNA also allowed RNA concentration to be determined through synthesis rates and RNA half-lives, instead of competition. Separating the duplication of genomic RNAs from the generation of functional RNAs allowed for much greater duplication fidelity of genomic RNAs without compromising the production of functional RNAs. Finally, the replacement of genomic RNA with DNA, which is a more stable molecule, allowed for larger genomes. The transition from self-catalysis enzyme synthesis to genome-directed enzyme synthesis was a critical step in cell evolution, and had lasting implications on the cell cycle, which must regulate functional synthesis and genomic duplication in very different ways.\nCyclin-dependent kinase and cyclin evolution.\nCell-cycle progression is controlled by the oscillating concentrations of different cyclins and the resulting molecular interactions from the various cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). In yeast, just one CDK (Cdc28 in \"S. cerevisiae\" and Cdc2 in \"S. pombe\") controls the cell cycle. However, in animals, whole families of CDKs have evolved. Cdk1 controls entry to mitosis and Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 regulate entry into S phase. Despite the evolution of the CDK family in animals, these proteins have related or redundant functions. For example, \"cdk2 cdk4 cdk6\" triple knockout mice cells can still progress through the basic cell cycle. \"cdk1\" knockouts are lethal, which suggests an ancestral CDK1-type kinase ultimately controlling the cell cycle.\n\"Arabidopsis thaliana\" has a Cdk1 homolog called CDKA;1, however \"cdka;1\" \"A. thaliana\" mutants are still viable, running counter to the opisthokont pattern of CDK1-type kinases as essential regulators controlling the cell cycle. Plants also have a unique group of B-type CDKs, whose functions may range from development-specific functions to major players in mitotic regulation.\nG1/S checkpoint evolution.\nThe G1/S checkpoint is the point at which the cell commits to division through the cell cycle. Complex regulatory networks lead to the G1/S transition decision. Across opisthokonts, there are both highly diverged protein sequences as well as strikingly similar network topologies. \nEntry into S-phase in both yeast and animals is controlled by the levels of two opposing regulators. The networks regulating these transcription factors are double-negative feedback loops and positive feedback loops in both yeast and animals. Additional regulation of the regulatory network for the G1/S checkpoint in yeast and animals includes the phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation of CDK-cyclin complexes. The sum of these regulatory networks creates a hysteretic and bistable scheme, despite the specific proteins being highly diverged. For yeast, Whi5 must be suppressed by Cln3 phosphorylation for SBF to be expressed, while in animals Rb must be suppressed by the Cdk4/6-cyclin D complex for E2F to be expressed. Both Rb and Whi5 inhibit transcript through the recruitment of histone deacetylase proteins to promoters. Both proteins additionally have multiple CDK phosphorylation sites through which they are inhibited. However, these proteins share no sequence similarity. \nStudies in \"A. thaliana\" extend our knowledge of the G1/S transition across eukaryotes as a whole. Plants also share a number of conserved network features with opisthokonts, and many plant regulators have direct animal homologs. For example, plants also need to suppress Rb for E2F translation in the network. These conserved elements of the plant and animal cell cycles may be ancestral in eukaryotes.

{"id": "7255", "revid": "28438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7255", "title": "Connection (dance)", "text": "Dance\nIn partner dancing, connection is physical, non-verbal communication between dancers to facilitate synchronized or coordinated dance movements. Some forms of connection involve \"lead/follow\" in which one dancer (the \"lead\") directs the movements of the other dancer (the \"follower\") by means of non-verbal directions conveyed through a physical connection between the dancers. In other forms, connection involves multiple dancers (more than two) without a distinct leader or follower (e.g. contact improvisation). Connection refers to a host of different techniques in many types of partner dancing, especially (but not exclusively) those that feature significant physical contact between the dancers, including the Argentine Tango, Lindy Hop, Balboa, East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing, Salsa, and other ballroom dances.\nOther forms of communication, such as visual cues or spoken cues, sometimes aid in connecting with one's partner, but are often used in specific circumstances (e.g., practicing figures, or figures which are purposely danced without physical connection). Connection can be used to transmit power and energy as well as information and signals; some dance forms (and some dancers) primarily emphasize power or signaling, but most are probably a mixture of both. Philosopher of dance Ilya Vidrin argues that connection between partners involves norm-based communication that include \u201ca physical exchange of information on the basis of ethically-bound conditions\u201d (proximity, orientation, and points of contact) which constrain agency and predictability.\nLead/Follow.\nFollowing and leading in a partner dance is accomplished by maintaining a physical connection called the frame that allows the leader to transmit body movement to the follower, and for the follower to suggest ideas to the leader. A frame is a stable structural combination of both bodies maintained through the dancers' arms and/or legs.\nConnection occurs in both open and closed dance positions (also called \"open frame\" and \"closed frame\").\nIn closed position with body contact, connection is achieved by maintaining the frame. The follower moves to match the leader, maintaining the pressure between the two bodies as well as the position.\nWhen creating frame, tension is the primary means of establishing communication. Changes in tension are made to create rhythmic variations in moves and movements, and are communicated through points of contact. In an open position or a closed position without body contact, the hands and arms alone provide the connection, which may be one of three forms: tension, compression or neutral.\nIn swing dances, tension and compression may be maintained for a significant period of time. In other dances, such as Latin, tension and compression may be used as indications of upcoming movement. However, in both styles, tension and compression do not signal immediate movement: the follow must be careful not to move prior to actual movement by the lead. Until then, the dancers must match pressures without moving their hands. In some styles of Lindy Hop, the tension may become quite high without initiating movement.\nThe general rule for open connections is that moves of the leader's hands back, forth, left or right are originated through moves of the entire body. Accordingly, for the follower, a move of the connected hand is immediately transformed into the corresponding move of the body. Tensing the muscles and locking the arm achieves this effect but is neither comfortable nor correct. Such tension eliminates the subtler communication in the connection, and eliminates free movement up and down, such as is required to initiate many turns.\nInstead of just tensing the arms, connection is achieved by engaging the shoulder, upper body and torso muscles. Movement originates in the body's core. A leader leads by moving himself and maintaining frame and connection. Different forms of dance and different movements within each dance may call for differences in the connection. In some dances the separation distance between the partners remains pretty constant. In others e.g. Modern Jive moving closer together and further apart are fundamental to the dance, requiring flexion and extension of the arms, alternating compression and tension.\nThe connection between two partners has a different feel in every dance and with every partner. Good social dancers adapt to the conventions of the dance and the responses of their partners."}

{"id": "7257", "revid": "2400126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7257", "title": "Caste", "text": "Social stratification conferring status\nA caste is a fixed social group into which an individual is born within a particular system of social stratification: a caste system. Within such a system, individuals are expected to marry exclusively within the same caste (endogamy), follow lifestyles often linked to a particular occupation, hold a ritual status observed within a hierarchy, and interact with others based on cultural notions of exclusion, with certain castes considered as either more pure or more polluted than others. The term \"caste\" is also applied to morphological groupings in eusocial insects such as ants, bees, and termites.\nThe paradigmatic ethnographic example of caste is the division of India's Hindu society into rigid social groups. Its roots lie in South Asia's ancient history and it still exists; however, the economic significance of the caste system in India seems to be declining as a result of urbanisation and affirmative action programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Hindu caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside Hinduism and India. In colonial Spanish America, mixed-race \"castas\" were a category within the Hispanic sector but the social order was otherwise fluid.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"caste\" (, ) derives from the Spanish and Portuguese , which, according to the John Minsheu's Spanish dictionary (1569), means \"race, lineage, tribe or breed\". The Portuguese and Spanish word \"casta\" originated in Gothic \"kasts\" - \"group of animals\". The word entered the languages of the Iberian Peninsula with the sense \"type of animal,\" and soon developed into \"race of men\" and later \"class, condition of men\". When the Spanish colonised the New World, they used the word to mean a 'clan or lineage'. It was, however, the Portuguese, the first Europeans to reach India by sea in 1498, to first employ in the primary modern sense of the English word 'caste' when they applied it to the thousands of endogamous, hereditary Indian social groups they encountered. The use of the spelling \"caste\", with this latter meaning, is first attested in English in 1613. In the Latin American context, the term \"caste\" is sometimes used to describe the \"casta\" system of racial classification, based on whether a person was of pure European, Indigenous or African descent, or some mix thereof, with the different groups being placed in a racial hierarchy; however, despite the etymological connection between the Latin American \"casta\" system and South Asian caste systems (the former giving its name to the latter), it is controversial to what extent the two phenomena are really comparable.\nIn South Asia.\nIndia.\nModern India's caste system is based on the superimposition of an old four-fold theoretical classification called varna on the social ethnic grouping called j\u0101ti. The Vedic period conceptualised a society as consisting of four types of varnas, or categories: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra, according to the nature of the work of its members. Varna was not an inherited category and the occupation determined the varna. However, a person's Jati is determined at birth and makes them take up that Jati's occupation; members could and did change their occupation based on personal strengths as well as economic, social and political factors. A 2016 study based on the DNA analysis of unrelated Indians determined that endogamous jatis originated during the Gupta Empire. Today, there are around 3,000 castes and 25,000 sub-castes in India.\nFrom 1901 onwards, for the purposes of the Decennial Census, British authorities in India categorized all J\u0101tis into the four \"Varna\" categories as described in ancient Indian texts. Herbert Hope Risley, the Census Commissioner, noted that \"The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the theoretical Indian system.\"\n\"Varna\", as mentioned in ancient Hindu texts, describes society as divided into four categories: Brahmins (scholars and yajna priests), Kshatriyas (rulers and warriors), Vaishyas (farmers, merchants and artisans) and Shudras (workmen/service providers). Scholars believe that the \"Varnas\" system was never truly operational in society and there is no evidence of it ever being a reality in Indian history. The practical division of the society has been in terms of \"Jatis\" (birth groups), which are not based on any specific religious principle but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations to geographic areas. The \"J\u0101tis\" have been endogamous social groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political, or economic status. Many of India's major empires and dynasties like the Mauryas, Shalivahanas, Chalukyas, Kakatiyas among many others, were founded by people who would have been classified as Shudras, under the \"Varnas\" system, as interpreted by the British. It is well established that by the 9th century, kings from all the four Varnas, including Brahmins and Vaishyas, had occupied the highest seat in the monarchical system in Hindu India, contrary to the Varna theory. Historically the kings and rulers had been called upon to mediate on the ranks of \"J\u0101tis\", which might number in thousands all over the subcontinent and vary by region. In practice, the \"j\u0101tis\" are seen to fit into the \"varna\" classes, but the \"varna\" status of \"j\u0101tis\" itself was subject to articulation over time.\nStarting with the 1901 Census of India led by colonial administrator Herbert Hope Risley, all the \"j\u0101tis\" were grouped under the theoretical \"varnas\" categories. According to political scientist Lloyd Rudolph, Risley believed that \"varna\", however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and \"[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it.\" The terms \"varna\" (conceptual classification based on occupation) and \"j\u0101ti\" (groups) are two distinct concepts: while \"varna\" is a theoretical four-part division, \"j\u0101ti\" (community) refers to the thousands of actual endogamous social groups prevalent across the subcontinent. The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the \"varnas\", as it provided a convenient shorthand; but a problem arises when colonial Indologists sometimes confuse the two. Sujata Patel argues that colonial ethnographic practices, frequently in association with Brahmin elites, constructed Indian society as traditional and caste-based. These practices, according to Patel, emphasise the cultural and religious dimensions and downplay economic and political factors.\nUpon independence from Britain, the Indian Constitution listed 1,108 Jatis across the country as Scheduled Castes in 1950, for positive discrimination. This constitution would also ban discrimination of the basis of the caste, though its practice in India remained intact. The Untouchable communities are sometimes called \"Dalit\" or \"Harijan\" in contemporary literature. In 2001, Dalits were 16.2% of India's population. Most of the 15 million bonded child workers are from the lowest castes. Independent India has witnessed caste-related violence. In 2005, government recorded approximately 110,000 cases of reported violent acts, including rape and murder, against Dalits.\nThe socio-economic limitations of the caste system are reduced due to urbanisation and affirmative action. Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in endogamy and patrimony, and politics. The globalisation and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilisation of people and policy development.\nStudies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of modern socio-economic changes in the country, India is experiencing significant changes in the dynamics and the economics of its social sphere. While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has provided a network for younger Indians to take control of their relationships through the use of dating apps. This remains isolated to informal terms, as marriage is not often achieved through the use of these apps. Hypergamy is still a common practice in India and Hindu culture. Men are expected to marry within their caste, or one below, with no social repercussions. If a woman marries into a higher caste, then her children will take the status of their father. If she marries down, her family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. In this case, the women are bearers of the egalitarian principle of the marriage. There would be no benefit in marrying a higher caste if the terms of the marriage did not imply equality. However, men are systematically shielded from the negative implications of the agreement.\nGeographical factors also determine adherence to the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to participate in exogamous marriage, due to a lack of eligible suitors within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women, of the northern mountains, have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma. This often leads to better husbandry as his actions are not protected by social expectations.\nChiefly among the factors influencing the rise of exogamy is the rapid urbanisation in India experienced over the last century. It is well known that urban centers tend to be less reliant on agriculture and are more progressive as a whole. As India's cities boomed in population, the job market grew to keep pace. Prosperity and stability were now more easily attained by an individual, and the anxiety to marry quickly and effectively was reduced. Thus, younger, more progressive generations of urban Indians are less likely than ever to participate in the antiquated system of arranged endogamy.\nIndia has also implemented a form of Affirmative Action, locally known as \"reservation groups\". Quota system jobs, as well as placements in publicly funded colleges, hold spots for the 8% of India's minority, and underprivileged groups. As a result, in states such as Tamil Nadu or those in the north-east, where underprivileged populations predominate, over 80% of government jobs are set aside in quotas. In education, colleges lower the marks necessary for the Dalits to enter.\nNepal.\nThe Nepali caste system resembles in some respects the Indian \"j\u0101ti\" system, with numerous \"j\u0101ti\" divisions with a \"varna\" system superimposed. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the Licchavi period. Jayasthiti Malla (1382\u20131395) categorised Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506\u20131575). The Hindu social code was later set up in the Gorkha Kingdom by Ram Shah (1603\u20131636).\nPakistan.\nMcKim Marriott claims a social stratification that is hierarchical, closed, endogamous and hereditary is widely prevalent, particularly in western parts of Pakistan. Frederik Barth in his review of this system of social stratification in Pakistan suggested that these are castes.\nSri Lanka.\nThe caste system in Sri Lanka is a division of society into strata, influenced by the textbook \"j\u0101ti\" system found in India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the Kandyan-period Kadayimpoth \u2013 Boundary books as well indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka's monarchy.\nRest of Asia.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIndonesia.\nBalinese caste structure has been described as being based either on three categories\u2014the noble triwangsa (thrice born), the middle class of \"dwij\u0101ti\" (twice born), and the lower class of \"ekaj\u0101ti\" (once born), much similar to the traditional Indian BKVS social stratification \u2014 or on four castes\nThe Brahmana caste was further subdivided by Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to \"castas\" in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, pre-colonial societies do not have a single social structure. The class structures can be roughly categorised into four types:\n* Royalty \u2013 (Visayan: \"kadatoan\") the \"datu\" and immediate descendants. They are often further categorised according to purity of lineage. The power of the \"datu\" is dependent on the willingness of their followers to render him respect and obedience. Most roles of the datu were judicial and military. In case of an unfit \"datu\", support may be withdrawn by his followers. \"Datu\" were almost always male, though in some ethnic groups like the Banwaon people, the female shaman (\"babaiyon\") co-rules as the female counterpart of the \"datu\". \n* Nobility \u2013 (Visayan: \"tumao\"; Tagalog: \"maginoo\"; Kapampangan \"ginu\"; Tausug: \"bangsa mataas\") the ruling class, either inclusive of or exclusive of the royal family. Most are descendants of the royal line or gained their status through wealth or bravery in battle. They owned lands and subjects, from whom they collected taxes.\n* Shamans \u2013 (Visayan: \"babaylan\"; Tagalog: \"katalonan\") the spirit mediums, usually female or feminised men. While they were not technically a caste, they commanded the same respect and status as nobility. \n* Warriors \u2013 (Visayan: \"timawa\"; Tagalog: \"maharlika\") the martial class. They could own land and subjects like the higher ranks, but were required to fight for the \"datu\" in times of war. In some Filipino ethnic groups, they were often tattooed extensively to record feats in battle and as protection against harm. They were sometimes further subdivided into different classes, depending on their relationship with the \"datu\". They traditionally went on seasonal raids on enemy settlements. \n* Commoners and slaves \u2013 (Visayan, Maguindanao: \"ulipon\"; Tagalog: \"alipin\"; Tausug: \"kiapangdilihan\"; Maranao: \"kakatamokan\") \u2013 the lowest class composed of the rest of the community who were not part of the enfranchised classes. They were further subdivided into the commoner class who had their own houses, the servants who lived in the houses of others, and the slaves who were usually captives from raids, criminals, or debtors. Most members of this class were equivalent to the European serf class, who paid taxes and can be conscripted to communal tasks, but were more or less free to do as they please.\nEast Asia.\nTibet.\nThere is significant controversy over the social classes of Tibet, especially with regards to the serfdom in Tibet controversy. There were three main feudal social groups in Tibet prior to 1959, namely ordinary laypeople (\"mi ser\" in Tibetan), lay nobility (\"sger pa\"), and monks. \nHeidi Fjeld has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European feudal serfdom, as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticise a supposedly egalitarian ancient Tibetan society.\nJapan.\nIn Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position, rather than personal merit, were rigid and highly formalised in a system called (). At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles (kuge), together with the Sh\u014dgun and daimy\u014d.\nOlder scholars believed that there were of \"samurai, peasants (\"hyakush\u014d\"), craftsmen, and merchants (\"ch\u014dnin\")\" under the daimyo, with 80% of peasants under the 5% samurai class, followed by craftsmen and merchants. However, various studies have revealed since about 1995 that the classes of peasants, craftsmen, and merchants under the samurai are equal, and the old hierarchy chart has been removed from Japanese history textbooks. In other words, peasants, craftsmen, and merchants are not a social pecking order, but a social classification.\nMarriage between certain classes was generally prohibited. In particular, marriage between daimyo and court nobles was forbidden by the Tokugawa shogunate because it could lead to political maneuvering. For the same reason, marriages between daimyo and high-ranking hatamoto of the samurai class required the approval of the Tokugawa shogunate. It was also forbidden for a member of the samurai class to marry a peasant, craftsman, or merchant, but this was done through a loophole in which a person from a lower class was adopted into the samurai class and then married. Since there was an economic advantage for a poor samurai class person to marry a wealthy merchant or peasant class woman, they would adopt a merchant or peasant class woman into the samurai class as an adopted daughter and then marry her. Samurai had the right to strike and even kill with their sword anyone of a lower class who compromised their honour.\nJapan had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracised, historically referred to by the insulting term \"eta\", now called \"burakumin\". While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the \"buraku\" or \"burakumin\" underclasses. The \"burakumin\" are regarded as \"ostracised\". The \"burakumin\" are one of the main minority groups in Japan, along with the Ainu of Hokkaido and those of Korean or Chinese descent.\nKorea.\nThe baekjeong () were an \"untouchable\" outcaste of Korea. The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the Khitan invasion of Korea in the 11th century. The defeated Khitans who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion. They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads. Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.\nIn 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian Joseon dynasty, Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the Yangban, which literally means \"two classes\". It was composed of scholars () and warriors (). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the (: literally \"middle people\"). This was a small class of specialised professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the (: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a serf population known as the \"nobi\". The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population. In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated, and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5% of the total population of Korea. The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886\u201387 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the Gabo Reform of 1894, but traces remained until 1930.\nThe opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the . However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate into worship, with non- finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage. Around the same time, the began to resist open social discrimination. They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an egalitarian Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by upper class, authorities, and \"commoners\", and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.\nWith the Gabo reform of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the Gabo government, the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal social equality, which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.\nWhile most Koreans by then had surnames and even , although still substantial number of , mostly consisted of serfs and slaves, and untouchables did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term (\"people\") and later, (\"citizen\").\nNorth Korea.\nThe Committee for Human Rights in North Korea reported that \"Every North Korean citizen is assigned a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life.\" Called \"Songbun\", Barbara Demick describes this \"class structure\" as an updating of the hereditary \"caste system\", a combination of Confucianism and Communism. It originated in 1946 and was entrenched by the 1960s, and consisted of 53 categories ranging across three classes: loyal, wavering, and impure. The privileged \"loyal\" class included members of the Korean Workers' Party and Korean People's Army officers' corps, the wavering class included peasants, and the impure class included collaborators with Imperial Japan and landowners. She claims that a bad family background is called \"tainted blood\", and that by law this \"tainted blood\" lasts three generations.\nWest Asia.\nKurdistan.\nYazidis.\nThere are three hereditary groups, often called castes, in Yazidism. Membership in the Yazidi society and a caste is conferred by birth. P\u00eers and Sheikhs are the priestly castes, which are represented by many sacred lineages (). Sheikhs are in charge of both religious and administrative functions and are divided into three endogamous houses, \u015eemsan\u00ee, Adan\u00ee and Qatan\u00ee who are in turn divided into lineages. The P\u00eers are in charge of purely religious functions and traditionally consist of 40 lineages or clans, but approximately 90 appellations of P\u00eer lineages have been found, which may have been a result of new sub-lineages arising and number of clans increasing over time due to division as Yazidis settled in different places and countries. Division could occur in one family, if there were a few brothers in one clan, each of them could become the founder of their own P\u00eer sub-clan (). Mir\u00eeds are the lay caste and are divided into tribes, who are each affiliated to a P\u00eer and a Sheikh priestly lineage assigned to the tribe.\nIran.\nPre-Islamic Sassanid society was immensely complex, with separate systems of social organisation governing numerous different groups within the empire. Historians believe society comprised four social classes, which linguistic analysis indicates may have been referred to collectively as \"pistras\". The classes, from highest to lowest status, were priests (), warriors (), secretaries (), and commoners ().\nYemen.\nIn Yemen there exists a hereditary caste, the African-descended Al-Akhdam who are kept as perennial manual workers. Estimates put their number at over 3.5 million residents who are discriminated, out of a total Yemeni population of around 22 million.\nAfrica.\nVarious sociologists have reported caste systems in Africa. The specifics of the caste systems have varied in ethnically and culturally diverse Africa; however, the following features are common \u2013 it has been a closed system of social stratification, the social status is inherited, the castes are hierarchical, certain castes are shunned while others are merely endogamous and exclusionary. In some cases, concepts of purity and impurity by birth have been prevalent in Africa. In other cases, such as the \"Nupe\" of Nigeria, the \"Beni Amer\" of East Africa, and the \"Tira\" of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.\nWest Africa.\nAmong the Igbo of Nigeria \u2013 especially Enugu, Anambra, Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Edo and Delta states of the country \u2013 scholar Elijah Obinna finds that the Osu caste system has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracised, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.\nThe \"osu\" class systems of eastern Nigeria and southern Cameroon are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the \"Osus\" people as \"owned by deities\" and outcasts.\nThe Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.\nIn a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in Ivory Coast, with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.\nSimilarly, the Mand\u00e9 societies in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the \"jonow\" slaves as inferior. Similarly, the Wolof in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the \"geer\" (freeborn/nobles), \"jaam\" (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass \"neeno\". In various parts of West Africa, Fulani societies also have class divisions. Other castes include \"Griots\", \"Forgerons\", and \"Cordonniers\".\nTamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the \"Malinke\" people no later than 14th century, and was present among the \"Wolof\" and \"Soninke\", as well as some \"Songhay\" and \"Fulani\" populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the \"Sosso-Malinke\" war described in the \"Sunjata\" epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.\nAs West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specialisations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.\nCentral Africa.\nEthel M. Albert in 1960 claimed that the societies in Central Africa were caste-like social stratification systems. Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in Rwanda and Burundi can be best described as castes. The Tutsi, noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous Hutu and the least numerous Twa regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.\nHorn of Africa.\nIn Ethiopia, there have been a number of studies of castes. Broad studies of castes have been written by Alula Pankhurst, who has published a study of caste groups in SW Ethiopia. and a later volume by Dena Freeman writing with Pankhurst.\nIn a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the Gurage and Konso. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.\nAmong the Kafa, there were also traditionally groups labelled as castes. \"Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths (Qemmo), weavers (Shammano), bards (Shatto), potters, and tanners (Manjo). In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves.\"\nThe Borana Oromo of southern Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the Oromo language, they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.\nThe traditionally nomadic Somali people are divided into clans, wherein the Rahanweyn agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the Madhiban were traditionally sometimes treated as outcasts. As Gabooye, the Madhiban along with the Yibir and Tumaal (collectively referred to as \"sab\") have since obtained political representation within Somalia, and their general social status has improved with the expansion of urban centers.\nThe Aari people caste system lasted for 4,500 years and prevented the exchange of genes between groups.\nEurope.\nFrance and Spain.\nFor centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded Cagots who lived primarily in the areas of the Navarrese Pyrenees, Basque provinces, B\u00e9arn, Arag\u00f3n, Gascony and Brittany, of France and Spain as an inferior caste, and a group of untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the churches they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, and receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn July 2013, the UK government announced its intention to amend the Equality Act 2010, to \"introduce legislation on caste, including any necessary exceptions to the caste provisions, within the framework of domestic discrimination law\". Section 9(5) of the Equality Act 2010 provides that \"a Minister may by order amend the statutory definition of race to include caste and may provide for exceptions in the Act to apply or not to apply to caste\".\nFrom September 2013 to February 2014, Meena Dhanda led a project on \"Caste in Britain\" for the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\nAmericas.\nLatin America.\nIn colonial Spanish America (16th-early 19th centuries), there were legal divisions of society, the Republic of Spaniards (), comprising European whites, African slaves (), and mixed-race , the offspring of unions between whites, blacks, and indigenous. The Republic of Indians () comprised all the various indigenous peoples, now classified in a single category, , by their colonial rulers. In the social and racial hierarchy, European Spaniards were at the apex, with legal rights and privileges. Lower racial groups (Africans, mixed-race castas, and pure indigenous), had fewer legal rights and lower social status. Unlike the rigid caste system in India, in colonial Spanish America there was some fluidity within the social order.\nUnited States.\nIn the opinion of W. Lloyd Warner, discrimination in the Southern United States in the 1930s against Blacks was similar to Indian castes in such features as residential segregation and marriage restrictions. In her 2020 book \"\", journalist Isabel Wilkerson used caste as an analogy to understand racial discrimination in the United States.\nGerald D. Berreman contrasted the differences between discrimination in the United States and India. In India, there are complex religious features which make up the system, whereas in the United States race and color are the basis for differentiation. The caste systems in India and the United States have higher groups which desire to retain their positions for themselves and thus perpetuate the two systems.\nThe process of creating a homogenized society by social engineering in both India and the Southern US has created other institutions that have made class distinctions among different groups evident. Anthropologist James C. Scott elaborates on how \"global capitalism is perhaps the most powerful force for homogenization, whereas the state may be the defender of local difference and variety in some instances\". The caste system, a relic of feudalistic economic systems, emphasizes differences between socio-economic classes that are obviated by openly free market capitalistic economic systems, which reward individual initiative, enterprise, merit, and thrift, thereby creating a path for social mobility. When the feudalistic slave economy of the southern United States was dismantled, Jim Crow laws and acts of domestic terrorism committed by white supremacists prevented many industrious African Americans from participating in the formal economy and achieving economic success on parity with their white peers, or destroying that economic success in instances where it was achieved, such as Black Wall Street, with only rare but commonly touted exceptions to lasting personal success such as Maggie Walker, Annie Malone, and Madame C.J. Walker. Parts of the United States are sometimes divided by race and class status despite the national narrative of integration.\nA survey on caste discrimination conducted by Equality Labs found 67% of Indian Dalits living in the US reporting that they faced caste-based harassment at the workplace, and 27% reporting verbal or physical assault based on their caste. However, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace study in 2021 criticizes Equality Labs findings and methodology noting Equality Labs study \"relied on a nonrepresentative snowball sampling method to recruit respondents. Furthermore, respondents who did not disclose a caste identity were dropped from the data set. Therefore, it is likely that the sample does not fully represent the South Asian American population and could skew in favor of those who have strong views about caste. While the existence of caste discrimination in India is incontrovertible, its precise extent and intensity in the United States can be contested\".\nIn 2023, Seattle became the first city in the United States to ban discrimination based on caste.\nRacial casteism.\nRacial casteism is a term used to identify the relationship between caste, race, and colorism. In modern-day India, the caste system has expanded to include groups and identities from diasporic groups as well such as the Africana Siddis and Kaffirs. Siddis make up 40,000 of India's vast population and are perceived as untouchables under the caste framework.This categorization is paired with anti-black ideology in the country, that is often adapted by broader uses of the term caste in western countries, most notably the United States. Like the Siddis, Africana caste Sri Lanka Kaffirs make up a small minority of the population with scholars noting that the exact number is hard to determine due to exclusion and lack of recognition from the government. Siddis and Kaffirs are considered untouchables due to their darker skin color alongside other physical factors that distinguish the group as lower caste.\nThe migration of Africana groups such as the Siddis and Kaffirs to South Asia is widely considered to be a result of the Indian Ocean Slave Trade, initiated by Muslim Arabs. During the trade, enslaved Africans were often brought as court servants, herbalists, midwives, or as bonded labor. The limited awareness of these groups can be attributed to caste-ideology fueled from this trade.\nThe racial understanding of caste has largely been debated by scholars, with some like Dr. B. R. Ambedkar arguing that caste differences between higher caste Aryans and lower cast native-Indians being more due to religious factors. While the term remains contended, it is widely understood that this racial assessment is based on the way lower-caste people are treated. Africana diasporic groups who do not fit the caste system reflected by the scheduled tribe are thus considered inferior for their darker skin and grouped in with the untouchables. Since caste is inherited at birth and is inflexible to change throughout a lifetime, this can lead to a racial caste system where colorism largely influences the mobility one has in their lifetime. Terminology shifted away from race-conscious terms in South Asian antiquity, where Aryans had pre-conceived social hierarchies built off of race, to a caste framework during Buddhism's rise in the third century BCE.\nRacial caste is embedded in the institutions that make up South Asia, particularly its governing bodies. When it comes to the electorate of India, voter preference is often based on race, caste, religion, alongside other attributing physical and political factors. This power imbalance alongside the rigid nature of caste can work against those of darker skin complexion to hold positions of power.\nCaste and higher education.\nThe foundational divisions of caste have historically been seen as a determining factor in one's skills and career prospects. Today, many people perceive higher education as a means of achieving their own professional goals, but there are still methods based on caste assumptions used to keep lower caste out of universities. This leads to their exclusion from the potential to be part of higher-paying jobs that are perceived as more elite. This social expectation and prevention of access to education and opportunity have elongated the struggle for financial and social equity amongst people from scheduled tribes and castes.\nAffirmative Action has been a global phenomenon to develop more spaces in politics, jobs, and education for people from historically disadvantaged backgrounds, which has led to the reservation system being applied to universities. Even with these regulations, caste nevertheless remains a largely determining factor in the university system in India. The guarantee of admittance to a certain proportion of people from oppressed castes is not enough to deal with the implications of divisions in higher education. For example, the reservation percentage can vary by state but is generally around 15% for Scheduled Castes, but 2019\u201320 data shows most universities miss this mark. Across the board, there is an average of 14.7% of scheduled caste students, meaning many universities are at a far lower rate than legislated. These reservation systems have backlash from upper caste groups, who claim that people are only admitted due to their caste status, as opposed to merit, in a similar argument playing out to affirmative action in the United States.\nReservation policies constitute a first step in providing access to admittance into higher education opportunities but do not overcome the overarching challenge of casteism. Caste-based discrimination and social stigma can still affect the experiences of students from marginalized communities in academic institutions. Universities are a crucial place of integration and moving to offer equitable opportunity beyond just attendance, but implementing protective policies to ensure students can be successful. Attendance at university has already been shown to impact how people view caste and has the potential to shape equity building beyond the current interpersonal and systemic relationship.\nSeveral forms of discrimination manifest in universities:\n \"When I was enrolled for an undergraduate course, I was vocal about his Dalit identity and vouched for the rights of Dalits and marginalized sections. Most of my upper-caste mates were against reservation. I was always typecast, stereotyped and even labeled with derogatory nicknames,\" Nishat Kabir, who is studying film at Ambedkar University in New Delhi, told Anadolu Agency.\nEighty-four percent of the SC/ST students surveyed said examiners had asked them about their caste directly or indirectly during their evaluations. One student said: \"Teachers are fine till they do not know your caste. The moment they come to know, their attitude towards you changes completely.\"\nDue to the challenges experienced on top of the normal pressure of being a student, the discrimination that Dalits and people of OBCs face has led to increased rates of suicide, with numerous examples shown to be tied directly to campus harassment and lack of administrative support.\nThe clarity that comes from people sharing their experiences has led to significant pushback in the 21st century, where students have been centering fights for justice and equity, often based on movements that student activists of the past have used. Allahabad University has seen a spike in student protests and demonstrations against institutional discrimination. Students used tactics of information spreading from pamphlets and court cases, to public civil disobedience through marches and sit-ins to disrupt the flow of university life and lead to broader discussions. The student unrest was not unique to Allahabad University but was strong enough to last over 90 days.\nCaste in sociology and entomology.\nThe initial observational studies of the division of labour in ant colonies attempted to demonstrate that ants specialized in tasks that were best suited to their size when they emerged from the pupae stage into the adult stage. A large proportion of the experimental work was done in species that showed strong variation in size. As the size of an adult was fixed for life, workers of a specific size range came to be called a \"caste\", calling up the traditional caste system in India in which a human's standing in society was decided at birth.\nThe notion of caste encouraged a link between scholarship in entomology and sociology because it served as an example of a division of labour in which the participants seemed to be uncompromisingly adapted to special functions and sometimes even unique environments. To bolster the concept of caste, entomologists and sociologists referred to the complementary social or natural parallel and thereby appeared to generalize the concept and give it an appearance of familiarity. In the late 19th- and early 20th centuries, the perceived similarities between the Indian caste system and caste polymorphism in insects were used to create a correspondence or parallelism for the purpose of explaining or clarifying racial stratification in human societies; the explanations came particularly to be employed in the United States. Ideas from heredity and natural selection influenced some sociologists who believed that some groups were predetermined to belong to a lower social or occupational status. Chiefly through the work of W. Lloyd Warner at the University of Chicago, a group of sociologists sharing similar principles came to evolve around the creed of caste in the 1930s and 1940s.\nThe ecologically oriented sociologist Robert E. Park, although attributing more weight to environmental explanations than the biological nonetheless believed that there were obstacles to the assimilation of blacks into American society and that an \"accommodation stage\" in a biracially organized caste system was required before full assimilation. He did disavow his position in 1937, suggesting that blacks were a minority and not a caste. The Indian sociologist Radhakamal Mukerjee was influenced by Robert E. Park and adopted the concept of \"caste\" to describe race relations in the US. According to anthropologist Diane Rodgers, Mukerjee \"proceeded to suggest that a caste system should be correctly instituted in the (US) South to ease race relations.\" Mukerjee often employed both entomological and sociological data and clues to describe caste systems. He wrote \"while the fundamental industries of man are dispersed throughout the insect world, the same kind of polymorphism appears again and again in different species of social insects which have reacted in the same manner as man, under the influence of the same environment, to ensure the supply and provision of subsistence.\" Comparing the caste system in India to caste polymorphism in insects, he noted, \"where we find the organization of social insects developed to perfection, there also has been seen among human associations a minute and even rigid specialization of functions, along with ant- and bee-like societal integrity and cohesiveness.\" He considered the \"resemblances between insect associations and caste-ridden societies\" to be striking enough to be \"amusing\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7262", "revid": "40274787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7262", "title": "CORAL", "text": "Early programming language\nCORAL, short for Computer On-line Real-time Applications Language is a programming language originally developed in 1964 at the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE), Malvern, Worcestershire, in the United Kingdom. The R was originally for \"radar\", not \"real-time\". It was influenced primarily by JOVIAL, and thus ALGOL, but is not a subset of either.\nThe most widely-known version, CORAL 66, was subsequently developed by I. F. Currie and M. Griffiths under the auspices of the \"Inter-Establishment Committee for Computer Applications\" (IECCA). Its official definition, edited by Woodward, Wetherall, and Gorman, was first published in 1970.\nIn 1971, CORAL was selected by the Ministry of Defence as the language for future military applications and to support this, a standardization program was introduced to ensure CORAL compilers met the specifications. This process was later adopted by the US Department of Defense while defining Ada.\nOverview.\nCoral 66 is a general-purpose programming language based on ALGOL 60, with some features from Coral 64, JOVIAL, and Fortran. It includes structured record types (as in Pascal) and supports the packing of data into limited storage (also as in Pascal). Like Edinburgh IMP it allows inline (embedded) assembly language, and also offers good runtime checking and diagnostics. It is designed for real-time computing and embedded system applications, and for use on computers with limited processing power, including those limited to fixed-point arithmetic and those without support for dynamic storage allocation.\nThe language was an inter-service standard for British military programming, and was also widely adopted for civil purposes in the British control and automation industry. It was used to write software for both the Ferranti and General Electric Company (GEC) computers from 1971 onwards. Implementations also exist for the Interdata 8/32, PDP-11, VAX and Alpha platforms and HPE Integrity Servers; for the Honeywell, and for the Computer Technology Limited (CTL, later ITL) Modular-1; and for SPARC running Solaris, and Intel running Linux.\nQueen Elizabeth II sent the first email from a head of state from the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment over the ARPANET on 26 March 1976. The message read \"This message to all ARPANET users announces the availability on ARPANET of the Coral 66 compiler provided by the GEC 4080 computer at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, Malvern, England, ... Coral 66 is the standard real-time high level language adopted by the Ministry of Defence.\"\nAs Coral was aimed at a variety of real-time work, rather than general office data processing, there was no standardised equivalent to a stdio library. IECCA recommended a primitive input/output (I/O) package to accompany any compiler (in a document titled \"Input/Output of Character data in Coral 66 Utility Programs\"). Most implementers avoided this by producing Coral interfaces to extant Fortran and, later, C libraries.\nCORAL's most significant contribution to computing may have been enforcing quality control in commercial compilers. To have a CORAL compiler approved by IECCA, and thus allowing a compiler to be marketed as a CORAL 66 compiler, the candidate compiler had to compile and execute a standard suite of 25 test programs and 6 benchmark programs. The process was part of the British Standard (BS) 5905 approval process. This methodology was observed and adapted later by the United States Department of Defense for the certification of Ada compilers.\nSource code for a Coral 66 compiler (written in BCPL) has been recovered and the \"Official Definition of Coral 66\" document by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) has been scanned; the Ministry of Defence patent office has issued a licence to the Edinburgh Computer History project to allow them to put both the code and the language reference online for non-commercial use.\nVariants.\nA variant of Coral 66 named PO-CORAL was developed during the late 1970s to early 1980s by the British General Post Office (GPO), together with GEC, STC and Plessey, for use on the System X digital telephone exchange control computers. This was later renamed BT-CORAL when British Telecom was spun off from the Post Office. Unique features of this language were the focus on real-time execution, message processing, limits on statement execution between waiting for input, and a prohibition on recursion to remove the need for a stack.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7264", "revid": "45266726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7264", "title": "Rhyming slang", "text": "When words are replaced by their rhymes\nRhyming slang is a form of slang word construction in the English language. It is especially prevalent among Cockneys in England, and was first used in the early 19th century in the East End of London; hence its alternative name, Cockney rhyming slang. In the US, especially the criminal underworld of the West Coast between 1880 and 1920, rhyming slang has sometimes been known as Australian slang.\nThe construction of rhyming slang involves replacing a common word with a phrase of two or more words, the last of which rhymes with the original word; then, in almost all cases, omitting, from the end of the phrase, the secondary rhyming word (which is thereafter implied), making the origin and meaning of the phrase elusive to listeners not in the know.\nExamples.\nThe form of Cockney slang is made clear with the following example. The rhyming phrase \"apples and pears\" is used to mean 'stairs'. Following the pattern of omission, \"and pears\" is dropped, thus the spoken phrase \"I'm going up the apples\" means \"I'm going up the stairs\".\nThe following are further common examples of these phrases:\nIn some examples the meaning is further obscured by additional iterations of rhyme. For example, \"Aris\" and \"plaster\" are double and triple rhymes of 'arse' respectively. First, \"arse\" was rhymed with \"bottle and glass\". Later, \"bottle\" was rhymed with \"Aristotle\" and truncated to \"Aris\". Thus \"Aris\" emerged as a double rhyme of 'arse'. Furthermore, \"Aris\" was later rhymed with \"plaster of Paris\", producing \"plaster\" as a triple rhyme of 'arse'.\nPhonetic versus phono-semantic forms.\nGhil'ad Zuckermann, a linguist and revivalist, has proposed a distinction between rhyming slang based on sound only, and phono-semantic rhyming slang, which includes a semantic link between the slang expression and its referent (the thing it refers to). An example of rhyming slang based only on sound is the Cockney \"tea leaf\" 'thief'.29 An example of phono-semantic rhyming slang is the Cockney \"sorrowful tale\" 'jail',30 in which case the person coining the slang term sees a semantic link, sometimes jocular, between the Cockney expression and its referent.30\nMainstream usage.\nThe use of rhyming slang has spread beyond the purely dialectal and some examples are to be found in the mainstream British English lexicon, although many users may be unaware of the origin of those words.\nMost of the words changed by this process are nouns, but a few are adjectival, e.g., \"bales\" (of cotton) 'rotten', or the adjectival phrase \"on one's Tod\" for 'on one's own', after Tod Sloan, a famous jockey.\nHistory.\nRhyming slang is believed to have originated in the mid-19th century in the East End of London, with several sources suggesting some time in the 1840s. \"The Flash Dictionary\", of unknown authorship, published in 1921 by Smeeton (48mo), contains a few rhymes. John Camden Hotten's 1859 \"Dictionary of Modern Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words\" likewise states that it originated in the 1840s (\"about twelve or fifteen years ago\"), but with \"chaunters\" and \"patterers\" in the Seven Dials area of London. Hotten's \"Dictionary\" included the first known \"Glossary of the Rhyming Slang\", which included later mainstays such as \"frog and toad\" 'the main road' and \"apples and pears\" 'stairs', as well as many more obscure examples, e.g. \"Battle of the Nile\" 'a tile' (a common term for a hat), \"Duke of York\" 'take a walk', and \"Top of Rome\" 'home'.\nIt remains a matter of speculation exactly how rhyming slang originated, for example, as a linguistic game among friends or as a cryptolect developed intentionally to confuse non-locals. If deliberate, it may also have been used to maintain a sense of community, or to allow traders to talk amongst themselves in marketplaces to facilitate collusion, without customers knowing what they were saying, or by criminals to confuse the police (see thieves' cant).\nThe academic, lexicographer and radio personality Terence Dolan has suggested that rhyming slang was invented by Irish immigrants to London \"so the actual English wouldn't understand what they were talking about.\"\nDevelopment.\nMany examples of rhyming slang are based on locations in London, such as \"Peckham Rye\", meaning 'tie', which dates from the late nineteenth century; \"Hampstead Heath\", meaning 'teeth'264 (usually as \"Hampsteads\"), which was first recorded in 1887; and \"barnet\" (Barnet Fair), meaning 'hair',231 which dates from the 1850s.\nIn the 20th century, rhyming slang began to be based on the names of celebrities and pop culture references:\nMany examples have passed into common usage. Some substitutions have become relatively widespread in England in their contracted form. \"To have a butcher's\", meaning 'to have a look', originates from \"butcher's hook\", an S-shaped hook used by butchers to hang up meat, and dates from the late nineteenth century but has existed independently in general use from around the 1930s simply as \"butchers\".30 Similarly, \"use your loaf\", meaning 'use your head', derives from \"loaf of bread\" and also dates from the late nineteenth century but came into independent use in the 1930s.\nConversely usages have lapsed, or been usurped (\"Hounslow Heath\" for 'teeth', was replaced by \"Hampsteads\" starting c.\u20091887).\nIn some cases, false etymologies exist. For example, the term \"barney\" has been used to mean an altercation or fight since the late nineteenth century, although without a clear derivation. Dialog in the 2001 film \"Ocean's Eleven\" incorrectly explains that \"barney\" derives from Barney Rubble, a character from the 1960's television cartoon \"The Flintstones\".14\nRegional and international variations.\nRhyming slang is used mainly in London in England but can, to some degree, be understood across the country. Some constructions, however, rely on particular regional accents for the rhymes to work. For instance, the term \"Charing Cross\" (a place in London), used to mean 'horse' since the mid-nineteenth century, does not work for a speaker without the lot\u2013cloth split, common in London at that time but not nowadays. A similar example is \"Joanna\" meaning 'piano', which is based on the pronunciation of \"piano\" as \"pianna\" . Unique formations also exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, such as in the East Midlands, where the local accent has formed \"Derby Road\", which rhymes with 'cold'.\nOutside England, rhyming slang is used in many English-speaking countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, with local variations. For example, in Australian slang, the term for an English person is \"pommy\", which has been proposed as a rhyme on \"pomegranate\", pronounced \"Pummy Grant\", which rhymed with 'immigrant'.\nRhyming slang is continually evolving, and new phrases are introduced all the time; new personalities replace old ones\u2014pop culture introduces new words\u2014as in \"I haven't a Scooby\" (from Scooby Doo, the eponymous cartoon dog of the cartoon series) meaning 'I haven't a clue'.\nTaboo terms.\nRhyming slang is often used as a substitute for words regarded as taboo, often to the extent that the association with the taboo word becomes unknown over time. \"Berk\" (often used to mean \"foolish person\") originates from the most famous of all fox hunts, the \"Berkeley Hunt\" meaning 'cunt'; \"cobblers\" (often used in the context \"what you said is rubbish\") originates from \"cobbler's awls\", meaning 'balls' (as in testicles); and \"Hampton\" (usually \"'ampton\") meaning 'prick' (as in penis) originates from Hampton Wick (a place in London) \u2013 the second part, \"wick\", also entered common usage as \"he gets on my wick\" ('he is an annoying person').74\nLesser taboo terms include \"pony and trap\" for 'crap' (as in defecate, but often used to denote nonsense or low quality); to blow a raspberry (rude sound of derision) from raspberry tart for 'fart'. \"Taking the Mick\" or \"taking the Mickey\" is thought to be a rhyming slang form of \"taking the piss\", where \"Mick\" came from Mickey Bliss.\nIn December 2004 Joe Pasquale, winner of the fourth series of ITV's \"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!\", became well known for his frequent use of the term \"Jacobs\", for Jacob's Cream Crackers, a rhyming slang term for \"knackers\" 'testicles'.\nIn popular culture.\nRhyming slang has been widely used in popular culture including film, television, music, literature, sport and degree classification.\nIn university degree classification.\nIn the British undergraduate degree classification system a first class honours degree is known as a \"Geoff Hurst\" (First) after the English 1966 World Cup footballer. An upper second class degree (a.k.a. a \"2:1\") is called an \"Attila the Hun\", and a lower second class (\"2:2\") a \"Desmond Tutu\", while a third class degree is known as a \"Thora Hird\" or \"Douglas Hurd\".\nIn film.\nCary Grant's character teaches rhyming slang to his female companion in \"Mr. Lucky\" (1943), describing it as 'Australian rhyming slang'. Rhyming slang is also used and described in a scene of the 1967 film \"To Sir, with Love\" starring Sidney Poitier, where the English students tell their foreign teacher that the slang is a drag and something for old people. The closing song of the 1969 crime caper, \"The Italian Job\", (\"Getta Bloomin' Move On\" a.k.a. \"The Self Preservation Society\") contains many slang terms.\nRhyming slang has been used to lend authenticity to an East End setting. Examples include \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" (1998) (wherein the slang is translated via subtitles in one scene); \"The Limey\" (1999); \"Sexy Beast\" (2000); \"Snatch\" (2000); \"Ocean's Eleven\" (2001); and \"Austin Powers in Goldmember\" (2002); \"It's All Gone Pete Tong\" (2004), after BBC radio disc jockey Pete Tong whose name is used in this context as rhyming slang for \"wrong\"; \"Green Street Hooligans\" (2005). In \"Margin Call\" (2011), Will Emerson, played by London-born actor Paul Bettany, asks a friend on the telephone, \"How's the trouble and strife?\" (\"wife\").\n\"Cockneys vs Zombies\" (2012) mocked the genesis of rhyming slang terms when a Cockney character calls zombies \"Trafalgars\" to even his Cockney fellows' puzzlement; he then explains it thus: \"Trafalgar square \u2013 fox and hare \u2013 hairy Greek \u2013 five day week \u2013 weak and feeble \u2013 pins and needles \u2013 needle and stitch \u2013 Abercrombie and Fitch \u2013 Abercrombie: zombie\".\nThe live-action Disney film \"Mary Poppins Returns\" song \"Trip A Little Light Fantastic\" involves Cockney rhyming slang in part of its lyrics, and is primarily spoken by the London lamplighters.\nIn the animated superhero film \"\" (2023), character Spider-Punk, a Camden native, is heard saying: \"I haven't got a Scooby-Doo\" (\"clue\").\nTelevision.\nSlang had a resurgence of popular interest in Britain beginning in the 1970s, resulting from its use in a number of London-based television programmes such as \"Steptoe and Son\" (1970\u201374); and \"Not On Your Nellie\" (1974\u201375), starring Hylda Baker as Nellie Pickersgill, alludes to the phrase \"not on your Nellie Duff\", rhyming slang for \"not on your puff\" i.e. not on your life. Similarly, \"The Sweeney\" (1975\u201378) alludes to the phrase \"Sweeney Todd\" for \"Flying Squad\", a rapid response unit of London's Metropolitan Police. In \"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin\" (1976\u201379), a comic twist was added to rhyming slang by way of spurious and fabricated examples which a young man had laboriously attempted to explain to his father (e.g. 'dustbins' meaning 'children', as in 'dustbin lids'='kids'; 'Teds' being 'Ted Heath' and thus 'teeth'; and even 'Chitty Chitty' being 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', and thus 'rhyming slang'...). It was also featured in an episode of \"The Good Life\" in the first season (1975) where Tom and Barbara purchase a wood-burning range from a junk trader called Sam, who litters his language with phony rhyming slang in hopes of convincing suburban residents that he is an authentic traditional Cockney trader. He comes up with a fake story as to the origin of Cockney rhyming slang and is caught out rather quickly. In \"The Jeffersons\" season 2 (1976) episode \"The Breakup: Part 2\", Mr. Bentley explains Cockney rhyming slang to George Jefferson, in that \"whistle and flute\" means \"suit\", \"apples and pears\" means \"stairs\", \"plates of meat\" means \"feet\".\nThe use of rhyming slang was also prominent in \"Mind Your Language\" (1977\u201379), \"Citizen Smith\" (1977\u201380), \"Minder\" (1979\u201394), \"Only Fools and Horses\" (1981\u201391), and \"EastEnders\" (1985\u2013). \"Minder\" could be quite uncompromising in its use of obscure forms without any clarification. Thus the non-Cockney viewer was obliged to deduce that, say, \"iron\" was \"male homosexual\" ('iron'='iron hoof'='poof'). One episode in Series 5 of \"Steptoe and Son\" was entitled \"Any Old Iron\", for the same reason, when Albert thinks that Harold is 'on the turn'. Variations of rhyming slang were also used in sitcom \"Birds of a Feather\", by main characters Sharon and Tracey, often to the confusion of character, Dorian Green, who was unfamiliar with the terms.\nOne early US show to regularly feature rhyming slang was the Saturday morning children's show \"The Bugaloos\" (1970\u201372), with the character of Harmony (Wayne Laryea) often incorporating it in his dialogue.\nMusic.\nIn popular music, Spike Jones and his City Slickers recorded \"So 'Elp Me\", based on rhyming slang, in 1950. The 1967 Kinks song \"Harry Rag\" was based on the usage of the name Harry Wragg as rhyming slang for \"fag\" (i.e. a cigarette). The idiom made a brief appearance in the UK-based DJ reggae music of the 1980s in the hit \"Cockney Translation\" by Smiley Culture of South London; this was followed a couple of years later by Domenick and Peter Metro's \"Cockney and Yardie\". London-based artists such as Audio Bullys and Chas &amp; Dave (and others from elsewhere in the UK, such as The Streets, who are from Birmingham) frequently use rhyming slang in their songs.\nBritish-born M.C. MF Doom released an ode entitled \"Rhymin' Slang\", after settling in the UK in 2010. The track was released on the 2012 JJ Doom album \"Key to the Kuffs\".\nAnother contributor was Lonnie Donegan who had a song called \"My Old Man's a Dustman\". In it he says his father has trouble putting on his boots \"He's got such a job to pull them up that he calls them daisy roots\".\nLiterature.\nIn modern literature, Cockney rhyming slang is used frequently in the novels and short stories of Kim Newman, for instance in the short story collections \"The Man from the Diogenes Club\" (2006) and \"Secret Files of the Diogenes Club\" (2007), where it is explained at the end of each book.\nIt is also parodied in \"Going Postal\" by Terry Pratchett, which features a geriatric Junior Postman by the name of Tolliver Groat, a speaker of 'Dimwell Arrhythmic Rhyming Slang', the only rhyming slang on the Disc which \"does not actually rhyme\". Thus, a wig is a 'prunes', from 'syrup of prunes', an obvious parody of the Cockney \"syrup\" from \"syrup of figs \u2013 wig\". There are numerous other parodies, though it has been pointed out that the result is even more impenetrable than a conventional rhyming slang and so may not be quite so illogical as it seems, given the assumed purpose of rhyming slang as a means of communicating in a manner unintelligible to all but the initiated.\nIn the book \"Goodbye to All That\" by Robert Graves, a beer is a \"broken square\" as Welch Fusiliers officers walk into a pub and order broken squares when they see men from the Black Watch. The Black Watch had a minor blemish on its record of otherwise unbroken squares. Fistfights ensued.\nIn Dashiell Hammett's \"The Dain Curse\", the protagonist exhibits familiarity with Cockney rhyming slang, referring to gambling at dice with the phrase \"rats and mice.\"\nCockney rhyming slang is one of the main influences for the dialect spoken in \"A Clockwork Orange\" (1962). The author of the novel, Anthony Burgess, also believed the phrase \"as queer as a clockwork orange\" was Cockney slang having heard it in a London pub in 1945, and subsequently named it in the title of his book.\nSport.\nIn Scottish football, a number of clubs have nicknames taken from rhyming slang. Partick Thistle are known as the \"Harry Rags\", which is taken from the rhyming slang of their 'official' nickname \"the jags\". Rangers are known as the \"Teddy Bears\", which comes from the rhyming slang for \"the Gers\" (shortened version of Ran-gers). Heart of Midlothian are known as the \"Jambos\", which comes from \"Jam Tarts\" which is the rhyming slang for \"Hearts\" which is the common abbreviation of the club's name. Hibernian are also referred to as \"The Cabbage\" which comes from Cabbage and Ribs being the rhyming slang for Hibs. The phrase Hampden Roar (originally describing the loud crowd noise emanating from the national stadium) is employed as \"What's the Hampden?\", (\"What's the score?\", idiom for \"What's happening / what's going on?\").\nIn rugby league, \"meat pie\" is used for try.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was developed from about 1940 in S\u00e3o Paulo State by cross-breeding Brazilian zebuine cattle \u2013 Indubrasil, Guzer\u00e1 and Nelore \u2013 with bulls of the French Charolais breed.\nHistory.\nCattle of the French Charolais breed of beef cattle were imported to Brazil in 1922 by the national ministry of agriculture and taken to the government breeding farm of Uruta\u00ed, in the state of Goi\u00e1s. In 1936 they were moved to another government breeding farm, the Fazenda de Cria\u00e7\u00e3o at S\u00e3o Carlos in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo; this farm had earlier been known as the Fazenda Canchim, and later became the Centro Nacional de Pesquisa do Sudeste of the Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecu\u00e1ria.128 There, under the direction of Ant\u00f4nio Teixeira Viana, Charolais bulls from the herd were used from about 1940 in an experimental programme of cross-breeding with Brazilian zebuine cattle of various breeds, with the aim of developing a taurindicine hybrid which would combine the environmental adaptation of the zebu with the productive qualities \u2013 including growth rate and meat yield \u2013 of the European breed.53128\nTwo possible lines of development were explored, both starting from the mating of a zebu cow to a Charolais bull; the first-generation (F1) crosses were thus 50% zebu and 50% European. Mating F1 cows to a Charolais bull gave rise to a second-generation (F2) hybrid with 25% zebu genes, and mating these F2 cows to a zebu bull resulted in stock with 62.5% zebuine and 37.5% European inheritance; reversing the order of the bulls used to sire the second and third generations resulted in the reverse F3 mix, with 37.5% zebuine and 62.5% European genes. In both schemes, the F3 hybrids were then bred together. The stock with 5/8 zebu blood was found to be rustic but highly variable, and to show little productive improvement over the original zebu stock, while those with 5/8 Charolais blood were found to be well-conformed, fast-growing and consistent, with good tolerance of insects and heat; these were the foundation of the Canchim.129 \nA total of 368 zebu cows were used to produce the F1 generation, of which almost 80% were Indubrasil, and the remainder Guzer\u00e1 and Nelore; fewer than half of these are in the ancestry of the Canchim, which also includes 53 Charolais bulls, 4 Guzer\u00e1 and 8 Indubrasil.\nThe first Canchim calves were born in 1953, and the herd was then kept closed until a second phase of cross-breeding was begun in either 1986148 or 1990.\nA breed society, the , was formed in 1971, and a herd-book was established in the same year.36 The breed was officially recognised in 1972.129\nThe Canchim constitutes approximately of the national beef herd.2\nCharacteristics.\nBody weights for bulls are usually in the range , although there are records of a bull weighing ; cows usually weigh some .148 Bulls have a small hump.36 The coat is similar to that of the Charolais, varying from white to cream-coloured.148\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990 when the Congress of People's Deputies modified Article 6 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which had previously granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system. The party's main ideology was Marxism\u2013Leninism. The party was outlawed under Russian president Boris Yeltsin's decree on 6 November 1991, citing the 1991 Soviet coup attempt as a reason.\nThe party started in 1898 as part of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1903, that party split into a Menshevik (m) (\"minority\") and Bolshevik (b) (\"majority\") faction; the latter, led by Vladimir Lenin, is the direct ancestor of the CPSU and is the party that seized power in the October Revolution of 1917. Its activities were suspended on Soviet territory 74 years later, on 29 August 1991, soon after a failed coup d'\u00e9tat by conservative CPSU leaders against the reforming Soviet president and party general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.\nThe CPSU was a communist party based on democratic centralism. This principle, conceived by Lenin, entails democratic and open discussion of policy issues within the party, followed by the requirement of total unity in upholding the agreed policies. The highest body within the CPSU was the Party Congress, which convened every five years. When the Congress was not in session, the Central Committee was the highest body. Because the Central Committee met twice a year, most day-to-day duties and responsibilities were vested in the Politburo, (previously the Presidium), the Secretariat and the Orgburo (until 1952). The party leader was the head of government and held the office of either General Secretary, Premier or head of state, or two of the three offices concurrently, but never all three at the same time. The party leader was the \"de facto\" chairman of the CPSU Politburo and chief executive of the Soviet Union. The tension between the party and the state (Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union) for the shifting focus of power was never formally resolved.\nAfter the founding of the Soviet Union in 1922, Lenin had introduced a mixed economy, commonly referred to as the New Economic Policy, which allowed for capitalist practices to resume under the Communist Party dictation in order to develop the necessary conditions for socialism to become a practical pursuit in the economically undeveloped country. In 1929, as Joseph Stalin became the leader of the party, Marxism\u2013Leninism, a fusion of the original ideas of German philosopher and economic theorist Karl Marx, and Lenin, became formalized by Stalin as the party's guiding ideology and would remain so throughout the rest of its existence. The party pursued state socialism, under which all industries were nationalized, and a command economy was implemented. After recovering from the Second World War, reforms were implemented which decentralized economic planning and liberalized Soviet society in general under Nikita Khrushchev.\nBy 1980, various factors, including the continuing Cold War, and ongoing nuclear arms race with the United States and other Western European powers and unaddressed inefficiencies in the economy, led to stagnant economic growth under Alexei Kosygin, and further with Leonid Brezhnev and growing disillusionment. After the younger, vigorous Mikhail Gorbachev assumed leadership in 1985 (following two short-term elderly leaders, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, who quickly died in succession), rapid steps were taken to transform the tottering Soviet economic system in the direction of a market economy once again. Gorbachev and his allies envisioned the introduction of an economy similar to Lenin's earlier New Economic Policy through a program of \"perestroika\", or restructuring, but their reforms, along with the institution of free multi-candidate elections led to a decline in the party's power, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the banning of the party by later last RSFSR president Boris Yeltsin and subsequent first president of the successor Russian Federation.\nA number of causes contributed to CPSU's loss of control and the dissolution of the Soviet Union during the early 1990s. Some historians have written that Gorbachev's policy of \"glasnost\" (political openness) was the root cause, noting that it weakened the party's control over society. Gorbachev maintained that \"perestroika\" without \"glasnost\" was doomed to failure anyway. Others have blamed the economic stagnation and subsequent loss of faith by the general populace in communist ideology. In the final years of the CPSU's existence, the Communist Parties of the federal subjects of Russia were united into the Communist Party of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). After the CPSU's demise, the Communist Parties of the Union Republics became independent and underwent various separate paths of reform. In Russia, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation emerged and has been regarded as the inheritor of the CPSU's old Bolshevik legacy into the present day.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1898\u20131924).\nThe origin of the CPSU was in the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). This faction arose out of the split between followers of Julius Martov and Vladimir Lenin in August 1903 at the Party's second conference. Martov's followers were called the Mensheviks (which means minority in Russian); and Lenin's, the Bolsheviks (majority). (The two factions were in fact of fairly equal numerical size.) The split became more formalized in 1914, when the factions became named the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks), and Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Mensheviks). Prior to the February Revolution, the first phase of the Russian Revolutions of 1917, the party worked underground as organized anti-Tsarist groups. By the time of the revolution, many of the party's central leaders, including Lenin, were in exile.\nAfter Emperor Nicholas II (1868\u20131918, reigned 1894\u20131917) abdicated in March 1917, a republic was established and administered by a provisional government, which was largely dominated by the interests of the military, former nobility, major capitalists business owners and democratic socialists. Alongside it, grassroots general assemblies spontaneously formed, called soviets, and a dual-power structure between the soviets and the provisional government was in place until such a time that their differences would be reconciled in a post-provisional government. Lenin was at this time in exile in Switzerland where he, with other dissidents in exile, managed to arrange with the Imperial German government safe passage through Germany in a sealed train back to Russia through the continent amidst the ongoing World War. In April, Lenin arrived in Petrograd (renamed former St. Petersburg) and condemned the provisional government, calling for the advancement of the revolution towards the transformation of the ongoing war into a war of the working class against capitalism. The rebellion proved not yet to be over, as tensions between the social forces aligned with the soviets (councils) and those with the provisional government now led by Alexander Kerensky (1881\u20131970, in power 1917), came into explosive tensions during that summer.\nThe Bolsheviks had rapidly increased their political presence from May onward through the popularity of their program, notably calling for an immediate end to the war, land reform for the peasants, and restoring food allocation to the urban population. This program was translated to the masses through simple slogans that patiently explained their solution to each crisis the revolution created. Up to July, these policies were disseminated through 41 publications, \"Pravda\" being the main paper, with a readership of 320,000. This was roughly halved after the repression of the Bolsheviks following the July Days demonstrations so that even by the end of August, the principal paper of the Bolsheviks had a print run of only 50,000 copies. Despite this, their ideas gained them increasing popularity in elections to the soviets.\nThe factions within the soviets became increasingly polarized in the later summer after armed demonstrations by soldiers at the call of the Bolsheviks and an attempted military coup by commanding Gen. Lavr Kornilov to eliminate the socialists from the provisional government. As the general consensus within the soviets moved leftward, less militant forces began to abandon them, leaving the Bolsheviks in a stronger position. By October, the Bolsheviks were demanding the full transfer of power to the soviets and for total rejection of the Kerensky led provisional government's legitimacy. The provisional government, insistent on maintaining the universally despised war effort on the Eastern Front because of treaty ties with its Allies and fears of Imperial German victory, had become socially isolated and had no enthusiastic support on the streets. On 7 November (25 October, old style), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection, which overthrew the Kerensky provisional government and left the soviets as the sole governing force in Russia.\nIn the aftermath of the October Revolution, the soviets united federally and the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, the world's first constitutionally socialist state, was established. The Bolsheviks were the majority within the soviets and began to fulfill their campaign promises by signing a damaging peace to end the war with the Germans in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and transferring estates and imperial lands to workers' and peasants' soviets. In this context, in 1918, RSDLP(b) became All-Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks). Outside of Russia, social-democrats who supported the Soviet government began to identify as communists, while those who opposed it retained the social-democratic label.\nIn 1921, as the Civil War was drawing to a close, Lenin proposed the New Economic Policy (NEP), a system of state capitalism that started the process of industrialization and post-war recovery. The NEP ended a brief period of intense rationing called \"war communism\" and began a period of a market economy under Communist dictation. The Bolsheviks believed at this time that Russia, being among the most economically undeveloped and socially backward countries in Europe, had not yet reached the necessary conditions of development for socialism to become a practical pursuit and that this would have to wait for such conditions to arrive under capitalist development as had been achieved in more advanced countries such as England and Germany. On 30 December 1922, the Russian SFSR joined former territories of the Russian Empire to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), of which Lenin was elected leader. On 9 March 1923, Lenin suffered a stroke, which incapacitated him and effectively ended his role in government. He died on 21 January 1924, only thirteen months after the founding of the Soviet Union, of which he would become regarded as the founding father.\nStalin era (1924\u20131953).\nAfter Lenin's death, a power struggle ensued between Joseph Stalin, the party's general secretary, and Leon Trotsky, the minister of defence, each with highly contrasting visions for the future direction of the country. Trotsky sought to implement a policy of permanent revolution, which was predicated on the notion that the Soviet Union would not be able to survive in a socialist character when surrounded by hostile governments and therefore concluded that it was necessary to actively support similar revolutions in the more advanced capitalist countries. Stalin, however, argued that such a foreign policy would not be feasible with the capabilities then possessed by the Soviet Union and that it would invite the country's destruction by engaging in armed conflict. Rather, Stalin argued that the Soviet Union should, in the meantime, pursue peaceful coexistence and invite foreign investment in order to develop the country's economy and build socialism in one country.\nUltimately, Stalin gained the greatest support within the party, and Trotsky, who was increasingly viewed as a collaborator with outside forces in an effort to depose Stalin, was isolated and subsequently expelled from the party and exiled from the country in 1928. Stalin's policies henceforth would later become collectively known as Stalinism. In 1925, the name of the party was changed to the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), reflecting that the republics outside of Russia proper were no longer part of an all-encompassing Russian state. The acronym was usually transliterated as VKP(b), or sometimes VCP(b). Stalin sought to formalize the party's ideological outlook into a philosophical hybrid of the original ideas of Lenin with orthodox Marxism into what would be called Marxism\u2013Leninism. Stalin's position as General Secretary became the top executive position within the party, giving Stalin significant authority over party and state policy.\nBy the end of the 1920s, diplomatic relations with Western countries were deteriorating to the point that there was a growing fear of another allied attack on the Soviet Union. Within the country, the conditions of the NEP had enabled growing inequalities between increasingly wealthy strata and the remaining poor. The combination of these tensions led the party leadership to conclude that it was necessary for the government's survival to pursue a new policy that would centralize economic activity and accelerate industrialization. To do this, the first five-year plan was implemented in 1928. The plan doubled the industrial workforce, proletarianizing many of the peasants by removing them from their land and assembling them into urban centers. Peasants who remained in agricultural work were also made to have a similarly proletarian relationship to their labor through the policies of collectivization, which turned feudal-style farms into collective farms which would be in a cooperative nature under the direction of the state. These two shifts changed the base of Soviet society towards a more working-class alignment. The plan was fulfilled ahead of schedule in 1932.\nThe success of industrialization in the Soviet Union led Western countries, such as the United States, to open diplomatic relations with the Soviet government. In 1933, after years of unsuccessful workers' revolutions (including a short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic) and spiraling economic calamity, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, violently suppressing the revolutionary organizers and posing a direct threat to the Soviet Union that ideologically supported them. The threat of fascist sabotage and imminent attack greatly exacerbated the already existing tensions within the Soviet Union and the Communist Party. A wave of paranoia overtook Stalin and the party leadership and spread through Soviet society. Seeing potential enemies everywhere, leaders of the government security apparatuses began severe crackdowns known as the Great Purge. In total, hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom were posthumously recognized as innocent, were arrested and either sent to prison camps or executed. Also during this time, a campaign against religion was waged in which the Russian Orthodox Church, which had long been a political arm of Tsarism before the revolution, was ruthlessly repressed, organized religion was generally removed from public life and made into a completely private matter, with many churches, mosques and other shrines being repurposed or demolished.\nThe Soviet Union warned the international community of the potential danger of aggression by Nazi Germany. The Western powers, however, remained committed to maintaining peace and avoiding another war breaking out. Many considered the Soviet Union's warnings to be an unwanted provocation. After many unsuccessful attempts to create an anti-fascist alliance among the Western countries, including trying to rally international support for the Spanish Republic in its struggle against a nationalist military rebellion supported by Germany and Italy, in 1939 the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany, later jointly invading and partitioning Poland to fulfil a secret protocol of the pact, as well as occupying the Baltic States. This pact would be broken in June 1941 when the German military invaded the Soviet Union in the largest land invasion in history, beginning the Great Patriotic War.\nThe Communist International was dissolved in 1943 after it was concluded that such an organization had failed to prevent the rise of fascism and the global war necessary to defeat it. After the 1945 Allied victory in World War II, the Party held to a doctrine of establishing socialist governments in the post-war occupied territories that would be administered by Communists loyal to Stalin's administration. The party also sought to expand its sphere of influence beyond the occupied territories, using proxy wars and espionage and providing training and funding to promote Communist elements abroad, leading to the establishment of the Cominform in 1947.\nIn 1949, the Chinese Communist Party emerged victorious in the Chinese Civil War. This caused a major shift in the global balance of forces and greatly escalated tensions between the Communists and the Western powers, fueling the Cold War. In Europe, Yugoslavia, under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito, acquired the territory of Trieste, causing conflict both with the Western powers and with Stalin, who opposed such a provocative move. Furthermore, the Yugoslav Communists actively supported the Greek Communists during their civil war, further frustrating the Soviet government. These tensions led to a Tito\u2013Stalin split, which marked the beginning of international sectarian division within the world Communist movement.\nPost-Stalin years (1953\u20131985).\nAfter Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev rose to the top post by overcoming political adversaries, including Lavrentiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov, in a power struggle. In 1955, Khrushchev achieved the demotion of Malenkov and secured his own position as Soviet leader. Early in his rule and with the support of several members of the Presidium, Khrushchev initiated the Thaw, which effectively ended the Stalinist mass terror of the prior decades and reduced socio-economic oppression considerably. At the 20th Congress held in 1956, Khrushchev denounced Stalin's crimes, being careful to omit any reference to complicity by any sitting Presidium members. His economic policies, while bringing about improvements, were not enough to fix the fundamental problems of the Soviet economy. The standard of living for ordinary citizens did increase; 108 million people moved into new housing between 1956 and 1965.\nKhrushchev's foreign policies led to the Sino-Soviet split, in part a consequence of his public denunciation of Stalin. Khrushchev improved relations with Josip Broz Tito's League of Communists of Yugoslavia but failed to establish the close, party-to-party relations that he wanted. While the Thaw reduced political oppression at home, it led to unintended consequences abroad, such as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and unrest in Poland, where the local citizenry now felt confident enough to rebel against Soviet control. Khrushchev also failed to improve Soviet relations with the West, partially because of a hawkish military stance. In the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Khrushchev's position within the party was substantially weakened. Shortly before his eventual ousting, he tried to introduce economic reforms championed by Evsei Liberman, a Soviet economist, which tried to implement market mechanisms into the planned economy.\nKhrushchev was ousted on 14 October 1964 in a Central Committee plenum that officially cited his inability to listen to others, his failure in consulting with the members of the Presidium, his establishment of a cult of personality, his economic mismanagement, and his anti-party reforms as the reasons he was no longer fit to remain as head of the party. He was succeeded in office by Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers.\nThe Brezhnev era began with a rejection of Khrushchevism in virtually every arena except one: continued opposition to Stalinist methods of terror and political violence. Khrushchev's policies were criticized as voluntarism, and the Brezhnev period saw the rise of neo-Stalinism. While Stalin was never rehabilitated during this period, the most conservative journals in the country were allowed to highlight positive features of his rule.\nAt the 23rd Congress held in 1966, the names of the office of First Secretary and the body of the Presidium reverted to their original names: General Secretary and Politburo, respectively. At the start of his premiership, Kosygin experimented with economic reforms similar to those championed by Malenkov, including prioritizing light industry over heavy industry to increase the production of consumer goods. Similar reforms were introduced in Hungary under the name New Economic Mechanism; however, with the rise to power of Alexander Dub\u010dek in Czechoslovakia, who called for the establishment of \"socialism with a human face\", all non-conformist reform attempts in the Soviet Union were stopped.\nDuring his rule, Brezhnev supported \"d\u00e9tente\", a passive weakening of animosity with the West with the goal of improving political and economic relations. However, by the 25th Congress held in 1976, political, economic and social problems within the Soviet Union began to mount, and the Brezhnev administration found itself in an increasingly difficult position. The previous year, Brezhnev's health began to deteriorate. He became addicted to painkillers and needed to take increasingly more potent medications to attend official meetings. Because of the \"trust in cadres\" policy implemented by his administration, the CPSU leadership evolved into a gerontocracy. At the end of Brezhnev's rule, problems continued to amount; in 1979 he consented to the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan to save the embattled communist regime there and supported the oppression of the Solidarity movement in Poland. As problems grew at home and abroad, Brezhnev was increasingly ineffective in responding to the growing criticism of the Soviet Union by Western leaders, most prominently by US presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher. The CPSU, which had wishfully interpreted the financial crisis of the 1970s as the beginning of the end of capitalism, found its country falling far behind the West in its economic development. Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982, and was succeeded by Yuri Andropov on 12 November.\nAndropov, a staunch anti-Stalinist, chaired the KGB during most of Brezhnev's reign. He had appointed several reformers to leadership positions in the KGB, many of whom later became leading officials under Gorbachev. Andropov supported increased openness in the press, particularly regarding the challenges facing the Soviet Union. Andropov was in office briefly, but he appointed a number of reformers, including Yegor Ligachev, Nikolay Ryzhkov, and Mikhail Gorbachev, to important positions. He also supported a crackdown on absenteeism and corruption. Andropov had intended to let Gorbachev succeed him in office, but Konstantin Chernenko and his supporters suppressed the paragraph in the letter which called for Gorbachev's elevation. Andropov died on 9 February 1984 and was succeeded by Chernenko. The elderly Chernenko was in poor health throughout his short leadership and was unable to consolidate power; effective control of the party organization remained with Gorbachev. When Chernenko died on 10 March 1985, his succession was already settled in favor of Gorbachev.\nGorbachev and the party's demise (1985\u20131991).\nThe Politburo did not want another elderly and frail leader after its previous three leaders, and elected Gorbachev as CPSU General Secretary on 11 March 1985, one day after Chernenko's death. When Gorbachev acceded to power, the Soviet Union was stagnating but was stable and might have continued largely unchanged into the 21st century if not for Gorbachev's reforms.\nGorbachev conducted a significant personnel reshuffling of the CPSU leadership, forcing old party conservatives out of office. In 1985 and early 1986 the new leadership of the party called for \"uskoreniye\" (). Gorbachev reinvigorated the party ideology, adding new concepts and updating older ones. Positive consequences of this included the allowance of \"pluralism of thought\" and a call for the establishment of \"socialist pluralism\" (literally, socialist democracy). Gorbachev introduced a policy of glasnost (, meaning \"openness\" or \"transparency\") in 1986, which led to a wave of unintended democratization. According to the British researcher of Russian affairs, Archie Brown, the democratization of the Soviet Union brought mixed blessings to Gorbachev; it helped him to weaken his conservative opponents within the party but brought out accumulated grievances which had been suppressed during the previous decades.\nIn reaction to these changes, a conservative movement gained momentum in 1987 in response to Boris Yeltsin's dismissal as First Secretary of the CPSU Moscow City Committee. On 13 March 1988, Nina Andreyeva, a university lecturer, wrote an article titled \"I Cannot Forsake My Principles\". The publication was planned to occur when both Gorbachev and his protege Alexander Yakovlev were visiting foreign countries. In their place, Yegor Ligachev led the party organization and told journalists that the article was \"a benchmark for what we need in our ideology today\". Upon Gorbachev's return, the article was discussed at length during a Politburo meeting; it was revealed that nearly half of its members were sympathetic to the letter and opposed further reforms which could weaken the party. The meeting lasted for two days, but on 5 April a Politburo resolution responded with a point-by-point rebuttal to Andreyeva's article.\nGorbachev convened the 19th Party Conference in June 1988. He criticized leading party conservatives\u2014Ligachev, Andrei Gromyko and Mikhail Solomentsev. In turn, conservative delegates attacked Gorbachev and the reformers. According to Brown, there had not been as much open discussion and dissent at a party meeting since the early 1920s.\nDespite the deep-seated opposition to further reform, the CPSU remained hierarchical; the conservatives acceded to Gorbachev's demands in deference to his position as the CPSU General Secretary. The 19th Conference approved the establishment of the Congress of People's Deputies (CPD) and allowed for contested elections between the CPSU and independent candidates. Other organized parties were not allowed. The CPD was elected in 1989; one-third of the seats were appointed by the CPSU and other public organizations to sustain the Soviet one-party state. The elections were democratic, but most elected CPD members opposed any more radical reform. The elections featured the highest electoral turnout in Russian history; no election before or since had a higher participation rate. An organized opposition was established within the legislature under the name Inter-Regional Group of Deputies by dissident Andrei Sakharov. An unintended consequence of these reforms was the increased anti-CPSU pressure; in March 1990, at a session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the party was forced to relinquish its political monopoly of power, in effect turning the Soviet Union into a liberal democracy.\nThe CPSU's demise began in March 1990, when state bodies eclipsed party elements in power. From then until the Soviet Union's disestablishment, Gorbachev ruled the country through the newly created post of President of the Soviet Union. Following this, the central party apparatus did not play a practical role in Soviet affairs. Gorbachev had become independent from the Politburo and faced few constraints from party leaders. In the summer of 1990 the party convened the 28th Congress. A new Politburo was elected, previous incumbents (except Gorbachev and Vladimir Ivashko, the CPSU Deputy General Secretary) were removed. Later that year, the party began work on a new program with a working title, \"Towards a Humane, Democratic Socialism\". According to Brown, the program reflected Gorbachev's journey from an orthodox communist to a European social democrat. The freedoms of thought and organization which Gorbachev allowed led to a rise in nationalism in the Soviet republics, indirectly weakening the central authorities. In response to this, a referendum took place in 1991, in which most of the union republics voted to preserve the union in a different form. In reaction to this, conservative elements within the CPSU launched the August 1991 coup, which overthrew Gorbachev but failed to preserve the Soviet Union. When Gorbachev resumed control (21 August 1991) after the coup's collapse, he resigned from the CPSU on 24 August 1991 and operations were handed over to Ivashko. On 29 August 1991 the activity of the CPSU was suspended throughout the country, on 6 November Yeltsin banned the activities of the party in Russia and Gorbachev resigned from the presidency on 25 December; the following day the Soviet of Republics dissolved the Soviet Union.\nOn 30 November 1992, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation recognized the ban on the activities of the primary organizations of the Communist Party, formed on a territorial basis, as inconsistent with the Constitution of Russia, but upheld the dissolution of the governing structures of the CPSU and the governing structures of its republican organization\u2014the Communist Party of the RSFSR.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganized themselves within the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF). Today a wide range of parties in Russia present themselves as successors of CPSU. Several of them have used the name \"CPSU\". However, the CPRF is generally seen (due to its massive size) as the heir of the CPSU in Russia. Additionally, the CPRF was initially founded as the Communist Party of the Russian SFSR in 1990 (sometime before the abolition of the CPSU) and was seen by critics as a \"Russian-nationalist\" counterpart to the CPSU.\nGoverning style.\nThe style of governance in the party alternated between collective leadership and a cult of personality. Collective leadership split power between the Politburo, the Central Committee, and the Council of Ministers to hinder any attempts to create a one-man dominance over the Soviet political system. By contrast, Stalin's period as leader was characterized by an extensive cult of personality. Regardless of leadership style, all political power in the Soviet Union was concentrated in the organization of the CPSU.\nDemocratic centralism.\nDemocratic centralism is an organizational principle conceived by Lenin. According to Soviet pronouncements, democratic centralism was distinguished from \"bureaucratic centralism\", which referred to high-handed formulae without knowledge or discussion. In democratic centralism, decisions are taken after discussions, but once the general party line has been formed, discussion on the subject must cease. No member or organizational institution may dissent on a policy after it has been agreed upon by the party's governing body; to do so would lead to expulsion from the party (formalized at the 10th Congress). Because of this stance, Lenin initiated a ban on factions, which was approved at the 10th Congress.\nLenin believed that democratic centralism safeguarded both party unity and ideological correctness. He conceived of the system after the events of 1917 when several socialist parties \"deformed\" themselves and actively began supporting nationalist sentiments. Lenin intended that the devotion to policy required by centralism would protect the parties from such revisionist ills and bourgeois deformation of socialism. Lenin supported the notion of a highly centralized vanguard party, in which ordinary party members elected the local party committee, the local party committee elected the regional committee, the regional committee elected the Central Committee, and the Central Committee elected the Politburo, Orgburo, and the Secretariat. Lenin believed that the party needed to be ruled from the center and have at its disposal power to mobilize party members at will. This system was later introduced in communist parties abroad through the Communist International (Comintern).\nVanguardism.\nA central tenet of Leninism was that of the vanguard party. In a capitalist society, the party was to represent the interests of the working class and all of those who were exploited by capitalism in general; however, it was not to become a part of that class. Lenin decided that the party's sole responsibility was to articulate and plan the long-term interests of the oppressed classes. It was not responsible for the daily grievances of those classes; that was the responsibility of the trade unions. According to Lenin, the party and the oppressed classes could never become one because the party was responsible for leading the oppressed classes to victory. The basic idea was that a small group of organized people could wield power disproportionate to their size with superior organizational skills. Despite this, until the end of his life, Lenin warned of the danger that the party could be taken over by bureaucrats, by a small clique, or by an individual. Toward the end of his life, he criticized the bureaucratic inertia of certain officials and admitted to problems with some of the party's control structures, which were to supervise organizational life.\nOrganization.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCongress.\nThe Congress, nominally the highest organ of the party, was convened every five years. Leading up to the October Revolution and until Stalin's consolidation of power, the Congress was the party's main decision-making body. However, after Stalin's ascension, the Congresses became largely symbolic. CPSU leaders used Congresses as a propaganda and control tool. The most noteworthy Congress since the 1930s was the 20th Congress, in which Khrushchev denounced Stalin in a speech titled \"The Personality Cult and its Consequences\".\nDespite delegates to Congresses losing their powers to criticize or remove party leadership, the Congresses functioned as a form of elite-mass communication. They were occasions for the party leadership to express the party line over the next five years to ordinary CPSU members and the general public. The information provided was general, ensuring that party leadership retained the ability to make specific policy changes as they saw fit.\nThe Congresses also provided the party leadership with formal legitimacy by providing a mechanism for the election of new members and the retirement of old members who had lost favor. The elections at Congresses were all predetermined and the candidates who stood for seats to the Central Committee and the Central Auditing Commission were approved beforehand by the Politburo and the Secretariat. A Congress could also provide a platform for the announcement of new ideological concepts. For instance, at the 22nd Congress, Khrushchev announced that the Soviet Union would see \"communism in twenty years\"\u2014 a position later retracted.\nA Conference, officially referred to as an All-Union Conference, was convened between Congresses by the Central Committee to discuss party policy and to make personnel changes within the Central Committee. 19 conferences were convened during the CPSU's existence. The 19th Congress held in 1952 removed the clause in the party's statute which stipulated that a party Conference could be convened. The clause was reinstated at the 23rd Congress, which was held in 1966.\nCentral Committee.\nThe Central Committee was a collective body elected at the annual party congress. It was mandated to meet at least twice a year to act as the party's supreme governing body. Membership of the Central Committee increased from 71 full members in 1934 to 287 in 1976. Central Committee members were elected to the seats because of the offices they held, not on their personal merit. Because of this, the Central Committee was commonly considered an indicator for Sovietologists to study the strength of the different institutions. The Politburo was elected by and reported to the Central Committee. Besides the Politburo, the Central Committee also elected the Secretariat and the general secretary\u2014the \"de facto\" leader of the Soviet Union. In 1919\u20131952, the Orgburo was also elected in the same manner as the Politburo and the Secretariat by the plenums of the Central Committee. In between Central Committee plenums, the Politburo and the Secretariat were legally empowered to make decisions on its behalf. The Central Committee or the Politburo and/or Secretariat on its behalf could issue nationwide decisions; decisions on behalf of the party were transmitted from the top to the bottom.\nUnder Lenin, the Central Committee functioned much as the Politburo did during the post-Stalin era, serving as the party's governing body. However, as the membership in the Central Committee increased, its role was eclipsed by the Politburo. Between Congresses, the Central Committee functioned as the Soviet leadership's source of legitimacy. The decline in the Central Committee's standing began in the 1920s; it was reduced to a compliant body of the Party leadership during the Great Purge. According to party rules, the Central Committee was to convene at least twice a year to discuss political matters\u2014but not matters relating to military policy. The body remained largely symbolic after Stalin's consolidation; leading party officials rarely attended meetings of the Central Committee.\nCentral Auditing Commission.\nThe Central Auditing Commission (CAC) was elected by the party Congresses and reported only to the party Congress. It had about as many members as the Central Committee. It was responsible for supervising the expeditious and proper handling of affairs by the central bodies of the Party; it audited the accounts of the Treasury and the enterprises of the Central Committee. It was also responsible for supervising the Central Committee apparatus, making sure that its directives were implemented and that Central Committee directives complied with the party Statute.\nStatute.\nThe Statute (also referred to as the Rules, Charter and Constitution) was the party's by-laws and controlled life within the CPSU. The 1st Statute was adopted at the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party\u2014the forerunner of the CPSU. How the Statute was to be structured and organized led to a schism within the party, leading to the establishment of two competing factions; Bolsheviks (literally \"majority\") and Mensheviks (literally \"minority\"). The 1st Statute was based upon Lenin's idea of a centralized vanguard party. The 4th Congress, despite a majority of Menshevik delegates, added the concept of democratic centralism to Article 2 of the Statute. The 1st Statute lasted until 1919 when the 8th Congress adopted the 2nd Statute. It was nearly five times as long as the 1st Statute and contained 66 articles. It was amended at the 9th Congress. At the 11th Congress, the 3rd Statute was adopted with only minor amendments being made. New statutes were approved at the 17th and 18th Congresses respectively. The last party statute, which existed until the dissolution of the CPSU, was adopted at the 22nd Congress.\nCentral Committee apparatus.\nGeneral Secretary.\nGeneral Secretary of the Central Committee was the title given to the overall leader of the party. The office was synonymous with the leader of the Soviet Union after Joseph Stalin's consolidation of power in the 1920s. Stalin used the office of General Secretary to create a strong power base for himself. The office was formally titled \"First Secretary\" between 1953 and 1966.\nPolitburo.\nThe Political Bureau (Politburo), known as the Presidium from 1952 to 1966, was the highest party organ when the Congress and the Central Committee were not in session. Until the 19th Conference in 1988, the Politburo alongside the Secretariat controlled appointments and dismissals nationwide. In the post-Stalin period, the Politburo controlled the Central Committee apparatus through two channels; the General Department distributed the Politburo's orders to the Central Committee departments and through the personnel overlap which existed within the Politburo and the Secretariat. This personnel overlap gave the CPSU General Secretary a way of strengthening his position within the Politburo through the Secretariat. Kirill Mazurov, Politburo member from 1965 to 1978, accused Brezhnev of turning the Politburo into a \"second echelon\" of power. He accomplished this by discussing policies before Politburo meetings with Mikhail Suslov, Andrei Kirilenko, Fyodor Kulakov, and Dmitriy Ustinov among others, who held seats both in the Politburo and the Secretariat. Mazurov's claim was later verified by Nikolai Ryzhkov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers under Gorbachev. Ryzhkov said that Politburo meetings lasted only 15 minutes because the people close to Brezhnev had already decided what was to be approved.\nThe Politburo was abolished and replaced by a Presidium in 1952 at the 19th Congress. In the aftermath the 19th Congress and the 1st Plenum of the 19th Central Committee, Stalin ordered the creation of the Bureau of the Presidium, which acted as the standing committee of the Presidium. On 6 March 1953, one day after Stalin's death, a new and smaller Presidium was elected, and the Bureau of the Presidium was abolished in a joint session with the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers.\nUntil 1990, the CPSU General Secretary acted as the informal chairman of the Politburo. During the first decades of the CPSU's existence, the Politburo was officially chaired by the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars; first by Lenin, then by Aleksey Rykov, Molotov, Stalin, and Malenkov. After 1922, when Lenin was incapacitated, Lev Kamenev as Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars chaired the Politburo's meetings. This tradition lasted until Khrushchev's consolidation of power. In the first post-Stalin years, when Malenkov chaired Politburo meetings, Khrushchev as First Secretary signed all Central Committee documents into force. From 1954 until 1958, Khrushchev chaired the Politburo as First Secretary, but in 1958 he dismissed and succeeded Nikolai Bulganin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. During this period, the informal position of Second Secretary\u2014later formalized as Deputy General Secretary\u2014was established. The Second Secretary became responsible for chairing the Secretariat in place of the General Secretary. When the General Secretary could not chair the meetings of the Politburo, the Second Secretary would take his place. This system survived until the dissolution of the CPSU in 1991.\nTo be elected to the Politburo, a member had to serve in the Central Committee. The Central Committee elected the Politburo in the aftermath of a party Congress. Members of the Central Committee were given a predetermined list of candidates for the Politburo having only one candidate for each seat; for this reason, the election of the Politburo was usually passed unanimously. The greater the power held by the sitting CPSU General Secretary, the higher the chance that the Politburo membership would be approved.\nSecretariat.\nThe Secretariat headed the CPSU's central apparatus and was solely responsible for the development and implementation of party policies. It was legally empowered to take over the duties and functions of the Central Committee when it was not in plenum (holding a meeting). Many members of the Secretariat concurrently held a seat in the Politburo. According to a Soviet textbook on party procedures, the Secretariat's role was that of \"leadership of current work, chiefly in the realm of personnel selection and in the organization of the verification of fulfillment of party-state decisions\". \"Selections of personnel\" () in this instance meant the maintenance of general standards and the criteria for selecting various personnel. \"Verification of fulfillment\" () of party and state decisions meant that the Secretariat instructed other bodies.\nThe powers of the Secretariat were weakened under Mikhail Gorbachev, and the Central Committee Commissions took over the functions of the Secretariat in 1988. Yegor Ligachev, a Secretariat member, said that the changes completely destroyed the Secretariat's hold on power and made the body almost superfluous. Because of this, the Secretariat rarely met during the next two years. It was revitalized at the 28th Party Congress in 1990, and the Deputy General Secretary became the official head of the Secretariat.\nOrgburo.\nThe Organizational Bureau, or Orgburo, existed from 1919 to 1952 and was one of three leading bodies of the party when the Central Committee was not in session. It was responsible for \"organizational questions, the recruitment, and allocation of personnel, the coordination of activities of the party, government and social organizations (e.g., trade unions and youth organizations), improvement to the party's structure, the distribution of information and reports within the party\". The 19th Congress abolished the Orgburo and its duties and responsibilities were taken over by the Secretariat. At the beginning, the Orgburo held three meetings a week and reported to the Central Committee every second week. Lenin described the relation between the Politburo and the Orgburo as \"the Orgburo allocates forces, while the Politburo decides policy\". A decision of the Orgburo was implemented by the Secretariat. However, the Secretariat could make decisions in the Orgburo's name without consulting its members, but if one Orgburo member objected to a Secretariat resolution, the resolution would not be implemented. In the 1920s, if the Central Committee could not convene the Politburo and the Orgburo would hold a joint session in its place.\nControl Commission.\nThe Central Control Commission (CCC) functioned as the party's supreme court. The CCC was established at the 9th All-Russian Conference in September 1920, but rules organizing its procedure were not enacted before the 10th Congress. The 10th Congress formally established the CCC on all party levels and stated that it could only be elected at a party congress or a party conference. The CCC and the CCs were formally independent but had to make decisions through the party committees at their level, which led them in practice to lose their administrative independence. At first, the primary responsibility of the CCs was to respond to party complaints, focusing mostly on party complaints of factionalism and bureaucratism. At the 11th Congress, the brief of the CCs was expanded; it became responsible for overseeing party discipline. In a bid to further centralize the powers of the CCC, a Presidium of the CCC, which functioned in a similar manner to the Politburo in relation to the Central Committee, was established in 1923. At the 18th Congress, party rules regarding the CCC were changed; it was now elected by the Central Committee and was subordinate to the Central Committee.\nCCC members could not concurrently be members of the Central Committee. To create an organizational link between the CCC and other central-level organs, the 9th All-Russian Conference created the joint CC\u2013CCC plenums. The CCC was a powerful organ; the 10th Congress allowed it to expel full and candidate Central Committee members and members of their subordinate organs if two-thirds of attendants at a CC\u2013CCC plenum voted for such. At its first such session in 1921, Lenin tried to persuade the joint plenum to expel Alexander Shliapnikov from the party; instead of expelling him, Shliapnikov was given a severe reprimand.\nDepartments.\nThe leader of a department was usually given the title \"head\" (). In practice, the Secretariat had a major say in the running of the departments; for example, five of eleven secretaries headed their own departments in 1978. Normally, specific secretaries were given supervising duties over one or more departments. Each department established its own cells\u2014called sections\u2014which specialized in one or more fields. During the Gorbachev era, a variety of departments made up the Central Committee apparatus. The Party Building and Cadre Work Department assigned party personnel in the nomenklatura system. The State and Legal Department supervised the armed forces, KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the trade unions, and the Procuracy. Before 1989, the Central Committee had several departments, but some were abolished that year. Among these departments was the Economics Department that was responsible for the economy as a whole, one for machine building, one for the chemical industry, etc. The party abolished these departments to remove itself from the day-to-day management of the economy in favor of government bodies and a greater role for the market, as a part of the perestroika process. In their place, Gorbachev called for the creations of commissions with the same responsibilities as departments, but giving more independence from the state apparatus. This change was approved at the 19th Conference, which was held in 1988. Six commissions were established by late 1988.\n\"Pravda\".\n\"Pravda\" (\"The Truth\") was the leading newspaper in the Soviet Union. The Organizational Department of the Central Committee was the only organ empowered to dismiss \"Pravda\" editors. In 1905, \"Pravda\" began as a project by members of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party. Leon Trotsky was approached about the possibility of running the new paper because of his previous work on Ukrainian newspaper \"Kyivan Thought\". The first issue of \"Pravda\" was published on 3 October 1908 in Lvov, where it continued until the publication of the sixth issue in November 1909, when the operation was moved to Vienna, Austria-Hungary. During the Russian Civil War, sales of \"Pravda\" were curtailed by \"Izvestia\", the government run newspaper. At the time, the average reading figure for \"Pravda\" was 130,000. This Vienna-based newspaper published its last issue in 1912 and was succeeded the same year by a new newspaper dominated by the Bolsheviks, also called \"Pravda\", which was headquartered in St. Petersburg. The paper's main goal was to promote Marxist\u2013Leninist philosophy and expose the lies of the bourgeoisie. In 1975, the paper reached a circulation of 10.6 million. It is currently owned by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.\nHigher Party School.\nThe Higher Party School (HPS) was the organ responsible for teaching cadres in the Soviet Union. It was the successor of the Communist Academy, which was established in 1918. The HPS was established in 1939 as the Moscow Higher Party School and it offered its students a two-year training course for becoming a CPSU official. It was reorganized in 1956 to that it could offer more specialized ideological training. In 1956, the school in Moscow was opened for students from socialist countries outside the Soviet Union. The Moscow Higher Party School was the party school with the highest standing. The school itself had eleven faculties until a 1972 Central Committee resolution demanded a reorganization of the curriculum. The first regional HPS outside Moscow was established in 1946 and by the early 1950s there were 70 Higher Party Schools. During the reorganization drive of 1956, Khrushchev closed 13 of them and reclassified 29 as inter-republican and inter-oblast schools.\nLower-level organization.\nRepublican and local organization.\nThe lowest organ above the primary party organization (PPO) was the district level. Every two years, the local PPO would elect delegates to the district-level party conference, which was overseen by a secretary from a higher party level. The conference elected a Party Committee and First Secretary and re-declared the district's commitment to the CPSU's program. In between conferences, the \"raion\" party committee\u2014commonly referred to as \"raikom\"\u2014was vested with ultimate authority. It convened at least six times a year to discuss party directives and to oversee the implementation of party policies in their respective districts, to oversee the implementation of party directives at the PPO-level, and to issue directives to PPOs. 75\u201380 percent of raikom members were full members, while the remaining 20\u201325 were non-voting, candidate members. Raikom members were commonly from the state sector, party sector, Komsomol or the trade unions.\nDay-to-day responsibility of the raikom was handed over to a Politburo, which usually composed of 12 members. The district-level First Secretary chaired the meetings of the local Politburo and the raikom, and was the direct link between the district and the higher party echelons. The First Secretary was responsible for the smooth running of operations. The raikom was headed by the local apparat\u2014the local agitation department or industry department. A raikom usually had no more than 4 or 5 departments, each of which was responsible for overseeing the work of the state sector but would not interfere in their work.\nThis system remained identical at all other levels of the CPSU hierarchy. The other levels were cities, oblasts (regions) and republics. The district-level elected delegates to a conference held at least every three years to elect the party committee. The only difference between the oblast and the district level was that the oblast had its own Secretariat and had more departments at its disposal. The oblast's party committee in turn elected delegates to the republican-level Congress, which was held every five years. The Congress then elected the Central Committee of the republic, which in turn elected a First Secretary and a Politburo. Until 1990, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was the only republic that did not have its own republican branch, being instead represented by the CPSU Central Committee.\nPrimary party organizations.\nThe primary party organization (PPO) was the lowest level in the CPSU hierarchy. PPOs were organized cells consisting of three or more members. A PPO could exist anywhere; for example, in a factory or a student dormitory. They functioned as the party's \"eyes and ears\" at the lowest level and were used to mobilize support for party policies. All CPSU members had to be a member of a local PPO. The size of a PPO varied from three people to several hundred, depending upon its setting. In a large enterprise, a PPO usually had several hundred members. In such cases, the PPO was divided into bureaus based upon production-units. Each PPO was led by an executive committee and an executive committee secretary. Each executive committee is responsible for the PPO executive committee and its secretary. In small PPOs, members met periodically to mainly discuss party policies, ideology, or practical matters. In such a case, the PPO secretary was responsible for collecting party dues, reporting to higher organs, and maintaining the party records. A secretary could be elected democratically through a secret ballot, but that was not often the case; in 1979, only 88 out of the over 400,000 PPOs were elected in this fashion. The remainder were chosen by a higher party organ and ratified by the general meetings of the PPO. The PPO general meeting was responsible for electing delegates to the party conference at either the district- or town-level, depending on where the PPO was located.\nMembership.\nMembership of the party was not open. To become a party member, one had to be approved by various committees, and one's past was closely scrutinized. As generations grew up having known nothing before the Soviet Union, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the Young Pioneers and, at the age of 14, might graduate to the Komsomol (Young Communist League). Ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to party discipline\u2014or had the right connections, one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. Membership of the party carried obligations as it expected Komsomol and CPSU members to pay dues and to carry out appropriate assignments and \"social tasks\" ().\nIn 1918, party membership was approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in an intensive recruitment campaign, the \"Lenin Levy\", resulting in new members referred to as the Lenin Enrolment, from both the working class and rural areas. This represented an attempt to \"proletarianize\" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the Party. In 1925, the party had 1,025,000 members in a Soviet population of 147 million. In 1927, membership had risen to 1,200,000. During the collectivization campaign and industrialization campaigns of the first five-year plan from 1929 to 1933, party membership grew rapidly to approximately 3.5 million members. However, party leaders suspected that the mass intake of new members had allowed \"social-alien elements\" to penetrate the party's ranks and document verifications of membership ensued in 1933 and 1935, removing supposedly unreliable members. Meanwhile, the party closed its ranks to new members from 1933 to November 1936. Even after the reopening of party recruiting, membership fell to 1.9 million by 1939. Nicholas DeWitt gives 2.307 million members in 1939, including candidate members, compared with 1.535 million in 1929 and 6.3 million in 1947. In 1986, the CPSU had over 19 million members\u2014approximately 10% of the Soviet Union's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers and 12% as collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the Soviet Union's 15 republics. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself had no separate Communist Party until 1990 because the CPSU controlled affairs there directly.\nKomsomol.\nThe All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League, commonly referred to as Komsomol, was the party's youth wing. The Komsomol acted under the direction of the CPSU Central Committee. It was responsible for indoctrinating youths in communist ideology and organizing social events. It was closely modeled on the CPSU; nominally the highest body was the Congress, followed by the Central Committee, Secretariat, and the Politburo. The Komsomol participated in nationwide policy-making by appointing members to the collegiums of the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Higher and Specialized Secondary Education, the Ministry of Education and, the State Committee for Physical Culture and Sports. The organization's newspaper was the \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\". The First Secretary and the Second Secretary were commonly members of the Central Committee but were never elected to the Politburo. However, at the republican level, several Komsomol first secretaries were appointed to the Politburo.\nIdeology.\nMarxism\u2013Leninism.\nMarxism\u2013Leninism was the cornerstone of Soviet ideology. It explained and legitimized the CPSU's right to rule while explaining its role as a vanguard party. For instance, the ideology explained that the CPSU's policies, even if they were unpopular, were correct because the party was enlightened. It was represented as the only truth in Soviet society; the party rejected the notion of multiple truths. Marxism\u2013Leninism was used to justify CPSU rule and Soviet policy, but it was not used as a means to an end. The relationship between ideology and decision-making was at best ambivalent; most policy decisions were made in the light of the continued, permanent development of Marxism\u2013Leninism. Marxism\u2013Leninism as the only truth could not\u2014by its very nature\u2014become outdated.\nDespite having evolved over the years, Marxism\u2013Leninism had several central tenets. The main tenet was the party's status as the sole ruling party. The 1977 Constitution referred to the party as \"The leading and guiding force of Soviet society, and the nucleus of its political system, of all state and public organizations, is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\". State socialism was essential and from Stalin until Gorbachev, official discourse considered that private social and economic activity obstructed the development of collective consciousness and the economy. Gorbachev supported privatization to a degree but based his policies on Lenin's and Nikolai Bukharin's opinions of the New Economic Policy of the 1920s, and supported complete state ownership over the commanding heights of the economy. Unlike liberalism, Marxism\u2013Leninism stressed the role of the individual as a member of a collective rather than the importance of the individual. Individuals only had the right to freedom of expression if it safeguarded the interests of a collective. For instance, the 1977 Constitution stated that every person had the right to express his or her opinion, but the opinion could only be expressed if it was in accordance with the \"general interests of Soviet society\". The number of rights granted to an individual was decided by the state, and the state could remove these rights if it saw fit. Soviet Marxism\u2013Leninism justified nationalism; the Soviet media portrayed every victory of the state as a victory for the communist movement as a whole. Largely, Soviet nationalism was based upon ethnic Russian nationalism. Marxism\u2013Leninism stressed the importance of the worldwide conflict between capitalism and socialism; the Soviet press wrote about progressive and reactionary forces while claiming that socialism was on the verge of victory and that the \"correlations of forces\" were in the Soviet Union's favor. The ideology professed state atheism and party members were consequently not allowed to be religious.\nMarxism\u2013Leninism believed in the feasibility of a communist mode of production. All policies were justifiable if it contributed to the Soviet Union's achievement of that stage.\nLeninism.\nIn Marxist philosophy, Leninism is the body of political theory for the democratic organization of a revolutionary vanguard party and the achievement of a dictatorship of the proletariat as a political prelude to the establishment of the socialist mode of production developed by Lenin. Since Karl Marx rarely, if ever wrote about how the socialist mode of production would function, these tasks were left for Lenin to solve. Lenin's main contribution to Marxist thought is the concept of the vanguard party of the working class. He conceived the vanguard party as a highly knit, centralized organization that was led by intellectuals rather than by the working class itself. The CPSU was open only to a small number of workers because the workers in Russia still had not developed class consciousness and needed to be educated to reach such a state. Lenin believed that the vanguard party could initiate policies in the name of the working class even if the working class did not support them. The vanguard party would know what was best for the workers because the party functionaries had attained consciousness.\nLenin, in light of the Marx's theory of the state (which views the state as an oppressive organ of the ruling class), had no qualms of forcing change upon the country. He viewed the dictatorship of the proletariat, rather than the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, to be the dictatorship of the majority. The repressive powers of the state were to be used to transform the country, and to strip of the former ruling class of their wealth. Lenin believed that the transition from the capitalist mode of production to the socialist mode of production would last for a long period. According to some authors, Leninism was by definition authoritarian. In contrast to Marx, who believed that the socialist revolution would comprise and be led by the working class alone, Lenin argued that a socialist revolution did not necessarily need to be led or to comprise the working class alone. Instead, he said that a revolution needed to be led by the oppressed classes of society, which in the case of Russia was the peasant class.\nStalinism.\nStalinism, while not an ideology \"per se\", refers to Stalin's thoughts and policies. Stalin's introduction of the concept \"Socialism in One Country\" in 1924 was an important moment in Soviet ideological discourse. According to Stalin, the Soviet Union did not need a socialist world revolution to construct a socialist society. Four years later, Stalin initiated his \"Second Revolution\" with the introduction of state socialism and central planning. In the early 1930s, he initiated the collectivization of Soviet agriculture by de-privatizing agriculture and creating peasant cooperatives rather than making it the responsibility of the state. With the initiation of his \"Second Revolution\", Stalin launched the \"Cult of Lenin\"\u2014a cult of personality centered upon himself. The name of the city of Petrograd was changed to Leningrad, the town of Lenin's birth was renamed Ulyanov (Lenin's birth-name), the Order of Lenin became the highest state award and portraits of Lenin were hung in public squares, workplaces and elsewhere. The increasing bureaucracy which followed the introduction of a state socialist economy was at complete odds with the Marxist notion of \"the withering away of the state\". Stalin explained the reasoning behind it at the 16th Congress held in 1930;\nWe stand for the strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which represents the mightiest and most powerful authority of all forms of State that have ever existed. The highest development of the State power for the withering away of State power \u2014this is the Marxian formula. Is this contradictory? Yes, it is contradictory. But this contradiction springs from life itself and reflects completely Marxist dialectic.\nAt the 1939 18th Congress, Stalin abandoned the idea that the state would wither away. In its place, he expressed confidence that the state would exist, even if the Soviet Union reached communism, as long as it was encircled by capitalism. Two key concepts were created in the latter half of his rule; the \"two camps\" theory and the \"capitalist encirclement\" theory. The threat of capitalism was used to strengthen Stalin's personal powers and Soviet propaganda began making a direct link with Stalin and stability in society, saying that the country would crumble without the leader. Stalin deviated greatly from classical Marxism on the subject of \"subjective factors\"; Stalin said that party members of all ranks had to profess fanatic adherence to the party's line and ideology, if not, those policies would fail.\nConcepts.\nDictatorship of the proletariat.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEither the dictatorship of the landowners and capitalists or the dictatorship of the proletariat ... There is no middle course ... There is no middle course anywhere in the world, nor can there be.\n\u2014 Lenin, claiming that people had only two choices between two different, but distinct class dictatorships\nLenin, supporting Marx's theory of the state, believed democracy to be unattainable anywhere in the world before the proletariat seized power. According to Marxist theory, the state is a vehicle for oppression and is headed by a ruling class. He believed that by his time, the only viable solution was dictatorship since the war was heading into a final conflict between the \"progressive forces of socialism and the degenerate forces of capitalism\". The Russian Revolution was by 1917, already a failure according to its original aim, which was to act as an inspiration for a world revolution. The initial anti-statist posture and the active campaigning for direct democracy was replaced because of Russia's level of development with\u2014according to their own assessments\u2014dictatorship. The reasoning was Russia's lack of development, its status as the sole socialist state in the world, its encirclement by imperialist powers, and its internal encirclement by the peasantry.\nMarx and Lenin did not care if a bourgeois state was ruled in accordance with a republican, parliamentary or a constitutional monarchical system since this did not change the overall situation. These systems, even if they were ruled by a small clique or ruled through mass participation, were all dictatorships of the bourgeoisie who implemented policies in defense of capitalism. However, there was a difference; after the failures of the world revolutions, Lenin argued that this did not necessarily have to change under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The reasoning came from practical considerations; the majority of the country's inhabitants were not communists, neither could the party reintroduce parliamentary democracy because that was not in synchronization with its ideology and would lead to the party losing power. He, therefore, concluded that the form of government has nothing to do with the nature of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\nBukharin and Trotsky agreed with Lenin; both said that the revolution had destroyed the old but had failed to create anything new. Lenin had now concluded that the dictatorship of the proletariat would not alter the relationship of power between men, but would rather \"transform their productive relations so that, in the long run, the realm of necessity could be overcome and, with that, genuine social freedom realized\". From 1920 to 1921, Soviet leaders and ideologists began differentiating between socialism and communism; hitherto the two terms had been used interchangeably and used to explain the same things. From then, the two terms had different meanings; Russia was in transition from capitalism to socialism\u2014referred to interchangeably under Lenin as the dictatorship of the proletariat, socialism was the intermediate stage to communism and communism was considered the last stage of social development. By now, the party leaders believed that because of Russia's backward state, universal mass participation and true democracy could only take form in the last stage.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n[Because] the proletariat is still so divided, so degraded, so corrupted in parts ... that an organization taking in the whole proletariat cannot directly exercise proletarian dictatorship. It can be exercised only by a vanguard that has absorbed the revolutionary energy of the class.\n\u2014 Lenin, explaining why the regime had become increasingly dictatorial\nIn early Bolshevik discourse, the term \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was of little significance, and the few times it was mentioned it was likened to the form of government which had existed in the Paris Commune. However, with the ensuing Russian Civil War and the social and material devastation that followed, its meaning altered from commune-type democracy to rule by iron-discipline. By now, Lenin had concluded that only a proletarian regime as oppressive as its opponents could survive in this world. The powers previously bestowed upon the Soviets were now given to the Council of People's Commissars, the central government, which was, in turn, to be governed by \"an army of steeled revolutionary Communists [by Communists he referred to the Party]\". In a letter to Gavril Myasnikov in late 1920, Lenin explained his new interpretation of the term \"dictatorship of the proletariat\":\nDictatorship means nothing more nor less than authority untrammeled by any laws, absolutely unrestricted by any rules whatever, and based directly on force. The term 'dictatorship' has no other meaning but this.\nLenin justified these policies by claiming that all states were class states by nature and that these states were maintained through class struggle. This meant that the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union could only be \"won and maintained by the use of violence against the bourgeoisie\". The main problem with this analysis is that the party came to view anyone opposing or holding alternate views of the party as bourgeois. Its worst enemy remained the moderates, which were considered to be \"the real agents of the bourgeoisie in the working-class movement, the labor lieutenants of the capitalist class\". The term \"bourgeoisie\" became synonymous with \"opponent\" and with people who disagreed with the party in general. These oppressive measures led to another reinterpretation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism in general; it was now defined as a purely economic system. Slogans and theoretical works about democratic mass participation and collective decision-making were now replaced with texts which supported authoritarian management. Considering the situation, the party believed it had to use the same powers as the bourgeoisie to transform Russia; there was no alternative. Lenin began arguing that the proletariat, like the bourgeoisie, did not have a single preference for a form of government and because of that, the dictatorship was acceptable to both the party and the proletariat. In a meeting with party officials, Lenin stated\u2014in line with his economist view of socialism\u2014that \"Industry is indispensable, democracy is not\", further arguing that \"we [the Party] do not promise any democracy or any freedom\".\nAnti-imperialism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nImperialism is capitalism at the stage of development at which the dominance of monopolies and finance capital is established; in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance; in which the division of the world among the international trusts as begun; in which divisions of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed.\n\u2014 Lenin, citing the main features of capitalism in the age of imperialism in \"Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism\"\nThe Marxist theory on imperialism was conceived by Lenin in his book, \"\" (published in 1917). It was written in response to the theoretical crisis within Marxist thought, which occurred due to capitalism's recovery in the 19th century. According to Lenin, imperialism was a specific stage of development of capitalism; a stage he referred to as state monopoly capitalism. The Marxist movement was split on how to solve capitalism's resurgence after the great depression of the late 19th century. Eduard Bernstein from the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP) considered capitalism's revitalization as proof that it was evolving into a more humane system, adding that the basic aims of socialists were not to overthrow the state but to take power through elections. Karl Kautsky, also from the SDP, held a highly dogmatic view; he said that there was no crisis within Marxist theory. Both of them denied or belittled the role of class contradictions in society after the crisis. In contrast, Lenin believed that the resurgence was the beginning of a new phase of capitalism; this stage was created because of a strengthening of class contradiction, not because of its reduction.\nLenin did not know when the imperialist stage of capitalism began; he said it would be foolish to look for a specific year, however, said it began at the beginning of the 20th century (at least in Europe). Lenin believed that the economic crisis of 1900 accelerated and intensified the concentration of industry and banking, which led to the transformation of the finance capital connection to industry into the monopoly of large banks. In \"Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism\", Lenin wrote; \"the twentieth century marks the turning point from the old capitalism to the new, from the domination of capital in general to the domination of finance capital\". Lenin defines imperialism as the monopoly stage of capitalism.\nThe 1986 Party Program claimed the Tsarist regime collapsed because the contradictions of imperialism, which he held to be the gap \"between the social nature of production and the private capitalist form of appropriation\" manifesting itself in wars, economic recessions, and exploitation of the working class, were strongest in Russia. Imperialism was held to have caused the Russo-Japanese War and the First World War, with the 1905 Russian Revolution presented as \"the first people's revolution of the imperialist epoch\" and the October Revolution is said to have been rooted in \"the nationwide movement against imperialist war and for peace.\"\nPeaceful coexistence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe loss by imperialism of its dominating role in world affairs and the utmost expansion of the sphere in which the laws of socialist foreign policy operate are a distinctive feature of the present stage of social development. The main direction of this development is toward even greater changes in the correlation of forces in the world arena in favor of socialism.\n \u2014 Nikolay Inozemtsev, a Soviet foreign policy analyst, referring to series of events (which he believed) would lead to the ultimate victory of socialism\n\"Peaceful coexistence\" was an ideological concept introduced under Khrushchev's rule. While the concept has been interpreted by fellow communists as proposing an end to the conflict between the systems of capitalism and socialism, Khrushchev saw it as a continuation of the conflict in every area except in the military field. The concept said that the two systems were developed \"by way of diametrically opposed laws\", which led to \"opposite principles in foreign policy\".\nPeaceful coexistence was steeped in Leninist and Stalinist thought. Lenin believed that international politics were dominated by class struggle; in the 1940s Stalin stressed the growing polarization which was occurring in the capitalist and socialist systems. Khrushchev's peaceful coexistence was based on practical changes which had occurred; he accused the old \"two camp\" theory of neglecting the non-aligned movement and the national liberation movements. Khrushchev considered these \"grey areas\", in which the conflict between capitalism and socialism would be fought. He still stressed that the main contradiction in international relations were those of capitalism and socialism. The Soviet Government under Khrushchev stressed the importance of peaceful coexistence, saying that it had to form the basis of Soviet foreign policy. Failure to do, they believed, would lead to nuclear conflict. Despite this, Soviet theorists still considered peaceful coexistence to be a continuation of the class struggle between the capitalist and socialist worlds, but not based on armed conflict. Khrushchev believed that the conflict, in its current phase, was mainly economic.\nThe emphasis on peaceful coexistence did not mean that the Soviet Union accepted a static world with clear lines. It continued to uphold the creed that socialism was inevitable and they sincerely believed that the world had reached a stage in which the \"correlations of forces\" were moving towards socialism. With the establishment of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe and Asia, Soviet foreign policy planners believed that capitalism had lost its dominance as an economic system.\nSocialism in one country.\nThe concept of \"Socialism in One Country\" was conceived by Stalin in his struggle against Leon Trotsky and his concept of permanent revolution. In 1924, Trotsky published his pamphlet \"Lessons of October\", in which he stated that socialism in the Soviet Union would fail because of the backward state of economic development unless a world revolution began. Stalin responded to Trotsky's pamphlet with his article, \"October and Comrade Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution\". In it, Stalin stated that he did not believe an inevitable conflict between the working class and the peasants would take place, and that \"socialism in one country is completely possible and probable\". Stalin held the view common among most Bolsheviks at the time; there was a possibility of real success for socialism in the Soviet Union despite the country's backwardness and international isolation. While Grigoriy Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev and Nikolai Bukharin\u2014together with Stalin\u2014opposed Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution, their views on the way socialism could be built diverged.\nAccording to Bukharin, Zinoviev, and Kamenev supported the resolution of the 14th Conference held in 1925, which stated that \"we cannot complete the building of socialism due to our technological backwardness\". Despite this cynical attitude, Zinoviev and Kamenev believed that a defective form of socialism could be constructed. At the 14th Conference, Stalin reiterated his position that socialism in one country was feasible despite the capitalist blockade of the Soviet Union. After the conference, Stalin wrote \"Concerning the Results of the XIV Conference of the RCP(b)\", in which he stated that the peasantry would not turn against the socialist system because they had a self-interest in preserving it. Stalin said the contradictions which arose within the peasantry during the socialist transition could \"be overcome by our own efforts\". He concluded that the only viable threat to socialism in the Soviet Union was a military intervention.\nIn late 1925, Stalin received a letter from a party official which stated that his position of \"Socialism in One Country\" was in contradiction with Friedrich Engels' writings on the subject. Stalin countered that Engels' writings reflected \"the era of pre-monopoly capitalism, the pre-imperialist era when there were not yet the conditions of an uneven, abrupt development of the capitalist countries\". From 1925, Bukharin began writing extensively on the subject and in 1926, Stalin wrote \"On Questions of Leninism\", which contains his best-known writings on the subject. With the publishing of \"Leninism\", Trotsky began countering Bukharin's and Stalin's arguments, writing that socialism in one country was only possible only in the short term, and said that without a world revolution it would be impossible to safeguard the Soviet Union from the \"restoration of bourgeois relations\". Zinoviev disagreed with Trotsky and Bukharin, and Stalin; he maintained Lenin's position from 1917 to 1922 and continued to say that only a defective form of socialism could be constructed in the Soviet Union without a world revolution. Bukharin began arguing for the creation of an autarkic economic model, while Trotsky said that the Soviet Union had to participate in the international division of labor to develop. In contrast to Trotsky and Bukharin, in 1938, Stalin said that a world revolution was impossible and that Engels was wrong on the matter. At the 18th Congress, Stalin took the theory to its inevitable conclusion, saying that the communist mode of production could be conceived in one country. He rationalized this by saying that the state could exist in a communist society as long as the Soviet Union was encircled by capitalism. However, with the establishment of socialist regimes in Eastern Europe, Stalin said that socialism in one country was only possible in a large country like the Soviet Union and that to survive, the other states had to follow the Soviet line.\nMarket socialism.\nBetween 1985 and 1991, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) underwent a fundamental ideological transformation, shifting from traditional Marxist\u2013Leninist orthodoxy toward models of market socialism and democratic socialism. This evolution was spearheaded by Mikhail Gorbachev, who initiated \"perestroika\" (restructuring) and \"glasnost\" (openness) as part of an effort to rejuvenate the Soviet system through selective decentralization and democratization. Initially, Gorbachev framed these reforms as a return to the \"true\" democratic spirit of Leninism, but they increasingly incorporated features associated with Western social democracy, such as private enterprise, market regulation, and political pluralism. As White notes, the period saw \"a move away from classical command socialism and towards a system more compatible with market coordination and democratic accountability\".\nThis shift was underpinned by a redefinition of socialism not as a static set of economic relations, but as a flexible, evolving system responsive to contemporary challenges. Gorbachev asserted that socialism must be \"deeply democratic\" and grounded in civil society rather than bureaucratic inertia. The 1988 Law on Cooperatives legalized small-scale private enterprise, and by the 28th Party Congress in 1990, the CPSU officially recognized political pluralism and supported a mixed economy. This marked a decisive break from centralized economic planning and the monolithic party-state model.\nHowever, these reforms triggered ideological fragmentation and institutional instability. While Gorbachev hoped to salvage socialism through democratization and limited market reform, the dismantling of central controls accelerated the unraveling of the Soviet system. As Brown argues, the CPSU's endorsement of \"socialist pluralism\" lacked a coherent framework, leading to a crisis of authority and legitimacy. Ultimately, the party's pivot toward democratic socialism and market coordination failed to sustain the Soviet state, which collapsed in December 1991.\nReasons for demise.\nWestern view.\nThere were few, if any, who believed that the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse by 1985. The economy was stagnating, but stable enough for the Soviet Union to continue. The political situation was calm because of twenty years of systematic repression against any threat to the country and one-party rule, and the Soviet Union was in its peak of influence in world affairs. The immediate causes for the Soviet Union's dissolution were the policies and thoughts of Mikhail Gorbachev, the CPSU general secretary. His policies of \"perestroika\" and \"glasnost\" tried to revitalize the Soviet economy and the social and political culture of the country. Throughout his rule, he put more emphasis on democratizing the Soviet Union because he believed it had lost its moral legitimacy to rule. These policies led to the collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and indirectly destabilized Gorbachev's and the CPSU's control over the Soviet Union. Archie Brown said:\nThe expectations of, again most notably, Lithuanians, Estonians, and Latvians were enormously enhanced by what they saw happening in the 'outer empire' [Eastern Europe], and they began to believe that they could remove themselves from the 'inner empire'. In truth, a democratized Soviet Union was incompatible with denial of the Baltic states' independence for, to the extent that those Soviet republics became democratic, their opposition to remaining in a political entity whose center was Moscow would become increasingly evident. Yet, it was not preordained that the entire Soviet Union would break up.\nHowever, Brown said that the system did not need to collapse or to do so in the way it did. The democratization from above weakened the party's control over the country and put it on the defensive. Brown added that a different leader than Gorbachev would probably have oppressed the opposition and continued with economic reform. Nonetheless, Gorbachev accepted that the people sought a different road and consented to the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991. He said that because of its peaceful collapse, the fall of Soviet communism is \"one of the great success stories of 20th-century politics\". According to Lars T. Lih, the Soviet Union collapsed because people stopped believing in its ideology. He wrote:\nWhen in 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed not with a bang but a whimper, this unexpected outcome was partly the result of the previous disenchantments of the narrative of class leadership. The Soviet Union had always been based on the fervent belief in this narrative in its various permutations. When the binding power of the narrative dissolved, the Soviet Union itself dissolved.\nAccording to the Chinese Communist Party.\nThe first research into the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was very simple and did not take into account several factors. However, these examinations became more advanced by the 1990s, and unlike most Western scholarship, which focuses on the role of Gorbachev and his reform efforts, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) examined \"core (political) life and death issues\" so that it could learn from them and not make the same mistakes. Following the CPSU's demise and the Soviet Union's collapse, the CCP's analysis began examining systematic causes. Several leading CCP officials began hailing Khrushchev's rule, saying that he was the first reformer and that if he had continued after 1964, the Soviet Union would not have witnessed the Era of Stagnation begun under Brezhnev and continued under Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko. The main economic failure was that the political leadership did not pursue any reforms to tackle the economic malaise that had taken hold, dismissing certain techniques as capitalist, and never disentangling the planned economy from socialism. Xu Zhixin from the CASS Institute of Eastern Europe, Russia, and Central Asia, argued that Soviet planners laid too much emphasis on heavy industry, which led to shortages of consumer goods. Unlike his counterparts, Xu argued that the shortages of consumer goods were not an error but \"was a consciously planned feature of the system\". Other CPSU failures were pursuing the policy of state socialism, the high spending on the military-industrial complex, a low tax base, and the subsidizing of the economy. The CCP argued that when Gorbachev came to power and introduced his economic reforms, they were \"too little, too late, and too fast\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn my opinion, the fundamental cause of the drastic changes in the Soviet Union and East European countries at the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s was the loss of dynamism of the Stalin\u2013Soviet Socialist Model ... The demerits of this model were institutional and fundamental\u2014not a single reform after Stalin's death brought fundamental changes to the Stalin\u2013Soviet Socialist Model. This model, with its problems and contradictions accumulating by day, was finally in crisis, and the people of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe lost their confidence in it. The [only] way out was to abandon the Stalin\u2013Soviet Socialist Model and seek another road for social development.\n\u2014 Lu Nanqun, a Sovietologist from CASS\nWhile most CCP researchers criticize the CPSU's economic policies, many have criticized what they see as \"Soviet totalitarianism\". They accuse Joseph Stalin of creating a system of mass terror and intimidation, annulling the democracy component of democratic centralism and emphasizing centralism, which led to the creation of an inner-party dictatorship. Other points were Russian nationalism, a lack of separation between the party and state bureaucracies, suppression of non-Russian ethnicities, distortion of the economy through the introduction of over-centralization and the collectivization of agriculture. According to CCP researcher Xiao Guisen, Stalin's policies led to \"stunted economic growth, tight surveillance of society, a lack of democracy in decision-making, an absence of the rule of law, the burden of bureaucracy, the CPSU's alienation from people's concerns, and an accumulation of ethnic tensions\". Stalin's effect on ideology was also criticized; several researchers accused his policies of being \"leftist\", \"dogmatist\" and a deviation \"from true Marxism\u2013Leninism.\" He is criticized for initiating the \"bastardization of Leninism\", of deviating from true democratic centralism by establishing a one-man rule and destroying all inner-party consultation, of misinterpreting Lenin's theory of imperialism and of supporting foreign revolutionary movements only when the Soviet Union could get something out of it. Yu Sui, a CCP theoretician, said that \"the collapse of the Soviet Union and CPSU is a punishment for its past wrongs!\" Similarly, Brezhnev, Mikhail Suslov, Alexei Kosygin and Konstantin Chernenko have been criticized for being \"dogmatic, ossified, inflexible, [for having a] bureaucratic ideology and thinking\", while Yuri Andropov is depicted by some of having the potential of becoming a new Khrushchev if he had not died early.\nWhile the CCP concur with Gorbachev's assessment that the CPSU needed internal reform, they do not agree on how it was implemented, criticizing his idea of \"humanistic and democratic socialism\", of negating the leading role of the CPSU, of negating Marxism, of negating the analysis of class contradictions and class struggle, and of negating the \"ultimate socialist goal of realizing communism\". Unlike the other Soviet leaders, Gorbachev is criticized for pursuing the wrong reformist policies and for being too flexible and too rightist. The CCP Organization Department said, \"What Gorbachev in fact did was not to transform the CPSU by correct principles\u2014indeed the Soviet Communist Party needed transformation\u2014but instead he, step-by-step, and ultimately, eroded the ruling party's dominance in ideological, political and organizational aspects\".\nThe CPSU was also criticized for not taking enough care in building the primary party organization and not having inner-party democracy. Others, more radically, concur with Milovan \u0110ilas assessment, saying that a new class was established within the central party leadership of the CPSU and that a \"corrupt and privileged class\" had developed because of the nomenklatura system. Others criticized the special privileges bestowed on the CPSU elite, the nomenklatura system\u2014which some said had decayed continuously since Stalin's rule\u2014and the relationship between the Soviet military and the CPSU. Unlike in China, the Soviet military was a state institution whereas in China it is a party (and state) institution. The CCP criticizes the CPSU of pursuing Soviet imperialism in its foreign policies.\nFootnotes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nArticles and journal entries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As Christianity established itself as a separate religion, with its own scriptures, some views moved away from the Jewish roots while others remained firmly grounded in Jewish tradition. The mainstream view within Christianity is that the Jewish scriptures within what became known as the Old Testament, as well as passages within what became known as the New Testament, both make clear that same-sex sexual behaviour is sinful \u2013 an interpretation supported by the wording of certain translations of the Bible.\nToday, most denominations teach that homosexual behavior and acts are sinful, and both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church officially condemn homosexual activity as sin. However, some mainly liberal denominations, churches and individuals hold views that differ from traditional interpretations and some of the mainline Protestant denominations in the USA, Canada and the UK now view same-sex behaviour as equally valid and allow clergy to perform same-sex marriages.\nHistory.\nThe Hebrew Bible and its traditional interpretations in Judaism and Christianity have historically affirmed and endorsed a patriarchal and heteronormative approach towards human sexuality, endorsing exclusively penetrative vaginal intercourse between men and women within the boundaries of marriage over all other forms of human sexual activity, including autoeroticism, masturbation, oral sex, non-penetrative and non-heterosexual sexual intercourse (all of which have been labeled as \"sodomy\" at various times).\nThey have believed and taught that such behaviors are forbidden because they are considered sinful, and further compared to or derived from the behavior of the alleged residents of Sodom and Gomorrah. However, the status of LGBTQ people in early Christianity is debated.\nThe history of Christianity and homosexuality has been much debated with these disagreements often concerning the translations of certain phrases, or the meaning and context of some biblical passages.\nThe extent to which the Bible mentions the subject, whether or not it is condemned, and whether the various passages apply today, have become contentious topics in the 20th and 21st centuries. Significant debate has arisen over the proper interpretation of the Levitical code; the narrative of Sodom and Gomorrah; and various Pauline passages which appear to condemn same-sex sexual activities.\nChristian denominational positions.\nCatholic Church.\nThe Catholic Church views as sinful any sexual act not related to procreation by a couple joined in marriage. The Church states that \"homosexual tendencies\" are \"objectively disordered\", but does not consider the tendency itself to be sinful but rather a temptation toward sin.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church states that \"men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies[...] must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity\" and that \"every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.\" The Church opposes criminal penalties against homosexuality. The Catholic Church requires those who are attracted to people of the same (or opposite) sex to practise chastity, because it teaches that sexuality should only be practised within marriage, which includes chaste sex as permanent, procreative, heterosexual, and monogamous. The Vatican distinguishes between \"deep-seated homosexual tendencies\" and the \"expression of a transitory problem\", in relation to ordination to the priesthood; saying in a 2005 document that homosexual tendencies \"must be clearly overcome at least three years before ordination to the diaconate.\"\nA 2011 report based on telephone surveys of self-identified American Catholics conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 56% believe that sexual relations between two people of the same sex are not sinful. Research indicates that the Catholic Church's teachings on sexual conduct are \"a major source of conflict and distress\" to LGBTQ Catholics.\nIn January 2018, German bishop Franz-Josef Bode of the Diocese of Osnabr\u00fcck, and in February 2018 German Catholic cardinal Reinhard Marx, chairman of the German Bishops' Conference, said in interviews with German journalists that blessing of same-sex unions is possible in Catholic churches in Germany. In Austria blessing of same sex unions is performed in two churches located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Linz. In 2021, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith clarified that same-sex civil unions cannot be blessed.\nOn 11 March 2023, the Synodal Path with support of over 80 percentage of German Roman Catholic bishops allowed liturgical blessing ceremonies for same-sex unions in all 27 German Roman Catholic diocese. A similar decision had been taken a few months earlier by the Flemish bishops of the Episcopal Conference of Belgium. Both decisions received strong condemnation by the Holy See and by conservative Catholic clergy: Cardinal Pietro Parolin stated that the German bishops had no authority over the issue and Cardinal Wim Eijk urged Flemish bishops to withdraw their decision.\nOn 18 December 2023, non-liturgical blessings of same-sex couples in the document \"Fiducia supplicans\" were approved by Pope Francis and published by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. However, \"it is not a formal liturgical blessing and does not give the impression that the Catholic Church is blessing the union as if it were a marriage\".\nOrthodox churches.\nThe Eastern Orthodox churches condemn homosexual acts. The Orthodox Church shares a long history of church teachings and canon law with the Catholic Church and has a similar conservative stance on homosexuality. Some Orthodox Church jurisdictions, such as the Orthodox Church in America, have taken the approach of welcoming people with \"homosexual feelings and emotions\", while encouraging them to work towards \"overcoming its harmful effects in their lives\", while not allowing the sacraments to people who seek to justify homosexual activity. Other Orthodox Churches, such as those in Eastern Europe and Greece, view homosexuality less favourably. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America lists homosexuality along with fornication, adultery, and more because of the thinking that homosexuality breaks up the institution of marriage and family. A 2017 Pew Research Center poll found that the majority of Orthodox Christians in the Eastern European and former USSR states surveyed believe that homosexuality \"should not be accepted by society\"; 45% of Orthodox Christians in Greece and 31% in the United States answered the same way.\nIn July 2022, Archbishop Elpidophoros of America baptized two babies adopted by clothing designers Evanggelos Bousis and Peter Dundas, making him the first Greek Orthodox bishop to baptize children adopted by gay couples. According to the metropolitan in whose diocese the baptism took place (Antonios of Glyfada), Elpidophoros did not inform him in advance that the baptism in question was to be performed for a gay couple. Metropolitan Antonios reported Elpidophoros to the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece, which issued a formal protest to both Elpidophoros and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.\nProtestant churches.\n Christian pride flag hanging in a Metropolitan Community Church\nAccepting position.\nCertain other Christian denominations do not view monogamous same-sex relationships as sinful or immoral, and may bless such unions and consider them marriages. These include the United Church of Canada, the Presbyterian Church (USA), the United Church of Christ, all German Lutheran, reformed and united churches in EKD, all Swiss reformed churches, the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the United Protestant Church in Belgium, the United Protestant Church of France, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Iceland, the Church of Norway, and the Uniting Church in Australia. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland also allows prayer for same-sex couples. The Metropolitan Community Church was founded specifically to serve the Christian LGBTQ community. The Global Alliance of Affirming Apostolic Pentecostals (GAAAP) traces its roots back to 1980, making it the oldest LGBT-affirming Apostolic Pentecostal denomination in existence. Another such organization is the Affirming Pentecostal Church International, currently the largest affirming Pentecostal organization, with churches in the US, UK, Central and South America, Europe and Africa.\nLGBT-affirming denominations regard homosexuality as a natural occurrence. The United Church of Christ celebrates gay marriage, and some parts of the Anglican and Lutheran churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. The United Church of Canada also allows same-sex marriage, and views sexual orientation as a gift from God. Within the Anglican Communion, there are openly gay clergy; for example, Gene Robinson is an openly gay Bishop in the US Episcopal Church. Within the Lutheran communion, there are openly gay clergy, too; for example, bishop Eva Brunne is an openly lesbian bishop in the Church of Sweden. Such religious groups and denominations interpret scripture and doctrine in a way that leads them to accept that homosexuality is morally acceptable, and a natural occurrence. For example, in 1988 the United Church of Canada, that country's largest Protestant denomination, affirmed that \"a) All persons, regardless of their sexual orientation, who profess Jesus Christ and obedience to Him, are welcome to be or become full members of the Church; and b) All members of the Church are eligible to be considered for the Ordered Ministry.\" In 2000, the Church's General Assembly further affirmed that \"human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual or homosexual, are a gift from God and part of the marvelous diversity of creation.\"\nIn addition, some Christian denominations such as the Moravian Church, believe that the Bible speaks negatively of homosexual acts but, as research on the matter continues, the Moravian Church seeks to establish a policy on homosexuality and the ordination of homosexuals. In 2014, Moravian Church in Europe allowed blessings of same-sex unions.\nLiberal Quakers, those in membership of Britain Yearly Meeting and Friends General Conference in the US and some Conservative Quaker Yearly Meetings approve of same-sex marriage and union. Quakers were the first Christian group in the United Kingdom to advocate for equal marriage and Quakers in Britain formally recognised same-sex relationships in 1963.\nThe United Methodist Church elected a lesbian bishop in 2016, and on 7 May 2018, the Council of Bishops proposed the One Church Plan, which would allow individual pastors and regional church bodies to decide whether to ordain LGBTQ clergy and perform same-sex weddings. On 26 February 2019, a special session of the General Conference rejected the One Church Plan and voted to strengthen its official opposition to same-sex marriages and ordaining openly LGBTQ clergy.\nAt the 2024 General Conference, 93% of delegates voted to lift existing bans on the ordination of LGBTQ+ people and the hosting of same-sex marriages.\nVarious positions.\nAnglican.\nSince 1998, the Anglican Church has reassured people with same sex attraction they are loved by God and are welcomed as full members of the Body of Christ. The Church leadership has a variety of views in regard to homosexual expression and ordination. Some expressions of sexuality are considered sinful including \"promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual)\". The Church is concerned with pressures on young people to engage sexually and encourages abstinence.\nAt the 13th Lambeth Conference in 1998, homosexuality was the most hotly debated issue. It was finally decided, by a vote of 526\u201370, to pass a resolution (1.10) calling for a \"listening process\" but stating (in an amendment passed by a vote of 389\u2013190) that \"homosexual practice\" (not necessarily orientation) is \"incompatible with Scripture\". Reflecting on resolution 1.10 in the lead up to Lambeth 2022, Angela Tilby recalled the intervention of Bishop Michael Bourke, who successfully proposed an amendment which said: \"We commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual persons\". Tilby considered that while the amendment had appeared inconsequential at the time, it had indeed been significant: she said that the idea of \"patient listening\" underpinned the Church of England's process \"Living in Love and Faith\".\nLutheran.\nChurches within Lutheranism hold stances on the issue ranging from labeling homosexual acts as sinful, to acceptance of homosexual relationships. For example, the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, the Lutheran denomination in Ethiopia, and second largest non-united Lutheran denomination in the world, has taken a stand that marriage is inherently between a man and a woman, and has formally broken fellowship with the ELCA. The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod, the Lutheran Church of Australia, and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod recognize homosexual behavior as intrinsically sinful and seek to minister to those who are struggling with homosexual inclinations. However, the Church of Sweden, the Church of Denmark, the Church of Norway, or Lutheran churches of the Evangelical Church in Germany conducts same-sex marriages, while the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada opens the ministry of the church to gay pastors and other professional workers living in committed relationships.\nRejecting position.\nSome mainline Protestant denominations, such as the African Methodist churches, the Reformed Church in America, and the Presbyterian Church in America, Christian Reformed Church in North America also oppose LGBTQ relationships.\nQuakers within the Friends United Meeting and the Evangelical Friends Church International believe that sexual relations are condoned only in marriage, which they define to be between a man and a woman.\nConfessional Lutheran churches teach that it is sinful to have homosexual desires, even if they do not lead to homosexual activity. The Doctrinal statement issued by the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod states that making a distinction between homosexual orientation and the act of homosexuality is confusing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHowever, confessional Lutherans also warn against selective morality which harshly condemns homosexuality while treating other sins more lightly.\nEvangelical churches.\nThe positions of the evangelical churches are varied, according to denominations. Some evangelical denominations have adopted neutral positions, leaving the choice to local churches to decide for same-sex marriage. Others strongly oppose same-sex marriage, same-sex sexual activity, and expression of gay/lesbian/bisexual identity generally.\nEvangelical Conservative positions.\nSome Evangelical Christians regard homosexual acts as sinful and think they should not be accepted by society. They tend to interpret biblical verses on homosexual acts to mean that the heterosexual family was created by God to be the bedrock of civilization and that same-sex relationships contradict God's design for marriage and is not his will. Christians who oppose homosexual relationships sometimes argue that same-gender sexual activity is a sin.\nIn opposing interpretations of the Bible that are supportive of homosexual relationships, conservative Christians have argued for the reliability of the Bible, and the meaning of texts related to homosexual acts, while often seeing what they call the diminishing of the authority of the Bible by many homosexual authors as being ideologically driven.\nAs an alternative to a school-sponsored Day of Silence opposing bullying of LGBTQ students, conservative Christians organized a Golden Rule Initiative, where they passed out cards saying \"As a follower of Christ, I believe that all people are created in the image of God and therefore deserve love and respect.\" Others created a Day of Dialogue to oppose what they believe is the silencing of Christian students who make public their opposition to homosexuality.\nOn 29 August 2017, the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood released a manifesto on human sexuality known as the \"Nashville Statement\". The statement was signed by 150 evangelical leaders, and includes 14 points of belief.\nFundamentalist position.\nIt is in some fundamentalist conservative positions, that there are anti-LGBT activists on TV or radio who accuse homosexual people of a gay agenda and of being responsible for social problems, such as terrorism. Fundamentalists also regularly accuse homosexuals of being responsible for natural disasters. Some evangelical churches in Uganda, Ghana, and Nigeria strongly oppose homosexuality and homosexuals as well as the LGTBQ community at large. They have campaigned for laws criminalizing homosexuality.\nModerate position.\nSome churches have a moderate Conservative position. They only support sexuality in marriage between a man and a woman, but show sympathy and respect towards homosexual people. Churches thus see themselves as \"welcoming, but not affirming\". This expression has its origin in the book \"Welcoming but Not Affirming: An Evangelical Response to Homosexuality\" published in 1998 by the American Baptist theologian Stanley Grenz.\nOrganizations.\nThe French Evangelical Alliance, a member of the European Evangelical Alliance and the World Evangelical Alliance, adopted on 12 October 2002, through its National Council, a document entitled (\"Faith, Hope and Homosexuality\"), in which homophobia, hatred and rejection of homosexuals are condemned, but which denies homosexual practices and full church membership of unrepentant homosexuals and those who approve of these practices. In 2015, the Conseil national des \u00e9vang\u00e9liques de France (French National Council of Evangelicals) reaffirmed its position on the issue by opposing marriage of same-sex couples, while not rejecting homosexuals, but wanting to offer them more than a blessing; an accompaniment and a welcome.\nThe French evangelical pastor Philippe Auzenet, a chaplain of the association Oser en parler, regularly intervenes on the subject in the media. It promotes dialogue and respect, as well as sensitization in order to better understand homosexuals. He also said in 2012 that Jesus would go to a gay bar, because he was going to all people with love.\nLiberal positions.\nInternational.\nThere are some international evangelical associations that are gay-friendly, such as the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists and Affirming Pentecostal Church International.\nU.S..\nA 2014 survey reported that 43% of white evangelical American Christians between the ages of 18 and 33 supported same-sex marriage. Some evangelical churches accept homosexuality and celebrate gay weddings. The change in beliefs in favor of gay marriage in evangelical churches has certain consequences for them. Various churches thus received an excommunication from their Christian denomination for not respecting the confession of faith. Other churches have faced significant departures of members from their congregations, seeing their financial resources diminish.\nNeutral positions.\nSome evangelical associations have adopted neutral positions, leaving the choice to local churches to decide for same-sex marriage.\nDenominational positions.\nAnabaptism.\nMost Mennonite associations hold a conservative position on homosexuality.\nThe Brethren Mennonite Council for LGBT Interests was founded in 1976 in the US and has member churches of different associations in the US and Canada.\nThe Mennonite Church Canada leaves the choice to each church for same-sex marriage.\nThe Mennonite Church in the Netherlands and the Mennonite Church USA permit same-sex marriage.\nBaptist.\nMost Baptist associations around the world hold a conservative view on homosexuality.\nSome Baptist associations in the United States do not have official beliefs about marriage in a confession of faith and invoke congregationalism to leave the choice to each church to decide. This is the case of American Baptist Churches USA, Progressive National Baptist Convention (USA), Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (USA), National Baptist Convention, USA and the Baptist Union of Great Britain. \nSome Baptist associations support same-sex marriage. This is the case of the Alliance of Baptists (USA), the Canadian Association for Baptist Freedoms, the Alian\u00e7a de Batistas do Brasil, the Fraternidad de Iglesias Bautistas de Cuba, and the Association of Welcoming and Affirming Baptists (international).\nPentecostalism.\nMost Pentecostal associations take a conservative stance on homosexuality.\nThe Covenant Network was formed in 2000 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, and allow same-sex marriage. According to a denomination census released in 2023, it has 18 churches in 3 countries.\nRestorationist churches.\nRestorationist churches, such as Seventh-Day Adventists, generally teach that homosexuals are 'broken' and can be 'fixed'. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that \"The Bible condemns sexual activity that is not between a husband and wife, whether it is homosexual or heterosexual conduct. (1 Corinthians 6:18)[...] While the Bible disapproves of homosexual acts, it does not condone hatred of homosexuals or homophobia. Instead, Christians are directed to \"respect everyone.\"\u20141 Peter 2:17, \"Good News Translation\".\" The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in 2015 that it officially welcomes its gay and lesbian members, if they choose sexual abstinence. The Community of Christ, a branch of Mormonism, fully accepts LGBTQ persons, performs weddings for gay and lesbian couples, and ordains LGBTQ members. Within the Stone-Campbell aligned restorationist churches the views are divergent. The churches of Christ (A Capella) and the Independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ mostly adhere to a conservative position on LGBTQ members and will not perform weddings for gay and lesbian couples. The Disciples of Christ, is fully accepting of LGBTQ persons, often performs weddings for gay and lesbian couples, and ordains LGBTQ members. The United Church of Christ is an officially \"open and affirming\" church. Other Restorationist churches such as Millerite churches, have taken mixed positions but are increasingly accepting with some of their congregations fully accepting LGBTQ persons in all aspects of religious and political life. The Seventh-day Adventist Church maintains that homosexual sex itself is forbidden in the Bible.\nViews supportive of homosexuality.\nIn the 20th century, theologians like J\u00fcrgen Moltmann, Hans K\u00fcng, John Robinson, Bishop David Jenkins, Don Cupitt, and Bishop Jack Spong challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated or that they do not refer to what is in the modern day understood as \"homosexuality.\" Clay Witt, a minister in the Metropolitan Community Church, explains how theologians and commentators like John Shelby Spong, George Edwards and Michael England interpret injunctions against certain sexual acts as being originally intended as a means of distinguishing religious worship between Abrahamic and the surrounding pagan faiths, within which homosexual acts featured as part of idolatrous religious practices: \"England argues that these prohibitions should be seen as being directed against sexual practices of fertility cult worship. As with the earlier reference from Strong's, he notes that the word 'abomination' used here is directly related to idolatry and idolatrous practices throughout the Hebrew Testament. Edwards makes a similar suggestion, observing that 'the context of the two prohibitions in Leviticus 18:22 and Leviticus 20:13 suggest that what is opposed is not same-sex activity outside the cult, as in the modern secular sense, but within the cult identified as Canaanite'\".\nIn 1986, the Evangelical and Ecumenical Women's Caucus (EEWC), then known as the Evangelical Women's Caucus International, passed a resolution stating: \"Whereas homosexual people are children of God, and because of the biblical mandate of Jesus Christ that we are all created equal in God's sight, and in recognition of the presence of the lesbian minority in EWCI, EWCI takes a firm stand in favor of civil rights protection for homosexual persons.\"\nSome Christians believe that Biblical passages have been mistranslated or that these passages do not refer to LGBTQ orientation as currently understood. Liberal Christian scholars, like conservative Christian scholars, accept earlier versions of the texts that make up the Bible in Hebrew or Greek. However, within these early texts there are many terms that modern scholars have interpreted differently from previous generations of scholars. There are concerns with copying errors, forgery, and biases among the translators of later Bibles. They consider some verses such as those they say support slavery or the inferior treatment of women as not being valid today, and against the will of God present in the context of the Bible. They cite these issues when arguing for a change in theological views on sexual relationships to what they say is an earlier view. They differentiate among various sexual practices, treating rape, prostitution, or temple sex rituals as immoral and those within committed relationships as positive regardless of sexual orientation. They view certain verses, which they believe refer only to homosexual rape, as not relevant to consensual homosexual relationships.\nYale professor John Boswell has argued that a number of Early Christians entered into homosexual relationships, and that certain Biblical figures had homosexual relationships, such as Ruth and her mother-in-law Naomi, Daniel and the court official Ashpenaz, and David and King Saul's son Jonathan. Boswell has also argued that adelphopoiesis, a rite bonding two men, was akin to a religiously sanctioned same-sex union. Having partaken in such a rite, a person was prohibited from entering into marriage or taking monastic vows, and the choreography of the service itself closely parallelled that of the marriage rite. His views have not found wide acceptance, and opponents have argued that this rite sanctified a platonic brotherly bond, not a homosexual union. He also argued that condemnation of homosexuality began only in the 12th century. Boswell's critics point out that many earlier doctrinal sources condemn homosexuality as a sin even if they do not prescribe a specific punishment, and that Boswell's arguments are based on sources which reflected a general trend towards harsher penalties, rather than a change in doctrine, from the 12th century onwards.\nDesmond Tutu, the former Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town and a Nobel Peace Prize winner, described homophobia as a \"crime against humanity\" and \"every bit as unjust\" as apartheid: \"We struggled against apartheid in South Africa, supported by people the world over, because black people were being blamed and made to suffer for something we could do nothing about; our very skins. It is the same with sexual orientation. It is a given.[...] We treat them [gays and lesbians] as pariahs and push them outside our communities. We make them doubt that they too are children of God \u2013 and this must be nearly the ultimate blasphemy. We blame them for what they are.\"\nModern gay Christian leader Justin R. Cannon promotes what he calls \"Inclusive Orthodoxy\" ('orthodoxy' in this sense is not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox Church). He explains on his ministry website: \"Inclusive Orthodoxy is the belief that the Church can and must be inclusive of LGBTQ individuals without sacrificing the Gospel and the Apostolic teachings of the Christian faith.\" Cannon's ministry takes a unique and distinct approach from modern liberal Christians while still supporting homosexual relations. His ministry affirms the divine inspiration of the Bible, the authority of Tradition, and says \"...that there is a place within the full life and ministry of the Christian Church for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Christians, both those who are called to lifelong celibacy and those who are partnered.\"\nToday, many religious people are becoming more affirming of same-sex relationships, even in denominations with official stances against homosexuality. In the United States, people in denominations who are against same-sex relationships are liberalizing quickly, though not as quickly as those in more affirming groups. This social change is creating tension within many denominations, and even schisms and mass walk-outs among Mormons and other conservative groups.\nPope Francis voiced support for same-sex civil unions during an interview in a documentary film, \"Francesco\", which was premiered at the Rome Film Festival on 21 October 2020.\nHomosexual Christians and organizations.\nStudies in the US show more LGBTQ individuals identify as Protestant than Catholic. George Barna, a conservative Christian author and researcher, conducted a survey in the United States in 2009 that found gay and lesbian people having a Christian affiliation were more numerous than had been presumed. He characterized some of his leading conclusions from the data as follows: \"People who portray gay adults as godless, hedonistic, Christian bashers are not working with the facts. A substantial majority of gays cite their faith as a central facet of their life, consider themselves to be Christian, and claim to have some type of meaningful personal commitment to Jesus Christ active in their life today.\" Barna also found that LGBTQ people were more likely to interpret faith as an individual rather than a collective experience.\nCandace Chellew-Hodge, liberal Christian lesbian founder of the online magazine \"Whosoever\", responded to the findings: \"All in all, I'm grateful for Barna even wandering into the subject of gay and lesbian religious belief. I think his study is important and can go a long way to dispelling the old \"gays vs. God\" dichotomy that too often gets played out in the media. However, his overall message is still harmful: Gays and lesbians are Christians \u2013 they're just not as good as straight ones.\" She argued that Barna had formulated his report with undue irony and skepticism, and that he had failed to take into account the reasons for the data which enkindled his \"arri\u00e8re pens\u00e9e.\" The reason why far fewer homosexuals attend church, she argued, is that there are far fewer churches who will accept them. Equally, gays and lesbians do not see the Bible as unequivocally true because they are forced by its use against them to read it more closely and with less credulity, leading them to note its myriad contradictions.\nOrganizations for homosexual Christians exist across a wide range of beliefs and traditions. The interdenominational Q Christian Fellowship (formerly Gay Christian Network) has some members who affirm same-sex relationships and others who commit themselves to celibacy, groups it refers to as \"Side A\" and \"Side B\", respectively. According to founder Justin Lee:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We're just trying to get people together who experience attraction to the same sex, however they have handled that, and who love Jesus and say, OK, you are welcome here, and then let's pray together and figure out where God wants us to take it.\nSome organizations cater exclusively to homosexual Christians who do not want to have gay sex, or attraction; the goals of these organizations vary. Some Christian groups focus on simply refraining from gay sex, such as Courage International and North Star. Other groups additionally encourage gay members to reduce or eliminate same-sex attractions. Love Won Out and the now-defunct Exodus International are examples of such ministries. These groups are sometimes referred to as ex-gay organizations, though many no longer use the term. Alan Chambers, the president of Exodus, says the term incorrectly implies a complete change in sexual orientation, though the group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays continues to use the term. In addition, individual Christians identifying as gay who want to subscribe to the conservative ethic are becoming more vocal themselves.\nGay Christian writer and actor Peterson Toscano argues that organizations promoting orientation change are a \"ruse\". An organization he co-founded, Beyond Ex-Gay, supports people who feel they have been wounded by such organizations.\nOther groups support or advocate for gay Christians and their relationships. For example, in the United States, IntegrityUSA represents the interests of lesbian and gay Christians in the Episcopal Church, while United Methodists have the Reconciling Ministries Network and evangelical Christians have \"Evangelicals Concerned\". GracePointe Church became one of the first evangelical megachurches in the US to support full equality for LGBTQ people in 2015. In 2014 the United Church of Christ filed a lawsuit challenging North Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage, which is America's first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans; the Alliance of Baptists joined the lawsuit later that year.\nIn Europe, working within the worldwide Anglican Communion on a range of discrimination issues, including those of LGBTQ clergy and people in the church, is \"Inclusive Church\". The longest standing groups for lesbian and gay Christians in the UK, were Quest (for LGBTQ Catholics) and Metropolitan Community Church (UK) both founded in 1973; followed in 1976 by the non-denominational Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement; specifically aimed to meet the needs of lesbian and gay evangelicals, there is the \"Evangelical Fellowship for Lesbian and Gay Christians\"; specifically working within the Church of England is \"Changing Attitude\", which also takes an international focus in working for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender affirmation within the Anglican Communion.\nSociologist Richard N. Pitt argues that these organizations are only available to LGBTQ members of liberal denominations, as opposed to those in conservative denominations. His review of the literature on gay Christians suggests that these organizations not only represent the interests of Christians who attend their churches, but (like gay-friendly and gay-affirming churches) also give these members useful responses to homophobic and heterosexist rhetoric. His research shows that those LGBTQ Christians who stay at homophobic churches \"kill the messenger\" by attacking the minister's knowledge about homosexuality, personal morality, focus on sin instead of forgiveness, and motivations for preaching against homosexuality.\nMovement of pro-celibacy gay Christians.\nThere is a movement of people who call themselves \"gay Christians\", but choose to practice celibacy. The movement is often positioned against both liberals and conservatives. Recognizing themselves as gay or bisexual, these people believe that their attraction to same-sex people, while present, does not allow them to have homosexual relationships. They often say that their Christian conversion did not instantly change their sexual desires. They insist that the church should always reject homosexual practices, but that it should welcome gay people.\nEx-gay movement.\nVarious Christian organizations have been involved in the ex-gay movement. Love in Action, founded in 1973, was the first in the US. In 1976, its members founded Exodus International, a Christian organization (more specifically Protestant and Evangelical) in the United States and in various countries of the world. The Catholic organization Courage International was founded in 1980.\nConversion therapies for people wishing to change sexual orientation have been associated with the movement. Conversion therapy has been widely criticized and denounced by many major medical associations as pseudoscientific and harmful. Studies have found that LGBTQ individuals who experienced conversion therapy reported significantly higher rates of depression, suicide attempts, and substance abuse than their peers who did not.\nCriticism.\nIn 2005, Baptist Pastor Al Sharpton criticized megachurches for focusing on \"bedroom morals\", statements against same-sex marriage and abortion, by ignoring issues of social justice, such as the immorality of war and the erosion of affirmative action.\nIn 2015, American theologian L. Gregory Jones has criticized some Christian churches for their lack of effort to interest young people in the Christian faith in a relevant way, while putting a lot of energy into talking negatively about homosexuality, which is even more boring for young people who want to work with the whole world.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2012, the Cushitic languages with over one million speakers were Oromo, Somali, Beja, Afar, Hadiyya, Kambaata, and Sidama.\nOfficial status.\nThe Cushitic languages with the greatest number of total speakers are Oromo (37 million), Somali (24 million), Beja (3.2 million), Sidamo (3 million), and Afar (2 million).\nOromo serves as one of the official working languages of Ethiopia and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system including Oromia, Harari and Dire Dawa regional states and of the Oromia Zone in the Amhara Region.\nSomali is the first of two official languages of Somalia and three official languages of Somaliland. It also serves as a language of instruction in Djibouti, and as the working language of the Somali Region in Ethiopia.\nBeja, Afar, Blin and Saho, the languages of the Cushitic branch of Afroasiatic that are spoken in Eritrea, are languages of instruction in the Eritrean elementary school curriculum. The constitution of Eritrea also recognizes the equality of all natively spoken languages. Additionally, Afar is a language of instruction in Djibouti, as well as the working language of the Afar Region in Ethiopia.\nOrigin and prehistory.\nChristopher Ehret argues for a unified Proto-Cushitic language in the Red Sea Hills as far back as the Early Holocene. The expansion of Cushitic languages of the Southern Cushitic branch into the Rift Valley is associated with the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic.\nTypological characteristics.\nPhonology.\nMost Cushitic languages have a simple five-vowel system with phonemic length (); a notable exception are the Agaw languages, which do not contrast vowel length, but have one or two additional central vowels. The consonant inventory of many Cushitic languages includes glottalic consonants, e.g. in Oromo, which has the ejectives and the implosive . Less common are pharyngeal consonants , which appear e.g. in Somali or the Saho\u2013Afar languages.\nMost Cushitic languages have a system of restrictive tone also known as \"pitch accent\" in which tonal contours overlaid on the stressed syllable play a prominent role in morphology and syntax.\nGrammar.\nNouns.\nNouns are inflected for case and number. All nouns are further grouped into two gender categories, masculine gender and feminine gender. In many languages, gender is overtly marked directly on the noun (e.g. in Awngi, where all female nouns carry the suffix \"-a\").\nThe case system of many Cushitic languages is characterized by marked nominative alignment, which is typologically quite rare and predominantly found in languages of Africa. In marked nominative languages, the noun appears in unmarked \"absolutive\" case when cited in isolation, or when used as predicative noun and as object of a transitive verb; on the other hand, it is explicitly marked for nominative case when it functions as subject in a transitive or intransitive sentence.\nPossession is usually expressed by genitive case marking of the possessor. South Cushitic\u2014which has no case marking for subject and object\u2014follows the opposite strategy: here, the possessed noun is marked for construct case, e.g. Iraqw \"af\u00e9-r mar'i\" \"doors\" (lit. \"mouths of houses\"), where \"afee\" \"mouth\" is marked for construct case.\nMost nouns are by default unmarked for number, but can be explicitly marked for singular (\"singulative\") and plural number. E.g. in Bilin, \"d\u0259mmu\" \"cat(s)\" is number-neutral, from which singular \"d\u0259mmura\" \"a single cat\" and plural \"d\u0259mmut\" \"several cats\" can be formed. Plural formation is very diverse, and employs ablaut (i.e. changes of root vowels or consonants), suffixes and reduplication.\nVerbs.\nVerbs are inflected for person/number and tense/aspect. Many languages also have a special form of the verb in negative clauses.\nMost Cushitic languages distinguish seven person/number categories: first, second, third person, singular and plural number, with a masculine/feminine gender distinction in third person singular. The most common conjugation type employs suffixes. Some languages also have a prefix conjugation: in Beja and the Saho\u2013Afar languages, the prefix conjugation is still a productive part of the verb paradigm, whereas in most other languages, e.g. Somali, it is restricted to only a few verbs. It is generally assumed that historically, the suffix conjugation developed from the older prefix conjugation, by combining the verb stem with a suffixed auxiliary verb. The following table gives an example for the suffix and prefix conjugations in affirmative present tense in Somali.\nSyntax.\nBasic word order is verb final, the most common order being subject\u2013object\u2013verb (SOV). The subject or object can also follow the verb to indicate focus.\nClassification.\nOverview.\nThe phylum was first designated as \"Cushitic\" in 1858. Traditionally, Cushitic has been divided into North Cushitic (consisting solely of Beja), Central Cushitic (the Agaw languages), and the large East Cushitic group. Greenberg (1950) argued for the inclusion of the South Cushitic group. The Omotic languages, once classified as West Cushitic, have almost universally been reclassified as a separate branch of Afroasiatic.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis classification has not been without contention. For example, it has been argued that Southern Cushitic belongs in the Eastern branch, with its divergence explained by contact with Hadza- and Sandawe-like languages. Hetzron (1980) and Fleming (post-1981) exclude Beja altogether, though this is rejected by other linguists. Some of the classifications that have been proposed over the years are summarized here:\nFor debate on the placement of the Cushitic branch within Afroasiatic, see Afroasiatic languages.\nBeja.\nBeja constitutes the only member of the Northern Cushitic subgroup. As such, Beja contains a number of linguistic innovations that are unique to it, as is also the situation with the other subgroups of Cushitic (e.g. idiosyncratic features in Agaw or Central Cushitic). Hetzron (1980) argues that Beja therefore may comprise an independent branch of the Afroasiatic family. However, this suggestion has been rejected by most other scholars. The characteristics of Beja that differ from those of other Cushitic languages are instead generally acknowledged as normal branch variation.\nDidier Morin (2001) assigned Beja to Lowland East Cushitic on the grounds that the language shared lexical and phonological features with the Afar and Saho idioms, and also because the languages were historically spoken in adjacent speech areas. However, among linguists specializing in the Cushitic languages, the standard classification of Beja as North Cushitic is accepted.\nBlemmyan, an early form of Beja \u2013 mostly attested through onomastic evidence, but also directly by a small text on an ostracon from Saqqara \u2013 was spoken by the Blemmyes, an ancient people of Lower Nubia that appears in the Egyptian historical records from the 6th century BCE onwards. It is also likely that the Medjay spoke a language that was ancestral to Beja.\nOmotic.\nCushitic was formerly seen as also including most or all of the Omotic languages. An early view by Enrico Cerulli proposed a \"Sidama\" subgroup comprising most of the Omotic languages and the Sidamic group of Highland East Cushitic. Mario Martino Moreno in 1940 divided Cerulli's Sidama, uniting the Sidamic proper and the Lowland Cushitic languages as East Cushitic, the remainder as West Cushitic or \"ta/ne\" Cushitic. The Aroid languages were not considered Cushitic by either scholar (thought by Cerulli to be instead Nilotic); they were added to West Cushitic by Joseph Greenberg in 1963. Further work in the 1960s soon led to the putative West Cushitic being seen as typologically divergent and renamed as \"Omotic\".\nToday the inclusion of Omotic as a part of Cushitic has been abandoned. Omotic is most often seen as an independent branch of Afroasiatic, primarily due to the work of Harold C. Fleming (1974) and Lionel Bender (1975); some linguists like Paul Newman (1980) challenge Omotic's classification within the Afroasiatic family itself.\nOther divergent languages.\nThere are also a few languages of uncertain classification, including Yaaku, Dahalo, Aasax, Kw'adza, Boon, Ongota and the Cushitic component of Mbugu (Ma'a). There is a wide range of opinions as to how the languages are interrelated.\nThe positions of the Dullay languages and of Yaaku are uncertain. They have traditionally been assigned to an East Cushitic subbranch along with Highland (Sidamic) and Lowland East Cushitic. However, Hayward thinks that East Cushitic may not be a valid node and that its constituents should be considered separately when attempting to work out the internal relationships of Cushitic. Bender (2020) suggests Yaaku to be a divergent member of the Arboroid group.\nThe Afroasiatic identity of Ongota has also been broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, because of the \"mixed\" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. Harold C. Fleming (2006) proposes that Ongota is a separate branch of Afroasiatic. Bonny Sands (2009) thinks the most convincing proposal is by Sav\u00e0 and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a Nilo-Saharan substratum. In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language while retaining some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.\nHetzron (1980) and Ehret (1995) have suggested that the South Cushitic languages (Rift languages) are a part of Lowland East Cushitic, the only one of the six groups with much internal diversity.\nHypothesized Cushitic substrate languages.\nSome of the ancient peoples of Nubia are hypothesized to have spoken languages belonging to the Cushitic group, especially the people of the C-Group culture. It has been speculated that these people left a substratum of Cushitic words in the modern Nubian languages. Given the scarcity of data (all onomastic or toponymic), however, it remains unclear if the C-Group culture in fact spoke a Cushitic language.\nChristopher Ehret (1998) proposed on the basis of loanwords that South Cushitic languages (called \"Tale\" and \"Bisha\" by Ehret) were spoken in an area closer to Lake Victoria than are found today.\nAlso, historically, the Southern Nilotic languages have undergone extensive contact with a \"missing\" branch of East Cushitic that Heine (1979) refers to as \"Baz\". Mous and Rapold (2025) instead attribute these loans to various stages of other, already attested Cushitic languages.\nReconstruction.\nChristopher Ehret proposed a reconstruction of Proto-Cushitic in 1987, but did not base this on individual branch reconstructions. Grover Hudson (1989) has done some preliminary work on Highland East Cushitic, David Appleyard (2006) has proposed a reconstruction of Proto-Agaw, and Roland Kie\u00dfling and Maarten Mous (2003) have jointly proposed a reconstruction of West Rift Southern Cushitic. No reconstruction has been published for Lowland East Cushitic, though Paul D. Black wrote his (unpublished) dissertation on the topic in 1974. Hans-J\u00fcrgen Sasse (1979) proposed a reconstruction of the consonants of Proto-East Cushitic. No comparative work has yet brought these branch reconstructions together.\nComparative vocabulary.\nBasic vocabulary.\nSample basic vocabulary of Cushitic languages from Vossen &amp; Dimmendaal (2020:318) (with PSC denoting Proto-Southern Cushitic):\nNumerals.\nComparison of numerals in individual Cushitic languages:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7279", "revid": "31711350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7279", "title": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code", "text": "Section of the United States Bankruptcy Code\nChapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) permits reorganization under the bankruptcy laws of the United States. Such reorganization, known as Chapter 11 bankruptcy, is available to every business, whether organized as a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship, and to individuals, although it is most prominently used by corporate entities. In contrast, Chapter 7 governs the process of a liquidation bankruptcy, though liquidation may also occur under Chapter 11; while Chapter 13 provides a reorganization process for the majority of private individuals.\nChapter 11 overview.\nWhen a business is unable to service its debt or pay its creditors, the business or its creditors can file with a federal bankruptcy court for protection under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 11.\nIn Chapter 7, the business ceases operations, a trustee sells all of its assets, and then distributes the proceeds to its creditors. Any residual amount is returned to the owners of the company.\nIn Chapter 11, in most instances the debtor remains in control of its business operations as a debtor in possession, and is subject to the oversight and jurisdiction of the court.\nA Chapter 11 bankruptcy will result in one of three outcomes for the debtor: reorganization, conversion to Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or dismissal. In order for a Chapter 11 debtor to reorganize, the debtor must file (and the court must confirm) a plan of reorganization. In effect, the plan is a compromise between the major stakeholders in the case, including the debtor and its creditors. Most Chapter 11 cases aim to confirm a plan, but that may not always be possible.\nIf the judge approves the reorganization plan and the creditors all agree, then the plan can be confirmed. Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code requires the bankruptcy court reach certain conclusions prior to confirming or approving the plan and making it binding on all parties in the case, most notably that the plan complies with applicable law and was proposed in good faith. The court must also find that the reorganization plan is feasible in that, unless the plan provides otherwise, the plan is not likely to be followed by further reorganization or liquidation.\nIn a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor corporation is typically recapitalized so that it emerges from bankruptcy with more equity and less debt, a process through which some of the debtor corporation's debts may be discharged. Determinations as to which debts are discharged, and how equity and other entitlements are distributed to various groups of investors, are often based on a \nvaluation of the reorganized business. Bankruptcy valuation is often highly contentious because it is both subjective and important to case outcomes. The methods of valuation used in bankruptcy have changed over time, generally tracking methods used in investment banking, Delaware corporate law, and corporate and academic finance, but with a significant time lag.\nFeatures of Chapter 11 reorganization.\nChapter 11 retains many of the features present in all or most bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. It provides additional tools for debtors as well. Most importantly, \u00a0https:// empowers the trustee to operate the debtor's business. In Chapter 11, unless a separate trustee is appointed for cause, the debtor, as debtor in possession, acts as trustee of the business.\nChapter 11 affords the debtor to possess several mechanisms to restructure its business. A debtor in possession can acquire financing and loans on favorable terms by giving new lenders first priority on the business's earnings. The court may also permit the debtor in possession to reject and cancel contracts. Debtors are also protected from other litigation against the business through the imposition of an automatic stay. While the automatic stay is in place, creditors are stayed from any collection attempts or activities against the debtor in possession, and most litigation against the debtor is stayed, or put on hold, until it can be resolved in bankruptcy court, or resumed in its original venue. An example of proceedings that are not necessarily stayed automatically is family law proceedings against a spouse or parent. Further, creditors may file with the court seeking relief from the automatic stay.\nIf the business is insolvent, its debts exceed its assets, and the business is unable to pay debts as they come due, the bankruptcy restructuring may result in the company's owners being left with nothing; instead, the owners' rights and interests are ended and the company's creditors are left with ownership of the newly reorganized company.\nAll creditors are entitled to be heard by the court. The court is ultimately responsible for determining whether the proposed plan of reorganization complies with bankruptcy laws.\nOne controversy that has broken out in bankruptcy courts concerns the proper amount of disclosure that the court and other parties are entitled to receive from the members of the creditor's committees that play a large role in many proceedings.\nChapter 11 plan.\nChapter 11 usually results in the reorganization of the debtor's business or personal assets and debts, but can also be used as a mechanism for liquidation. Debtors may \"emerge\" from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy within a few months or within several years, depending on the size and complexity of the bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code accomplishes this objective through the use of a bankruptcy plan. The debtor in possession typically has the first opportunity to propose a plan during the period of exclusivity. This period allows the debtor 120 days from the date of filing for Chapter 11 to propose a plan of reorganization before any other party in interest may propose a plan. If the debtor proposes a plan within the 120-day exclusivity period, a 180-day exclusivity period from the date of filing for Chapter 11 is granted in order to allow the debtor to gain confirmation of the proposed plan. With some exceptions, the plan may be proposed by any party in interest. Interested creditors then vote for a plan.\nConfirmation.\nIf the judge approves the reorganization plan and the creditors agree, the plan can be confirmed. If at least one class of creditors objects and votes against the plan, it may nonetheless be confirmed if the requirements of cramdown are met. In order to be confirmed over the creditors' objection, the plan must not discriminate against that class of creditors, and the plan must be found fair and equitable to that class. Upon confirmation, the plan becomes binding and identifies the treatment of debts and operations of the business for the duration of the plan. If a plan cannot be confirmed, the court may either convert the case to a liquidation under Chapter 7 or, if, in the best interests of the creditors and the estate, the case may be dismissed, resulting in a return to the status quo before bankruptcy. If the case is dismissed, creditors will look to non-bankruptcy law in order to satisfy their claims.\nIn order to proceed to the confirmation hearing, the bankruptcy court must approve a disclosure statement. Once the disclosure statement is approved, the plan proponent will solicit votes from the classes of creditors. Solicitation is the process by which creditors vote on the proposed confirmation plan. This process can be complicated if creditors fail or refuse to vote. In this case, the plan proponent might tailor his or her efforts to obtain votes, or the plan itself. The plan may be modified before confirmation, so long as the modified plan meets all the requirements of Chapter 11.\nA chapter 11 case typically results in one of three outcomes: a reorganization, a conversion into chapter 7 liquidation, or it is dismissed.\nFor a Chapter 11 debtor to reorganize, they must file (and the court must confirm) a reorganization plan. Simply put, the plan is a compromise between the major stakeholders in the case, including, but not limited to the debtor and its creditors. Most chapter 11 cases aim to confirm a plan, but that may not always be possible. Section 1121(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides for an exclusivity period in which only the debtor may file a plan of reorganization. This period lasts 120 days after the date of the order for relief, and if the debtor does file a plan within the first 120 days, the exclusivity period is extended to 180 days after the order for relief for the debtor to seek acceptance of the plan by holders of claims and interests.\nIf the judge approves the reorganization plan and the creditors all \"agree\", then the plan can be confirmed. \u00a71129 of the Bankruptcy Code requires the bankruptcy court reach certain conclusions prior to \"confirming\" or \"approving\" the plan and making it binding on all parties in the case. Most importantly, the bankruptcy court must find the plan (a) complies with applicable law, and (b) has been proposed in good faith. Furthermore, the court must determine whether the plan is \"feasible,\" In other words, the court must safeguard that confirming the plan will not yield to liquidation down the road.\nThe plan must ensure that the debtor will be able to pay most administrative and priority claims (priority claims over unsecured claims) on the effective date.\nAutomatic stay.\nLike other forms of bankruptcy, petitions filed under Chapter 11 invoke the automatic stay of \u00a7\u00a0362. The automatic stay requires all creditors to cease collection attempts, making many post-petition debt collection efforts void or voidable. Under some circumstances, some creditors, or the United States Trustee, can request the court convert the case into a liquidation under Chapter 7 or appoint a trustee to manage the debtor's business. The court will grant a motion to convert to Chapter 7 or appoint a trustee if either of these actions is in the best interest of all creditors. Sometimes, a company will liquidate under Chapter 11 (perhaps in a 363 sale), in which the pre-existing management may be able to help get a higher price for divisions or other assets than a Chapter 7 liquidation would be likely to achieve. Section 362(d) of the Bankruptcy Code allows the court to terminate, annul, or modify the continuation of the automatic stay as may be necessary or appropriate to balance the competing interests of the debtor, its estate, creditors, and other parties in interest and grants the bankruptcy court considerable flexibility to tailor relief to the exigencies of the circumstances. Relief from the automatic stay is generally sought by motion and, if opposed, is treated as a contested matter under Bankruptcy Rule 9014. A party seeking relief from the automatic stay must also pay the filing fee required by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1930(b).\nExecutory contracts.\nIn the new millennium, airlines have fallen under intense scrutiny for what many see as abusing Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a tool for escaping labor contracts, usually 30\u201335% of an airline's operating cost. Every major US airline has filed for Chapter 11 since 2002. In the space of 2 years (2002\u20132004) US Airways filed for bankruptcy twice leaving the AFL\u2013CIO, pilot unions and other airline employees claiming the rules of Chapter 11 have helped turn the United States into a corporatocracy. The trustee or debtor-in-possession is given the right, under \u00a7 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, subject to court approval, to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases. The trustee or debtor-in-possession must assume or reject an executory contract in its entirety unless some portion of it is severable. The trustee or debtor-in-possession normally assumes a contract or lease if it is needed to operate the reorganized business or if it can be assigned or sold at a profit. The trustee or debtor-in-possession normally rejects a contract or lease to transform damage claims arising from the nonperformance of those obligations into a prepetition claim. In some situations, rejection can limit the damages a contract counterparty can claim against the debtor.\nPriority.\nChapter 11 follows the same priority scheme as other bankruptcy chapters. The priority structure is defined primarily by \u00a7\u00a0507 of the Bankruptcy Code (\u00a0https://).\nAs a general rule, administrative expenses (the actual, necessary expenses of preserving the bankruptcy estate, including expenses such as employee wages and the cost of litigating the Chapter 11 case) are paid first. Secured creditors\u2014creditors who have a security interest, or collateral, in the debtor's property\u2014will be paid before unsecured creditors. Unsecured creditors' claims are prioritized by \u00a7\u00a0507. For instance, the claims of suppliers of products or employees of a company may be paid before other unsecured creditors are paid. Each priority level must be paid in full before the next lower priority level may receive payment.\nSection 1110.\nSection 1110 (\u00a0https://) generally provides a secured party with an interest in an aircraft the ability to take possession of the equipment within 60 days after a bankruptcy filing unless the airline cures all defaults. More specifically, the right of the lender to take possession of the secured equipment is not hampered by the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nSubchapter V.\nIn August 2019, the Small Business Reorganization Act of 2019 (\"SBRA\") added Subchapter V to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Subchapter V, which took effect in February 2020, is reserved exclusively for small business debtors to expedite bankruptcy procedures and economically resolve small business bankruptcy cases.\nSubchapter V retains many of the advantages of a traditional Chapter 11 case without the unnecessary procedural burdens and costs. It seeks to increase the debtor's ability to negotiate a successful reorganization, retain control of the business, increase oversight, and ensure a quick reorganization.\nA Subchapter V case contrasts with a traditional Chapter 11 in several key aspects: it is earmarked only for the \"small business debtor\" (as defined by the Bankruptcy Code), so only a debtor can file a plan of reorganization. The SBRA requires the U.S. Trustee to appoint a \"Subchapter V trustee\" to every Subchapter V case to supervise and control estate funds and facilitate the development of a consensual plan. It also eliminates the automatic appointment of an official committee of unsecured creditors and abolishes quarterly fees usually paid to the U.S. Trustee throughout the case. Most notably, Subchapter V allows the small business owner to retain their equity in the business so long as the reorganization plan does not discriminate unfairly and is fair and equitable with respect to each class of claims or interests.\nConsiderations.\nThe reorganization and court process may take an inordinate amount of time, limiting the chances of a successful outcome and sufficient debtor-in-possession financing may be unavailable during an economic recession. A preplanned, pre-agreed approach between the debtor and its creditors (sometimes called a pre-packaged bankruptcy) may facilitate the desired result. A company undergoing Chapter 11 reorganization is effectively operating under the \"protection\" of the court until it emerges. An example is the airline industry in the United States; in 2006 over half the industry's seating capacity was on airlines that were in Chapter 11. These airlines were able to stop making debt payments, break their previously agreed upon labor union contracts, freeing up cash to expand routes or weather a price war against competitors \u2014 all with the bankruptcy court's approval.\nStudies on the impact of forestalling the creditors' rights to enforce their security reach different conclusions.\nStatistics.\nFrequency.\nChapter 11 cases dropped by 60% from 1991 to 2003. One 2007 study found this was because businesses were turning to bankruptcy-like proceedings under state law, rather than the federal bankruptcy proceedings, including those under chapter 11. Insolvency proceedings under state law, the study stated, are currently faster, less expensive, and more private, with some states not even requiring court filings. However, a 2005 study claimed the drop may have been due to an increase in the incorrect classification of many bankruptcies as \"consumer cases\" rather than \"business cases\".\nCases involving more than US$50 million in assets are almost always handled in federal bankruptcy court, and not in bankruptcy-like state proceeding.\nLargest cases.\nThe largest bankruptcy in history was of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which listed $639 billion in assets as of its Chapter 11 filing in 2008. The 16 largest corporate bankruptcies as of December 13, 2011\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plainlist/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEnron, Lehman Brothers, MF Global and Refco have all ceased operations while others were acquired by other buyers or emerged as a new company with a similar name.\n\u2021 The Enron assets were taken from the 10-Q filed on November 11, 2001. The company announced that the annual financials were under review at the time of filing for Chapter 11.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7283", "revid": "3632083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7283", "title": "Controversy", "text": "State of prolonged public dispute or debate\nControversy (, ) is a state of prolonged public dispute or debate, usually concerning a matter of conflicting opinion or point of view. The word was coined from the Latin \"controversia\", as a composite of \"controversus\" \u2013 \"turned in an opposite direction\", and also means an exercise in rhetoric practiced in Rome. \nLegal.\nIn the theory of law, a controversy differs from a legal case; while legal cases include all suits, criminal as well as civil, a controversy is a purely civil proceeding.\nFor example, the Case or Controversy Clause of Article Three of the United States Constitution (, Clause 1) states that \"the judicial Power shall extend\u00a0...\u00a0to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party\". This clause has been deemed to impose a requirement that United States federal courts are not permitted to cases that do not pose an actual controversy\u2014that is, an actual dispute between adverse parties which is capable of being resolved by the [court]. In addition to setting out the scope of the jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, it also prohibits courts from issuing advisory opinions, or from hearing cases that are either unripe, meaning that the controversy has not arisen yet, or moot, meaning that the controversy has already been resolved.\nBenford's law.\nBenford's law of controversy, as expressed by the astrophysicist and science fiction author Gregory Benford in 1980, states: \"Passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available.\" In other words, it claims that the less factual information is available on a topic, the more controversy can arise around that topic \u2013 and the more facts are available, the less controversy can arise. Thus, for example, controversies in physics would be limited to subject areas where experiments cannot be carried out yet, whereas controversies would be inherent to politics, where communities must frequently decide on courses of action based on insufficient information.\nPsychological bases.\nControversies are frequently thought to be a result of a lack of confidence on the part of the disputants \u2013 as implied by Benford's law of controversy, which only talks about lack of information (\"passion is inversely proportional to the amount of real information available\"). For example, in analyses of the political controversy over anthropogenic climate change, which is exceptionally virulent in the United States, it has been proposed that those who are opposed to the scientific consensus do so because they don't have enough information about the topic. A study of 1540 US adults found instead that levels of scientific literacy correlated with the strength of opinion on climate change, but not on which side of the debate that they stood.\nThe puzzling phenomenon of two individuals being able to reach different conclusions after being exposed to the same facts has been frequently explained (particularly by Daniel Kahneman) by reference to a 'bounded rationality' \u2013 in other words, that most judgments are made using fast acting heuristics that work well in every day situations, but are not amenable to decision-making about complex subjects such as climate change. Anchoring has been particularly identified as relevant in climate change controversies as individuals are found to be more positively inclined to believe in climate change if the outside temperature is higher, if they have been primed to think about heat, and if they are primed with higher temperatures when thinking about the future temperature increases from climate change.\nIn other controversies \u2013 such as that around the HPV vaccine, the same evidence seemed to license inference to radically different conclusions. Kahan et al. explained this by the cognitive biases of biased assimilation and a credibility heuristic.\nSimilar effects on reasoning are also seen in non-scientific controversies, for example in the gun control debate in the United States. As with other controversies, it has been suggested that exposure to empirical facts would be sufficient to resolve the debate once and for all. In computer simulations of cultural communities, beliefs were found to polarize within isolated sub-groups, based on the mistaken belief of the community's unhindered access to ground truth. Such confidence in the group to find the ground truth is explicable through the success of wisdom of the crowd based inferences. However, if there is no access to the ground truth, as there was not in this model, the method will fail.\nBayesian decision theory allows these failures of rationality to be described as part of a statistically optimized system for decision making. Experiments and computational models in multisensory integration have shown that sensory input from different senses is integrated in a statistically optimal way, in addition, it appears that the kind of inferences used to infer single sources for multiple sensory inputs uses a Bayesian inference about the causal origin of the sensory stimuli. As such, it appears neurobiologically plausible that the brain implements decision-making procedures that are close to optimal for Bayesian inference.\nBrocas and Carrillo propose a model to make decisions based on noisy sensory inputs, beliefs about the state of the world are modified by Bayesian updating, and then decisions are made based on beliefs passing a threshold. They show that this model, when optimized for single-step decision making, produces belief anchoring and polarization of opinions \u2013 exactly as described in the global warming controversy context \u2013 in spite of identical evidence presented, the pre-existing beliefs (or evidence presented first) has an overwhelming effect on the beliefs formed. In addition, the preferences of the agent (the particular rewards that they value) also cause the beliefs formed to change \u2013 this explains the biased assimilation (also known as confirmation bias) shown above. This model allows the production of controversy to be seen as a consequence of a decision maker optimized for single-step decision making, rather than a result of limited reasoning in the bounded rationality of Daniel Kahneman.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This constricted region of chromosome connects the sister chromatids, creating a short arm (p) and a long arm (q) on the chromatids. During mitosis, spindle fibers attach to the centromere via the kinetochore.\nThe physical role of the centromere is to act as the site of assembly of the kinetochores \u2013 a highly complex multiprotein structure that is responsible for the actual events of chromosome segregation \u2013 i.e. binding microtubules and signaling to the cell cycle machinery when all chromosomes have adopted correct attachments to the spindle, so that it is safe for cell division to proceed to completion and for cells to enter anaphase.\nThere are, broadly speaking, two types of centromeres. \"Point centromeres\" bind to specific proteins that recognize particular DNA sequences with high efficiency. Any piece of DNA with the point centromere DNA sequence on it will typically form a centromere if present in the appropriate species. The best characterized point centromeres are those of the budding yeast, \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\". \"Regional centromeres\" is the term coined to describe most centromeres, which typically form on regions of preferred DNA sequence, but which can form on other DNA sequences as well. The signal for formation of a regional centromere appears to be epigenetic. Most organisms, ranging from the fission yeast \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\" to humans, have regional centromeres.\nRegarding mitotic chromosome structure, centromeres represent a constricted region of the chromosome (often referred to as the primary constriction) where two identical sister chromatids are most closely in contact. When cells enter mitosis, the sister chromatids (the two copies of each chromosomal DNA molecule resulting from DNA replication in chromatin form) are linked along their length by the action of the cohesin complex. It is now believed that this complex is mostly released from chromosome arms during prophase, so that by the time the chromosomes line up at the mid-plane of the mitotic spindle (also known as the metaphase plate), the last place where they are linked with one another is in the chromatin in and around the centromere.\nPosition.\nIn humans, centromere positions define the chromosomal karyotype, in which each chromosome has two arms, \"p\" (the shorter of the two) and \"q\" (the longer). The short arm 'p' is reportedly named for the French word \"petit\" meaning 'small'. The position of the centromere relative to any particular linear chromosome is used to classify chromosomes as metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric, telocentric, or holocentric.\nMetacentric.\nMetacentric means that the centromere is positioned midway between the chromosome ends, resulting in the arms being approximately equal in length. When the centromeres are metacentric, the chromosomes appear to be \"x-shaped.\"\nSubmetacentric.\nSubmetacentric means that the centromere is positioned below the middle, with one chromosome arm shorter than the other, often resulting in an L shape.\nAcrocentric.\nAn acrocentric chromosome's centromere is situated so that one of the chromosome arms is much shorter than the other. The \"acro-\" in acrocentric refers to the Greek word for \"peak.\" The human genome has six acrocentric chromosomes, including five autosomal chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21, 22) and the Y chromosome.\nShort acrocentric p-arms contain little genetic material and can be translocated without significant harm, as in a balanced Robertsonian translocation. In addition to some protein coding genes, human acrocentric p-arms also contain Nucleolus organizer regions (NORs), from which ribosomal RNA is transcribed. However, a proportion of acrocentric p-arms in cell lines and tissues from normal human donors do not contain detectable NORs. The domestic horse genome includes one metacentric chromosome that is homologous to two acrocentric chromosomes in the conspecific but undomesticated Przewalski's horse. This may reflect either fixation of a balanced Robertsonian translocation in domestic horses or, conversely, fixation of the fission of one metacentric chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes in Przewalski's horses. A similar situation exists between the human and great ape genomes, with a reduction of two acrocentric chromosomes in the great apes to one metacentric chromosome in humans (see aneuploidy and the human chromosome 2).\nMany diseases from the result of unbalanced translocations more frequently involve acrocentric chromosomes than other non-acrocentric chromosomes. Acrocentric chromosomes are usually located in and around the nucleolus. As a result, these chromosomes tend to be less densely packed than chromosomes in the nuclear periphery. Consistently, chromosomal regions that are less densely packed are also more prone to chromosomal translocations in cancers.\nTelocentric.\nTelocentric chromosomes have a centromere at one end of the chromosome and therefore exhibit only one arm at the cytological (microscopic) level. They are not present in humans but can form through cellular chromosomal errors. Telocentric chromosomes occur naturally in many species, such as the house mouse, in which all chromosomes except the Y are telocentric.\nSubtelocentric.\nSubtelocentric chromosomes' centromeres are located between the middle and the end of the chromosomes, but reside closer to the end of the chromosomes.\nCentromere types.\nAcentric.\nAn acentric chromosome is fragment of a chromosome that lacks a centromere. Since centromeres are the attachment point for spindle fibers in cell division, acentric fragments are not evenly distributed to daughter cells during cell division. As a result, a daughter cell will lack the acentric fragment and deleterious consequences could occur.\nChromosome-breaking events can also generate acentric chromosomes or acentric fragments.\u00a0 \u00a0\nDicentric.\nA dicentric chromosome is an abnormal chromosome with two centromeres, which can be unstable through cell divisions. It can form through translocation between or fusion of two chromosome segments, each with a centromere. Some rearrangements produce both dicentric chromosomes and acentric fragments which can not attach to spindles at mitosis. The formation of dicentric chromosomes has been attributed to genetic processes, such as Robertsonian translocation and paracentric inversion. Dicentric chromosomes can have a variety of fates, including mitotic stability. In some cases, their stability comes from inactivation of one of the two centromeres to make a functionally monocentric chromosome capable of normal transmission to daughter cells during cell division.\nFor example, human chromosome 2, which is believed to be the result of a Robertsonian translocation at some point in the evolution between the great apes and \"Homo\", has a second, vestigial, centromere near the middle of its long arm.\nMonocentric.\nThe monocentric chromosome is a chromosome that has only one centromere in a chromosome and forms a narrow constriction.\nMonocentric centromeres are the most common structure on highly repetitive DNA in plants and animals.\nHolocentric.\nUnlike monocentric chromosomes, holocentric chromosomes have no distinct primary constriction when viewed at mitosis. Instead, spindle fibers attach along almost the entire (Greek: holo-) length of the chromosome. In holocentric chromosomes centromeric proteins, such as CENPA (CenH3) are spread over the whole chromosome. The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, is a well-known example of an organism with holocentric chromosomes, but this type of centromere can be found in various species, plants, and animals, across eukaryotes. Holocentromeres are actually composed of multiple distributed centromere units that form a line-like structure along the chromosomes during mitosis. Alternative or nonconventional strategies are deployed at meiosis to achieve the homologous chromosome pairing and segregation needed to produce viable gametes or gametophytes for sexual reproduction.\nDifferent types of holocentromeres exist in different species, namely with or without centromeric repetitive DNA sequences and with or without CenH3. Holocentricity has evolved at least 13 times independently in various green algae, protozoans, invertebrates, and different plant families. Contrary to monocentric species where acentric fragments usually become lost during cell division, the breakage of holocentric chromosomes creates fragments with normal spindle fiber attachment sites. Because of this, organisms with holocentric chromosomes can more rapidly evolve karyotype variation, able to heal fragmented chromosomes through subsequent addition of telomere caps at the sites of breakage.\nPolycentric.\nPolycentric chromosomes have several kinetochore clusters, i.e. centromes. The term overlaps partially with \"holocentric\", but \"polycentric\" is clearly preferred when discussing defectively formed monocentric chromosomes. There is some actual ambiguity as well, as there is no clear line dividing up the transition from kinetochores covering the whole chromosome to distinct clusters. In other words, the difference between \"the whole chromosome is a centrome\" and \"the chromosome has no centrome\" is hazy and usage varies. Beyond \"polycentricity\" being used more about defects, there is no clear preference in other topics such as evolutionary origin or kinetochore distribution and detailed structure (e.g. as seen in tagging or genome assembly analysis).\nEven clearly distinct clusters of kinetochore proteins do not necessarily produce more than one constriction: \"Metapolycentric\" chromosomes feature one elongated constriction of the chromosome, joining a longer segment which is still visibly shorter than the chromatids. Metapolycentric chromosomes may be a step in the emergence and suppression of centromere drive, a type of meiotic drive that disrupts parity by monocentric centromeres growing additional kinetochore proteins to gain an advantage during meiosis.\nHuman chromosomes.\nBased on the micrographic characteristics of size, position of the centromere and sometimes the presence of a chromosomal satellite, the human chromosomes are classified into the following groups:\nSequence.\nThere are two types of centromeres. In regional centromeres, DNA sequences contribute to but do not define function. Regional centromeres contain large amounts of DNA and are often packaged into heterochromatin. In most eukaryotes, the centromere's DNA sequence consists of large arrays of repetitive DNA (e.g. satellite DNA) where the sequence within individual repeat elements is similar but not identical. In humans, the primary centromeric repeat unit is called \u03b1-satellite (or alphoid), although a number of other sequence types are found in this region. Centromere satellites are hypothesized to evolve by a process called layered expansion. They evolve rapidly between species, and analyses in wild mice show that satellite copy number and heterogeneity relates to population origins and subspecies. Additionally, satellite sequences may be affected by inbreeding.\nPoint centromeres are smaller and more compact. DNA sequences are both necessary and sufficient to specify centromere identity and function in organisms with point centromeres. In budding yeasts, the centromere region is relatively small (about 125 bp DNA) and contains two highly conserved DNA sequences that serve as binding sites for essential kinetochore proteins.\nInheritance.\nSince centromeric DNA sequence is not the key determinant of centromeric identity in metazoans, it is thought that epigenetic inheritance plays a major role in specifying the centromere. The daughter chromosomes will assemble centromeres in the same place as the parent chromosome, independent of sequence. It has been proposed that histone H3 variant CENP-A (Centromere Protein A) is the epigenetic mark of the centromere. The question arises whether there must be still some original way in which the centromere is specified, even if it is subsequently propagated epigenetically. If the centromere is inherited epigenetically from one generation to the next, the problem is pushed back to the origin of the first metazoans.\nOn the other hand, thanks to comparisons of the centromeres in the X chromosomes, epigenetic and structural variations have been seen in these regions. In addition, a recent assembly of the human genome has detected a possible mechanism of how pericentromeric and centromeric structures evolve, through a layered expansion model for \u03b1Sat sequences. This model proposes that different \u03b1Sat sequence repeats emerge periodically and expand within an active vector, displacing old sequences, and becoming the site of kinetochore assembly. The \u03b1Sat can originate from the same, or from different vectors. As this process is repeated over time, the layers that flank the active centromere shrink and deteriorate. This process raises questions about the relationship between this dynamic evolutionary process and the position of the centromere.\nStructure.\nThe centromeric DNA is normally in a heterochromatin state, which is essential for the recruitment of the cohesin complex that mediates sister chromatid cohesion after DNA replication as well as coordinating sister chromatid separation during anaphase. In this chromatin, the normal histone H3 is replaced with a centromere-specific variant, CENP-A in humans. The presence of CENP-A is believed to be important for the assembly of the kinetochore on the centromere. CENP-C has been shown to localise almost exclusively to these regions of CENP-A associated chromatin. In human cells, the histones are found to be most enriched for H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 which are known heterochromatic modifications. In Drosophila, Islands of retroelements are major components of the centromeres.\nIn the yeast \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\" (and probably in other eukaryotes), the formation of centromeric heterochromatin is connected to RNAi. In nematodes such as \"Caenorhabditis elegans\", some plants, and the insect orders Lepidoptera and Hemiptera, chromosomes are \"holocentric\", indicating that there is not a primary site of microtubule attachments or a primary constriction, and a \"diffuse\" kinetochore assembles along the entire length of the chromosome.\nCentromeric aberrations.\nIn rare cases, neocentromeres can form at new sites on a chromosome as a result of a repositioning of the centromere. This phenomenon is most well known from human clinical studies and there are currently over 90 known human neocentromeres identified on 20 different chromosomes. The formation of a neocentromere must be coupled with the inactivation of the previous centromere, since chromosomes with two functional centromeres (Dicentric chromosome) will result in chromosome breakage during mitosis. In some unusual cases human neocentromeres have been observed to form spontaneously on fragmented chromosomes. Some of these new positions were originally euchromatic and lack alpha satellite DNA altogether. Neocentromeres lack the repetitive structure seen in normal centromeres which suggest that centromere formation is mainly controlled epigenetically. Over time a neocentromere can accumulate repetitive elements and mature into what is known as an evolutionary new centromere. There are several well known examples in primate chromosomes where the centromere position is different from the human centromere of the same chromosome and is thought to be evolutionary new centromeres. Centromere repositioning and the formation of evolutionary new centromeres has been suggested to be a mechanism of speciation.\nCentromere proteins are also the autoantigenic target for some anti-nuclear antibodies, such as anti-centromere antibodies.\nDysfunction and disease.\nIt has been known that centromere misregulation contributes to mis-segregation of chromosomes, which is strongly related to cancer and miscarriage. Notably, overexpression of many centromere genes have been linked to cancer malignant phenotypes. Overexpression of these centromere genes can increase genomic instability in cancers. Elevated genomic instability on one hand relates to malignant phenotypes; on the other hand, it makes the tumor cells more vulnerable to specific adjuvant therapies such as certain chemotherapies and radiotherapy. Instability of centromere repetitive DNA was recently shown in cancer and aging.\nRepair of centromeric DNA.\nWhen DNA breaks occur at centromeres in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, the cells are able to recruit the homologous recombinational repair machinery to the damaged site, even in the absence of a sister chromatid. It appears that homologous recombinational repair can occur at centromeric breaks throughout the cell cycle in order to prevent the activation of inaccurate mutagenic DNA repair pathways and to preserve centromeric integrity.\nEtymology and pronunciation.\nThe word \"centromere\" () uses combining forms of \"centro- and -mere\", yielding \"central part\", describing the centromere's location at the center of the chromosome.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been listed in the Guinness World Records as the best-selling desktop computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 12.5 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for US$. Preceded by the VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its 64 kilobytes (65,536 bytes) of RAM. With support for multicolor sprites and a custom chip for waveform generation, the C64 could create superior visuals and audio compared to systems without such custom hardware.\nThe C64 dominated the low-end computer market (except in the UK, France and Japan, lasting only about six months in Japan) for most of the later years of the 1980s. For a substantial period (1983\u20131986), the C64 had between 30% and 40% share of the US market and two million units sold per year, outselling IBM PC compatibles, the Apple II, and Atari 8-bit computers. Sam Tramiel, a later Atari president and the son of Commodore's founder, said in a 1989 interview, \"When I was at Commodore we were building 400,000 C64s a month for a couple of years.\" In the UK market, the C64 faced competition from the BBC Micro, the ZX Spectrum, and later the Amstrad CPC 464, but the C64 was still the second-most-popular computer in the UK after the ZX Spectrum. The Commodore 64 failed to make any impact in Japan, as their market was dominated by Japanese computers, such as the NEC PC-8801, Sharp X1, Fujitsu FM-7 and MSX, and in France, where the ZX Spectrum, Thomson MO5 and TO7, and Amstrad CPC 464 dominated the market.\nPart of the Commodore 64's success was its sale in regular retail stores instead of only electronics or computer hobbyist specialty stores. Commodore produced many of its parts in-house to control costs, including custom integrated circuit chips from MOS Technology. In the United States, it has been compared to the Ford Model T automobile for its role in bringing a new technology to middle-class households via creative and affordable mass-production. Approximately 10,000 commercial software titles have been made for the Commodore\u00a064, including development tools, office productivity applications, and video games. C64 emulators allow anyone with a modern computer, or a compatible video game console, to run these programs today. The C64 is also credited with popularizing the computer demoscene and is still used today by some computer hobbyists. In 2011, 17 years after it was taken off the market, research showed that brand recognition for the model was still at 87%.\nHistory.\nIn January 1981, MOS Technology, Inc., Commodore's integrated circuit design subsidiary, initiated a project to design the graphic and audio chips for a next-generation video game console. Design work for the chips, named MOS Technology VIC-II (Video Integrated Circuit for graphics) and MOS Technology SID (Sound Interface Device for audio), was completed in November 1981. Commodore then began a game console project that would use the new chips\u2014called the \"Ultimax\" or the \"MAX Machine\", engineered by Yash Terakura from Commodore Japan. This project was eventually cancelled after just a few machines were manufactured for the Japanese market. At the same time, Robert \"Bob\" Russell (system programmer and architect on the VIC-20) and Robert \"Bob\" Yannes (engineer of the SID) were critical of the current product line-up at Commodore, which was a continuation of the Commodore PET line aimed at business users. With the support of Al Charpentier (engineer of the VIC-II) and Charles Winterble (manager of MOS Technology), they proposed to Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel a low-cost sequel to the VIC-20. Tramiel dictated that the machine should have 64 KB of random-access memory (RAM). Although 64-Kbit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips cost over US$ at the time, he knew that 64K DRAM prices were falling and would drop to an acceptable level before full production was reached. The team was able to quickly design the computer because, unlike most other home-computer companies, Commodore had its own semiconductor fab to produce test chips; because the fab was not running at full capacity, development costs were part of existing corporate overhead. The chips were complete by November, by which time Charpentier, Winterble, and Tramiel had decided to proceed with the new computer; the latter set a final deadline for the first weekend of January, to coincide with the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nThe product was code named the VIC-40 as the successor to the popular VIC-20. The team that constructed it consisted of Yash Terakura, Shiraz Shivji, Bob Russell, Bob Yannes, and David A. Ziembicki. The design, prototypes, and some sample software were finished in time for the show, after the team had worked tirelessly over both Thanksgiving and Christmas weekends. The machine used the same case, same-sized motherboard, and same Commodore BASIC 2.0 in ROM as the VIC-20. BASIC also served as the user interface shell and was available immediately on startup at the codice_1 prompt. When the product was to be presented, the VIC-40 product was renamed C64. The C64 made an impressive debut at the January 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, as recalled by Production Engineer David A. Ziembicki: \"All we saw at our booth were Atari people with their mouths dropping open, saying, 'How can you do that for $595?'\" The answer was vertical integration; due to Commodore's ownership of MOS Technology's semiconductor fabrication facilities, each C64 had an estimated production cost of US$ (equivalent to $350 in 2022).\nReception.\nIn July 1983, \"BYTE\" magazine stated that \"the 64 retails for $. At that price it promises to be one of the hottest contenders in the under-$ personal computer market.\" It described the SID as \"a true music synthesizer\u00a0... the quality of the sound has to be heard to be believed\", while criticizing the use of Commodore BASIC\u00a02.0, the floppy disk performance which is \"even slower than the Atari 810 drive\", and Commodore's quality control. \"BYTE\" gave more details, saying the C64 had \"inadequate Commodore BASIC 2.0. An 8K-byte interpreted BASIC\" which they assumed was because \"Obviously, Commodore feels that most home users will be running prepackaged software \u2013 there is no provision for using graphics (or sound as mentioned above) from within a BASIC program except by means of POKE commands.\" This was one of very few warnings about C64 BASIC published in any computer magazines. \"Creative Computing\" said in December 1984 that the C64 was \"the overwhelming winner\" in the category of home computers under $. Despite criticizing its \"slow disk drive, only two cursor directional keys, zero manufacturer support, non-standard interfaces, etc.\", the magazine said that at the C64's price of less than $ \"you can't get another system with the same features: 64K, color, sprite graphics, and barrels of available software\". The Tandy Color Computer was the runner up. The Apple II was the winner in the category of home computer over $, which was the category the Commodore 64 was in when it was first released at the price of $.\nMarket war: 1982\u20131983.\nCommodore had a reputation for announcing products that never appeared, so the company sought to ship the C64 quickly. Production began in the spring of 1982, and volume shipments began in August. The C64 faced a wide range of competing home computers, but, with a lower price and more flexible hardware, it quickly outsold many of its competitors.\nIn the United States, the greatest competitors were the Atari 8-bit computers, the Apple II, and the TI-99/4A. The Atari 400 and 800 had been designed to accommodate previously stringent FCC emissions requirements and so were expensive to manufacture. Though similar in specifications, the C64 and Apple II represented differing design philosophies; as an open architecture system, upgrade capability for the Apple II was granted by internal expansion slots, whereas the C64's comparatively closed architecture had only a single external ROM cartridge port for bus expansion. However, the Apple II used its expansion slots for interfacing with common peripherals like disk drives, printers, and modems; the C64 had a variety of ports integrated into its motherboard, which were used for these purposes, usually leaving the cartridge port free. Commodore's was not a completely closed system, however; the company had published detailed specifications for most of their models since the Commodore PET and VIC-20 days, and the C64 was no exception. This was in contrast to the TI-99/4A, as Texas Instruments focused less on hobbyists and more towards unsophisticated users. C64 sales were relatively slow due to a lack of software, reliability issues with early production models, particularly high failure rates of the PLA chip, which used a new production process, and a shortage of 1541 disk drives, which also suffered rather severe reliability issues. During 1983, however, a trickle of software turned into a flood and sales began rapidly climbing.\nCommodore sold the C64 not only through its network of authorized dealers but also through department stores, discount stores, toy stores and college bookstores. The C64 had a built-in RF modulator and thus could be plugged into any television set. This allowed it (like its predecessor, the VIC-20) to compete directly against video game consoles such as the Atari 2600. Like the Apple IIe, the C64 could also output a composite video signal, avoiding the RF modulator altogether. This allowed the C64 to be plugged into a specialized monitor for a sharper picture. Unlike the IIe, the C64's NTSC output capability also included separate luminance/chroma signal output equivalent to (and electrically compatible with) S-Video, for connection to the Commodore 1702 monitor, providing even better video quality than a composite signal.\nAggressive pricing of the C64 is considered to have been a major catalyst in the video game crash of 1983. In January 1983, Commodore offered a $100 rebate in the United States on the purchase of a C64 to anyone that traded in another video game console or computer. To take advantage of this rebate, some mail-order dealers and retailers offered a Timex Sinclair 1000 (TS1000) for as little as $ with the purchase of a C64. This deal meant that the consumer could send the TS1000 to Commodore, collect the rebate, and pocket the difference; Timex Corporation departed the computer market within a year. Commodore's tactics soon led to a price war with the major home computer manufacturers. The success of the VIC-20 and C64 contributed significantly to Texas Instruments and other smaller competitors exiting the field.\nThe price war with Texas Instruments was seen as a personal battle for Commodore president Jack Tramiel. Commodore dropped the C64's list price by $ within two months of its release. In June 1983 the company lowered the price to $ (equivalent to $ in 2024), and some stores sold the computer for $. At one point, the company was selling as many C64s as all computers sold by the rest of the industry combined. Meanwhile, TI lost money by selling the TI-99/4A for $. TI's subsequent demise in the home computer industry in October 1983 was seen as revenge for TI's tactics in the electronic calculator market in the mid-1970s, when Commodore was almost bankrupted by TI.\nAll four machines had similar memory configurations which were standard in 1982\u201383: for the Apple II+ (upgraded within months of C64's release to with the Apple IIe) and for the Atari 800. At upwards of $, the Apple\u00a0II was about twice as expensive, while the Atari 800 cost $899. One key to the C64's success was Commodore's aggressive marketing tactics, and they were quick to exploit the relative price/performance divisions between its competitors with a series of television commercials after the C64's launch in late 1982. The company also published detailed documentation to help developers, while Atari initially kept technical information secret.\nAlthough many early C64 games were inferior Atari 8-bit ports, by late 1983, the growing installed base caused developers to create new software with better graphics and sound. Rumors spread in late 1983 that Commodore would discontinue the C64, but it was the only non-discontinued, widely available home computer in the US by then, with more than 500,000 sold during the Christmas season; because of production problems in Atari's supply chain, by the start of 1984 \"the Commodore 64 largely has [the low-end] market to itself right now\", \"The Washington Post\" reported.\n1984\u20131987.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Some of the graphics modes on the 64 are really strange, and they have no analogs to the Atari or Apple, like the ability to change color of the character basis across the screen. That gave us a lot of color capability that had not been exploited.\u2014\u200a\nWith sales booming and the early reliability issues with the hardware addressed, software for the C64 began to grow in size and ambition during 1984. This growth shifted to the primary focus of most US game developers. The two holdouts were Sierra, who largely skipped over the C64 in favor of Apple and PC-compatible machines, and Broderbund, who were heavily invested in educational software and developed primarily around the Apple II. In the North American market, the disk format had become nearly universal while cassette and cartridge-based software all but disappeared. Most US-developed games by this point grew large enough to require multi-loading from disk.\nAt a mid-1984 conference of game developers and experts at Origins Game Fair, Dan Bunten, Sid Meier, and a representative of Avalon Hill said that they were developing games for the C64 first as the most promising market. By 1985, games were an estimated 60 to 70% of Commodore 64 software. \"Computer Gaming World\" stated in January 1985 that companies such as Epyx that survived the video game crash did so because they \"jumped on the Commodore bandwagon early\". Over 35% of SSI's 1986 sales were for the C64, ten points higher than for the Apple\u00a0II. The C64 was even more important for other companies, which often found that more than half the sales for a title ported to six platforms came from the C64 version. That year, \"Computer Gaming World\" published a survey of ten game publishers that found that they planned to release forty-three Commodore 64 games that year, compared to nineteen for Atari and forty-eight for Apple\u00a0II, and Alan Miller stated that Accolade developed first for the C64 because \"it will sell the most on that system\".\nIn Europe, the primary competitors to the C64 were British-built computers: the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the BBC Micro, and the Amstrad CPC 464. In the UK, the 48K Spectrum had not only been released a few months ahead of the C64's early 1983 debut, but it was also selling for \u00a3175, less than half the C64's \u00a3399 price. The Spectrum quickly became the market leader and Commodore had an uphill struggle against it in the marketplace. The C64 did however go on to rival the Spectrum in popularity in the latter half of the 1980s. Adjusted to the population size, the popularity of Commodore\u00a064 was the highest in Finland at roughly 3 units per 100 inhabitants, where it was subsequently marketed as \"the Computer of the Republic\".\nBy early 1985 the C64's price was $; with an estimated production cost of , its profitability was still within the industry-standard markup of two to three times. Commodore sold about one million C64s in 1985 and a total of 3.5 million by mid-1986. Although the company reportedly attempted to discontinue the C64 more than once in favor of more expensive computers such as the Commodore 128, demand remained strong. In 1986, Commodore introduced the 64C, a redesigned 64, which \"Compute!\" saw as evidence that\u2014contrary to C64 owners' fears that the company would abandon them in favor of the Amiga and 128\u2014\"the 64 refuses to die\". Its introduction also meant that Commodore raised the price of the C64 for the first time, which the magazine cited as the end of the home-computer price war. Software sales also remained strong; MicroProse, for example, in 1987 cited the Commodore and IBM PC markets as its top priorities.\n1988\u20131994.\nBy 1988, PC compatibles were the largest and fastest-growing home and entertainment software markets, displacing former leader Commodore. Software sales for Apple II and Atari 8-bit decreased, but sales for the 64 remained strong, albeit almost unchanged in the third quarter of 1988 year over year, while the overall market grew 42% driven by PC games. Commodore was still selling 1 to 1.5 million 64 units worldwide each year of what \"Computer Chronicles\" that year called \"the Model T of personal computers\". Epyx CEO Dave Morse cautioned that \"there are no new 64 buyers, or very few. It's a consistent group that's not growing... it's going to shrink as part of our business.\" One computer gaming executive stated that the Nintendo Entertainment System's enormous popularity\u00a0\u2013 seven million sold in 1988, almost as many as the number of C64s sold in its first five years\u00a0\u2013 had stopped the C64's growth. Trip Hawkins reinforced that sentiment, stating that Nintendo was \"the last hurrah of the 8-bit world\".\nSSI exited the Commodore 64 market in 1991, after most competitors. \"Ultima VI\", released in 1991, was the last major C64 game release from a North American developer, and \"The Simpsons\", published by Ultra Games, was the last arcade conversion. The latter was a somewhat uncommon example of a US-developed arcade port as after the early years of the C64, most arcade conversions were produced by UK developers and converted to NTSC and disk format for the US market, American developers instead focusing on more computer-centered game genres such as RPGs and simulations. In the European market, disk software was rarer and cassettes were the most common distribution method; this led to a higher prevalence of arcade titles and smaller, lower-budget games that could fit entirely in the computer's memory without requiring multiloads. European programmers also tended to exploit advanced features of the C64's hardware more than their US counterparts.\nThe Commodore 64 Light Fantastic pack was released in time for the 1989 Christmas holiday season. The package included a C64C, a Cheetah Defender 64 Light gun and 3D-glasses. This pack included several games compatible with the light gun, including some developed purely for the packs release (Mindscape.) \nIn the United States, demand for 8-bit computers all but ceased as the 1990s began and PC compatibles completely dominated the computer market. However, the C64 continued to be popular in the UK and other European countries. The machine's eventual demise was not due to lack of demand or the cost of the C64 itself (still profitable at a retail price point between \u00a344 and \u00a350), but rather because of the cost of producing the disk drive. In March 1994, at CeBIT in Hanover, Germany, Commodore announced that the C64 would be finally discontinued in 1995, noting that the Commodore 1541 cost more than the C64 itself.\nHowever, only one month later in April 1994, the company filed for bankruptcy. When Commodore went bankrupt, all production on their inventory, including the C64, was discontinued, thus ending the C64's &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;11+1\u20442-year production. Claims of sales of 17, 22 and 30 million of C64 units sold worldwide have been made. Company sales records, however, indicate that the total number was about 12.5 million. Based on that figure, the Commodore 64 was still the third most popular computing platform into the 21st century until 2017 when the Raspberry Pi family replaced it.\nWhile 360,000 C64s were sold in 1982, about 1.3 million were sold in 1983, followed by a large spike in 1984 when 2.6 million were sold. After that, sales held steady at between 1.3 and 1.6 million a year for the remainder of the decade and then dropped off after 1989. North American sales peaked between 1983 and 1985 and gradually tapered off afterward, while European sales remained quite strong into the early 1990s. Commodore itself reported a robust sales figure of over 800,000 units during the 1991 fiscal year, but sales during the 1993 fiscal year had declined to fewer than 200,000 units. Throughout the early 1990s, European sales had accounted for more than 80% of Commodore's total sales revenue.\n2025\u2013present.\nOn July 5, 2025, YouTuber Christian Simpson of the channel Retro Recipes (later renamed to Retro Recipes x Commodore) released the video titled \"Can We Save The COMMODORE Brand? My Biggest Project Yet\", at the end of which he hinted at acquiring the entire holding company maintaining the original Commodore trademarks and branding (Commodore Corporation B.V.). On June 28, 2025 a follow up video was released which announced that an agreement had been reached and hinted at an upcoming hardware release. On July 12, 2025, the newly revived magazine \"Compute!'s Gazette\" in its first edition announced the re-release of the original Commodore 64, which coincided with a video announcement from Retro Recipes x Commodore, The Commodore 64 Ultimate is an FPGA based re-implementation of the original C64 hardware which retains compatibility with existing C64 peripherals and cartridges while offering expanded capabilities and modern connectivity. The system was created with community partners and their projects such as Gideon Zweijtzer (of Gideon's Logic) and a customized variant of the Ultimate64 Elite-II mainboard. The base model re-release features a breadbin styled case and keyboard with classic coloring, while other editions offer RGB lighting and transparent / semi-transparent cases. The original schedule called for units to be shipped in October or November of 2025.\nC64 family.\nCommodore MAX.\nIn 1982, Commodore released the MAX Machine in Japan. It was called the Ultimax in the United States and VC-10 in Germany. The MAX was intended to be a game console with limited computing capability and was based on a cut-down version of the hardware family later used in the C64. The MAX was discontinued months after its introduction because of poor sales in Japan.\nCommodore Educator 64.\n1983 saw Commodore attempt to compete with the Apple II's hold on the US education market with the Educator 64, essentially a C64 and \"green\" monochrome monitor in a PET case. Schools preferred the all-in-one metal construction of the PET over the standard C64's separate components, which could be easily damaged, vandalized, or stolen. Schools did not prefer the Educator 64 to the wide range of software and hardware options the Apple\u00a0IIe was able to offer, and it was produced in limited quantities.\nSX-64.\nAlso in 1983, Commodore released the SX-64, a portable version of the C64. The SX-64 has the distinction of being the first commercial \"full-color\" portable computer. While earlier computers using this form factor only incorporate monochrome (\"green screen\") displays, the base SX-64 unit features a color cathode-ray tube (CRT) and one integrated 1541 floppy disk drive. Even though Commodore claimed in advertisements that it would have dual 1541 drives, when the SX-64 was released there was only one and the other became a floppy disk storage slot. Also, unlike most other C64s, the SX-64 does not have a datasette connector so an external cassette was not an option.\nCommodore 128.\nTwo designers at Commodore, Fred Bowen and Bil Herd, were determined to rectify the problems of the Plus/4. They intended that the eventual successors to the C64\u2014the Commodore 128 and 128D computers (1985)\u2014were to build upon the C64, avoiding the Plus/4's flaws. The successors had many improvements such as a BASIC with graphics and sound commands (like almost all home computers not made by Commodore), 80-column display ability, and full CP/M compatibility. The decision to make the Commodore 128 plug compatible with the C64 was made quietly by Bowen and Herd, software and hardware designers respectively, without the knowledge or approval by the management in the post Jack Tramiel era. The designers were careful not to reveal their decision until the project was too far along to be challenged or changed and still make the impending Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Upon learning that the C128 was designed to be compatible with the C64, Commodore's marketing department independently announced that the C128 would be 100% compatible with the C64, thereby raising the bar for C64 support. In a case of malicious compliance, the 128 design was altered to include a separate \"64 mode\" using a complete C64 environment to try to ensure total compatibility.\nCommodore 64C.\nThe C64's designers intended the computer to have a new, wedge-shaped case within a year of release, but the change did not occur. In 1986, Commodore released the 64C computer, which is functionally identical to the original, which was nicknamed the Breadbin 64 after the release of the 64C. The exterior design was remodeled in the sleeker style of the Commodore 128. The 64C uses new versions of the SID, VIC-II, and I/O chips being deployed. Models with the C64E board had the graphic symbols printed on the top of the keys, instead of the normal location on the front. The sound chip (SID) was changed to use the MOS 8580 chip, with the core voltage reduced from 12V to 9V. The most significant changes include different behavior in the filters and in the volume control, which result in some music/sound effects sounding differently than intended, and in digitally sampled audio being almost inaudible, respectively (though both of these can mostly be corrected-for in software). The 64\u00a0KB RAM memory went from eight chips to two chips. BASIC and the KERNAL went from two separate chips into one 16\u00a0KB ROM chip. The PLA chip and some TTL chips were integrated into a DIL 64-pin chip. The \"252535-01\" PLA integrated the color RAM as well into the same chip. The smaller physical space made it impossible to put in some internal expansions like a floppy-speeder. In the United States, the 64C was often bundled with the third-party GEOS graphical user interface (GUI)-based operating system, as well as the software needed to access Quantum Link. The 1541 drive received a matching face-lift, resulting in the 1541C. Later, a smaller, sleeker 1541-II model was introduced, along with the 800 KB 3.5-inch microfloppy 1581.\nCommodore 64 Games System.\nIn 1990, the C64 was repackaged in the form of a game console, called the C64 Games System (C64GS), with most external connectivity removed. A simple modification to the 64C's motherboard was made to allow cartridges to be inserted from above. A modified ROM replaced the BASIC interpreter with a boot screen to inform the user to insert a cartridge. Designed to compete with the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega's Master System, it suffered from very low sales compared to its rivals. It was another commercial failure for Commodore, and it was never released outside Europe. The Commodore game system lacked a keyboard, so any software that required a keyboard could not be used.\nCommodore 65.\nIn 1990, an advanced successor to the C64, the Commodore 65 (also known as the \"C64DX\"), was prototyped, but the project was canceled by Commodore's chairman Irving Gould in 1991. The C65's specifications were impressive for an 8-bit computer, bringing specs comparable to the 16-bit Apple\u00a0IIGS. For example, it could display 256 colors on the screen, while OCS based Amigas could only display 64 in HalfBrite mode (32 colors and half-bright transformations). Although no specific reason was given for the C65's cancellation, it would have competed in the marketplace with Commodore's lower-end Amigas and the Commodore CDTV.\nSoftware.\nIn 1982, the C64's graphics and sound capabilities were rivaled only by the Atari 8-bit computers and appeared exceptional when compared with the popular Apple II. The C64 is often credited with starting the demoscene subculture (see Commodore 64 demos). It is still being actively used in the demoscene, especially for music (its SID sound chip even being used in special sound cards for PCs, and the Elektron SidStation synthesizer). Even though other computers quickly caught up with it, the C64 remained a strong competitor to the later video game consoles Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Master System, thanks in part to its by-then established software base.\nBecause of lower incomes and the domination of the ZX Spectrum in the UK, almost all British C64 software used cassette tapes. Few cassette C64 programs were released in the US after 1983 and, in North America, the diskette was the principal method of software distribution. The cartridge slot on the C64 was also mainly a feature used in the computer's first two years on the US market and became rapidly obsolete once the price and reliability of 1541 drives improved. A handful of PAL region games used bank switched cartridges to get around the 16\u00a0KB memory limit.\nBASIC.\nAs is common for home computers of the early 1980s, the C64 comes with a BASIC interpreter, in ROM. KERNAL, I/O, and tape/disk drive operations are accessed via custom BASIC language commands. The disk drive has its own interfacing microprocessor and ROM (firmware) I/O routines, much like the earlier CBM/PET systems and the Atari 400 and Atari 800. This means that no memory space is dedicated to running a disk operating system, as was the case with earlier systems such as the Apple\u00a0II and TRS-80.\nCommodore BASIC 2.0 is used instead of the more advanced BASIC\u00a04.0 from the PET series, since C64 users were not expected to need the disk-oriented enhancements of BASIC\u00a04.0. The company did not expect many to buy a disk drive, and using BASIC\u00a02.0 simplified VIC-20 owners' transition to the 64. \"The choice of BASIC\u00a02.0 instead of 4.0 was made with some soul-searching, not just at random. The typical user of a C64 is not expected to need the direct disk commands as much as other extensions, and the amount of memory to be committed to BASIC were to be limited. We chose to leave expansion space for color and sound extensions instead of the disk features. As a result, you will have to handle the disk in the more cumbersome manner of the 'old days'.\"\nThe version of Microsoft BASIC is not very comprehensive and does not include specific commands for sound or graphics manipulation, instead requiring users to use the \"PEEK and POKE\" commands to access the graphics and sound chip registers directly. To provide extended commands, including graphics and sound, Commodore produced two different cartridge-based extensions to BASIC\u00a02.0: Simons' BASIC and Super Expander 64. Other languages available for the C64 include Pascal, C, Logo, Forth, and FORTRAN. Compilers for BASIC\u00a02.0 such as Petspeed\u00a02 (from Commodore), Blitz (from Jason Ranheim), and Turbo Lightning (from Ocean Software) were produced. Most commercial C64 software was written in assembly language, either cross-developed on a larger computer, or directly on the C64 using a machine code monitor or an assembler. This maximized speed and minimized memory use. Some games, particularly adventures, used high-level scripting languages and sometimes mixed BASIC and machine language.\nAlternative operating systems.\nMany third-party operating systems have been developed for the C64. As well as the original GEOS, two third-party GEOS-compatible systems have been written: Wheels and GEOS megapatch. Both of these require hardware upgrades to the original C64. Several other operating systems are or have been available, including WiNGS OS, the Unix-like LUnix, operated from a command-line, and the embedded systems OS Contiki, with full GUI. Other less well-known OSes include ACE, Asterix, DOS/65, and GeckOS. C64 OS, albeit not a full operating system, is commercially available today and remains under active development. It features a full GUI in character mode, and many other modern features. A version of CP/M was released, but this requires the addition of an external Z80 processor to the expansion bus. Furthermore, the Z80 processor is underclocked to be compatible with the C64's memory bus, so performance is poor compared to other CP/M implementations. C64 CP/M and C128 CP/M both suffer a lack of software; although most commercial CP/M software can run on these systems, software media is incompatible between platforms. The low usage of CP/M on Commodores means that software houses saw no need to invest in mastering versions for the Commodore disk format. The C64 CP/M cartridge is also not compatible with anything except the early 326298 motherboards.\nNetworking software.\nDuring the 1980s, the Commodore 64 was used to run bulletin board systems using software packages such as Punter BBS, Bizarre 64, Blue Board, C-Net, Color 64, CMBBS, C-Base, DMBBS, Image BBS, EBBS, and The Deadlock Deluxe BBS Construction Kit, often with sysop-made modifications. These boards sometimes were used to distribute cracked software. As late as December 2013, there were 25 such Bulletin Board Systems in operation, reachable via the Telnet protocol. There were major commercial online services, such as Compunet (UK), CompuServe (US\u00a0\u2013 later bought by America Online), The Source (US), and Minitel (France) among many others. These services usually required custom software which was often bundled with a modem and included free online time as they were billed by the minute. Quantum Link (or Q-Link) was a US and Canadian online service for Commodore 64 and 128 personal computers that operated from November 5, 1985, to November 1, 1994. It was operated by Quantum Computer Services of Vienna, Virginia, which in October 1991 changed its name to America Online and continued to operate its AOL service for the IBM PC compatible and Apple Macintosh. Q-Link was a modified version of the PlayNET system, which Control Video Corporation (CVC, later renamed Quantum Computer Services) licensed.\nOnline gaming.\nThe first graphical character-based interactive environment is \"Club Caribe\". First released as \"Habitat\" in 1988, \"Club Caribe\" was introduced by LucasArts for Q-Link customers on their Commodore 64 computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items. Although the game's open world was very basic, its use of online avatars and the combination of chat and graphics was revolutionary. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted by the need to support modem data transfer rates as low as 300 bits per second. Habitat's graphics were stored locally on floppy disk, eliminating the need for network transfer.\nHardware.\nCPU and memory.\nThe C64 uses an 8-bit MOS Technology 6510 microprocessor that is almost identical to the 6502 but has three-state buses, a different pinout, slightly different clock signals and other minor changes for this application. It also has six I/O lines on otherwise-unused legs on the 40-pin IC package. These are used for two purposes in the C64: to bank-switch the machine's read-only memory (ROM) in and out of the processor's address space, and to operate the datasette tape recorder. The C64 has of 8-bit-wide dynamic RAM, of 4-bit-wide static color RAM for text mode, and are available to built-in Commodore BASIC 2.0 on startup. There is of ROM, made up of the BASIC interpreter, the KERNAL, and the character ROM. Because the processor can only address at a time, the ROM was mapped into memory and only of RAM (plus between the ROMs) were available at startup. Most \"breadbin\" Commodore 64s used 4164 DRAM with eight chips totaling 64K of system RAM. Later models, featuring Assy 250466 and Assy 250469 motherboards, used 41464 DRAM (64K\u00d74) chips which stored per chip (so only two were required). Because 4164 DRAMs are 64K\u00d71, eight chips are needed to make an entire byte; the computer will not function without all of them present. The first chip contains Bit 0 for the memory space, the second chip contains Bit 1, and so forth.\nThe C64 performs a RAM test on power-up and if a RAM error is detected, the amount of free BASIC memory will be lower than the normal 38,911. If the faulty chip is in lower memory, then an codice_2 error is displayed rather than the usual BASIC startup banner.\nThe C64 uses a complicated memory-banking scheme; the normal power-on default is the BASIC ROM mapped in at $A000-$BFFF, and the screen editor (KERNAL) ROM at $E000\u2013$FFFF. RAM under the system ROMs can be written to, but not read back, without swapping out the ROMs. Memory location $01 contains a register with control bits for enabling or disabling the system ROMs and the I/O area at $D000. If the KERNAL\u00a0ROM is swapped out, BASIC will be removed at the same time.264 BASIC is not active without the KERNAL; BASIC often calls KERNAL routines, and part of the ROM code for BASIC is in the KERNAL ROM.\nThe character ROM is normally invisible to the CPU. The character ROM may be mapped into $D000\u2013$DFFF, where it is then visible to the CPU. Because doing so necessitates swapping out the I/O registers, interrupts must first be disabled. By removing I/O from the memory map, $D000\u2013$DFFF becomes free RAM.\nC64 cartridges map into assigned ranges in the CPU's address space. The most common cartridge auto-starting requires a string at $8000 which contains \"CBM80\" followed by the address where program execution begins. A few C64 cartridges released in 1982 use Ultimax mode (or MAX mode), a leftover feature of the unsuccessful MAX Machine. These cartridges map into $F000 and displace the KERNAL\u00a0ROM. If Ultimax mode is used, the programmer will have to provide code for handling system interrupts. The cartridge port has 16 address lines, which grants access to the computer's entire address space if needed. Disk and tape software normally load at the start of BASIC memory ($0801), and use a small BASIC stub (such as codice_3) to jump to the start of the program. Although no Commodore 8-bit machine except the C128 can automatically boot from a floppy disk, some software intentionally overwrites certain BASIC vectors in the process of loading so execution begins automatically (instead of requiring the user to type RUN at the BASIC prompt after loading).\nAbout 300 cartridges were released for the C64, primarily during the machine's first &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 years on the market, after which most software outgrew the cartridge limit. One notable third-party expansion was the Power Cartridge, developed by Dutch company Kolff Computer Supplies (KCS). It provided a BASIC extension toolkit, a machine code monitor, a reset button, and fastload routines that accelerated cassette and disk access (up to 10\u00d7 and 6\u00d7 respectively). Popular in the Benelux region, it was used for both productivity and programming purposes.\nLarger software companies, such as Ocean Software, began releasing games on bank-switched cartridges to overcome the cartridge limit during the C64's final years.\nCommodore did not include a reset button on its computers until the CBM-II line, but third-party cartridges had a reset button. A soft reset can be triggered by jumping to the CPU reset routine at $FCE2 (64738). A few programs use this as an exit feature, although it does not clear memory.\nThe KERNAL\u00a0ROM underwent three revisions, mainly designed to fix bugs. The initial version is only found on 326298 motherboards (used in the first production models), and cannot detect whether an NTSC or PAL VIC-II is present. The second revision is found on all C64s made from late 1982 through 1985. The final KERNAL\u00a0ROM revision was introduced on the 250466 motherboard (late breadbin models with 41464 RAM), and is found in all C64Cs. The 6510 CPU is clocked at (NTSC) and (PAL), lower than some competing systems; the Atari 800, for example, is clocked at ). Performance can be boosted slightly by disabling the VIC-II's video output via a register write. This feature is often used by tape and disk fast loaders and the KERNAL cassette routine to keep a standard CPU cycle timing not modified by the VIC-II's sharing of the bus.\nThe restore key is gated directly to the CPU's NMI line, and will generate an NMI if pressed. The KERNAL handler for the NMI checks if run/stop is also pressed; if not, it ignores the NMI and exits. Run/stop-restore is normally a soft reset in BASIC which restores all I/O registers to their power-on default state, but does not clear memory or reset pointers; any BASIC programs in memory will be left untouched. Machine-language software usually disables run/stop-restore by remapping the NMI vector to a dummy RTI instruction. The NMI can also be used for an extra interrupt thread by programs, but risks a system lockup or other undesirable side effects if the restore key is accidentally pressed (which activates the NMI thread).\nJoysticks, mice, and paddles.\nThe C64 retained the VIC-20's DE-9 Atari joystick port and added another; any Atari-specification game controller can be used on a C64. The joysticks are read from the registers at $DC00 and $DC01, and most software is designed to use a joystick in port 2 for control rather than port 1; the upper bits of $DC00 are used by the keyboard, and an I/O conflict can result. Although it is possible to use Sega gamepads on a C64, it is not recommended; their slightly different signal can damage the CIA chip. The SID chip's register $D419, used to control paddles, is an analog input. A handful of games, primarily released early in the computer's life cycle, can use paddles. In 1986, Commodore released two mice for the C64 and C128: the 1350 and 1351. The 1350 is a digital device read from the joystick registers, and can be used with any program supporting joystick input. The 1351 is an analog potentiometer-based mouse, read with the SID's analog-to-digital converter.\nGraphics.\nThe VIC-II graphics chip features a new palette, eight hardware sprites per scanline (enabling up to 112 sprites per PAL screen), scrolling capabilities, and two bitmap graphics modes.\nText modes.\nThe standard text mode features 40 columns, like most Commodore PET models; the built-in character encoding is not standard ASCII but PETSCII, an extended form of ASCII-1963. The KERNAL\u00a0ROM sets the VIC-II to a dark-blue background on power-up, with a light-blue border and text. Unlike the PET and VIC-20, the C64 uses double-width text; some early VIC-IIs had poor video quality which resulted in a fuzzy picture. Most screenshots show borders around the screen, a feature of the VIC-II chip. By utilizing interrupts to reset hardware registers with precise timing, it was possible to place graphics within the borders and use the full screen.\nThe C64 has a resolution of 320\u00d7200 pixels, consisting of a 40\u00d725 grid of 8\u00d78 character blocks. It has 255 predefined character blocks, known as PETSCII. The character set can be copied into RAM and modified by a programmer.\nThere are three color modes: \"high resolution\", with two colors available per character block (one foreground and one background), \"multicolor\" (four colors per character block\u00a0\u2013 three foreground and one background), and \"extended color\" (each individual character on the text screen may have one of four different background colors; the trade-off is that the character set is limited to the first 64 characters in the character set). In multicolor mode, attributes are shared between pixel pairs so the effective visible resolution is 160\u00d7200 pixels; only 16\u00a0KB of memory is available for the VIC-II video processor.\nSince the C64 has a bitmapped screen, it is possible (but slow) to draw each pixel individually. Most programmers used techniques developed for earlier, non-bitmapped systems like the Commodore PET and TRS-80. A programmer redraws the character set, and the video processor fills the screen block by block from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. Two types of animation are used: character block animation and hardware sprites.\nCharacter block animation.\nThe user draws a series of characters of a person walking, possibly two in the middle of the block and another two walking in and out of the block. Then the user sequences them so the character walks into the block and out again. Drawing a series of these gets a person walking across the screen. By timing the redraw to occur when the television screen blanks out to restart drawing the screen, there will be no flicker. For this to happen, a user programs the VIC-II that it generates a raster interrupt when video flyback occurs. This technique is used in the \"Space Invaders\" arcade game.\nHorizontal and vertical pixel scrolling of up to one character block is supported by two hardware scroll registers. Depending on timing, hardware scrolling affects the entire screen or selected lines of character blocks. On a non-emulated C64, scrolling is glass-like and blur-free.\nHardware sprites.\nA sprite is a character which moves over an area of the screen, draws over the background, and redraws it after it moves. This differs from character block animation, where the user flips character blocks. On the C64, the VIC-II video controller handles most sprite emulation; the programmer defines the sprite and where it goes.\nThe C64 has two types of sprites, respecting their color-mode limitations. Hi-res sprites have one color (one background and one foreground), and multi-color sprites have three (one background and three foreground). Color modes can be split or windowed on a single screen. Sprites can be doubled in size vertically and horizontally up to four times their size, but the pixel attributes are the same \u2013 the pixels become \"fatter\". There are eight sprites, and all eight can be shown in each horizontal line concurrently. Sprites can move with glassy smoothness in front of, and behind, screen characters and other sprites.\nThe hardware sprites of a C64 can be displayed on a bitmapped (high-resolution) screen or a text-mode screen in conjunction with fast and smooth character block animation. Software-emulated sprites on systems without support for hardware sprites, such as the Apple II and ZX Spectrum, required a bitmapped screen. Sprite-sprite and sprite-background collisions are detected in hardware, and the VIC-II can be programmed to trigger an interrupt accordingly.\nSound.\nThe SID chip has three channels, each with its own ADSR envelope generator and filter capabilities. Ring modulation makes use of channel three to work with the other two channels. Bob Yannes developed the SID chip and, later, co-founded the synthesizer company Ensoniq. Composers and programmers of game music on the C64 include Rob Hubbard, Jeroen Tel, Tim Follin, David Whittaker, Chris H\u00fclsbeck, Ben Daglish, Martin Galway, Kjell Nordb\u00f8 and David Dunn. Due to the chip's three channels, chords are often played as arpeggios. It was also possible to continuously update the master volume with sampled data to enable the playback of 4-bit digitized audio. By 2008, it was possible to play four-channel 8-bit audio samples and two SID channels and still use filtering.\nThere are two versions of the SID chip: the 6581 and the 8580. The MOS Technology 6581 was used in the original (\"breadbin\") C64s, the early versions of the 64C, and the Commodore 128. The 6581 was replaced with the MOS Technology 8580 in 1987. Although the 6581 sound quality is a little crisper, it lacks the 8580's versatility; the 8580 can mix all available waveforms on each channel, but the 6581 can only mix waveforms in a channel in a limited fashion. The main difference between the 6581 and the 8580 is the supply voltage; the 6581 requires 12 volts, and the 8580 9 volts. A modification can be made to use the 6581 in a newer 64C board (which uses the 9-volt chip).\nIn 1986, the Sound Expander was released for the Commodore 64. It was a sound module with a Yamaha YM3526 chip capable of FM synthesis, primarily intended for professional music production.\nRevisions.\nCommodore made many changes to the C64's hardware, sometimes introducing compatibility issues. The computer's rapid development and Commodore and Jack Tramiel's focus on cost-cutting instead of product testing resulted in several defects which caused developers like Epyx to complain and required many revisions; Charpentier said that \"not coming a little close to quality\" was one of the company's mistakes.\nCost reduction was the reason for most of the revisions. Reducing manufacturing costs was vitally important to Commodore's survival during the price war and lean years of the 16-bit era. The C64's original (NMOS-based) motherboard went through two major redesigns and a number of revisions, exchanging positions of the VIC-II, SID and PLA chips. Much of the cost was initially eliminated by reducing the number of discrete components, such as diodes and resistors, which enabled a smaller printed circuit board. There were 16 C64 motherboard revisions to simplify production and reduce manufacturing costs. Some board revisions were exclusive to PAL regions. All C64 motherboards were manufactured in Hong Kong.\nIC locations changed frequently with each motherboard revision, as did the presence (or lack) of the metal RF shield around the VIC-II; PAL boards often had aluminized cardboard instead of a metal shield. The SID and VIC-II are socketed on all boards, but the other ICs may be socketed or soldered. The first production C64s, made from 1982 to early 1983, are known as \"silver label\" models due to the case having a silver-colored \"Commodore\" logo. The power LED had a silver badge reading \"64\" around it. These machines have only a five-pin video cable, and cannot produce S-Video. Commodore introduced the familiar \"rainbow badge\" case in late 1982, but many machines produced into early 1983 also used silver-label cases until the existing stock was used up. The original 326298 board was replaced in spring 1983 by the 250407 motherboard, which had an eight-pin video connector and added S-Video support. This case design was used until the C64C appeared in 1986. All ICs switched to plastic shells, but the silver-label C64s (notably the VIC-II) had some ceramic ICs. The case is made from ABS plastic, which may become brown with time; this can be reversed with retrobright.\nICs.\nThe VIC-II was manufactured with 5-micrometer NMOS technology, and was clocked at 17.73447 MHz (PAL) or 14.31818 MHz (NTSC). Internally, the clock was divided to generate the dot clock (about 8\u00a0MHz) and the two-phase system clocks (about 1\u00a0MHz; the pixel and system clock speeds differ slightly on NTSC and PAL machines). At such high clock rates the chip generated considerable heat, forcing MOS Technology to use a ceramic dual in-line package known as a CERDIP. The ceramic package was more expensive, but dissipated heat more effectively than plastic.\nAfter a redesign in 1983, the VIC-II was encased in a plastic dual in-line package; this reduced costs substantially, but did not eliminate the heat problem. Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required a heat sink. To avoid extra cost, the metal RF shielding doubled as the VIC's heat sink; not all units shipped with this type of shielding, however. Most C64s in Europe shipped with a cardboard RF shield coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was questionable; it acted instead as an insulator, blocking airflow and trapping heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips. The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 micrometers and, in some areas, 6 micrometers. The prototype SID and some early production models had a ceramic dual in-line package, but (unlike the VIC-II) are very rare; the SID was encased in plastic when production began in early 1982.\nMotherboard.\nIn 1986, Commodore released the last revision of the classic C64 motherboard. It was otherwise identical to the 1984 design, except for two 64-kilobit \u00d7 4-bit DRAM chips which replaced the original eight 64-kilobit \u00d7 1-bit ICs. After the release of the Commodore 64C, MOS Technology began to reconfigure the original C64's chipset to use HMOS technology. The main benefit of HMOS was that it required less voltage to drive the IC, generating less heat. This enhanced the reliability of the SID and VIC-II. The new chipset was renumbered 85xx to reflect the change to HMOS.\nIn 1987, Commodore released a 64C variant with a redesigned motherboard known as a \"short board\". The new board used the HMOS chipset, with a new 64-pin PLA chip. The \"SuperPLA\", as it was called, integrated discrete components and transistor\u2013transistor logic (TTL) chips. In the last revision of the 64C motherboard, the 2114 4-bit-wide color RAM was integrated into the SuperPLA.\nPower supply.\nThe C64 used an external power supply, a linear transformer with multiple taps differing from switch mode (presently used on PC power supplies). It was encased in epoxy resin gel, which discouraged tampering but increased the heat level during use. The design saved space in the computer's case, and allowed international versions to be more easily manufactured. The 1541-II and 1581 disk drives and third-party clones also have external power-supply \"bricks\", like most peripherals.\nCommodore power supplies often failed sooner than expected. The computer reportedly had a 30-percent return rate in late 1983, compared to the 5\u20137 percent rate considered acceptable by the industry; \"Creative Computing\" reported four working C64s, out of seven. Malfunctioning power bricks were notorious for damaging the RAM chips. Due to their higher density and single supply (+5V), they had less tolerance for over-voltage. The usually-failing voltage regulator could be replaced by piggybacking a new regulator on the board and fitting a heat sink on top.\nThe original PSU on early-1982 and 1983 machines had a 5-pin connector which could accidentally be plugged into the computer's video output. Commodore later changed the design, omitting the resin gel to reduce costs. The following model, the Commodore 128, used a larger, improved power supply which included a fuse. The power supply for the Commodore REU was similar to that of the Commodore 128, providing an upgrade for customers purchasing the accessory.\nSpecifications.\nInternal hardware.\nCreative Micro Designs also produced a 2\u00a0MB REU for the C64 and C128, called the 1750\u00a0XL. The technology actually supported up to 16\u00a0MB, but 2\u00a0MB was the biggest one officially made. Expansions of up to 16\u00a0MB were also possible via the CMD SuperCPU.\nInput/output (I/O) ports and power supply.\nThe 9 volt AC is used to supply power via a charge pump to the SID sound generator chip, provide 6.8 V via a rectifier to the cassette motor, a \"0\" pulse for every positive half wave to the time-of-day (TOD) input on the CIA chips, and 9 volts AC directly to the user-port. Thus, as a minimum, a 12 V square wave is required. But a 9 V sine wave is preferred.\nMemory map.\nNote that even if an I/O chip like the VIC-II only uses 64 positions in the memory address space, it will occupy 1,024 addresses because some address bits are left undecoded.\nManufacturing cost.\nVertical integration was the key to keeping Commodore 64 production costs low. At the introduction in 1982, the production cost was US$135 and the retail price US$595. In 1985, the retail price went down to US$149 (US$ today) and the production costs were believed to be somewhere between US$35\u201350 ( Commodore would not confirm this cost figure. Dougherty of the Berkeley Softworks estimated the costs of the Commodore 64 parts based on his experience at Mattel and Imagic.\nTo lower costs, TTL chips were replaced with less expensive custom chips and ways to increase the yields on the sound and graphics chips were found. The video chip 6567 had the ceramic package replaced with plastic but heat dissipation demanded a redesign of the chip and the development of a plastic package that can dissipate heat as well as ceramic.\nCompatible hardware.\nC64 enthusiasts were developing new hardware in 2008, including Ethernet cards, specially adapted hard disks and flash card interfaces (sd2iec). A-SID, which gives the C-64 a wah-wah effect, was introduced in 2022.\nClones and other reuse of the Commodore 64 name.\nClones.\nC64 clones are computers which imitate Commodore 64 functions. In mid-2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer Tulip Computers (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the C64 Direct-to-TV (C64DTV): a joystick-based TV game based on the C64, with 30 games in its ROM. Designed by Jeri Ellsworth, a self-taught computer designer who had designed the C-One C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar to other mini-consoles based on the modestly-successful Atari 2600 and Intellivision. The C64DTV was advertised on QVC in the United States for the 2004 holiday season.\nIn 2015, a Commodore 64-compatible motherboard was produced by Individual Computers. Called the C64 Reloaded, it is a redesign of Commodore 64 motherboard revision 250466 with several new features. The motherboard is designed to be placed in an existing, empty C64 or C64C case. Produced in limited quantities, models of this Commodore 64 clone have machined or ZIF sockets in which custom C64 chips are placed. The board contains jumpers to accept revisions of the VIC-II and SID chips and the ability to switch between the PAL and NTSC video systems. It has several innovations, including selection (via the restore key) of KERNAL and character ROMs, built-in reset toggle on the power switch, and an S-Video socket to replace the original TV modulator. The motherboard is powered by a DC-to-DC converter which uses 12 V DC from a mains adapter, rather than the original (and failure-prone) Commodore 64 power-supply brick.\nWeb.it Internet computer.\nThe C64 brand was reused in 1998 for the Web.it Internet Computer, a low-powered, Internet-oriented, all-in-one x86 PC running MS-DOS and Windows 3.1. It uses an AMD \u00c9lan SC400 SoC with 16\u00a0MB of RAM, a 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, 56k modem and PC Card. Despite its Commodore 64 nameplate, the C64 Web.it looks different and is only directly compatible with the original via included emulation software. PC clones branded C64x sold by Commodore USA, a company licensing the Commodore trademark, began shipping in June 2011. The C64x's case resembles the original C64 computer, but \u2013 like the Web.it \u2013 it is based on x86 architecture and is not compatible with the Commodore 64.\nVirtual Console.\nSeveral Commodore 64 games were released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and North America. They were delisted from the service in August 2013.\nTHEC64 and THEC64 Mini.\nBritish company Retro Games released two unofficial Linux-based emulation consoles based on the Commodore 64: THEC64 Mini in 2018 and the full size THEC64 in 2019. The name THEC64 \u2013 without a space between \"The\" and \"C64\" \u2013 is due to Retro Games not licensing the use of any Commodore trademarks including the C64 name; another consequence of this is that the Commodore key from the original keyboard is replaced with a THEC64 key.\nTHEC64 Mini is a decorative, half-size Commodore 64 with two USB and one HDMI port, and a mini USB connection to power the system. The keyboard is non-functional; the system is controlled by an included THEC64 joystick or a separate USB keyboard. The console uses the VICE emulator which can also load additional software ROMs.\nThe full-size THEC64 is the same size as the original Commodore 64, with a functional keyboard. Enhancements include VIC-20 emulation, two additional USB ports, and an upgraded joystick.\nEmulators.\nCommodore 64 emulators include the open source VICE, Hoxs64, and CCS64. An iPhone app was also released with a compilation of C64 ports.\nThe \"Commodore PET\", introduced in July 2015, was an Android smartphone with Commodore 64 and Amiga emulation built-in.\nFootnotes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Combining science, aesthetics and technique, cartography builds on the premise that reality (or an imagined reality) can be modeled in ways that communicate spatial information effectively.\nThe fundamental objectives of traditional cartography are to:\nModern cartography constitutes many theoretical and practical foundations of geographic information systems (GIS) and geographic information science (GISc).\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nWhat is the earliest known map is a matter of some debate, both because the term \"map\" is not well-defined and because some artifacts that might be maps might actually be something else. A wall painting that might depict the ancient Anatolian city of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck (previously known as Catal Huyuk or \u00c7atal H\u00fcy\u00fck) has been dated to the late 7th millennium BCE. Among the prehistoric alpine rock carvings of Mount Bego (France) and Valcamonica (Italy), dated to the 4th millennium BCE, geometric patterns consisting of dotted rectangles and lines are widely interpreted in archaeological literature as depicting cultivated plots. Other known maps of the ancient world include the Minoan \"House of the Admiral\" wall painting from c.\u20091600 BCE, showing a seaside community in an oblique perspective, and an engraved map of the holy Babylonian city of Nippur, from the Kassite period (14th\u00a0\u2013 12th centuries BCE). The oldest surviving world maps are from 9th century BCE Babylonia. One shows Babylon on the Euphrates, surrounded by Assyria, Urartu and several cities, all, in turn, surrounded by a \"bitter river\" (Oceanus). Another depicts Babylon as being north of the center of the world.\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans created maps from the time of Anaximander in the 6th century BCE. In the 2nd century CE, Ptolemy wrote his treatise on cartography, Geographia. This contained Ptolemy's world map \u2013 the world then known to Western society (\"Ecumene\"). As early as the 8th century, Arab scholars were translating the works of the Greek geographers into Arabic. Roads were essential in the Roman world, motivating the creation of maps, called \"itinerarium\", that portrayed the world as experienced via the roads. The is the only surviving example.\nIn ancient China, geographical literature dates to the 5th century BCE. The oldest extant Chinese maps come from the State of Qin, dated back to the 4th century BCE, during the Warring States period. In the book \"Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao\", published in 1092 by the Chinese scientist Su Song, a star map on the equidistant cylindrical projection. Although this method of charting seems to have existed in China even before this publication and scientist, the greatest significance of the star maps by Su Song is that they represent the oldest existent star maps in printed form.\nEarly forms of cartography of India included depictions of the pole star and surrounding constellations. These charts may have been used for navigation.\nMiddle Ages and Renaissance.\n ('maps of the world') are the medieval European maps of the world. About 1,100 of these are known to have survived: of these, some 900 are found illustrating manuscripts, and the remainder exist as stand-alone documents.\nThe Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi produced his medieval atlas \"Tabula Rogeriana (Book of Roger)\" in 1154. By combining the knowledge of Africa, the Indian Ocean, Europe, and the Far East (which he learned through contemporary accounts from Arab merchants and explorers) with the information he inherited from the classical geographers, he was able to write detailed descriptions of a multitude of countries. Along with the substantial text he had written, he created a world map influenced mostly by the Ptolemaic conception of the world, but with significant influence from multiple Arab geographers. It remained the most accurate world map for the next three centuries. The map was divided into seven climatic zones, with detailed descriptions of each zone. As part of this work, a smaller, circular map depicting the south on top and Arabia in the center was made. Al-Idrisi also made an estimate of the circumference of the world, accurate to within 10%.\nIn the Age of Discovery, from the 15th century to the 17th century, European cartographers both copied earlier maps (some of which had been passed down for centuries) and drew their own based on explorers' observations and new surveying techniques. The invention of the magnetic compass, telescope and sextant enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, Martin Behaim, a German cartographer and advisor to the king John II of Portugal, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.\nIn 1507, Martin Waldseem\u00fcller produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (\"Universalis Cosmographia\") bearing the first use of the name \"America.\" Portuguese cartographer Diogo Ribero was the author of the first known planisphere with a graduated Equator (1527). Italian cartographer Battista Agnese produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts. Johannes Werner refined and promoted the Werner projection. This was an equal-area, heart-shaped world map projection (generally called a cordiform projection) that was used in the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the sinusoidal projection and the Bonne projection. The Werner projection places its standard parallel at the North Pole; a sinusoidal projection places its standard parallel at the equator; and the Bonne projection is intermediate between the two.\nIn 1569, mapmaker Gerardus Mercator first published a map based on his Mercator projection, which uses equally-spaced parallel vertical lines of longitude and parallel latitude lines spaced farther apart as they get farther away from the equator. By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death, and new editions were published after his death.\nIn 1570, the Brabantian cartographer Abraham Ortelius, strongly encouraged by Gillis Hooftman, created the first true modern atlas, \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum.\" In a rare move, Ortelius credited mapmakers who contributed to the atlas, the list of which grew to 183 individuals by 1603.\nIn the Renaissance, maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owner's reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly. Because of this, towards the end of the Renaissance, maps were displayed with equal importance of painting, sculptures, and other pieces of art. In the sixteenth century, maps were becoming increasingly available to consumers through the introduction of printmaking, with about 10% of Venetian homes having some sort of map by the late 1500s.\nThere were three main functions of maps in the Renaissance:\nIn medieval times, written directions of how to get somewhere were more common than the use of maps. With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power. Political leaders could lay claim to territories through the use of maps, and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The Holy Land and other religious places were the most commonly mapped during the Renaissance.\nIn the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map-making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid-to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century. Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\nPrinting technology.\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: woodcut and copper-plate intaglio, referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath. The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins. Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press to flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map, but thicker paper was more durable.\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\nLettering.\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time. To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as cancellaresca. There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.\nColor.\nThe first use of color in map-making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information. Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\nEarly modern period.\nThe early modern period saw the convergence of cartographical techniques across Eurasia and the exchange of mercantile mapping techniques via the Indian Ocean.\nIn the early seventeenth century, the Selden map was created by a Chinese cartographer. Historians have put its date of creation around 1620, but there is debate in this regard. This map's significance draws from historical misconceptions of East Asian cartography, the main one being that East Asians did not do cartography until Europeans arrived. The map's depiction of trading routes, a compass rose, and scale bar points to the culmination of many map-making techniques incorporated into Chinese mercantile cartography.\nIn 1689, representatives of the Russian tsar and Qing Dynasty met near the border town of Nerchinsk, which was near the disputed border of the two powers, in eastern Siberia. The two parties, with the Qing negotiation party bringing Jesuits as intermediaries, managed to work a treaty which placed the Amur River as the border between the Eurasian powers, and opened up trading relations between the two. This treaty's significance draws from the interaction between the two sides, and the intermediaries who were drawn from a wide variety of nationalities.\nAge of Enlightenment.\nMaps of the Enlightenment period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by Herman Moll. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by Nicolas de Fer. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by Louis Hennepin, published in 1697, and Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux, in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or cartouche.\nModern period.\nIn cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the compass and much later, magnetic storage devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to store and manipulate them digitally.\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the printing press, quadrant, and vernier allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. Hartmann Schedel was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the telescope, sextant, and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their latitude by measuring angles to the North Star at night or the Sun at noon.\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the lithographic and photochemical processes, make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\nIn the 20th century, aerial photography, satellite imagery, and remote sensing provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite ground tracks for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space. Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of computers and peripherals such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, have democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps has created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also digital raster graphic.\nIn the early years of the new millennium, three key technological advances transformed cartography: the removal of Selective Availability in the Global Positioning System (GPS) in May 2000, which improved locational accuracy for consumer-grade GPS receivers to within a few metres; the invention of OpenStreetMap in 2004, a global digital counter-map that allowed anyone to contribute and use new spatial data without complex licensing agreements; and the launch of Google Earth in 2005 as a development of the virtual globe EarthViewer 3D (2004), which revolutionised accessibility of accurate world maps, as well as access to satellite and aerial imagery. These advances brought more accuracy to geographical and location-based data and widened the range of applications for cartography, for example in the development of satnav devices.\nToday most commercial-quality maps are made using software of three main types: CAD, GIS and specialized illustration software. Spatial information can be stored in a database, from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\nOn the other hand, we can observe a reverse trend. In contemporary times, there is a resurgence of interest in the most beautiful periods of cartography, with various maps being created using, for example, Renaissance-style aesthetics. We encounter imitators or continuators of Renaissance traditions that merge the realms of science and art. Among them are figures such as Luther Phillips (1891\u20131960) and Ruth Rhoads Lepper Gardner (1905\u20132011), who still operated using traditional cartographic methods, as well as creators utilizing modern developments based on GIS solutions and those employing techniques that combine advanced GIS/CAD methods with traditional artistic forms.\nField-rugged computers, GPS, and laser rangefinders make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\nDeconstruction.\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's deconstruction. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"epistemological\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century. An example of this understanding is that \"[European reproduction of terrain on maps] reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth\u2026\".\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief, European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a 'sense of the other' in relation to nonconforming maps.\"\nDepictions of Africa are a common target of deconstructionism. According to deconstructionist models, cartography was used for strategic purposes associated with imperialism and as instruments and representations of power during the conquest of Africa. The depiction of Africa and the low latitudes in general on the Mercator projection has been interpreted as imperialistic and as symbolic of subjugation due to the diminished proportions of those regions compared to higher latitudes where the European powers were concentrated.\nMaps furthered imperialism and colonization of Africa in practical ways by showing basic information like roads, terrain, natural resources, settlements, and communities. Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the Berlin Conference of 1884\u20131885.\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.\nMap types.\nGeneral vs. thematic cartography.\nIn understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1\u00a0inch to 1 mile) \"Ordnance Survey\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\nThematic cartography involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a dot map showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical choropleth classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.\nTopographic vs. topological.\nA topographic map is primarily concerned with the topographic description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of contour lines showing elevation. Terrain or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see Cartographic relief depiction). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate digital elevation models which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.\nA topological map is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. Beck's London Underground map is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the River Thames, letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space. Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.\nMap design.\nModern technology, including advances in printing, the advent of geographic information systems and graphics software, and the Internet, has vastly simplified the process of map creation and increased the palette of design options available to cartographers. This has led to a decreased focus on production skill, and an increased focus on quality design, the attempt to craft maps that are both aesthetically pleasing and practically useful for their intended purposes.\nMap purpose and audience.\nA map has a purpose and an audience. Its purpose may be as broad as teaching the major physical and political features of the entire world, or as narrow as convincing a neighbor to move a fence. The audience may be as broad as the general public or as narrow as a single person. Mapmakers use design principles to guide them in constructing a map that is effective for its purpose and audience.\nCartographic process.\nThe cartographic process spans many stages, starting from conceiving the need for a map and extending all the way through its consumption by an audience. Conception begins with a real or imagined environment. As the cartographer gathers information about the subject, they consider how that information is structured and how that structure should inform the map's design. Next, the cartographers experiment with generalization, symbolization, typography, and other map elements to find ways to portray the information so that the map reader can interpret the map as intended. Guided by these experiments, the cartographer settles on a design and creates the map, whether in physical or electronic form. Once finished, the map is delivered to its audience. The map reader interprets the symbols and patterns on the map to draw conclusions and perhaps to take action. By the spatial perspectives they provide, maps help shape how we view the world.\nAspects of map design.\nDesigning a map involves bringing together a number of elements and making a large number of decisions. The elements of design fall into several broad topics, each of which has its own theory, its own research agenda, and its own best practices. That said, there are synergistic effects between these elements, meaning that the overall design process is not just working on each element one at a time, but an iterative feedback process of adjusting each to achieve the desired gestalt.\nDeliberate cartographic errors.\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as propaganda or as a \"watermark\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled \"trap streets\". Other names and forms for this are paper towns, fictitious entries, and copyright easter eggs.\nAnother motive for deliberate errors is cartographic \"vandalism\": a mapmaker wishing to leave their mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the Rocky Mountains' continental divide that appeared on a Boulder County, Colorado map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.\nSandy Island in New Caledonia is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions.\nWith the emergence of the internet and Web mapping, technologies allow for the creation and distribution of maps by people without proper cartographic training are readily available. This has led to maps that ignore cartographic conventions and are potentially misleading.\nProfessional and learned societies.\nProfessional and learned societies include:\nAcademic journals.\nJournals related to cartography, as well as GIS, GISc, include:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nMapmaking\nHistory\nMeanings"}

{"id": "7296", "revid": "3138265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7296", "title": "Cardiac glycoside", "text": "Class of organic compounds\nCardiac glycosides are a class of organic compounds that increase the output force of the heart and decrease its rate of contractions by inhibiting the cellular sodium-potassium ATPase pump. Their beneficial medical uses include treatments for congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias; however, their relative toxicity prevents them from being widely used. Most commonly found as defensive poisons in several plant genera such as \"Digitalis\" (the foxgloves) and \"Asclepias\" (the milkweeds), these compounds nevertheless have a diverse range of biochemical effects regarding cardiac cell function and have also been suggested for use in cancer treatment.\nClassification.\nGeneral structure.\nThe general structure of a cardiac glycoside consists of a steroid molecule attached to a sugar (glycoside) and an R group. The steroid nucleus consists of four fused rings to which other functional groups such as methyl, hydroxyl, and aldehyde groups can be attached to influence the overall molecule's biological activity. Cardiac glycosides also vary in the groups attached at either end of the steroid. Specifically, different sugar groups attached at the sugar end of the steroid can alter the molecule's solubility and kinetics; however, the lactone moiety at the R group end only serves a structural function.\nIn particular, the structure of the ring attached at the R end of the molecule allows it to be classified as either a cardenolide or bufadienolide. Cardenolides differ from bufadienolides due to the presence of an \"enolide,\" a five-membered ring with a single double bond, at the lactone end. Bufadienolides, on the other hand, contain a \"dienolide,\" a six-membered ring with two double bonds, at the lactone end. While compounds of both groups can be used to influence the cardiac output of the heart, cardenolides are more commonly used medicinally, primarily due to the widespread availability of the plants from which they are derived.\nClassification.\nCardiac glycosides can be more specifically categorized based on the plant they are derived from, as in the following list. For example, cardenolides have been primarily derived from the foxglove plants \"Digitalis purpurea\" and \"Digitalis lanata\", while bufadienolides have been derived from the venom of the cane toad \"Rhinella marina\" (formerly known as \"Bufo marinus\"), from which they receive the \"bufo\" portion of their name. Below is a list of organisms from which cardiac glycosides can be derived.\nMechanism of action.\nCardiac glycosides affect the sodium-potassium ATPase pump in cardiac muscle cells to alter their function. Normally, these sodium-potassium pumps move potassium ions in and sodium ions out. Cardiac glycosides, however, inhibit this pump by stabilizing it in the E2-P transition state, so that sodium cannot be extruded: intracellular sodium concentration therefore increases. With regard to potassium ion movement, because both cardiac glycosides and potassium compete for binding to the ATPase pump, changes in extracellular potassium concentration can potentially lead to altered drug efficacy. Nevertheless, by carefully controlling the dosage, such adverse effects can be avoided. Continuing on with the mechanism, raised intracellular sodium levels inhibit the function of a second membrane ion exchanger, NCX, which is responsible for pumping calcium ions out of the cell and sodium ions in at a ratio of . Thus, calcium ions are also not extruded and will begin to build up inside the cell as well.\nThe disrupted calcium homeostasis and increased cytoplasmic calcium concentrations cause increased calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the SERCA2 transporter. Raised calcium stores in the SR allow for greater calcium release on stimulation, so the myocyte can achieve faster and more powerful contraction by cross-bridge cycling. The refractory period of the AV node is increased, so cardiac glycosides also function to decrease heart rate. For example, the ingestion of digoxin leads to increased cardiac output and decreased heart rate without significant changes in blood pressure; this quality allows it to be widely used medicinally in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.\nNon-cardiac uses.\nCardiac glycosides were identified as senolytics: they can selectively eliminate senescent cells which are more sensitive to the ATPase-inhibiting action due to cell membrane changes.\nClinical significance.\nCardiac glycosides have long served as the main medical treatment to congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia, due to their effects of increasing the force of muscle contraction while reducing heart rate. Heart failure is characterized by an inability to pump enough blood to support the body, possibly due to a decrease in the volume of the blood or its contractile force. Treatments for the condition thus focus on lowering blood pressure, so that the heart does not have to exert as much force to pump the blood, or directly increasing the heart's contractile force, so that the heart can overcome the higher blood pressure. Cardiac glycosides, such as the commonly used digoxin and digitoxin, deal with the latter, due to their positive inotropic activity. On the other hand, cardiac arrhythmia are changes in heart rate, whether faster (tachycardia) or slower (bradycardia). Medicinal treatments for this condition work primarily to counteract tachycardia or atrial fibrillation by slowing down heart rate, as done by cardiac glycosides.\nNevertheless, due to questions of toxicity and dosage, cardiac glycosides have been replaced with synthetic drugs such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers and are no longer used as the primary medical treatment for such conditions. Depending on the severity of the condition, though, they may still be used in conjunction with other treatments.\nToxicity.\nFrom ancient times, humans have used cardiac-glycoside-containing plants and their crude extracts as arrow coatings, homicidal or suicidal aids, rat poisons, heart tonics, diuretics and emetics, primarily due to the toxic nature of these compounds. Thus, though cardiac glycosides have been used for their medicinal function, their toxicity must also be recognized. For example, in 2008 US poison centers reported 2,632 cases of digoxin toxicity, and 17 cases of digoxin-related deaths. Because cardiac glycosides affect the cardiovascular, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems, these three systems can be used to determine the effects of toxicity. The effect of these compounds on the cardiovascular system presents a reason for concern, as they can directly affect the function of the heart through their inotropic and chronotropic effects. In terms of inotropic activity, excessive cardiac glycoside dosage results in cardiac contractions with greater force, as further calcium is released from the SR of cardiac muscle cells. Toxicity also results in changes to heart chronotropic activity, resulting in multiple kinds of dysrhythmia and potentially fatal ventricular tachycardia. These dysrhythmias are an effect of an influx of sodium and decrease of resting membrane potential threshold in cardiac muscle cells. When taken beyond a narrow dosage range specific to each particular cardiac glycoside, these compounds can rapidly become dangerous. In sum, they interfere with fundamental processes that regulate membrane potential. They are toxic to the heart, the brain, and the gut at doses that are not difficult to reach. In the heart, the most common negative effect is premature ventricular contraction.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While frequently an imperialist project, colonialism functions through differentiating between the targeted land and people, and that of the colonizers (a critical component of colonization). Rather than annexation, this typically culminates in organizing the colonized into colonies separate to the colonizers' metropole. Colonialism sometimes deepens by developing settler colonialism, whereby settlers from one or multiple colonizing metropoles occupy a territory with the intention of partially or completely supplanting the existing indigenous peoples, possibly amounting to genocide.2\nColonialism monopolizes power by understanding conquered land and people to be inferior, based on beliefs of entitlement and superiority, justified with beliefs of having a civilizing mission to cultivate land and life, historically often rooted in the belief of a Christian mission. These beliefs and the actual colonization establish a so-called coloniality, which keeps the colonized socio-economically othered and subaltern through modern biopolitics of sexuality, gender, race, disability and class, among others, resulting in intersectional violence and discrimination.\nWhile different forms of colonialism have existed around the world, the concept has been developed as a description of European colonial empires of the modern era. These spread globally from the 15th century to the mid-20th century, spanning 35% of Earth's land by 1800 and peaking at 84% by the beginning of World War I. European colonialism employed mercantilism and chartered companies, and established complex colonialities.\nDecolonization, which started in the 18th century, gradually led to the independence of colonies in waves, with a particular large wave of decolonizations happening in the aftermath of World War II between 1945 and 1975. Colonialism has a persistent impact on a wide range of modern outcomes, as scholars have shown that variations in colonial institutions can account for variations in economic development, regime types, and state capacity. Some academics have used the term neocolonialism to describe the continuation or imposition of elements of colonial rule through indirect means in the contemporary period.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEtymology.\nColonialism is etymologically derived from the Latin term colonia, originally a designation for a type of city or outpost that was founded and populated by newly settled Roman citizens at the direction of the Roman government. The word is then in turn derived from the Latin word (\"farmer\") and its root word (\"to cultivate, to till\").\nDefinitions.\nThe earliest uses of \"colonialism\" referred to plantations that men emigrated to and settled. The term expanded its meaning in the early 20th century to act as a historical reference for European imperial expansion and the imperialist subjection of Asian and African peoples, while also serving as a paradigm for analysing the form of rule. Defining colonialism became necessary for the international anti-colonial movement, and it was discussed in the 1955 Bandung Conference and the contexts it applied to disputed. The concept entered the forefront of academia in the late 20th century, followed by the development of postcolonialism.\n\"Collins English Dictionary\" defines colonialism as \"the practice by which a powerful country directly controls less powerful countries and uses their resources to increase its own power and wealth\". \"Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary\" defined colonialism as \"the policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories\". The online \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\" offers several definitions: \"domination of a people or area by a foreign state or nation\", \"the practice of extending and maintaining a nation's political and economic control over another people or area\" and \"the policy of or belief in acquiring and retaining colonies\".\nThe \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" defines it as \"a practice of domination, which involves the subjugation of one people to another\" and uses the term \"to describe the process of European settlement and political control over the rest of the world, including the Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia\". It discusses the distinction between colonialism, imperialism, and conquest and states that \"[t]he difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the term is often used as a synonym for imperialism. Both colonialism and imperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit Europe economically and strategically\".\nIn his preface to J\u00fcrgen Osterhammel's \"Colonialism: A Theoretical Overview\", Roger Tignor says \"For Osterhammel, the essence of colonialism is the existence of colonies, which are by definition governed differently from other territories such as protectorates or informal spheres of influence.\" In the book, Osterhammel asks, \"How can 'colonialism' be defined independently from 'colony?'\" He settles on a three-sentence definition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAccording to Julian Go, \"Colonialism refers to the direct political control of a society and its people by a foreign ruling state... The ruling state monopolizes political power and keeps the subordinated society and its people in a legally inferior position.\" He also writes, \"colonialism depends first and foremost upon the declaration of sovereignty and/or territorial seizure by a core state over another territory and its inhabitants who are classified as inferior subjects rather than equal citizens.\"\nAustralian historian Lorenzo Veracini defines colonialism as the establishment and maintenance of an unequal relationship between a colonial metropole and a colonized territory through violence and argues that colonialism is sustained as an unequal relationship through the essential forces of displacement and violence. The imbalance of power that results from a colonial relationship allows a colonial metropole to exploit unequal trading terms between it and its colonies.\nWendell Bell in \"The Encyclopedic Dictionary of Sociology\" describes colonialism (incl. internal colonialism) as a \"a process by which [...] dominance is acquired and held by a foreign power over another people and land\". This definition is cited and complemented by the \"International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences\", clarifying that the rule of colonialism is different to annexation as it does not involve actual incorporation.\nIn \"A Dictionary of Human Geography\" colonialism is described as control over another people accompanied by an ideology of superiority and racism.\nColonial studies have been criticized for eurocentrism in determining the threshold between colonialism versus conquest.\nTypes of colonialism.\n\"The Times\" once quipped that there were three types of colonial empire: \"The English, which consists in making colonies with colonists; the German, which collects colonists without colonies; the French, which sets up colonies without colonists.\" Modern studies of colonialism have often distinguished between various overlapping categories of colonialism, broadly classified into four types: settler colonialism, exploitation colonialism, surrogate colonialism, and internal colonialism. Some historians have identified other forms of colonialism, including national and trade forms.\nSocio-cultural evolution.\nWhen colonists settled in pre-populated areas, the societies and cultures of the people in those areas permanently changed. Colonial practices directly and indirectly forced the colonized peoples to abandon their traditional cultures and established complex systems of power, so-called colonialities. For example, European colonizers in the United States implemented the residential schools program to force native children to assimilate into the hegemonic culture.\nCultural colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the mestizos of the Americas, as well as racially divided populations such as those found in French Algeria or in Southern Rhodesia. In fact, everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence, hybrid communities existed.\nNotable examples in Asia include the Anglo-Burmese, Anglo-Indian, Burgher, Eurasian Singaporean, Filipino mestizo, Kristang, and Macanese peoples. In the Dutch East Indies (later Indonesia) the vast majority of \"Dutch\" settlers were in fact Eurasians known as Indo-Europeans, formally belonging to the European legal class in the colony.\nHistory.\nAntiquity.\nActivity that could be called colonialism has a long history, starting at least as early as the ancient Egyptians. Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans founded colonies in antiquity. Phoenicia had an enterprising maritime trading-culture that spread across the Mediterranean from 1550\u00a0BC to 300\u00a0BC; later the Persian Empire and various Greek city-states continued on this line of setting up colonies. The Romans would soon follow, setting up \"coloniae\" throughout the Mediterranean, in North Africa, and in Western Asia.\nMedieval.\nFrom the 9th century Vikings (Norsemen) such as Leif Erikson established colonies in Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, North America, present-day Russia and Ukraine, France (Normandy) and Sicily. In the 9th century a new wave of Mediterranean colonisation began, with competitors such as the Venetians, Genovese and Amalfians infiltrating the wealthy previously Byzantine or Eastern Roman islands and lands. European Crusaders set up colonial regimes in Outremer (in the Levant, 1097\u20131291) and in the Baltic littoral (12th century onwards). Venice began to dominate Dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal colonial extent at the conclusion of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, with the declaration of the acquisition of three octaves of the Byzantine Empire.\nModern.\nModern colonialism is generally considered to have begun with the Spanish conquest of the Canary Islands when \"the relationships involved in domination became recognisably colonial.\"10 Following the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, the sea routes discovered by Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator (1394\u20131460) became central to trade, and helped fuel the Age of Discovery. The Crown of Castile encountered the Americas in 1492 through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extents of land. The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the areas of these \"new\" lands between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire in 1494.\nThe 17th century saw the birth of the Dutch Empire and French colonial empire, as well as the English overseas possessions, which later became the British Empire. It also saw the establishment of Danish overseas colonies and Swedish overseas colonies.\nA first wave of separatism started with the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783), initiating the Rise of the \"Second\" British Empire (1783\u20131815). The Spanish Empire largely collapsed in the Americas with the Spanish American wars of independence (1808\u20131833). Empire-builders established several new colonies after this time, including in the German colonial empire and Belgian colonial empire. Starting with the end of the French Revolution European authors such as Johann Gottfried Herder, August von Kotzebue, and Heinrich von Kleist prolifically published so as to conjure up sympathy for the oppressed native peoples and the slaves of the new world, thereby starting the idealization of \"native\" humans.\nThe Habsburg monarchy, the Russian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire existed at the same time but did not expand over oceans. Rather, these empires expanded through the conquest of neighbouring territories. There was, though, some Russian colonization of North America across the Bering Strait. The Empire of Brazil fought for hegemony in South America. The United States gained overseas territories after the 1898 Spanish\u2013American War, hence, the coining of the term \"American imperialism\".\nThe Japanese colonial empire began in the mid-19th century with the settler colonization of Hokkaido and the destruction of the island's indigenous Ainu people before moving onto the Ryukyu Islands (the indigenous Ryukyuan people survived colonization more intact). After the Meiji Restoration, Japan more formally developed its colonial policies with the help of European advisors. The stated purpose from the beginning was to compensate for the lack of resources on the main islands of Japan by securing control over natural resources in Asia for its own economic development and industrialization, not unlike its European counterparts. Japan defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War to control Korea and the island of Formosa, now Taiwan, and later fought off the Russian Empire to control Port Arthur and South Sakhalin.\nIn the late 19th century, many European powers became involved in the Scramble for Africa.\n20th century.\nThe world's colonial population at the outbreak of the First World War\u00a0\u2013 a high point for colonialism\u00a0\u2013 totalled about 560 million people, of whom 70% lived in British possessions, 10% in French possessions, 9% in Dutch possessions, 4% in Japanese possessions, 2% in German possessions, 2% in American possessions, 3% in Portuguese possessions, 1% in Belgian possessions and 0.5% in Italian possessions. The domestic domains of the colonial powers had a total population of about 370\u00a0million people. Outside Europe, few areas had remained without coming under formal colonial tutorship \u2013 and even Siam, China, Japan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Persia, and Abyssinia had felt varying degrees of Western colonial-style influence\u00a0\u2013 concessions, unequal treaties, extraterritoriality and the like.\nAsking whether colonies paid, economic historian Grover Clark (1891\u20131938) argues an emphatic \"No!\" He reports that in every case the support cost, especially the military system necessary to support and defend colonies, outran the total trade they produced. Apart from the British Empire, they did not provide favoured destinations for the immigration of surplus metropole populations. The question of whether colonies paid is a complicated one when recognizing the multiplicity of interests involved. In some cases colonial powers paid a lot in military costs while private investors pocketed the benefits. In other cases the colonial powers managed to move the burden of administrative costs to the colonies themselves by imposing taxes.\nWorld War I.\nThe First World War brought the European colonial empires into conflict with each other with the fight sustained by their colonial territories.130 War mobilization heightened colonial exploitation globally, sparking several anticolonial uprisings in response to forced conscription. Germany capitulated in large part due to the Allied sea blockade cutting off access to its overseas colonies, a disadvantage which German U-boats could not inflict on the Allies. The victorious Allies divided up the German colonial empire and much of the Ottoman Empire between themselves as League of Nations mandates, grouping these territories into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they could prepare for independence. The empires of Russia and Austria collapsed in 1917\u20131918, and the Soviet empire emerged.\nInterwar years.\nAnti-colonial sentiment surged during the interwar years.130-136 The Easter Rising and Irish War of Independence led to the UK conceding independence to Ireland. Turkey became an independent country in the ruins of the Ottoman Empire and fought off interventions from Britain, France, and Italy. The first Pan-African Congress would take place in Paris in 1919. The Soviet Union positioned itself as \"an explicitly anti-imperialist power\"130 and would play an important role in the success of anticolonial resistance movements in Asia and Africa, although its own policies in Central Asia resembled the colonial policies of the Russian empire that preceded it. At the same time, Japan expanded its colonies in Asia and the Pacific. \nWorld War II.\nMany interpret World War II as an attempt by Nazi Germany and its allies to colonize the whole European continent, especially in the east. Historian Lorenzo Veracini writes, \"The global history of colonialism can be seen as bookended by two fateful moments: European armies crossed the strait of Gibraltar in the fifteenth century to establish unequal relations of domination in Africa, and a colonial army crossed it in the opposite direction in 1936, to conquer the metropole and pursue a civil war that subjected the metropolitan populations with a violence that had been until then reserved for restive colonized subjects.\"5 Economic historian Adam Tooze posits that Operation Barbarossa is \"far better understood as the last great land-grab in the long and bloody history of European colonialism.\"462 \"From the moment that Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the genocidal impulses of Nazi ideology towards both the Jews and the Slavs had taken on concrete form in an extraordinary programme of population displacement and colonial settlement.\"463 Generalplan Ost, the Nazi government's grand plan of settler colonialism, called for the mass murder and deportation of at least 30 million Slavs from Poland and the western Soviet Union in preparation for the importation of millions of German settlers.462-467 The plan was lauded as a 'solution' to secure Germany's food supply for the duration of the war, unlike the previous one. Hitler repeatedly drew parallels between the colonization plan and Manifest Destiny in the United States. Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire argues in Discourse on Colonialism, \"[Europeans] tolerated that Nazism before it was inflicted on them, they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimized it, because, until then, it had been applied only to non-European peoples.\"\nPost-WWII decolonization.\nIn the aftermath of World War II, decolonisation progressed rapidly. The tumultuous upheaval of the war significantly weakened the major colonial powers, and they quickly lost control of colonies such as Singapore, India, and Libya. In addition, the United Nations shows support for decolonisation in its 1945 charter. In 1960, the UN issued the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, which affirmed its stance (though notably, colonial empires such as France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States abstained).\nThe word \"neocolonialism\" originated from Jean-Paul Sartre in 1956, to refer to a variety of contexts since the decolonisation that took place after World War II. Generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonisation\u00a0\u2013 rather to colonialism or colonial-style exploitation by other means. Specifically, neocolonialism may refer to the theory that former or existing economic relationships, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or the operations of companies (such as Royal Dutch Shell in Nigeria and Brunei) fostered by former colonial powers were or are used to maintain control of former colonies and dependencies after the colonial independence movements of the post\u2013World War II period. The term became popular in ex-colonies in the late 20th century.\nContemporary.\nWhile colonies of contiguous empires have been historically excluded, they can be seen as colonies.\nContemporary expansion of colonies is seen by some in case of Russian imperialism and Chinese imperialism. Zionism is a modern colonialist movement, although it began in the 20th century. It has been categorized by some scholars as a settler colonialist movement.\nImpact.\nThe impacts of colonisation are immense and pervasive. Various effects, both immediate and protracted, include the spread of virulent diseases, causing pandemics, oppression, unequal social relations through othering and economically through exclusion, detribalization, appropriation, exploitation, enslavement, medical advances, the creation of new institutions, abolitionism, changing infrastructure, and technological progress. Colonial practices also spur the spread of conquerors' languages, literature and cultural institutions, while endangering or obliterating those of indigenous peoples, possibly amounting to genocide.2 Despite the colonial suppression and narrative, colonised people may be able to build on their agency, potentially having influence on the imperial country or even challenging it. Often though this has been met with cultural appropriation and forced assimilation.\nWith respect to international borders, Britain and France traced close to 40% of the entire length of the world's international boundaries.\nEconomy, trade and commerce.\nEconomic expansion, sometimes described as the colonial surplus, has accompanied imperial expansion since ancient times. Greek trade networks spread throughout the Mediterranean region while Roman trade expanded with the primary goal of directing tribute from the colonised areas towards the Roman metropole. According to Strabo, by the time of emperor Augustus, up to 120 Roman ships would set sail every year from Myos Hormos in Roman Egypt to India. With the development of trade routes under the Ottoman Empire,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gujari Hindus, Syrian Muslims, Jews, Armenians, Christians from south and central Europe operated trading routes that supplied Persian and Arab horses to the armies of all three empires, Mocha coffee to Delhi and Belgrade, Persian silk to India and Istanbul.\nAztec civilisation developed into an extensive empire that, much like the Roman Empire, had the goal of exacting tribute from the conquered colonial areas. For the Aztecs, a significant tribute was the acquisition of sacrificial victims for their religious rituals.\nOn the other hand, European colonial empires sometimes attempted to channel, restrict and impede trade involving their colonies, funneling activity through the metropole and taxing accordingly.\nDespite the general trend of economic expansion, the economic performance of former European colonies varies significantly. In \"Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-run Growth\", economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson compare the economic influences of the European colonists on different colonies and study what could explain the huge discrepancies in previous European colonies, for example, between West African colonies like Sierra Leone and Hong Kong and Singapore.\nAccording to the paper, economic institutions are the determinant of the colonial success because they determine their financial performance and order for the distribution of resources. At the same time, these institutions are also consequences of political institutions \u2013 especially how de facto and de jure political power is allocated. To explain the different colonial cases, we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions.\nFor example, one interesting observation is \"the Reversal of Fortune\"\u00a0\u2013 the less developed civilisations in 1500, like North America, Australia, and New Zealand, are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilisations in 1500 before the colonists came, like the Mughals in India and the Incas in the Americas. One explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies: it was less likely for European colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area. Therefore, given a more developed civilisation and denser population, European colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system; while in places with little to extract, European colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests. Political institutions thus gave rise to different types of economic systems, which determined the colonial economic performance.\nEuropean colonisation and development also changed gendered systems of power already in place around the world. In many pre-colonialist areas, women maintained power, prestige, or authority through reproductive or agricultural control. For example, in certain parts of Sub-Saharan Africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights. While men would make political and communal decisions for a community, the women would control the village's food supply or their individual family's land. This allowed women to achieve power and autonomy, even in patrilineal and patriarchal societies.\nThrough the rise of European colonialism came a large push for development and industrialisation of most economic systems. When working to improve productivity, Europeans focused mostly on male workers. Foreign aid arrived in the form of loans, land, credit, and tools to speed up development, but were only allocated to men. In a more European fashion, women were expected to serve on a more domestic level. The result was a technologic, economic, and class-based gender gap that widened over time.\nWithin a colony, the presence of extractive colonial institutions in a given area has been found have effects on the modern day economic development, institutions and infrastructure of these areas.\nSlavery and indentured servitude.\nEuropean nations entered their imperial projects with the goal of enriching the European metropoles. Exploitation of non-Europeans and of other Europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonisers. Two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were the extension of slavery and indentured servitude. In the 17th century, nearly two-thirds of English settlers came to North America as indentured servants.\nEuropean slave traders brought large numbers of African slaves to the Americas by sail. Spain and Portugal had brought African slaves to work in African colonies such as Cape Verde and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, and then in Latin America, by the 16th century. The British, French and Dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries. The European colonial system took approximately 11\u00a0million Africans to the Caribbean and to North and South America as slaves.\nAbolitionists in Europe and Americas protested the inhumane treatment of African slaves, which led to the elimination of the slave trade (and later, of most forms of slavery) by the late 19th century. One (disputed) school of thought points to the role of abolitionism in the American Revolution: while the British colonial metropole started to move towards outlawing slavery, slave-owning elites in the Thirteen Colonies saw this as one of the reasons to fight for their post-colonial independence and for the right to develop and continue a largely slave-based economy.\nBritish colonising activity in New Zealand from the early 19th century played a part in ending slave-taking and slave-keeping among the indigenous M\u0101ori.\nOn the other hand, British colonial administration in Southern Africa, when it officially abolished slavery in the 1830s, caused rifts in society which arguably perpetuated slavery in the Boer Republics and fed into the philosophy of \"apartheid\".\nThe labour shortages that resulted from abolition inspired European colonisers in Queensland, British Guaiana and Fiji (for example) to develop new sources of labour, re-adopting a system of indentured servitude. Indentured servants consented to a contract with the European colonisers. Under their contract, the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year, while the employer agreed to pay for the servant's voyage to the colony, possibly pay for the return to the country of origin, and pay the employee a wage as well. The employees became \"indentured\" to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony, which they were expected to pay through their wages. In practice, indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts imposed by the employers, with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony.\nIndia and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era. Indentured servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and also to French and Portuguese colonies, while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies. Between 1830 and 1930, around 30\u00a0million indentured servants migrated from India, and 24\u00a0million returned to India. China sent more indentured servants to European colonies, and around the same proportion returned to China.\nFollowing the Scramble for Africa, an early but secondary focus for most colonial regimes was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery persists in Africa and in the world at large with much the same practices of \"de facto\" servility despite legislative prohibition.\nMilitary innovation.\nConquering forces have throughout history applied innovation in order to gain an advantage over the armies of the people they aim to conquer. Greeks developed the phalanx system, which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall, with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield. Under Philip II of Macedon, they were able to organise thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force, bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments. Alexander the Great exploited this military foundation further during his conquests.\nThe Spanish Empire held a major advantage over Mesoamerican warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal, predominantly iron, which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the Aztec civilisation and others. The use of gunpowder weapons cemented the European military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the Americas and elsewhere.\nEnd of empire.\nThe populations of some colonial territories, such as Canada, enjoyed relative peace and prosperity as part of a European power, at least among the majority. Minority populations such as First Nations peoples and French-Canadians experienced marginalisation and resented colonial practices. Francophone residents of Quebec, for example, were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of Britain during World War I, resulting in the Conscription crisis of 1917. Other European colonies had much more pronounced conflict between European settlers and the local population. Rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era, such as India's Sepoy Rebellion of 1857.\nThe territorial boundaries imposed by European colonisers, notably in central Africa and South Asia, defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another. European colonisers disregarded native political and cultural animosities, imposing peace upon people under their military control. Native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators.\nThe Partition of British India in August 1947 led to the Independence of India and the creation of Pakistan. These events also caused much bloodshed at the time of the migration of immigrants from the two countries. Muslims from India and Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan migrated to the respective countries they sought independence for.\nPost-independence population movement.\nIn a reversal of the migration patterns experienced during the modern colonial era, post-independence era migration followed a route back towards the imperial country. In some cases, this was a movement of settlers of European origin returning to the land of their birth, or to an ancestral birthplace. 900,000 French colonists (known as the \"Pied-Noirs\") resettled in France following Algeria's independence in 1962. A significant number of these migrants were also of Algerian descent. 800,000 people of Portuguese origin migrated to Portugal after the independence of former colonies in Africa between 1974 and 1979; 300,000 settlers of Dutch origin migrated to the Netherlands from the Dutch West Indies after Dutch military control of the colony ended.\nAfter WWII 300,000 Dutchmen from the Dutch East Indies, of which the majority were people of Eurasian descent called Indo Europeans, repatriated to the Netherlands. A significant number later migrated to the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\nGlobal travel and migration in general developed at an increasingly brisk pace throughout the era of European colonial expansion. Citizens of the former colonies of European countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former European imperial nation. For example, rights to dual citizenship may be generous, or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies.\nIn some cases, the former European imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies. The Commonwealth of Nations is an organisation that promotes cooperation between and among Britain and its former colonies, the Commonwealth members. A similar organisation exists for former colonies of France, the Francophonie; the Community of Portuguese Language Countries plays a similar role for former Portuguese colonies, and the Dutch Language Union is the equivalent for former colonies of the Netherlands.\nMigration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for European countries, where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies. Cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in France in recent decades, between immigrants from the Maghreb countries of north Africa and the majority population of France. Nonetheless, immigration has changed the ethnic composition of France; by the 1980s, 25% of the total population of \"inner Paris\" and 14% of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin, mainly Algerian.\nIntroduced diseases.\nEncounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases, which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, smallpox, measles, malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America.\nHalf the native population of Hispaniola in 1518 was killed by smallpox. Smallpox also ravaged Mexico in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in Tenochtitlan alone, including the emperor, and Peru in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors. Measles killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 17th century. In 1618\u20131619, smallpox wiped out 90% of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans. Smallpox epidemics in 1780\u20131782 and 1837\u20131838 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians. Some believe that the death of up to 95% of the Native American population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases. Over the centuries, the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases, while the indigenous peoples had no time to build such immunity.\nSmallpox decimated the native population of Australia, killing around 50% of indigenous Australians in the early years of British colonisation. It also killed many New Zealand M\u0101ori. As late as 1848\u201349, as many as 40,000 out of 150,000 Hawaiians are estimated to have died of measles, whooping cough and influenza. Introduced diseases, notably smallpox, nearly wiped out the native population of Easter Island. In 1875, measles killed over 40,000 Fijians, approximately one-third of the population. The Ainu population decreased drastically in the 19th century, due in large part\nto infectious diseases brought by Japanese settlers pouring into Hokkaido.\nConversely, researchers have hypothesised that a precursor to syphilis may have been carried from the New World to Europe after Columbus's voyages. The findings suggested Europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home, where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions of Europe. The disease was more frequently fatal than it is today; syphilis was a major killer in Europe during the Renaissance. The first cholera pandemic began in Bengal, then spread across India by 1820. Ten thousand British troops and countless Indians died during this pandemic. Between 1736 and 1834 only some 10% of East India Company's officers survived to take the final voyage home. Waldemar Haffkine, who mainly worked in India, who developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague in the 1890s, is considered the first microbiologist.\nAccording to a 2021 study by J\u00f6rg Baten and Laura Maravall on the anthropometric influence of colonialism on Africans, the average height of Africans decreased by 1.1 centimetres upon colonization and later recovered and increased overall during colonial rule. The authors attributed the decrease to diseases, such as malaria and sleeping sickness, forced labor during the early decades of colonial rule, conflicts, land grabbing, and widespread cattle deaths from the rinderpest viral disease.\nCountering disease.\nAs early as 1803, the Spanish Crown organised a mission (the Balmis expedition) to transport the smallpox vaccine to the Spanish colonies, and establish mass vaccination programs there. By 1832, the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans. Under the direction of Mountstuart Elphinstone a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination in India. From the beginning of the 20th century onwards, the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers. The sleeping sickness epidemic in Africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk. In the 20th century, the world saw the biggest increase in its population in human history due to lessening of the mortality rate in many countries due to medical advances. The world population has grown from 1.6\u00a0billion in 1900 to over seven billion today.\nBotany.\nColonial botany refers to the body of works concerning the study, cultivation, marketing and naming of the new plants that were acquired or traded during the age of European colonialism. Notable examples of these plants included sugar, nutmeg, tobacco, cloves, cinnamon, Peruvian bark, peppers, \"Sassafras albidum\", and tea. This work was a large part of securing financing for colonial ambitions, supporting European expansion and ensuring the profitability of such endeavors. Vasco de Gama and Christopher Columbus were seeking to establish routes to trade spices, dyes and silk from the Moluccas, India and China by sea that would be independent of the established routes controlled by Venetian and Middle Eastern merchants. Naturalists like Hendrik van Rheede, Georg Eberhard Rumphius, and Jacobus Bontius compiled data about eastern plants on behalf of the Europeans. Though Sweden did not possess an extensive colonial network, botanical research based on Carl Linnaeus identified and developed techniques to grow cinnamon, tea and rice locally as an alternative to costly imports.\nGeography.\nSettlers acted as the link between indigenous populations and the imperial hegemony, thus bridging the geographical, ideological and commercial gap between the colonisers and colonised. While the extent in which geography as an academic study is implicated in colonialism is contentious, geographical tools such as cartography, shipbuilding, navigation, mining and agricultural productivity were instrumental in European colonial expansion. Colonisers' awareness of the Earth's surface and abundance of practical skills provided colonisers with a knowledge that, in turn, created power.\nAnne Godlewska and Neil Smith argue that \"empire was 'quintessentially a geographical project'\". Historical geographical theories such as environmental determinism legitimised colonialism by positing the view that some parts of the world were underdeveloped, which created notions of skewed evolution. Geographers such as Ellen Churchill Semple and Ellsworth Huntington put forward the notion that northern climates bred vigour and intelligence as opposed to those indigenous to tropical climates (See The Tropics) viz a viz a combination of environmental determinism and Social Darwinism in their approach.\nPolitical geographers also maintain that colonial behaviour was reinforced by the physical mapping of the world, therefore creating a visual separation between \"them\" and \"us\". Geographers are primarily focused on the spaces of colonialism and imperialism; more specifically, the material and symbolic appropriation of space enabling colonialism.\nMaps played an extensive role in colonialism, as Bassett would put it \"by providing geographical information in a convenient and standardised format, cartographers helped open West Africa to European conquest, commerce, and colonisation\". Because the relationship between colonialism and geography was not scientifically objective, cartography was often manipulated during the colonial era. Social norms and values had an effect on the constructing of maps. During colonialism map-makers used rhetoric in their formation of boundaries and in their art. The rhetoric favoured the view of the conquering Europeans; this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non-European was instantly regarded as inaccurate. Furthermore, European cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism; portraying one's own ethnicity in the centre of the map. As J.B. Harley put it, \"The steps in making a map\u00a0\u2013 selection, omission, simplification, classification, the creation of hierarchies, and 'symbolisation'\u00a0\u2013 are all inherently rhetorical.\"\nA common practice by the European cartographers of the time was to map unexplored areas as \"blank spaces\". This influenced the colonial powers as it sparked competition amongst them to explore and colonise these regions. Imperialists aggressively and passionately looked forward to filling these spaces for the glory of their respective countries. The \"Dictionary of Human Geography\" notes that cartography was used to empty 'undiscovered' lands of their Indigenous meaning and bring them into spatial existence via the imposition of \"Western place-names and borders, [therefore] priming 'virgin' (putatively empty land, 'wilderness') for colonisation (thus sexualising colonial landscapes as domains of male penetration), reconfiguring alien space as absolute, quantifiable and separable (as property).\"\nDavid Livingstone stresses \"that geography has meant different things at different times and in different places\" and that we should keep an open mind in regards to the relationship between geography and colonialism instead of identifying boundaries. Geography as a discipline was not and is not an objective science, Painter and Jeffrey argue, rather it is based on assumptions about the physical world. Comparison of exogeographical representations of ostensibly tropical environments in science fiction art support this conjecture, finding the notion of the tropics to be an artificial collection of ideas and beliefs that are independent of geography.\nOcean and space.\nWith contemporary advances in deep sea and outer space technologies, colonization of the seabed and the Moon have become an object of non-terrestrial colonialism.\nMarxism.\nMarxism views colonialism as a form of capitalism, enforcing exploitation and social change. Marx thought that working within the global capitalist system, colonialism is closely associated with uneven development. It is an \"instrument of wholesale destruction, dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies, socio-psychological disorientation, massive poverty and neocolonial dependency\". Colonies are constructed into modes of production. The search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter-capitalist rivalry for capital accumulation. Lenin regarded colonialism as the root cause of imperialism, as imperialism was distinguished by monopoly capitalism via colonialism and as Lyal S. Sunga explains: \"Vladimir Lenin advocated forcefully the principle of self-determination of peoples in his \"Theses on the Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination\" as an integral plank in the programme of socialist internationalism\" and he quotes Lenin who contended that \"The right of nations to self-determination implies exclusively the right to independence in the political sense, the right to free political separation from the oppressor nation. Specifically, this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation.\" Non-Russian Marxists within the RSFSR and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, meanwhile, between 1918 and 1923 and then after 1929, considered the Soviet regime a renewed version of Russian imperialism and colonialism.\nIn his critique of colonialism in Africa, the Guyanese historian and political activist Walter Rodney states:The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power. Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups. It implies the ability to defend one's interests and if necessary to impose one's will by any means available\u00a0... When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society that in itself is a form of underdevelopment\u00a0... During the centuries of pre-colonial trade, some control over social political and economic life was retained in Africa, in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans. That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism. Colonialism went much further than trade. It meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by Europeans of the social institutions within Africa. Africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards, and lost full command of training young members of the society. Those were undoubtedly major steps backwards\u00a0... Colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation, but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so-called 'mother country'. From an African view-point, that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by African labour out of African resources. It meant the development of Europe as part of the same dialectical process in which Africa was underdeveloped. Colonial Africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector. As seen earlier, exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance, but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place.According to Lenin, the new imperialism emphasised the transition of capitalism from free trade to a stage of monopoly capitalism to finance capital. He states it is, \"connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world\". As free trade thrives on exports of commodities, monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry. This, to Lenin, was the highest stage of capitalism. He goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing. War is stated to be the consequence of imperialism. As a continuation of this thought, G.N. Uzoigwe states, \"But it is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses.\"\nLiberalism and capitalism.\nClassical liberals were generally in abstract opposition to colonialism and imperialism, including Adam Smith, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat, Richard Cobden, John Bright, Henry Richard, Herbert Spencer, H.R. Fox Bourne, Edward Morel, Josephine Butler, W.J. Fox and William Ewart Gladstone. Their philosophies found the colonial enterprise, particularly mercantilism, in opposition to the principles of free trade and liberal policies. Adam Smith wrote in \"The Wealth of Nations\" that Britain should grant independence to all of its colonies and also argued that it would be economically beneficial for British people in the average, although the merchants having mercantilist privileges would lose out.\nRace and gender.\nDuring the colonial era, the global process of colonisation served to spread and synthesize the social and political belief systems of the \"mother-countries\" which often included a belief in a certain natural racial superiority of the race of the mother-country. Colonialism also acted to reinforce these same racial belief systems within the \"mother-countries\" themselves. Usually also included within the colonial belief systems was a certain belief in the inherent superiority of male over female. This particular belief was often pre-existing amongst the pre-colonial societies, prior to their colonisation.\nPopular political practices of the time reinforced colonial rule by legitimising European (and/ or Japanese) male authority, and also legitimising female and non-mother-country race inferiority through studies of craniology, comparative anatomy, and phrenology. Biologists, naturalists, anthropologists, and ethnologists of the 19th century were focused on the study of colonised indigenous women, as in the case of Georges Cuvier's study of Sarah Baartman. Such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on the observations of naturalists' from the mother-countries. European studies along these lines gave rise to the perception that African women's anatomy, and especially genitalia, resembled those of mandrills, baboons, and monkeys, thus differentiating colonised Africans from what were viewed as the features of the evolutionarily superior, and thus rightfully authoritarian, European woman.\nIn addition to what would now be viewed as pseudo-scientific studies of race, which tended to reinforce a belief in an inherent mother-country racial superiority, a new supposedly \"science-based\" ideology concerning gender roles also then emerged as an adjunct to the general body of beliefs of inherent superiority of the colonial era. Female inferiority across all cultures was emerging as an idea supposedly supported by craniology that led scientists to argue that the typical brain size of the female human was, on the average, slightly smaller than that of the male, thus inferring that therefore female humans must be less developed and less evolutionarily advanced than males. This finding of relative cranial size difference was later attributed to the general typical size difference of the human male body versus that of the typical human female body.\nWithin the former European colonies, non-Europeans and women sometimes faced invasive studies by the colonial powers in the interest of the then prevailing pro-colonial scientific ideology of the day.\nOthering.\nOthering is the process of creating a separate entity to persons or groups who are labelled as different or non-normal due to the repetition of characteristics. Othering is the creation of those who discriminate, to distinguish, label, categorise those who do not fit in the societal norm. Several scholars in recent decades developed the notion of the \"other\" as an epistemological concept in social theory. For example, postcolonial scholars, believed that colonising powers explained an \"other\" who were there to dominate, civilise, and extract resources through colonisation of land.\nPolitical geographers explain how colonial/imperial powers \"othered\" places they wanted to dominate to legalise their exploitation of the land. During and after the rise of colonialism the Western powers perceived the East as the \"other\", being different and separate from their societal norm. This viewpoint and separation of culture had divided the Eastern and Western culture creating a dominant/subordinate dynamic, both being the \"other\" towards themselves.\nPost-colonialism.\nPost-colonialism (or post-colonial theory) can refer to a set of theories in philosophy and literature that grapple with the legacy of colonial rule. In this sense, one can regard post-colonial literature as a branch of postmodern literature concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires.\nMany practitioners take Edward Sa\u00efd's book \"Orientalism\" (1978) as the theory's founding work (although French theorists such as Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire (1913\u20132008) and Frantz Fanon (1925\u20131961) made similar claims decades before Sa\u00efd). Sa\u00efd analyzed the works of Balzac, Baudelaire and Lautr\u00e9amont, arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority.\nWriters of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial discourse, but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" (1998) gave its name to Subaltern Studies.\nIn \"A Critique of Postcolonial Reason\" (1999), Spivak argued that major works of European metaphysics (such as those of Kant and Hegel) not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions, but actively prevent non-Europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects. Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807), famous for its explicit ethnocentrism, considers Western civilisation as the most accomplished of all, while Kant also had some traces of racialism in his work.\nThe 2014 YouGov survey found that British people are mostly proud of colonialism and the British Empire:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A new YouGov survey finds that most think the British Empire is more something to be proud of (59%) than to be ashamed of (19%). 23% don't know. Young people are least likely to feel pride over shame when it comes to the Empire, though about half (48%) of 18\u201324 year olds do. In comparison, about two-thirds (65%) of over 60s feel mostly proud. ... A third of British people (34%) also say they would like it if Britain still had an empire. Under half (45%) say they would not like the Empire to exist today. 20% don't know.\nMigrations.\nNations and regions outside Northern China with significant populations of Han Chinese ancestry:\nNations and regions outside Europe with significant populations of European ancestry\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7301", "revid": "36336112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7301", "title": "Casablanca", "text": "Largest city in Morocco\nCasablanca (, ; , ) is the largest city in Morocco and the country's economic and business centre. Located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia plain in the central-western part of Morocco, the city has a population of about 3.22 million in the urban area, and over 4.27 million in Greater Casablanca, making it the most populous city in the Maghreb region, and the ninth-largest in the Arab world.\nCasablanca is Morocco's chief port, with the Port of Casablanca being one of the largest artificial ports in Africa, and the third-largest port in North Africa, after Tanger-Med ( east of Tangier) and Port Said. Casablanca also hosts the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.\nCasablanca is a significant financial centre, ranking 54th globally in the September 2023 Global Financial Centres Index rankings, between Brussels and Rome. The Casablanca Stock Exchange is Africa's third-largest in terms of market capitalization, as of December 2022.\nMajor Moroccan companies and many of the largest American and European companies operating in the country have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show that Casablanca is the main industrial zone in the country.\nEtymology.\nAnfa.\nBefore the 15th century, the settlement at what is now Casablanca had been called \"Anfa\", rendered in European sources variously as El-Anfa, Anafa or Anaffa, Anafe, Anife, Anafee, Nafe, and Nafee. Ibn Khaldun ascribed the name to the \"Anfa\u00e7a\", a branch of the Awraba tribe of the Maghreb, though the sociologist Andr\u00e9 Adam refuted this claim due to the absence of the third syllable. Nahum Slouschz gave a Hebrew etymology, citing the \"Lexicon\" of Gesenius: \"an\u00e2ph\u00e2h\" (a type of bird) or \"anaph\" (face, figure), though Adam refuted this arguing that even a Judaized population would still have spoken Tamazight. Adam also refuted an Arabic etymology, (\"anf\", \"nose\"), as the city predated the linguistic Arabization of the country, and the term \"anf\" was not used to describe geographic areas. Adam affirmed a Tamazight etymology\u2014from \"anfa\" \"hill\", \"anfa\" \"promontory on the sea\", \"ifni\" \"sandy beach\", or \"anfa\" \"threshing floor\"\u2014although he determined the available information insufficient to establish exactly which.\nThe name \"Anfa\" was used in maps until around 1830\u2014in some until 1851\u2014which Adam attributes to the tendency of cartographers to replicate previous maps.\nCasablanca.\nWhen the \"\u02bf\"Alawi Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (c.\u20091710\u20131790) rebuilt the city after its destruction in the earthquake of 1755, it was renamed \"\"ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02be\" \" ( \"The White House\"), though in vernacular use it was pronounced \"Dar al-Bai\u1e0d\u0101\" ( literally \"House of the White,\" although in Moroccan Arabic vernacular it retains the original sense of \"The White House\").\nThe origins of the name \"Casablanca\" are unclear, although several theories have been suggested. Andr\u00e9 Adam mentions the legend of the Sufi saint and merchant Allal al-Qairawani, who supposedly came from Tunisia and settled in Casablanca with his wife Lalla al-Bai\u1e0d\u0101\u02be ( \"White Lady\"). The villagers of Mediouna would reportedly provision themselves at \"Dar al-Bai\u1e0d\u0101\u02be\" ( \"House of the White\").\nIn fact, on a low hill slightly inland above the ruins of Anfa and just to the west of today's city centre, it appears there was a white-washed structure, possibly a Sufi zawiya that acted as a landmark to sailors. The Portuguese cartographer Duarte Pacheco wrote in the early 16th century that the city could easily be identified by a tower, and nautical guides from the late 19th century still mentioned a \"white tower\" as a point of reference. The Portuguese mariners calqued the modern Arabic name to \"Casa Branca\" ( \"White House\") in place of Anfa. The name \"Casablanca\" was then a calque of the Portuguese name when the Spanish took over trade through the Iberian Union.\nDuring the French protectorate in Morocco, the name remained Casablanca (). Today, Moroccans still call the city Casablanca or \"Casa\" for short, or by its Arabic name, pronounced in Moroccan Arabic or in Standard Arabic.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe area that is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by the seventh century BC. It was used as a port by the Phoenicians, then the Romans. In his book \"Description of Africa\", Leo Africanus refers to ancient Casablanca as \"Anfa\", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744\u00a0AD. He believed Anfa was the most \"prosperous city on the Atlantic Coast because of its fertile land.\" Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068. After the defeat of the Barghawata in the 12th century, Arab tribes of Hilal and Sulaym descent settled in the region, mixing with the local Berbers, which led to widespread Arabization. During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids were ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.\nPortuguese conquest and Spanish influence.\nIn the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers. The Portuguese consequently bombarded the town into ruins in 1468. The town that grew up around it was called Casa Branca, meaning \"white house\" in Portuguese.\nThe town was finally rebuilt between 1756 and 1790 by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah, the grandson of Moulay Ismail. The town was called \"ad-D\u0101r al-Bay\u1e0d\u0101\u02bc\" (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0636\u0627\u0621), the Arabic translation of the Portuguese \"Casa Branca\".\nColonial struggle.\nIn the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, used in Morocco's national drink, mint tea). By the 1860s, around 5,000 residents were there, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s. Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in 1906. By 1921, this rose to 110,000, largely through the development of shanty towns.\nBombardment of Casablanca.\nThe Treaty of Algeciras of 1906 formalized French preeminence in Morocco and included three measures that directly impacted Casablanca: that French officers would control operations at the customs office and seize revenue as collateral for loans given by France, that the French holding company \"La Compagnie Marocaine\" would develop the port of Casablanca, and that a French-and-Spanish-trained police force would be assembled to patrol the port.\nTo build the port's breakwater, narrow-gauge track was laid in June 1907 for a small Decauville locomotive to connect the port to a quarry in Roches Noires, passing through the sacred Sidi Belyout graveyard. In resistance to this and the measures of the 1906 Treaty of Algeciras, tribesmen of the Chaouia attacked the locomotive, killing 9 Compagnie Marocaine laborers\u20143 French, 3 Italians, and 3 Spanish.\nIn response, the French bombarded the city in August 1907 with multiple gunboats and landed troops inside the town, causing severe damage and killing between 600 and 3,000 Moroccans. Estimates for the total casualties are as high as 15,000 dead and wounded. In the immediate aftermath of the bombardment and the deployment of French troops, the European homes and the \"Mellah\", or Jewish quarter, were sacked, and the latter was also set ablaze.\nAs Oujda had already been occupied, the bombardment and military invasion of the city opened a western front to the French military conquest of Morocco. \nFrench rule and influence.\nFrench control of Casablanca was formalized March 1912 when the Treaty of Fez established the French. Under French imperial control, Casablanca became a port of colonial extraction.\nRight at the beginning of the twentieth century when Morocco was officially declared a French protectorate, the French decided to shift power to Morocco's coastal areas (i.e. Rabat and Casablanca) at the expense of its interior areas (i.e. Fez and Marrakesh). Rabat was made the administrative capital of the country and Casablanca its economic capital.\nGeneral Hubert Lyautey assigned the planning of the new colonial port city to Henri Prost. As he did in other Moroccan cities, Prost designed a European outside the walls of the medina. In Casablanca, he also designed a new \"\" to house Moroccans arriving from other cities.\nEuropeans formed almost half the population of Casablanca.\nA 1937\u20131938 typhoid fever outbreak was exploited by colonial authorities to justify the appropriation of urban spaces in Casablanca. Moroccans residing in informal housing were cleared out of the center and displaced, notably to .\nWorld War II.\nAfter Philippe P\u00e9tain of France signed the armistice with the Nazis, he ordered French troops in France's colonial empire to defend French territory against any aggressors\u2014Allied or otherwise\u2014applying a policy of \"asymmetrical neutrality\" in favour of the Germans. French colonists in Morocco generally supported P\u00e9tain, while Moroccans tended to favour de Gaulle and the Allies.\nOperation Torch, which started on 8 November 1942, was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African campaign of World War II. The Western Task Force, composed of American units led by Major General George S. Patton and Rear Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt, carried out the invasions of Mehdia, Fedhala, and Asfi. American forces captured Casablanca from Vichy control when France surrendered 11 November 1942, but the Naval Battle of Casablanca continued until American forces sank German submarine U-173 on 16 November.\nCasablanca was the site of the Berrechid Airfield, a large American air base used as the staging area for all American aircraft for the European theatre of World War II. The airfield has since become Mohammed V International Airport.\nAnfa Conference.\nCasablanca hosted the Anfa Conference (also called the Casablanca Conference) in January 1943. Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war. Also in attendance were the Free France generals Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud, though they played minor roles and didn't participate in the military planning.\nIt was at this conference that the Allies adopted the doctrine of \"unconditional surrender\", meaning that the Axis powers would be fought until their defeat. Roosevelt also met privately with Sultan Muhammad V and expressed his support for Moroccan independence after the war. This became a turning point, as Moroccan nationalists were emboldened to openly seek complete independence.\nToward independence.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.\nOn 7 April 1947, a massacre of working class Moroccans, carried out by Senegalese Tirailleurs in the service of the French colonial army, was instigated just as Sultan Muhammed V was due to make a speech in Tangier appealing for independence.\nRiots in Casablanca took place from 7\u20138 December 1952, in response to the assassination of the Tunisian labor unionist Farhat Hached by \"La Main Rouge\"\u2014the clandestine militant wing of French intelligence. Then, on 25 December 1953 (Christmas Day), Muhammad Zarqtuni orchestrated a bombing of Casablanca's Central Market in response to the forced exile of Sultan Muhammad V and the royal family on 20 August (Eid al-Adha) of that year.\nSince independence.\nMorocco gained independence from France in 1956. The post-independence era witnessed significant urban transformations and socio-economic shifts, particularly in neighborhoods like Hay Mohammadi, which were deeply impacted by neoliberal policies and state-led urban redevelopment projects.\nCasablanca Group.\nOn 4\u20137 January 1961, the city hosted an ensemble of progressive African leaders during the Casablanca Conference of 1961. Among those received by King Muhammad V were Gamal Abdel Nasser, Kwame Nkrumah, Modibo Ke\u00efta, and Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, Ferhat Abbas.\nJewish emigration.\nCasablanca was a major departure point for Jews leaving Morocco through Operation Yachin, an operation conducted by Mossad to secretly migrate Moroccan Jews to Israel between November 1961 and spring 1964.\n1965 riots.\nThe 1965 student protests organized by the National Union of Popular Forces-affiliated National Union of Moroccan Students, which spread to cities around the country and devolved into riots, started on 22 March 1965, in front of Lyc\u00e9e Mohammed V in Casablanca. The protests started as a peaceful march to demand the right to public higher education for Morocco, but expanded to include concerns of labourers, the unemployed, and other marginalized segments of society, and devolved into vandalism and rioting. The riots were violently repressed by security forces with tanks and armoured vehicles; Moroccan authorities reported a dozen deaths while the UNFP reported more than 1,000. This violent suppression happened under the minister of interior Mohamed Oufkir's direction. He personally machine-gunned rioters from his helicopter.\nKing Hassan II blamed the events on teachers and parents, and declared in a speech to the nation on 30 March 1965: \"There is no greater danger to the State than a so-called intellectual. It would have been better if you were all illiterate.\"\n1981 riots.\nOn 6 June 1981, the Casablanca Bread Riots took place, which were sparked by a sharp increase in the price of necessities such as butter, sugar, wheat flour, and cooking oil following a period of severe drought. Hassan II appointed the French-trained interior minister Driss Basri as hardliner, who would later become a symbol of the Years of Lead, with quelling the protests. The government stated that 66 people were killed and 100 were injured, while opposition leaders put the number of dead at 637, saying that many of these were killed by police and army gunfire.\n\"Mudawana\".\nIn March 2000, more than 60 women's groups organized demonstrations in Casablanca proposing reforms to the legal status of women in the country. About 40,000 women attended, calling for a ban on polygamy and the introduction of divorce law (divorce being a purely religious procedure at that time). Although the counter-demonstration attracted half a million participants, the movement for change started in 2000 was influential on King Mohammed VI, and he enacted a new \"mudawana\", or family law, in early 2004, meeting some of the demands of women's rights activists.\nFurther history.\nOn 16 May 2003, 33 civilians were killed and more than 100 people were injured when Casablanca was hit by a multiple suicide bomb attack carried out by Moroccans and claimed by some to have been linked to al-Qaeda. Twelve suicide bombers struck five locations in the city.\nAnother series of suicide bombings struck the city in early 2007. These events illustrated some of the persistent challenges the city faces in addressing poverty and integrating disadvantaged neighborhoods and populations. One initiative to improve conditions in the city's disadvantaged neighborhoods was the creation of the Sidi Moumen Cultural Center.\nAs calls for reform spread through the Arab world in 2011, Moroccans joined in, but concessions by the ruler led to acceptance. However, in December, thousands of people demonstrated in several parts of the city, especially the city center near la Fontaine, desiring more significant political reforms. On 1 November 2023, Casablanca along with Ouarzazate joined UNESCO's Creative Cities Network.\nGeography.\nCasablanca is located on the Atlantic coast of the Chaouia Plains, which have historically been the breadbasket of Morocco. Apart from the Atlantic coast, the Bouskoura forest is the only natural attraction in the city. The forest was planted in the 20th century and consists mostly of eucalyptus, palm, and pine trees. It is located halfway to the city's international airport.\nThe only watercourse in Casablanca is \"oued Bouskoura\", a small seasonal creek that until 1912 reached the Atlantic Ocean near the actual port. Most of oued Bouskoura's bed has been covered due to urbanization and only the part south of El Jadida road can now be seen. The closest permanent river to Casablanca is Oum Rabia, to the south-east.\nNeighborhood.\nThe list of neighborhoods is indicative and not complete:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nClimate.\nCasablanca has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Csa\"). The cool Canary Current off the Atlantic coast moderates temperature variation, which results in a climate remarkably similar to that of coastal Los Angeles, with similar temperature ranges. The city has an annual average of 72 days with significant precipitation, which amounts to per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are and , respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is on 30 November 2010.\nClimate change.\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Casablanca in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Tripoli, Libya. The annual temperature would increase by , and the temperature of the warmest month by , while the temperature of the coldest month would actually decrease by .\nMoreover, according to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Casablanca is one of 12 major African cities (Abidjan, Alexandria, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lom\u00e9, Luanda and Maputo) which would be the most severely affected by future sea level rise. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages, while the additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.\nEconomy.\nThe Grand Casablanca region is considered the locomotive of the development of the Moroccan economy. It attracts 32% of the country's production units and 56% of industrial labor. The region uses 30% of the national electricity production. With MAD 93\u00a0billion, the region contributes to 44% of the industrial production of the kingdom. About 33% of national industrial exports, MAD 27\u00a0billion, comes from the Grand Casablanca; 30% of the Moroccan banking network is concentrated in Casablanca.\nOne of the most important exports of Casablanca is phosphate. Other industries include fishing, fish canning, sawmills, furniture production, building materials, glass, textiles, electronics, leather work, processed food, spirits, soft drinks, and cigarettes.\nThe Casablanca and Mohammedia seaports activity represent 50% of the international commercial flows of Morocco. Almost the entire Casablanca waterfront is under development, mainly the construction of huge entertainment centres between the port and Hassan II Mosque, the Anfa Resort project near the business, entertainment and living centre of Megarama, the shopping and entertainment complex of Morocco Mall, as well as a complete renovation of the coastal walkway. The Sindbad park was also renewed with rides, games and entertainment services.\nCasablanca is a significant financial centre, ranking 54th globally in the September 2023 Global Financial Centres Index rankings, between Brussels and Rome. The Casablanca Stock Exchange is Africa's third-largest in terms of market capitalization, as of December 2022.\nRoyal Air Maroc has its head office at the previous Casablanca-Anfa Airport location. In 2004, it announced that it was moving its head office from Casablanca to a location in Province of Nouaceur, close to Mohammed V International Airport. The agreement to build the head office in Nouaceur was signed in 2009 but was never implemented.\nAdministration and Politics.\nCasablanca is a municipality that is part of the Casablanca-Settat region.\nThe municipality is divided into 16 districts (arrondissements).\nMunicipality.\nThe responsibilities of the Casablanca municipality include :\nMayor.\nThe Mayor of Casablanca is the head of the Casablanca municipality. He controls the Casablanca municipality administration.\nThe Mayor :\nCity Council.\nThe Mayor is accountable to the City Council, who represents a total of 100 to 130 elected citizens from every Casablanca neighborhood.\nThe City Council meets each year during the months of February, may and October. These 3 meetings are mandatory according to Moroccan law.\nThe council members are informed 10 days before the meetings.\nApart from these 3 sessions, the council can also be summoned by:\nAt the end of every council session, a record of the votes must be preserved by a Secretary.\n16 Districts (arrondissements).\nThe municipality of Casablanca is divided into 16 local districts (\"arrondissements\").\nAccording to Moroccan law, the main responsibilities of the districts include:\nEach year, the 16 districts all receive a small budget from the municipality of Casablanca. However, they each determine how to use that budget. Each district has a President who is accountable to 15 to 20 district council members.\nExample: \"The President of Anfa is accountable to the Council of Anfa. Only people living in Anfa can vote for the Anfa council.\"\nEach of the 16 local councils meets 3 times a year, in January, June, and September.\nThese 3 meetings are mandatory and generally open to the public.\nThe President of the 16 Districts can ask the Mayor of Casablanca to give them special powers.\nPrefectures.\nCasablanca is divided into 8 prefectures. Each prefecture is led by a Governor who is appointed by the Moroccan government.\nA governor typically oversees 2 or 3 districts.\n\"Example: The Governor of Prefecture de Casablanca-Anfa oversees Anfa, Sidi Belyout and Maarif.\"\nGovernors can cancel decisions voted by a council if the proper legal procedures were not respected. They can also ask a judge to remove a District President from office if there is evidence he doesn't show up at council meetings.\nDemographics.\nThe commune of Casablanca recorded a population of 3,359,818 in the 2014 Moroccan census. About 98% live in urban areas. Around 25% of the population are under 15 years old, and 9% are over 60 years old. The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is the largest urban area in the Maghreb. 99.9% of the population of Morocco are Arab and Berber Muslims. During the French protectorate in Morocco, European Christians formed almost half the population of Casablanca. Since Moroccan independence in 1956, the European population has decreased substantially. The city also is still home to a small community of Moroccan Christians, as well as a small group of foreign Roman Catholic and Protestant residents.\nJudaism in Casablanca.\nJews have a long history in Casablanca. A Sephardic Jewish community was in Anfa up to the destruction of the city by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750, the Rabbi Elijah synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\nIn the mid-19th century, with commercial development through European economic penetration, industrial imports from Europe drove traditional Jewish crafts out of the market, costing many Jews in the interior their traditional livelihoods. Moroccan Jews started migrating from the interior to coastal cities such as Essaouira, Mazagan, Asfi, and later Casablanca for economic opportunity, participating in trade with Europeans and the development of those cities.\nCasablanca's \"mellah\" was ravaged in the bombardment of Casablanca of 1907, the beginning of the French invasion of Morocco from the West.\nJean-Louis Cohen highlights the role of Jewish patrons in the architecture and urban development of Casablanca, particularly in construction of the overwhelming majority of the city's tallest buildings during the interwar period.\"\" One notable example of this trend is the L\u00e9vy-Bendayan Building designed by Marius Boyer.\"\"\nApproximately 28,000 Moroccan Jews immigrated to the State of Israel between 1948 and 1951, many through Casablanca. Casablanca then became a departure point in Operation Yachin, the covert Mossad-organized migration operation from 1961 to 1964. In 1956 there were 100,000 Jews registered in Casablanca. In 2018 it was estimated that there were only 2,500 Moroccan Jews living in Casablanca, while according to the World Jewish Congress there were only 1,000 Moroccan Jews remaining.\nToday, the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city, and many synagogues remain in service, but the city's Jewish community has dwindled. The Moroccan Jewish Museum is a museum established in the city in 1997.\nEducation.\nColleges and universities.\nPublic: \nPrivate:\nPrimary and secondary schools.\nInternational schools:\nPlaces of worship.\nMost of the city's places of worship are Muslim mosques. Some of the city's synagogues, such as Ettedgui Synagogue, also remain. There are also Christian churches; some remain in use \u2014 particularly by the West African migrant community \u2014 while many of the churches built during the colonial period have been repurposed, such as Church of the Sacred Heart.\nSports.\nAssociation football.\nCasablanca is home to two popular football clubs: Wydad Casablanca and Raja Casablanca\u2014which are rivals. Raja's symbol is an eagle and Wydad's symbol is a star and crescent, a symbol of Islam. These two popular clubs have produced some of Morocco's best players, such as: Salaheddine Bassir, Abdelmajid Dolmy, Baddou Zaki, Aziz Bouderbala, and Noureddine Naybet. Other football teams on top of these two major teams based in the city of Casablanca include Rachad Bernoussi, TAS de Casablanca, Majd Al Madina, and Racing Casablanca.\nRaja CA, founded in 1949, compete in Botola and play their home games at the Stade Mohammed V. The club is known for their supporters and is one of the most supported teams in Africa. Wydad AC, founded in 1937, also compete in Botola and play their home games at the Stade Mohammed V. Both have a strong reputation on continental competitions, having both won the CAF Champions League three times.\nCasablanca hosted eight African Champions League finals, all eight at the Stade Mohammed V. The Stade also hosted the 2018 CHAN Final (which Morocco won) and 1988 African Cup of Nations final. It could potentially host matches for the 2030 FIFA World Cup including the final.\nTennis.\nCasablanca hosts The Grand Prix Hassan II, a professional men's tennis tournament of the ATP tour.\nHosting.\nCasablanca staged the 1961 Pan Arab Games, the 1983 Mediterranean Games, and games during the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations. Morocco was scheduled to host the 2015 African Nations Cup, but decided to decline due to Ebola fears. Morocco will host the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.\nVenues.\nThe Hassan II Stadium is the planned football stadium to be built in the city. Once completed in 2025, it will be used mostly for football matches and will serve as the home of Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, and the Morocco national football team. The stadium was designed with a capacity of 93,000 spectators, making it one of the highest-capacity stadiums in Africa. Once completed, it will replace the Stade Mohamed V. The initial idea of the stadium was for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to South Africa. Nevertheless, the Moroccan government supported the decision to go ahead with the plans. It will be completed in 2025. The idea of the stadium was also for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, for which Morocco lost their bid to Canada, Mexico and United States. It will now host the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Morocco will co-host with two European nations Spain and Portugal. It is expected to be complete by 2028.\nRoad Racing.\nThe city is host to the International Casablanca Marathon, a 26.2-mile road race that draws international competition.

Gabriel Veyre also worked and eventually died in Casablanca.\nMarcelin Flandrin (1889\u20131957), a French military photographer, settled in Casablanca and recorded much of the early colonial period in Morocco with his photography. With his staged nude postcard photos taken in Casablanca's colonial brothel quarter, Flandrin was also responsible for disseminating the orientalist image of Moroccan women as sexual objects.\nCasablanca has a thriving street photography scene. Yoriyas is prominent among photographers capturing the economic capital's street scenes, and has attracted international attention.\nFilm.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Casablanca had many movie theaters, such as Cinema Rialto, Cinema Lynx and Cinema Vox, the largest in Africa when it was built.\nThe 1942 American film \"Casablanca\" is set in Casablanca and has had a lasting impact on the city's image although it was filmed in the United States.

Ahmed El Maanouni, Hicham Lasri and Said Naciri are also from Casablanca.\nArchitecture.\nCasablanca's architecture and urban development are historically significant. The city is home to many notable buildings in a variety of styles, including traditional Moroccan architecture, various colonial architectural styles, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Neo-Mauresque, Streamline Moderne, Modernism, Brutalism, and more. During the French Protectorate, the French government described Casablanca as a \"laboratory of urbanism\".\nThe work of the \"Groupe des Architectes Modernes Marocains\" (GAMMA) on public housing projects\u2014such as Carri\u00e8res Centrales in Hay Mohammadi\u2014in a style described as vernacular modernism influenced modernist architecture around the world.\nCasam\u00e9moire and MAMMA. are two organizations dedicated to the preservation and appreciation of the city's architectural heritage.\nTransport.\nRapid transit.\nThe Casablanca Tramway is the rapid transit tram system in Casablanca. As of 2024, the network consists of four lines covering , with 110 stops.\nCasablanca has also implemented a rapid bus transit system known as the Casablanca Busway, a high-level bus network serving the city. As of 2024, the network consists of two lines, BW1 and BW2.\nSince the 1970s, Casablanca had planned to build a metro system to offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. However, the city council voted to abandon the metro project in 2014 due to high costs, and decided to continue expanding the already operating tram system instead.\n\"Compagnie de Transports au Maroc\" (CTM) offers private intercity coach buses on various lines run servicing most notable Moroccan towns, as well as a number of European cities. These run from the CTM Bus Station on Leo Africanus Street near the Central Market in downtown Casablanca. Supratours, an affiliate of ONCF, also offers coach bus service at a slightly lower cost, departing from a station on Wilad Zian Street. There is another bus station farther down on the same street called the Wilad Zian Bus Station; this station is the country's largest bus station, serving over 800 buses daily, catering more to Morocco's lower income population.\nTourism.\nAlthough Mohammed V International Airport receives most international flights into Morocco, international tourism in Casablanca is not as developed as it is in cities such as Fez and Marrakesh.\nThe Hassan II Mosque, which is the second largest mosque in Africa and the seventh-largest in the world, is the city's main tourist attraction. Visitors also come to see the city's rich architectural heritage.\nPopular sites for national tourism include shopping centers such as Morocco Mall, Anfa Place, the Marina Shopping Center, and the Tachfine Center. Additional sites include the Corniche and the beach of Ain Diab, and parks such as the Arab League Park or the Sindibad theme park.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nCasablanca is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCasablanca also has cooperation agreements with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7303", "revid": "47023628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7303", "title": "Cross", "text": "Geometrical figure\nThe cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other. The lines usually run vertically and horizontally. A cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter X, is also termed a saltire in heraldic terminology. Throughout centuries the cross in its various shapes and forms was a symbol of various beliefs. \nThe cross has been widely taken as an official symbol of the Christian faith exclusively from an early period in that religion's history to present. In pre-Christian times, it was used as a religious or cultural symbol throughout Europe, in west and south Asia (the latter, in the form of the original swastika); and in Ancient Egypt, where the Ankh was a hieroglyph that represented \"life\" and was used in the worship of the god Aten. It often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital circle or oval to signify the sacred marriage, as in the Egyptian amulet Nefer, which features the male cross and female orb, considered an amulet of blessedness and a charm of sexual harmony.\nName.\nThe word \"cross\" is recorded in 11th-century Old English as \"cros\", exclusively for the instrument of Christ's crucifixion, replacing the native Old English word \"rood\". The word's history is complicated; it appears to have entered English from Old Irish, possibly via Old Norse, ultimately from the Latin (or its accusative and its genitive ), \"stake, cross\". The English verb \"to cross\" arises from the noun c.\u20091200, first in the sense \"to make the sign of the cross\"; the generic meaning \"to intersect\" develops in the 15th century. The Latin word was influenced by popular etymology by a native Germanic word reconstructed as *\"krukjo\" (English \"crook\", Old English , Old Norse , Old High German ). This word, by conflation with Latin , gave rise to Old French (modern French ), the term for a shepherd's crook, adopted in English as \"crosier\".\nLatin referred to the gibbet where criminals were executed, a stake or pole, with or without transom, on which the condemned were impaled or hanged, but more particularly a cross or the pole of a carriage. The derived verb means \"to put to death on the cross\" or, more frequently, \"to put to the rack, to torture, torment\", especially in reference to mental troubles.\n In the Roman world, replaced as the name of some cross-like instruments for lethal and temporary punishment, ranging from a forked cross to a gibbet or gallows.\nThe field of etymology is of no help in any effort to trace a supposed original meaning of \"crux\". A \"crux\" can be of various shapes: from a single beam used for impaling or suspending () to the various composite kinds of cross () made from more beams than one. The latter shapes include not only the traditional \u2020-shaped cross (the ), but also the T-shaped cross (the or tau cross), which the descriptions in antiquity of the execution cross indicate as the normal form in use at that time, and the X-shaped cross (the \"crux decussata\" or saltire).\nThe Greek equivalent of Latin \"crux\" \"stake, gibbet\" is , found in texts of four centuries or more before the gospels and always in the plural number to indicate a stake or pole. From the first century BC, it is used to indicate an instrument used in executions. The Greek word is used in descriptions in antiquity of the execution cross, which indicate that its normal shape was similar to the Greek letter tau (\u03a4).\nHistory.\nPre-Christian.\nDue to the simplicity of the design (two intersecting lines), cross-shaped incisions make their appearance from deep prehistory; as petroglyphs in European cult caves, dating back to the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, and throughout prehistory to the Iron Age.\nAlso of prehistoric age are numerous variants of the simple cross mark, including the \"crux gammata\" with curving or angular lines, and the Egyptian \"crux ansata\" with a loop.\nSpeculation has associated the cross symbol \u2013 even in the prehistoric period \u2013 with astronomical or cosmological symbology involving\n\"four elements\" (Chevalier, 1997) or the cardinal points, or the unity of a vertical axis mundi or celestial pole with the horizontal world (Koch, 1955). Speculation of this kind became especially popular in the mid- to late-19th century in the context of comparative mythology seeking to tie Christian mythology to ancient cosmological myths. Influential works in this vein included\nG. de Mortillet (1866), L. M\u00fcller (1865), W. W. Blake (1888), Ansault (1891), etc.\nIn the European Bronze Age the cross symbol appeared to carry a religious meaning, perhaps as a symbol of consecration, especially pertaining to burial.\nThe cross sign occurs trivially in tally marks, and develops into a number symbol independently in the Roman numerals (X \"ten\"), the Chinese rod numerals (\u5341 \"ten\") and the Brahmi numerals (\"four\", whence the numeral 4).\nIn the Phoenician alphabet and derived scripts, the cross symbol represented the phoneme /t/, i.e. the letter taw, which is the historical predecessor of Latin T. The letter name \"taw\" means \"mark\", presumably continuing the Egyptian hieroglyph \"two crossed sticks\" (Gardiner Z9).\nPost-Christian.\nThe shape of the cross (\"crux\", \"stauros\" \"stake, gibbet\"), as represented by the Latin letter T, came to be used as a new symbol (seal) or emblem of Christianity since the 2nd century AD to succeeding Ichthys in aftermaths of that new religion's separation from Judaism. Clement of Alexandria in the early 3rd century calls it (\"the Lord's sign\") he repeats the idea, current as early as the Epistle of Barnabas, that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, \u03a4\u0399\u0397) in Genesis 14:14 was a foreshadowing (a \"type\") of the cross (the letter Tau) and of Jesus (the letters Iota Eta). Clement's contemporary Tertullian rejects the accusation that Christians are \"crucis religiosi\" (i.e. \"adorers of the gibbet\"), and returns the accusation by likening the worship of pagan idols to the worship of poles or stakes.\nIn his book \"De Corona\", written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.\nWhile early Christians used the T-shape to represent the cross in writing and gesture, the use of the Greek cross and Latin cross, i.e. crosses with intersecting beams, appears in Christian art towards the end of Late Antiquity. An early example of the cruciform halo, used to identify Christ in paintings, is found in the \"Miracles of the Loaves and Fishes\" mosaic of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (6th century). The Patriarchal cross, a Latin cross with an additional horizontal bar, first appears in the 10th century. A wide variation of cross symbols is introduced for the purposes of heraldry beginning in the age of the Crusades.\nMarks and graphemes.\nThe cross mark is used to mark a position, or as a check mark, but also to mark deletion.\nDerived from Greek Chi are the Latin letter X, Cyrillic Kha and possibly runic Gyfu.\nEgyptian hieroglyphs involving cross shapes include \"ankh\" \"life\", \"ndj\" \"protect\" and \"nfr\" \"good; pleasant, beautiful\".\nSumerian cuneiform had a simple cross-shaped character, consisting of a horizontal and a vertical wedge (\ud808\ude26), read as \"ma\u0161\" \"tax, yield, interest\"; the superposition of two diagonal wedges results in a decussate cross (\ud808\ude7d), read as \"pap\" \"first, pre-eminent\" (the superposition of these two types of crosses results in the eight-pointed star used as the sign for \"sky\" or \"deity\" (\ud808\udc2d), DINGIR). The cuneiform script has other, more complex, cruciform characters, consisting of an arrangement of boxes or the fourfold arrangement of other characters, including the archaic cuneiform characters LAK-210, LAK-276, LAK-278, LAK-617 and the classical sign EZEN (\ud808\udca1).\nPhoenician \"t\u0101w\" is still cross-shaped in Paleo-Hebrew alphabet and in some Old Italic scripts (Raetic and Lepontic), and its descendant T becomes again cross-shaped in the Latin minuscule t. The plus sign (+) is derived from Latin t via a simplification of a ligature for \"et\" \"and\" (introduced by Johannes Widmann in the late 15th century).\nThe letter Aleph is cross-shaped in Aramaic and paleo-Hebrew.\nEgyptian hieroglyphs with cross-shapes include Gardiner Z9 \u2013 Z11 (\"crossed sticks\", \"crossed planks\").\nOther, unrelated cross-shaped letters include Brahmi \"ka\" (predecessor of the Devanagari letter \u0915) and Old Turkic (Orkhon) \"d\u00b2\" and Old Hungarian \"b\", and Katakana \u30ca \"na\" and \u30e1 \"me\".\nThe multiplication sign (\u00d7), often attributed to William Oughtred (who first used it in an appendix to the 1618 edition of John Napier's \"Descriptio\") apparently had been in occasional use since the mid 16th century.\nOther typographical symbols resembling crosses include the dagger or \"obelus\" (\u2020), the Chinese (\u5341, Kangxi radical 24) and Roman (X ten).\nUnicode has a variety of cross symbols in the \"Dingbat\" block (U+2700\u2013U+27BF):\nThe Miscellaneous Symbols block (U+2626 to U+262F) adds three specific Christian cross variants, viz. the Patriarchal cross (\u2626), Cross of Lorraine (\u2628) and Cross potent (\u2629, mistakenly labeled a \"Cross of Jerusalem\").\nEmblems.\nThe following is a list of cross symbols, \"except\" for variants of the Christian cross and Heraldic crosses, for which see the dedicated lists at Christian cross variants and Crosses in heraldry, respectively.\nPhysical gestures.\nCross shapes are made by a variety of physical gestures. Crossing the fingers of one hand is a common invocation of the symbol. The sign of the cross associated with Christian genuflection is made with one hand: in Eastern Orthodox tradition the sequence is head-heart-right shoulder-left shoulder, while in Oriental Orthodox, Catholic and Anglican tradition the sequence is head-heart-left-right.\nCrossing the index fingers of both hands represents and a charm against evil in European folklore. Other gestures involving more than one hand include the \"cross my heart\" movement associated with making a promise and the Tau shape of the referee's \"time out\" hand signal.\nCrossed index fingers represent the number 10 (\u5341) in Chinese number gestures.\nUnicode.\nUnicode provides various cross symbols:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7304", "revid": "24465790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7304", "title": "Coordination complex", "text": "Molecule or ion containing ligands datively bonded to a central metallic atom\nA coordination complex is a chemical compound consisting of a central atom or ion, which is usually metallic and is called the \"coordination centre\", and a surrounding array of bound molecules or ions, that are in turn known as \"ligands\" or complexing agents. Many metal-containing compounds, especially those that include transition metals (elements like titanium that belong to the periodic table's d-block), are coordination complexes.\nNomenclature and terminology.\nCoordination complexes are so pervasive that their structures and reactions are described in many ways, sometimes confusingly. The atom within a ligand that is bonded to the central metal atom or ion is called the donor atom. In a typical complex, a metal ion is bonded to several donor atoms, which can be the same or different. A polydentate (multiple bonded) ligand is a molecule or ion that bonds to the central atom through several of the ligand's atoms; ligands with 2, 3, 4 or even 6 bonds to the central atom are common. These complexes are called chelate complexes; the formation of such complexes is called chelation, complexation, and coordination.\nThe central atom or ion, together with all ligands, comprise the coordination sphere. The central atoms or ion and the donor atoms comprise the first coordination sphere.\nCoordination refers to the \"coordinate covalent bonds\" (dipolar bonds) between the ligands and the central atom. Originally, a complex implied a reversible association of molecules, atoms, or ions through such weak chemical bonds. As applied to coordination chemistry, this meaning has evolved. Some metal complexes are formed virtually irreversibly and many are bound together by bonds that are quite strong.\nThe number of donor atoms attached to the central atom or ion is called the coordination number. The most common coordination numbers are 2, 4, and especially 6. A hydrated ion is one kind of a complex ion (or simply a complex), a species formed between a central metal ion and one or more surrounding ligands, molecules or ions that contain at least one lone pair of electrons.\nIf all the ligands are monodentate, then the number of donor atoms equals the number of ligands. For example, the cobalt(II) hexahydrate ion or the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion\u00a0[Co(H2O)6]2+ is a hydrated-complex ion that consists of six water molecules attached to a metal ion\u00a0Co. The oxidation state and the coordination number reflect the number of bonds formed between the metal ion and the ligands in the complex ion. However, the coordination number of\u00a0Pt(en) is 4 (rather than 2) since it has two bidentate ligands, which contain four donor atoms in total.\nAny donor atom will give a pair of electrons. There are some donor atoms or groups which can offer more than one pair of electrons. Such are called bidentate (offers two pairs of electrons) or polydentate (offers more than two pairs of electrons). In some cases an atom or a group offers a pair of electrons to two similar or different central metal atoms or acceptors\u2014by division of the electron pair\u2014into a three-center two-electron bond. These are called bridging ligands.\nHistory.\nCoordination complexes have been known since the beginning of modern chemistry. Early well-known coordination complexes include dyes such as Prussian blue. Their properties were first well understood in the late 1800s, following the 1869 work of Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand. Blomstrand developed what has come to be known as the \"complex ion chain theory.\" In considering metal amine complexes, he theorized that the ammonia molecules compensated for the charge of the ion by forming chains of the type [(NH3)X]X+, where X is the coordination number of the metal ion. He compared his theoretical ammonia chains to hydrocarbons of the form (CH2)X.\nFollowing this theory, Danish scientist Sophus Mads J\u00f8rgensen made improvements to it. In his version of the theory, J\u00f8rgensen claimed that when a molecule dissociates in a solution there were two possible outcomes: the ions would bind via the ammonia chains Blomstrand had described or the ions would bind directly to the metal.\nIt was not until 1893 that the most widely accepted version of the theory today was published by Alfred Werner. Werner's work included two important changes to the Blomstrand theory. The first was that Werner described the two possibilities in terms of location in the coordination sphere. He claimed that if the ions were to form a chain, this would occur outside of the coordination sphere while the ions that bound directly to the metal would do so within the coordination sphere. In one of his most important discoveries however Werner disproved the majority of the chain theory. Werner discovered the spatial arrangements of the ligands that were involved in the formation of the complex hexacoordinate cobalt. His theory allows one to understand the difference between a coordinated ligand and a charge balancing ion in a compound, for example the chloride ion in the cobaltammine chlorides and to explain many of the previously inexplicable isomers.\nIn 1911, Werner first resolved the cobalt/ammonia coordination complex hexol into optical isomers, overthrowing the theory that only carbon compounds could possess chirality.\nStructures.\nThe ions or molecules surrounding the central atom are called ligands. Ligands are classified as L or X (or a combination thereof), depending on how many electrons they provide for the bond between ligand and central atom. L ligands provide two electrons from a lone electron pair, resulting in a coordinate covalent bond. X ligands provide one electron, with the central atom providing the other electron, thus forming a regular covalent bond. The ligands are said to be coordinated to the atom. For alkenes, the pi bonds can coordinate to metal atoms. An example is ethylene in the complex (Zeise's salt).\nGeometry.\nIn coordination chemistry, a structure is first described by its coordination number, the number of ligands attached to the metal (more specifically, the number of donor atoms). Usually one can count the ligands attached, but sometimes even the counting can become ambiguous. Coordination numbers are normally between two and nine, but large numbers of ligands are not uncommon for the lanthanides and actinides. The number of bonds depends on the size, charge, and electron configuration of the metal ion and the ligands. Metal ions may have more than one coordination number.\nTypically the chemistry of transition metal complexes is dominated by interactions between s and p molecular orbitals of the donor-atoms in the ligands and the d orbitals of the metal ions. The s, p, and d orbitals of the metal can accommodate 18 electrons (see 18-Electron rule). The maximum coordination number for a certain metal is thus related to the electronic configuration of the metal ion (to be more specific, the number of empty orbitals) and to the ratio of the size of the ligands and the metal ion. Large metals and small ligands lead to high coordination numbers, e.g. . Small metals with large ligands lead to low coordination numbers, e.g. . Due to their large size, lanthanides, actinides, and early transition metals tend to have high coordination numbers.\nMost structures follow the points-on-a-sphere pattern (or, as if the central atom were in the middle of a polyhedron where the corners of that shape are the locations of the ligands), where orbital overlap (between ligand and metal orbitals) and ligand-ligand repulsions tend to lead to certain regular geometries. The most observed geometries are listed below, but there are many cases that deviate from a regular geometry, e.g. due to the use of ligands of diverse types (which results in irregular bond lengths; the coordination atoms do not follow a points-on-a-sphere pattern), due to the size of ligands, or due to electronic effects (see, e.g., Jahn\u2013Teller distortion):\nThe idealized descriptions of 5-, 7-, 8-, and 9- coordination are often indistinct geometrically from alternative structures with slightly differing L-M-L (ligand-metal-ligand) angles, e.g. the difference between square pyramidal and trigonal bipyramidal structures.\nTo distinguish between the alternative coordinations for five-coordinated complexes, the \u03c4 geometry index was invented by Addison et al. This index depends on angles by the coordination center and changes between 0 for the square pyramidal to 1 for trigonal bipyramidal structures, allowing to classify the cases in between. This system was later extended to four-coordinated complexes by Houser et al. and also Okuniewski et al.\nIn systems with low d electron count, due to special electronic effects such as (second-order) Jahn\u2013Teller stabilization, certain geometries (in which the coordination atoms do not follow a points-on-a-sphere pattern) are stabilized relative to the other possibilities, e.g. for some compounds the trigonal prismatic geometry is stabilized relative to octahedral structures for six-coordination.\nStereochemistry.\nMany kinds of isomerism exist in coordination complexes. Just as in organic chemistry, isomers are of two types: diastereomers (also called diastereoisomers) and enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. Diastereomers are all other types of isomers.\nCis\u2013trans isomerism and facial\u2013meridional isomerism.\nCis\u2013trans isomerism occurs in octahedral and square planar complexes (but not tetrahedral). When two ligands are adjacent they are said to be cis, when\nopposite each other, trans. When three identical ligands occupy one face of an octahedron, the isomer is said to be facial, or fac. In a \"fac\" isomer, any two identical ligands are adjacent or \"cis\" to each other. If these three ligands and the metal ion are in one plane, the isomer is said to be meridional, or mer. A \"mer\" isomer can be considered as a combination of a \"trans\" and a \"cis\", since it contains both trans and cis pairs of identical ligands.\nOptical isomerism.\nOptical isomerism occurs when a complex is not superimposable with its mirror image. It is so called because the two isomers are each optically active, that is, they rotate the plane of polarized light in opposite directions. In the first molecule shown, the symbol \u039b (\"lambda\") is used as a prefix to describe the left-handed propeller twist formed by three bidentate ligands. The second molecule is the mirror image of the first, with the symbol \u0394 (\"delta\") as a prefix for the right-handed propeller twist. The third and fourth molecules are a similar pair of \u039b and \u0394 isomers, in this case with two bidentate ligands and two identical monodentate ligands.\nOther kinds of isomerism.\nStructural isomerism occurs when the bonds are themselves different. Four types of structural isomerism are recognized: ionisation isomerism, solvate or hydrate isomerism, linkage isomerism and coordination isomerism.\nElectronic properties.\nMany of the properties of transition metal complexes are dictated by their electronic structures. The electronic structure can be described by a relatively ionic model that ascribes formal charges to the metals and ligands. This approach is the essence of crystal field theory (CFT). Crystal field theory, introduced by Hans Bethe in 1929, gives a quantum mechanically based attempt at understanding complexes. But crystal field theory treats all interactions in a complex as ionic and assumes that the ligands can be approximated by negative point charges.\nMore sophisticated models embrace covalency, and this approach is described by ligand field theory (LFT) and molecular orbital theory (MO). Ligand field theory, introduced in 1935 and built from molecular orbital theory, can handle a broader range of complexes and can explain complexes in which the interactions are covalent. The chemical applications of group theory can aid in the understanding of crystal or ligand field theory, by allowing simple, symmetry based solutions to the formal equations.\nChemists tend to employ the simplest model required to predict the properties of interest; for this reason, CFT has been a favorite for the discussions when possible. MO and LF theories are more complicated, but provide a more realistic perspective.\nThe electronic configuration of the complexes gives them some important properties:\nColor of transition metal complexes.\nTransition metal complexes often have spectacular colors caused by electronic transitions by the absorption of light. For this reason they are often applied as pigments. Most transitions that are related to colored metal complexes are either d\u2013d transitions or charge transfer bands. In a d\u2013d transition, an electron in a d\u00a0orbital on the metal is excited by a photon to another d orbital of higher energy, therefore d\u2013d transitions occur only for partially-filled d-orbital complexes (d1\u20139). For complexes having d0 or d10 configuration, charge transfer is still possible even though d\u2013d transitions are not. A charge transfer band entails promotion of an electron from a metal-based orbital into an empty ligand-based orbital (metal-to-ligand charge transfer or MLCT). The converse also occurs: excitation of an electron in a ligand-based orbital into an empty metal-based orbital (ligand-to-metal charge transfer or LMCT). These phenomena can be observed with the aid of electronic spectroscopy; also known as UV-Vis. For simple compounds with high symmetry, the d\u2013d transitions can be assigned using Tanabe\u2013Sugano diagrams. These assignments are gaining increased support with computational chemistry.\nColors of lanthanide complexes.\nSuperficially lanthanide complexes are similar to those of the transition metals in that some are colored. However, for the common Ln3+ ions (Ln = lanthanide) the colors are all pale, and hardly influenced by the nature of the ligand. The colors are due to 4f electron transitions. As the 4f orbitals in lanthanides are \"buried\" in the xenon core and shielded from the ligand by the 5s and 5p orbitals they are therefore not influenced by the ligands to any great extent leading to a much smaller crystal field splitting than in the transition metals. The absorption spectra of an Ln3+ ion approximates to that of the free ion where the electronic states are described by spin-orbit coupling. This contrasts to the transition metals where the ground state is split by the crystal field. Absorptions for Ln3+ are weak as electric dipole transitions are parity forbidden (Laporte forbidden) but can gain intensity due to the effect of a low-symmetry ligand field or mixing with higher electronic states (\"e.g.\" d orbitals). f-f absorption bands are extremely sharp which contrasts with those observed for transition metals which generally have broad bands. This can lead to extremely unusual effects, such as significant color changes under different forms of lighting.\nMagnetism.\nMetal complexes that have unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. This can be due to an odd number of electrons overall, or to incomplete electron-pairing. Thus, monomeric Ti(III) species have one \"d-electron\" and must be (para)magnetic, regardless of the geometry or the nature of the ligands. Ti(II), with two d-electrons, forms some complexes that have two unpaired electrons and others with none. This effect is illustrated by the compounds TiX2[(CH3)2PCH2CH2P(CH3)2]2: when X\u00a0=\u00a0Cl, the complex is paramagnetic (high-spin configuration), whereas when X\u00a0=\u00a0CH3, it is diamagnetic (low-spin configuration). Ligands provide an important means of adjusting the ground state properties.\nIn bi- and polymetallic complexes, in which the individual centres have an odd number of electrons or that are high-spin, the situation is more complicated. If there is interaction (either direct or through ligand) between the two (or more) metal centres, the electrons may couple (antiferromagnetic coupling, resulting in a diamagnetic compound), or they may enhance each other (ferromagnetic coupling). When there is no interaction, the two (or more) individual metal centers behave as if in two separate molecules.\nReactivity.\nComplexes show a variety of possible reactivities:\nIf the ligands around the metal are carefully chosen, the metal can aid in (stoichiometric or catalytic) transformations of molecules or be used as a sensor.\nClassification.\nMetal complexes, also known as coordination compounds, include virtually all metal compounds. The study of \"coordination chemistry\" is the study of \"inorganic chemistry\" of all alkali and alkaline earth metals, transition metals, lanthanides, actinides, and metalloids. Thus, coordination chemistry is the chemistry of the majority of the periodic table. Metals and metal ions exist, in the condensed phases at least, only surrounded by ligands.\nThe areas of coordination chemistry can be classified according to the nature of the ligands, in broad terms:\n Examples: [Co(EDTA)]\u2212, [Co(NH3)6]3+, [Fe(C2O4)3]3-\n Example: (C5H5)Fe(CO)2CH3\n Example: hemoglobin contains heme, a porphyrin complex of iron\n Example: chlorophyll contains a porphyrin complex of magnesium\n Many natural ligands are \"classical\" especially including water.\n Example Ru3(CO)12\nExample: [Fe4S4(Scysteinyl)4]2\u2212, in which a cluster is embedded in a biologically active species.\nMineralogy, materials science, and solid state chemistry\u00a0\u2013 as they apply to metal ions\u00a0\u2013 are subsets of coordination chemistry in the sense that the metals are surrounded by ligands. In many cases these ligands are oxides or sulfides, but the metals are coordinated nonetheless, and the principles and guidelines discussed below apply. In hydrates, at least some of the ligands are water molecules. It is true that the focus of mineralogy, materials science, and solid state chemistry differs from the usual focus of coordination or inorganic chemistry. The former are concerned primarily with polymeric structures, properties arising from a collective effects of many highly interconnected metals. In contrast, coordination chemistry focuses on reactivity and properties of complexes containing individual metal atoms or small ensembles of metal atoms.\nNomenclature of coordination complexes.\nThe basic procedure for naming a complex is:\nExamples:\n [Cd(CN)2(en)2] \u2192 dicyanidobis(ethylenediamine)cadmium(II)\n [CoCl(NH3)5]SO4 \u2192 pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) sulfate\n [Cu(H2O)6] 2+ \u2192 hexaaquacopper(II) ion\n [CuCl5NH3]3\u2212 \u2192 amminepentachloridocuprate(II) ion\n K4[Fe(CN)6] \u2192 potassium hexacyanidoferrate(II)\n [NiCl4]2\u2212 \u2192 tetrachloridonickelate(II) ion (The use of chloro- was removed from IUPAC naming convention)\nThe coordination number of ligands attached to more than one metal (bridging ligands) is indicated by a subscript to the Greek symbol \u03bc placed before the ligand name. Thus the dimer of aluminium trichloride is described by Al2Cl4(\u03bc2-Cl)2.\nAny anionic group can be electronically stabilized by any cation. An anionic complex can be stabilised by a hydrogen cation, becoming an acidic complex which can dissociate to release the cationic hydrogen. This kind of complex compound has a name with \"ic\" added after the central metal. For example, H2[Pt(CN)4] has the name tetracyanoplatinic (II) acid.\nStability constant.\nThe affinity of metal ions for ligands is described by a stability constant, also called the formation constant, and is represented by the symbol Kf. It is the equilibrium constant for its assembly from the constituent metal and ligands, and can be calculated accordingly, as in the following example for a simple case:\nxM (aq) + yL (aq) \u21cc zZ (aq)\nformula_1\nwhere : x, y, and z are the stoichiometric coefficients of each species. M stands for metal / metal ion, the L for Lewis bases, and finally Z for complex ions. Formation constants vary widely. Large values indicate that the metal has high affinity for the ligand, provided the system is at equilibrium.\nSometimes the stability constant will be in a different form known as the constant of destability. This constant is expressed as the inverse of the constant of formation and is denoted as Kd = 1/Kf . This constant represents the reverse reaction for the decomposition of a complex ion into its individual metal and ligand components. When comparing the values for Kd, the larger the value, the more unstable the complex ion is.\nAs a result of these complex ions forming in solutions they also can play a key role in solubility of other compounds. When a complex ion is formed it can alter the concentrations of its components in the solution. For example:\nAg + 2NH3 \u21cc Ag(NH3)\nAgCl(s) + H2O(l) \u21cc Ag + Cl\nIf these reactions both occurred in the same reaction vessel, the solubility of the silver chloride would be increased by the presence of NH4OH because formation of the Diammine argentum(I) complex consumes a significant portion of the free silver ions from the solution. By Le Chatelier's principle, this causes the equilibrium reaction for the dissolving of the silver chloride, which has silver ion as a product, to shift to the right.\nThis new solubility can be calculated given the values of Kf and Ksp for the original reactions. The solubility is found essentially by combining the two separate equilibria into one combined equilibrium reaction and this combined reaction is the one that determines the new solubility. So Kc, the new solubility constant, is denoted by:\nformula_2\nApplication of coordination compounds.\nAs metals only exist in solution as coordination complexes, it follows then that this class of compounds is useful in a wide variety of ways.\nBioinorganic chemistry.\nIn bioinorganic chemistry and bioorganometallic chemistry, coordination complexes serve either structural or catalytic functions. An estimated 30% of proteins contain metal ions. Examples include the intensely colored vitamin B12, the heme group in hemoglobin, the cytochromes, the chlorin group in chlorophyll, and carboxypeptidase, a hydrolytic enzyme important in digestion. Another complex ion enzyme is catalase, which decomposes the cell's waste hydrogen peroxide. Synthetic coordination compounds are also used to bind to proteins and especially nucleic acids (e.g. anticancer drug cisplatin).\nIndustry.\nHomogeneous catalysis is a major application of coordination compounds for the production of organic substances. Processes include hydrogenation, hydroformylation, oxidation. In one example, a combination of titanium trichloride and triethylaluminium gives rise to Ziegler\u2013Natta catalysts, used for the polymerization of ethylene and propylene to give polymers of great commercial importance as fibers, films, and plastics.\nNickel, cobalt, and copper can be extracted using hydrometallurgical processes involving complex ions. They are extracted from their ores as ammine complexes. Metals can also be separated using the selective precipitation and solubility of complex ions. Cyanide is used chiefly for extraction of gold and silver from their ores.\nPhthalocyanine complexes are an important class of pigments.\nAnalysis.\nAt one time, coordination compounds were used to identify the presence of metals in a sample. Qualitative inorganic analysis has largely been superseded by instrumental methods of analysis such as atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

( ) was an American company founded in 1932 by Maurice Greenberg as The Connecticut Leather Company. The name \"COLECO\" is an abbreviation derived from the company's original name. It was a successful toy company in the 1980s, mass-producing versions of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls and its video game consoles, the Coleco Telstar dedicated consoles and ColecoVision. While the company ceased operations in 1988 as a result of bankruptcy, the Coleco brand was revived in 2005, and remains active to this day.\nOverview.\n1932: origins as The Connecticut Leather Company.\nColeco Industries, Inc. began in 1932 as The Connecticut Leather Company. The business supplied leather and \"shoe findings\" (the supplies and paraphernalia of a shoe repair shop) to shoe repairers. In 1938, the company began selling rubber footwear. During World War II demand for the company's supplies increased and by the end of the war, the company was larger and had expanded into new and used shoe machinery, hat cleaning equipment and marble shoeshine stands.\n1950s: leather diversification.\nBy the early 1950s, and thanks to Maurice Greenberg's son, Leonard Greenberg, the company had diversified further and was making leather lacing and leathercraft kits. In 1954, at the New York Toy Fair, their leather moccasin kit was selected as a Child Guidance Prestige Toy, and Connecticut Leather Company decided to commit to the toy business. In 1956, Leonard read about the emerging technology of vacuum formed plastic; the company adopted this and it became increasingly successful, producing a wide variety of plastic toys and wading pools.\n1961: Coleco Industries, Inc..\nIn 1961, the leather and shoe findings portion of the business was sold, and Connecticut Leather Company became Coleco Industries, Inc, An abbreviation of \"Connecticut Leather Company\". On January 9, 1962, Coleco went public, offering 120,000 shares of stock at $5.00 a share.\n1960s: acquisitions.\nIn 1963, the company acquired the Kestral Corporation of Springfield, Massachusetts, a manufacturer of inflatable vinyl pools and toys. This led to Coleco becoming the largest manufacturer of above-ground swimming pools in the world.\nIn 1966, Leonard persuaded his brother Arnold Greenberg to join the company. Further acquisitions included Playtime Products (1966) and Eagle Toys of Canada (1968). By the end of the 1960s, Coleco operated ten manufacturing facilities and occupied a new corporate headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut.\n1970s: financial difficulties and further diversification.\nColeco experienced financial difficulty during the 1970s, even though sales had grown to $48.6 million in 1971. In 1972, Coleco entered the snowmobile market through acquisition. Lower than expected snowfall that year and market conditions led to very reduced sales and poor profits.\nDozens of companies rushed to introduce game systems after the release of Atari's successful \"Pong\" console and the company entered the video game console business with the Telstar. Nearly all of the new game systems were based on General Instrument's \"\"Pong\"-on-a-chip\". General Instrument had underestimated demand, resulting in severe shortages. However, Coleco was one of the first to place an order and therefore one of the few companies to receive the full order. Though dedicated game consoles did not last long on the market, their early order enabled Coleco to break even.\nLate 1970s: handheld electronic games.\nColeco continued to perform well in electronics. The company transitioned into handheld electronic games, a market popularized by Mattel. An early success was \"Electronic Quarterback\". Coleco produced two popular lines of games, the \"head to head\" series of two player sports games (\"Football\", \"Baseball\", \"Basketball\", \"Soccer\", \"Hockey\", \"Boxing\") and the Mini-Arcade series of licensed video arcade titles such as \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Ms. Pac-Man\". A third line of educational handhelds was also produced and included the Electronic Learning Machine, \"Lil Genius\", \"Digits\", and a trivia game called \"Quiz Wiz\". Launched in 1982, their first four tabletop Mini-Arcades, for \"Pac-Man\", \"Galaxian\", \"Donkey Kong\", and \"Frogger\", sold approximately three million units within a year. Among these, 1.5 million units were sold for \"Pac-Man\" alone. In 1983, it released three more Mini-Arcades: \"Ms. Pac-Man\", \"Donkey Kong Junior\", and \"Zaxxon\".\nColeco returned to the video game console market in 1982 with the launch of the ColecoVision. The system was quite popular and more powerful than the Atari 2600, and came bundled with a copy of \"Donkey Kong\". The console sold 560,000 units in 1982. Coleco also hedged its bet on video games by introducing a line of ROM cartridges for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision, selling six million cartridges for both systems, along with two million sold for the ColecoVision for a total of eight million cartridges sold in 1982. It also introduced the Coleco Gemini, a clone of the popular Atari 2600, which came bundled with a copy of \"Donkey Kong\".\nWhen the video game business began to implode in 1983, it seemed clear that video game consoles were being supplanted by home computers. Bob Greenberg, son of Leonard Greenberg and nephew of Arnold Greenberg, left Microsoft where he had been working as a program developer at the time to assist in Coleco's entry into this market. Coleco's strategy was to introduce the Coleco Adam home computer, both as a stand-alone system and as an expansion module to the ColecoVision. The effort failed, in part because Adams were often unreliable due to being released with critical bugs, and in part because the computer's release coincided with the home computer industry crashing. Coleco withdrew from electronics early in 1985.\n1983: Cabbage Patch Kids.\nIn 1983, Coleco released the Cabbage Patch Kids series of dolls which were wildly successful. In the same year, Dr. Seuss signed a deal with Coleco to design a line of toys, including home video games based on his characters. Flush with success, Coleco purchased Leisure Dynamics (manufacturer of the board games \"Aggravation\" and \"Perfection\") and beleaguered Selchow and Righter, manufacturers of \"Scrabble\", \"Parcheesi\", and \"Trivial Pursuit\", in 1986. Sales of Selchow &amp; Righter games had plummeted, leaving them with warehouses full of unsold games. The purchase price for Selchow &amp; Righter was $75 million. That same year, Coleco introduced an ALF plush, based on the furry alien character who had his own television series at the time, as well as a talking version and a cassette-playing \"Storytelling ALF\" doll.\n1988: bankruptcy and sale.\nThe combination of the purchase of Selchow &amp; Righter, the disastrous Adam computer, and the public's waning infatuation with Cabbage Patch Dolls all contributed to Coleco's financial decline. In 1988, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nThe reorganized Coleco sold off all of its North American assets and outsourced thousands of jobs to foreign countries, closing plants in Amsterdam, New York and other cities.\nIn 1988, Canada-based SLM Action Sports Inc. purchased Coleco's swimming pool and snow goods divisions.\nIn 1989, Hasbro purchased most of Coleco's remaining product lines.\nBrand.\n\"Coleco\" as a brand name has been owned by several entities since it was created in 1961 by Coleco Industries, Inc.\nIn 2005, River West Brands, now Dormitus Brands, a Chicago-based brand revitalization company, re-introduced the Coleco brand to the marketplace. In late 2006, the company introduced the Coleco Sonic, a handheld system containing twenty Master System and Game Gear games, including two from the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series. In 2014, River West Brands established the subsidiary Coleco Holdings for their Coleco-branded projects.\nIn December 2015, Coleco Holdings announced the development of the Coleco Chameleon, a new cartridge-based video game system; in actuality, a re-branding of the controversial Retro VGS console, whose Indiegogo campaign failed to secure funding when it ended in early November 2015, with only $63,546 raised of its $1.95 million goal. In the press release, it was established that the system would be able to play new and classic games in the 8, 16, and 32-bit styles. The release for the system was announced to be sometime in early 2016, with a demonstration at Toy Fair New York in February. However, some critics suggested that the prototype fell short of its developmental goals and was nothing more than the motherboard of a Super NES model SNS-101 inside an Atari Jaguar case. Later mock images of a prototype posted by AtariAge showed the device utilizing a CCTV capture card in place of a motherboard. After Retro VGS failed to produce a fully working prototype, Coleco Holdings pulled out of involvement with Retro VGS, terminating the project.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7306", "revid": "87591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7306", "title": "ColecoVision", "text": "Second-generation home video game console\nThe ColecoVision is a second-generation home video-game console developed by Coleco and launched in North America in August 1982. It was released a year later in Europe by CBS Electronics as the CBS ColecoVision.\nThe console offered a closer experience to more powerful arcade video games compared to competitors such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision. The initial catalog of twelve games on ROM cartridge included the first home version of Nintendo's \"Donkey Kong\" as the pack-in game. Approximately 136 games were published for the ColecoVision between 1982 and 1984, including Sega's \"Zaxxon\" and some ports of lesser-known arcade games that found a larger audience on the console, such as \"Lady Bug\", \"Cosmic Avenger\", and \"Venture\".\nColeco released a series of hardware add-ons and special controllers to expand the capabilities of the console. \"Expansion Module #1\" allowed the system to play Atari 2600 cartridges. \"Expansion Module #3\", released some time later, converted the system into the Adam home computer, using the ColecoVision hardware primarily as a display system and handling joysticks. The resulting system ran all ColecoVision games as well as new software for the Adam.\nThe ColecoVision was discontinued in 1985, when Coleco withdrew from the video game market. Coleco had already contemplated shifting focus to their successful Cabbage Patch Kids toy line after the costly failure of their Adam computer.\nDevelopment.\nColeco entered the video game market in 1976 during the dedicated-game home console period with their line of Telstar consoles. When that market became oversaturated over the next few years, the company nearly went bankrupt, but found a successful product through handheld electronic games, with products that beat out those of the current market leader, Mattel. The company also developed a line of miniaturized tabletop arcade video games with licensed rights from arcade game makers including Sega, Bally, Midway, and Nintendo. Coleco was able to survive on sales of their electronic games through to 1982, but that market itself began to wane, and Coleco president Arnold Greenberg was still interested in producing a home video game console.\nAccording to Eric Bromley, who led the engineering for the ColecoVision, Greenberg had wanted to get into the programmable home console market with arcade-quality games, but the cost of components had been a limiting factor. As early as 1979, Bromley had drawn out specifications for a system using a Texas Instruments video and a General Instrument audio chip, but could not get the go-ahead due to the cost of RAM. Around 1981, Bromley saw an article in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that asserted the price of RAM had fallen and, after working the cost numbers, Bromley found the system cost fell within their cost margins. Within ten minutes of reporting this to Greenberg, they had established the working name \"ColecoVision\" for the console as they began a more thorough design\u2014a name which the marketing department never was able to surpass.\nColeco recognized that licensed conversion of arcade games had worked for Atari in selling the Atari VCS, so they had approached Nintendo around 1981 for potential access to their arcade titles. Bromley described a tense set of meetings with Nintendo's president Hiroshi Yamauchi under typical Japanese customs where he sought to negotiate for game rights, though Yamauchi only offered seemingly obscure titles. After a meal with Yamauchi during one day, Bromley excused himself to the restroom and happened upon one of the first \"Donkey Kong\" cabinets, which had yet to be released to Western countries. Knowing this game would likely be a hit, Bromley arranged a meeting the following day with Yamauchi and requested the exclusive rights to \"Donkey Kong\"; Yamauchi offered them if only they could provide $ upfront by that day and gave them $ per unit sold. Greenberg agreed, though as in Japanese custom, Bromley did not have a formal contract from Nintendo on his return. By the time of that year's Consumer Electronics Show, which Yamauchi was attending, Bromley found out from Yamauchi's daughter and translator that he had apparently given the rights to Atari. With Yamauchi's daughter's help, Bromley was able to commit Yamauchi to sign a formal contract to affirm the rights to Coleco. Coleco's announcement that they would bundle \"Donkey Kong\" with the console was initially met with surprise and skepticism, with journalists and retailers questioning why they would give away their most anticipated home video game with the console.\nRelease.\nThe ColecoVision was released in August 1982. By Christmas 1982, Coleco had sold more than 500,000 units, in part on the strength of \"Donkey Kong\" as the bundled game. ColecoVision's main competitor was the less commercially successful Atari 5200. Sales quickly passed 1 million in early 1983.\nThe ColecoVision was distributed by CBS Electronics outside of North America and was branded the CBS ColecoVision. In Europe, the console was released in July 1983, nearly one year after the North American release. Sega Enterprises attempted a Japanese version of the console, but it was retooled into the SG-1000 before release.\nBy the beginning of 1984, quarterly sales of the ColecoVision had dramatically decreased. In January 1985, Coleco discontinued the Adam, which was a home computer expansion for ColecoVision. By mid-1985, Coleco planned to withdraw from the video game market, and the ColecoVision was officially discontinued by October. Total sales are uncertain, but were ultimately in excess of 2 million consoles, with the console continuing to sell modestly up until its discontinuation.\nIn 1983, Spectravideo announced the SV-603 ColecoVision Video Game Adapter for its SV-318 computer. The company stated that the $70 product allowed users to \"enjoy the entire library of exciting ColecoVision video-game cartridges\".\nHardware.\nColecoVision is based around the Zilog Z80 CPU and a variant of the Texas Instruments TMS9918 video chip that was introduced in 1979.\nOn NTSC ColecoVision consoles, all first-party cartridges and most third-party software titles feature a 12.7 second pause before presenting the game select screen. CBS Electronics reduced this pause in the BIOS to 3.3 seconds for their PAL and SECAM ColecoVision consoles.\nExpansion Modules and accessories.\nFrom its introduction, Coleco touted the ColecoVision's hardware expandability by highlighting the \"Expansion Module Interface\" on the front of the unit. These hardware expansion modules and accessories were sold separately.\nAtari 2600 expansion.\n\"Expansion Module #1\" made the ColecoVision compatible with Atari 2600 cartridges and controllers. It leveraged the fact that the 2600 used largely off-the-shelf components and was effectively a complete set of 2600 electronics, including a reverse-engineered equivalent of the 2600's sole custom chip, the TIA. The ColecoVision console did not do any translation or processing of the game code on the 2600 cartridges; it only provided power and clock input to and audio/video output from the expansion module, which was otherwise entirely self-contained and could be thought of as the first Atari 2600 clone console. Functionally, this gave the ColecoVision the largest software library of any console of its day. The expansion module prompted legal action from Atari. Coleco and Atari settled out of court, with Coleco becoming licensed under Atari's patents. The royalty-based license also applied to Coleco's Gemini game system, a stand-alone clone of the 2600.\nDriving controller.\n\"Expansion Module #2\" is a driving controller (steering wheel / gas pedal) that comes packaged with the cartridge \"Turbo\". The gas pedal is merely a simple on/off switch. Although Coleco called the driving controller an expansion module, it actually plugs into the controller port, not the \"Expansion Module Interface\". The driving controller is also compatible with the cartridges \"Destructor\", \"Bump 'n' Jump\", \"Pitstop\", and \"The Dukes of Hazzard\".\nAdam computer expansion.\n\"Expansion Module #3\" converts the ColecoVision into the Adam computer, complete with keyboard, digital data pack (DDP) cassette drive, 64 KB RAM, and printer.\nRoller Controller.\nThe \"Roller Controller\" is a trackball that comes packaged with the cartridge \"Slither\", a conversion of the arcade game. The roller controller uses a special power connector that is not compatible with Expansion Module #3 (the Adam computer). Coleco mailed an adapter to owners of both units who complained. The other cartridge programmed to use the roller controller is \"Victory\". A joystick mode switch on the roller controller allows it to be used with all cartridges including \"WarGames\", \"Omega Race\", and Atarisoft's \"Centipede\".\nSuper Action Controller.\nThe \"Super Action Controller Set\", available in September 1983, is a set of two handheld joystick controllers that comes packaged with the cartridge \"Super Action Baseball\". Each controller has a ball-top joystick, four finger triggered action buttons, a 12-button numeric keypad, and a \"speed roller\". The cartridges \"Super Action Football\", \"Rocky\" \"Super Action Boxing\", and a conversion of the arcade game \"Front Line\" are also designed to be used with the \"Super Action Controller\".\nUnreleased.\nExpansion Module #3 was originally planned to be the Super Game Module. It was advertised for an August 1983 release but was ultimately cancelled and replaced with the Adam computer expansion. The Super Game Module added a tape drive known as the Exatron Stringy Floppy with 128 KB capacity, and the additional RAM, said to be 30 KB, to load and execute programs from tape. Games could be distributed on tiny tapes, called \"wafers\", and be much larger than the 16 KB or 32 KB ROM cartridges of the day. \"Super Donkey Kong\", with all screens and animations, \"Super Donkey Kong Jr\", and \"Super Smurf Rescue\" were demonstrated with the Super Game Module. The Adam computer expansion with its 256 KB tape drive and 64 KB RAM fulfilled the specifications promised by the Super Game Module.\nLegacy.\nMasayuki Uemura, head of Famicom development, stated that the ColecoVision set the bar that influenced how he approached the creation of the Famicom. During the creation of the Nintendo Entertainment System, Takao Sawano, chief manager of the project, brought a ColecoVision home to his family, who were impressed by the system's capability to produce smooth graphics, which contrasted with the flickering commonly seen on Atari 2600 games.\nIn 1986, Bit Corporation produced a ColecoVision clone called the Dina, which was sold in the United States by Telegames as the Telegames Personal Arcade.\n\"IGN\" named the ColecoVision their 12th-best video-game console out of their list of 25, citing \"its incredible accuracy in bringing current-generation arcade hits home\".\nIn 1996, the first homebrew ColecoVision game was released: a \"Tetris\" clone titled \"Kevtris\".\nIn 1997, Telegames released \"Personal Arcade Vol. 1\", a collection of ColecoVision games for Microsoft Windows, and a 1998 follow-up, \"Colecovision Hits Volume One\".\nIn 2012, Opcode Games released their own Super Game Module expansion, which increases RAM from 1 KB to 32 KB and adds four additional sound channels. This expansion brings the ColecoVision close to the MSX architecture standard, allowing MSX software to be more easily ported.\nIn 2014, AtGames began producing the ColecoVision Flashback console that includes 60 games, but not the original pack-in game, \"Donkey Kong\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The forces on each side are well-defined and fight by using weapons that target primarily the opponent's military. It is normally fought by using conventional weapons, not chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons.\nThe general purpose of conventional warfare is to weaken or destroy the opponent's military, which negates its ability to engage in conventional warfare. In forcing capitulation, however, one or both sides may eventually resort to unconventional warfare tactics.\nHistory.\nFormation of state.\nThe state was first advocated by Plato but found more acceptance in the consolidation of power under the Roman Catholic Church. European monarchs then gained power as the Catholic Church was stripped of temporal power and was replaced by the divine right of kings. In 1648, the powers of Europe signed the Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the religious violence for purely political governance and outlook, signifying the birth of the modern state.\nWithin the statist paradigm, only the state and its appointed representatives may bear arms and enter into war. In fact, war then became understood only as a conflict between sovereign states. Monarchs strengthened that idea and gave it the force of law. Any noble had been allowed to start a war, but European monarchs had to consolidate military power in response to the Napoleonic Wars.\nClausewitzian paradigm.\nPrussia was one of the countries that tried to amass military power. Carl von Clausewitz, one of Prussia's officers, wrote \"On War\", a work rooted solely in the world of the state. All other forms of intrastate conflict, such as rebellion, are not accounted for because in theoretical terms, he could not account for warfare before the state. However, near the end of his life, he grew increasingly aware of the importance of non-state military actors, as is revealed in his conceptions of \"the people in arms\", which he noted arose from the same social and political sources as traditional interstate warfare.\nPractices such as raiding or blood feuds were then labeled criminal activities and stripped of legitimacy. That war paradigm reflected the view of most of the modernized world in the early 21st century, as is verified by examination of the conventional armies of the time: large, high-maintenance, and technologically advanced armies designed to compete against similarly designed forces.\nClausewitz also forwarded the issue of \"casus belli\". Wars had been fought for social, religious, or even cultural reasons, and Clausewitz taught that war is merely \"a continuation of politics by other means.\" It is a rational calculation in which states fight for their interests (whether they are economic, security-related, or otherwise) once normal discourse has broken down.\nPrevalence.\nMost modern wars have been conducted using conventional means. Confirmed use of biological warfare by a nation state has not occurred since 1945, and chemical warfare has been used only a few times (the latest known confrontation in which it was utilized being the Syrian Civil War). Nuclear warfare has only occurred once: the American bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.\nSince World War II.\nThe state and Clausewitzian principles peaked in the World Wars, during the 20th century, but they also laid the groundwork for their dilapidation from nuclear proliferation. During the Cold War, the superpowers sought to avoid open conflict between their respective forces, as both sides recognized that such a clash could very easily escalate and quickly involve nuclear weapons. Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in proxy wars, military buildups, and diplomatic standoffs. Thus, no two nuclear powers have yet fought a conventional war directly except for two brief skirmishes between China and Soviet Union in the 1969 Sino-Soviet conflict and between India and Pakistan in the 1999 Kargil War.\nHowever, conventional wars have been fought since 1945 between countries without nuclear weapons, such as the Iran\u2013Iraq War and Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian War, or between a nuclear state and a weaker non-nuclear state, like the Gulf War and Russo-Ukrainian War.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7312", "revid": "31044994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7312", "title": "Chauvinism", "text": "Form of extreme patriotism and nationalism\nChauvinism ( ) is the unreasonable belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people, who are seen as strong and virtuous, while others are considered weak, unworthy, or inferior. The \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\" describes it as a form of \"excessive and unreasonable\" patriotism and nationalism, a fervent faith in national excellence and glory.\nIn American English, since the 1940s, the word has increasingly been used as a shorthand for male chauvinism, a trend reflected in \"Merriam-Webster's Dictionary\", which, as of 2018, began its first example of use of the term \"chauvinism\" with \"an attitude of superiority toward members of the opposite sex\".\nAs nationalism.\nAccording to legend, French soldier Nicolas Chauvin was badly wounded in the Napoleonic Wars and received a meager pension for his injuries. After Napoleon abdicated, Chauvin maintained his fanatical Bonapartist belief in the messianic mission of Imperial France, despite the unpopularity of this view under the Bourbon Restoration. His single-minded devotion to his cause, despite neglect by his faction and harassment by its enemies, started the use of the term. The French term had originated in the early 1830s based on the character of Nicolas Chauvin in the play \"The Tricolour Cockade\" by the Cogniard Brothers, and was later adopted into English, being recorded in American English in 1867.\n\"Chauvinism\" has extended from its original use to include fanatical devotion and undue partiality to any group or cause to which one belongs, especially when such partisanship includes prejudice against or hostility toward outsiders or rival groups and persists even in the face of overwhelming opposition. This French quality finds its parallel in the English-language term \"jingoism\", which has retained the meaning of \"chauvinism\" strictly in its original sense; that is, an attitude of belligerent nationalism.\nIn 1945, political theorist Hannah Arendt described the concept thus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Chauvinism is an almost natural product of the national concept in so far as it springs directly from the old idea of the \"national mission\". ... [A] nation's mission might be interpreted precisely as bringing its light to other, less fortunate peoples that, for whatever reason, have miraculously been left by history without a national mission. As long as this concept did not develop into the ideology of chauvinism and remained in the rather vague realm of national or even nationalistic pride, it frequently resulted in a high sense of responsibility for the welfare of backward people.\nIn this sense, chauvinism is irrational, in that no one can claim their nation or ethnic group to be inherently superior to another.\nA historical example of chauvinism from the century following Chauvin was the German-Jewish poet Ernst Lissauer, whose extreme nationalism after the outbreak of World War 1 included writing the \"Hymn of Hate against England\" () in 1915.\nAs David Aberbach remarks, \"There is nothing in modern Hebrew literature, however devoted to the cause of Jewish sovereignty, remotely comparable to the super-chauvinistic \"Hassgesang\" ('Hate Song for England')...\"\nDespite chauvinism's irrational roots, at the time, it was explicitly seen as almost obligatory for any German patriot. As Walther Rathenau commented just prior to the outbreak of the war, \"Whoever loves his Fatherland may and should be something of a chauvinist.\" Lissauer's poem was exceedingly popular, to the extent that it was praised by the Kaiser himself, and Lissauer's slogan \"\" was used as a daily greeting.\nHowever, whilst some German Jews did take the opportunity of the war to demonstrate their patriotism, Lissauer was an extremist, and in contrast many other German Jews disagreed with Lissauer and the way that mainstream opinion had shifted.\nThe Christianity-centric imagery used to document the by authors such as Walter Flex alienated Jewish soldiers.\nWhereas Lissauer attempted to sign up as a soldier (but was rejected as unfit) as soon as war broke out, then penned the poem, and in the words of Stefan Zweig considered everything published by the German newspapers and army to be \"gospel truth\" and Edward Grey to be \"the worst criminal\".\nThe last lines of the poem read:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMale chauvinism.\nMale chauvinism is the belief that men are superior to women. The closely related terms are \"male supremacy\", \"male oppression\", and \"patriarchy\". It becomes an insult in the male chauvinist pig variation.\nHistory.\nWhile the first variation of the English term \"chauvinism\", \"literary chauvinism\", appeared in 1888, the growing popularity of variations is attributed to the American Communist Party that stressed the \"white chauvinism\" and \"male chauvinism\" in the early 1930s (\"white chauvinism\" dates back to the \"Resolution on the Negro Question\" of 1930). At this time the brief term \"chauvinism\" frequently was used to designate the white chauvinism. The term \"male sex chauvinism\" appeared in \"The New York Times\" in 1934, while the form \"male chauvinism\" is first documented in the 1935 Clifford Odets play \"Till the Day I Die\" to reflect a pattern of patronizingly claiming the superiority of males, \"You and your male chauvinism!\". Outside the Communist party, the term was very rarely used for the next 30 years (about one mention in NYT every three years). At the same time, the \"male chauvinism\" term was regularly used in the Communist press in the US, where the \"chauvinism\" now standing for both white chauvinism and male chauvinism. The party sanctions against male chauvinists were employed, but were less severe than the ones against white chauvinists.\nThe second coming of the \"male chauvinist\" term in 1969 is associated with the women's liberation movement. This time it became widespread (130 articles in NYT used the term in 1972 alone). \"Male chauvinist pig\" quickly followed in 1970 and, useful for teasing and impossible for the target to interpret is as a joke, it turned out easier for activists to adopt, becoming a vogue word or even an early meme (the rate of its spread can be compared to that of \"groovy\").\nBy the early 1990s 63% of Chicago women acknowledged calling someone a \"male chauvinist pig\", including 58% of the women who did not self-identify as feminists, 56% of conservatives, 60% of non-voters, and 51% of African Americans. For comparison, much fewer women at the time used the word \"sexist\". The phrase was spreading through both everyday talk and the mass media.\nIn the workplace.\nThe balance of the workforce changed during World War II. As men entered or were conscripted into the military to fight in the war, women started replacing them. After the war ended, men returned home to find jobs in the workplace now occupied by women, which \"threatened the self-esteem many men derive from their dominance over women in the family, the economy, and society at large.\" Consequently, male chauvinism was on the rise, according to Cynthia B. Lloyd.\nLloyd and Michael Korda have argued that as they integrated back into the workforce, men returned to predominate, holding positions of power while women worked as their secretaries, usually typing dictations and answering telephone calls. This division of labor was understood and expected, and women typically felt unable to challenge their position or male superiors, argue Korda and Lloyd.\nCauses.\nChauvinist assumptions are seen by some as a bias in the TAT psychological personality test. Through cross-examinations, the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the \"potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation\" for women.\nAn often cited study done in 1976 by Sherwyn Woods, \"Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism\", attempts to find the underlying causes of male chauvinism.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Male chauvinism was studied in the psychoanalytic therapy of 11 men. It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine self-esteem. Mothers were more important than fathers in the development of male chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with decompensation in wives.Adam Jukes argues that a reason for male chauvinism is masculinity itself:For the vast majority of people all over the world, the mother is a primary carer...There's an asymmetry in the development of boys and girls. Infant boys have to learn how to be masculine. Girls don't. Masculinity is not in a state of crisis. Masculinity is a crisis. I don't believe misogyny is innate, but I believe it's inescapable because of the development of masculinity.\nFemale chauvinism.\nFemale chauvinism is the belief that women are superior to men. Second-wave feminist Betty Friedan observed that \"...the assumption that women have any moral or spiritual superiority as a class is [...] female chauvinism.\" Ariel Levy used the term in her book \"Female Chauvinist Pigs\", in which she argues that many young women in the United States and beyond are replicating male chauvinism and older misogynist stereotypes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The kinds of living organisms known on Earth, as of 2025[ [update]], all use carbon compounds for basic structural and metabolic functions, water as a solvent, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) to define and control their form. If life exists on other celestial bodies (planets, moons), it may be chemically similar, though it is also possible that there are organisms with quite different chemistries \u2013 for instance, involving other classes of carbon compounds, compounds of another element, and/or another solvent in place of water.\nThe possibility of life-forms being based on \"alternative\" biochemistries is the topic of an ongoing scientific discussion, informed by what is known about extraterrestrial environments and about the chemical behaviour of various elements and compounds. It is of interest in synthetic biology and is also a common subject in science fiction.\nThe element silicon has been much discussed as a hypothetical alternative to carbon. Silicon is in the same group as carbon on the periodic table and, like carbon, it is tetravalent. Hypothetical alternatives to water include ammonia, which, like water, is a polar molecule, and cosmically abundant; and non-polar hydrocarbon solvents such as methane and ethane, which are known to exist in liquid form on the surface of Titan.\nShadow biosphere.\nA shadow biosphere is a hypothetical microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. Although life on Earth is relatively well-studied, the shadow biosphere may still remain unnoticed because the exploration of the microbial world targets primarily the biochemistry of the macro-organisms.\nAlternative-chirality biomolecules.\nPerhaps the least unusual alternative biochemistry would be one with differing chirality of its biomolecules. In known Earth-based life, amino acids are almost universally of the L form and sugars are of the D form. Molecules using D amino acids or L sugars may be possible; molecules of such a chirality, however, would be incompatible with organisms using the opposing chirality molecules. Amino acids which chirality is opposite to the norm are found on Earth, and these substances are generally thought to result from decay of organisms of normal chirality. However, physicist Paul Davies speculates that some of them might be products of \"anti-chiral\" life.\nIt is questionable, however, whether such a biochemistry would be truly alien. Although it would certainly be an alternative stereochemistry, molecules that are overwhelmingly found in one enantiomer throughout the vast majority of organisms can nonetheless often be found in another enantiomer in different (often basal) organisms such as in comparisons between members of Archaea and other domains, making it an open topic whether an alternative stereochemistry is truly novel.\nNon-carbon-based biochemistries.\nOn Earth, all known living things have a carbon-based structure and system. Scientists have speculated about the advantages and disadvantages of using elements other than carbon to form the molecular structures necessary for life, but no one has proposed a theory employing such atoms to form all the necessary structures. However, as Carl Sagan argued, it is very difficult to be certain whether a statement that applies to all life on Earth will turn out to apply to all life throughout the universe. Sagan used the term \"carbon chauvinism\" for such an assumption. He regarded silicon and germanium as conceivable alternatives to carbon (other plausible elements include but are not limited to palladium and titanium); but, on the other hand, he noted that carbon does seem more chemically versatile and is more abundant in the cosmos. Norman Horowitz devised the experiments to determine whether life might exist on Mars that were carried out by the Viking Lander of 1976, the first U.S. mission to successfully land a probe on the surface of Mars. Horowitz argued that the great versatility of the carbon atom makes it the element most likely to provide solutions, even exotic solutions, to the problems of survival on other planets. He considered that there was only a remote possibility that non-carbon life forms could exist with genetic information systems capable of self-replication and the ability to evolve and adapt.\nSilicon biochemistry.\nThe silicon atom has been much discussed as the basis for an alternative biochemical system, because silicon has many chemical similarities to carbon and is in the same group of the periodic table. Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information.\nHowever, silicon has several drawbacks as a carbon alternative. Carbon is ten times more cosmically abundant than silicon, and its chemistry appears naturally more complex. By 1998, astronomers had identified 84 carbon-containing molecules in the interstellar medium, but only 8 containing silicon, of which half also include carbon. Even though Earth and other terrestrial planets are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (silicon is roughly 925 times more abundant in Earth's crust than carbon), terrestrial life bases itself on carbon. It may avoid silicon because silicon compounds are less varied, unstable in the presence of water, or block the flow of heat. \nRelative to carbon, silicon has a much larger atomic radius, and forms much weaker covalent bonds to atoms \u2014 except oxygen and fluorine, with which it forms very strong bonds. Almost no multiple bonds to silicon are stable, although silicon does exhibit varied coordination number. Silanes, silicon analogues to the alkanes, react rapidly with water, and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Consequently, most terrestrial silicon is \"locked up\" in silica, and not a wide variety of biogenic precursors. \nSilicones, which alternate between silicon and oxygen atoms, are much more stable than silanes, and may even be more stable than the equivalent hydrocarbons in sulfuric acid-rich extraterrestrial environments. Alternatively, the weak bonds in silicon compounds may help maintain a rapid pace of life at cryogenic temperatures. Polysilanols, the silicon homologues to sugars, are among the few compounds soluble in liquid nitrogen.\nAll known silicon macromolecules are artificial polymers, and so \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\". Even so, some Earth life uses biogenic silica: diatoms' silicate skeletons. A. G. Cairns-Smith hypothesized that silicate minerals in water played a crucial role in abiogenesis, in that biogenic carbon compounds formed around their crystal structures. Although not observed in nature, carbon\u2013silicon bonds have been added to biochemistry under directed evolution (artificial selection): a cytochrome \"c\" protein from \"Rhodothermus marinus\" has been engineered to catalyse new carbon\u2013silicon bonds between hydrosilanes and diazo compounds.\nArsenic as an alternative to phosphorus.\nWhile arsenic, which is chemically similar to phosphorus, is poisonous for most life forms on Earth, it is incorporated into the biochemistry of some organisms. Some marine algae incorporate arsenic into complex organic molecules such as arsenosugars and arsenobetaines. Fungi and bacteria can produce volatile methylated arsenic compounds. Arsenate reduction and arsenite oxidation have been observed in microbes (\"Chrysiogenes arsenatis\"). Additionally, some prokaryotes can use arsenate as a terminal electron acceptor during anaerobic growth and some can utilize arsenite as an electron donor to generate energy.\nIt has been speculated that the earliest life forms on Earth may have used arsenic biochemistry in place of phosphorus in the structure of their DNA. A common objection to this scenario is that arsenate esters are so much less stable to hydrolysis than corresponding phosphate esters that arsenic is poorly suited for this function.\nThe authors of a 2010 geomicrobiology study, supported in part by NASA, have postulated that a bacterium named GFAJ-1, collected in the sediments of Mono Lake in eastern California, can employ such 'arsenic DNA' when cultured without phosphorus. They proposed that the bacterium may employ high levels of poly-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate or other means to reduce the effective concentration of water and stabilize its arsenate esters. This claim was heavily criticized almost immediately after publication for the perceived lack of appropriate controls. Other authors were unable to reproduce their results and showed that the study had issues with phosphate contamination, suggesting that the low amounts present could sustain extremophile lifeforms. The 2010 paper was retracted in 2025.\nNon-water solvents.\nIn addition to carbon compounds, all currently known terrestrial life also requires water as a solvent. This has led to discussions about whether water is the only liquid capable of filling that role. The idea that an extraterrestrial life-form might be based on a solvent other than water has been taken seriously in recent scientific literature by the biochemist Steven Benner, and by the astrobiological committee chaired by John A. Baross. Solvents discussed by the Baross committee include ammonia, sulfuric acid, formamide, hydrocarbons, and (at temperatures much lower than Earth's) liquid nitrogen, or hydrogen in the form of a supercritical fluid.\nWater as a solvent limits the forms biochemistry can take. For example, Steven Benner, proposes the polyelectrolyte theory of the gene that claims that for a genetic biopolymer such as DNA to function in water, it requires repeated ionic charges. If water is not required for life, these limits on genetic biopolymers are removed. \nCarl Sagan once described himself as both a carbon chauvinist and a water chauvinist; however, on another occasion he said that he was a carbon chauvinist but \"not that much of a water chauvinist\".\nHe speculated on hydrocarbons, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia as possible alternatives to water.\nSome of the properties of water that are important for life processes include:\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapor or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: Enceladus and Europa (where geysers have been observed), Titan, and Ganymede. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however. For instance, water ice has a high albedo, meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During ice ages, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favourable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be \"does\" the prospective solvent remain liquid, but \"at what pressure\". For example, hydrogen cyanide has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1 atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of Venus, with of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\nAmmonia.\nThe ammonia molecule (NH3), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen. The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea dating back to 1954 at least, when J. B. S. Haldane raised the topic at a symposium about life's origin.\nMany chemical reactions can occur in an ammonia solution, and liquid ammonia has chemical similarities with water. Ammonia dissolves most organic molecules at least as well as water does, and many elemental metals. Haldane indicated that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogues; for instance, the ammonia-related amine group (\u2212NH2) is analogous to the water-related hydroxyl group (\u2212OH).\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H+ ion. When ammonia accepts an H+, it forms the ammonium cation (NH4+), analogous to hydronium (H3O+). When it donates an H+ ion, it forms the amide anion (NH2\u2212), analogous to the hydroxide anion (OH\u2212). Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H+ ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger nucleophile. Ammonia added to water functions as an Arrhenius base: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a solvent system definition of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium. The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous imine group (C=NH) could be used instead.\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The hydrogen bonds between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's heat of vaporization to be half that of water, its surface tension to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a hydrophobic effect. Gerald Feinberg and Robert Shapiro have questioned whether ammonia could hold prebiotic molecules together well enough to allow the emergence of a self-reproducing system. Ammonia is also flammable in oxygen and could not exist sustainably in an environment suitable for aerobic metabolism.\nA biosphere based on ammonia would likely exist at temperatures or air pressures that are extremely unusual in relation to life on Earth. Life on Earth usually exists between the melting point and boiling point of water, at a pressure designated as normal pressure, between . When also held to normal pressure, ammonia's melting and boiling points are and respectively. Because chemical reactions generally proceed more slowly at lower temperatures, ammonia-based life existing in this set of conditions might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth. On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.\nA set of conditions where ammonia is liquid at Earth-like temperatures would involve it being at a much higher pressure. For example, at 60 atm ammonia melts at and boils at .\nAmmonia and ammonia\u2013water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based habitability zone. Such conditions could exist, for example, under the surface of Saturn's largest moon Titan.\nMethane and other hydrocarbons.\nMethane (CH4) is a simple hydrocarbon: that is, a compound of two of the most common elements in the cosmos: hydrogen and carbon. It has a cosmic abundance comparable with ammonia. Hydrocarbons could act as a solvent over a wide range of temperatures but would lack polarity. Isaac Asimov, the biochemist and science fiction writer, suggested in 1981 that poly-lipids could form a substitute for proteins in a non-polar solvent such as methane. Lakes composed of a mixture of hydrocarbons, including methane and ethane, have been detected on the surface of Titan by the \"Cassini\" spacecraft.\nThere is debate about the effectiveness of methane and other hydrocarbons as a solvent for life compared to water or ammonia. Water is a stronger solvent than the hydrocarbons, enabling easier transport of substances in a cell. However, water is also more chemically reactive and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form which solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the threat of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way. Also, the water molecule's tendency to form strong hydrogen bonds can interfere with internal hydrogen bonding in complex organic molecules. Life with a hydrocarbon solvent could make more use of hydrogen bonds within its biomolecules. Moreover, the strength of hydrogen bonds within biomolecules would be appropriate to a low-temperature biochemistry.\nAstrobiologist Chris McKay has argued, on thermodynamic grounds, that if life does exist on Titan's surface, using hydrocarbons as a solvent, it is likely also to use the more complex hydrocarbons as an energy source by reacting them with hydrogen, reducing ethane and acetylene to methane. Possible evidence for this form of life on Titan was identified in 2010 by Darrell Strobel of Johns Hopkins University; a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward diffusion at a rate of roughly 1025 molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan's surface. As Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects Chris McKay had predicted if methanogenic life-forms were present. The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by Chris McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms reducing acetylene to methane. While restating the biological hypothesis, McKay cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are to be considered more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a non-living surface catalyst enabling acetylene to react with hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow. He noted that even a non-biological catalyst effective at 95\u00a0K would in itself be a startling discovery.\nAzotosome.\nA hypothetical cell membrane termed an azotosome, able to function in liquid methane in Titan conditions was computer-modelled in an article published in February 2015. Composed of acrylonitrile, a small molecule containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, it is predicted to have stability and flexibility in liquid methane comparable to that of a phospholipid bilayer (the type of cell membrane possessed by all life on Earth) in liquid water. An analysis of data obtained using the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array (ALMA), completed in 2017, confirmed substantial amounts of acrylonitrile in Titan's atmosphere. Later studies questioned whether acrylonitrile would be able to self-assemble into azotosomes. However, in 2025 a new mechanism was proposed by scientists Christian Mayer and Conor Nixon to overcome the previous barriers to self-assembly of azotosomes in liquid methane, based on 'splashing' of a methane lake surface film by a hydrocarbon raindrop.\nHydrogen fluoride.\nHydrogen fluoride (HF), like water, is a polar molecule, and due to its polarity it can dissolve many ionic compounds. At atmospheric pressure, its melting point is , and its boiling point is ; the difference between the two is a little more than 100\u00a0K. HF also makes hydrogen bonds with its neighbour molecules, as do water and ammonia. It has been considered as a possible solvent for life by scientists such as Peter Sneath and Carl Sagan.\nHF is dangerous to the systems of molecules that Earth-life is made of, but certain other organic compounds, such as paraffin waxes, are stable with it. Like water and ammonia, liquid hydrogen fluoride supports an acid\u2013base chemistry. Using a solvent system definition of acidity and basicity, nitric acid functions as a base when it is added to liquid HF.\nHowever, hydrogen fluoride is cosmically rare, unlike water, ammonia, and methane.\nHydrogen sulfide.\nHydrogen sulfide is the closest chemical analog to water, but is less polar and is a weaker inorganic solvent. Hydrogen sulfide is quite plentiful on Jupiter's moon Io and may be in liquid form a short distance below the surface; astrobiologist Dirk Schulze-Makuch has suggested it as a possible solvent for life there. On a planet with hydrogen sulfide oceans, the source of the hydrogen sulfide could come from volcanoes, in which case it could be mixed in with a bit of hydrogen fluoride, which could help dissolve minerals. Hydrogen sulfide life might use a mixture of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide as their carbon source. They might produce and live on sulfur monoxide, which is analogous to oxygen (O2). Hydrogen sulfide, like hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, suffers from the small temperature range where it is liquid, though that, like that of hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, increases with increasing pressure.\nSilicon dioxide and silicates.\nSilicon dioxide, also known as silica and quartz, is very abundant in the universe and has a large temperature range where it is liquid. However, its melting point is , so it would be impossible to make organic compounds in that temperature, because all of them would decompose. Silicates are similar to silicon dioxide and some have lower melting points than silica. Feinberg and Shapiro have suggested that molten silicate rock could serve as a liquid medium for organisms with a chemistry based on silicon, oxygen, and other elements such as aluminium.\nOther solvents or cosolvents.\nOther solvents sometimes proposed:\nSulfuric acid in liquid form is strongly polar. It remains liquid at higher temperatures than water, its liquid range being 10\u00a0\u00b0C to 337\u00a0\u00b0C at a pressure of 1\u00a0atm, although above 300\u00a0\u00b0C it slowly decomposes. Sulfuric acid is known to be abundant in the clouds of Venus, in the form of aerosol droplets. In a biochemistry that used sulfuric acid as a solvent, the alkene group (C=C), with two carbon atoms joined by a double bond, could function analogously to the carbonyl group (C=O) in water-based biochemistry.\nA proposal has been made that life on Mars may exist and be using a mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide as its solvent.\nA 61.2% (by mass) mix of water and hydrogen peroxide has a freezing point of \u221256.5\u00a0\u00b0C and tends to super-cool rather than crystallize. It is also hygroscopic, an advantage in a water-scarce environment.\nSupercritical carbon dioxide has been proposed as a candidate for alternative biochemistry due to its ability to selectively dissolve organic compounds and assist the functioning of enzymes and because \"super-Earth\"- or \"super-Venus\"-type planets with dense high-pressure atmospheres may be common.\nOther speculations.\nNon-green photosynthesizers.\nPhysicists have noted that, although photosynthesis on Earth generally involves green plants, a variety of other-colored plants could also support photosynthesis, essential for most life on Earth, and that other colors might be preferred in places that receive a different mix of stellar radiation than Earth.\nThese studies indicate that blue plants would be unlikely; however yellow or red plants may be relatively common.\nVariable environments.\nMany Earth plants and animals undergo major biochemical changes during their life cycles as a response to changing environmental conditions, for example, by having a spore or hibernation state that can be sustained for years or even millennia between more active life stages. Thus, it would be biochemically possible to sustain life in environments that are only periodically consistent with life as we know it.\nFor example, frogs in cold climates can survive for extended periods of time with most of their body water in a frozen state, whereas desert frogs in Australia can become inactive and dehydrate in dry periods, losing up to 75% of their fluids, yet return to life by rapidly rehydrating in wet periods. Either type of frog would appear biochemically inactive (i.e. not living) during dormant periods to anyone lacking a sensitive means of detecting low levels of metabolism.\nAlanine world and hypothetical alternatives.\nThe genetic code may have evolved during the transition from the RNA world to a protein world. The \"alanine world hypothesis\" postulates that the evolution of the genetic code (the so-called GC phase) started with only four basic amino acids: alanine, glycine, proline and ornithine (now arginine). The evolution of the genetic code ended with 20 proteinogenic amino acids. From a chemical point of view, most of them are Alanine-derivatives particularly suitable for the construction of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets \u2013 basic secondary structural elements of modern proteins. Direct evidence of this is an experimental procedure in molecular biology known as alanine scanning.\nA hypothetical \"proline world\" would create a possible alternative life with the genetic code based on the proline chemical scaffold as the protein backbone. Similarly, a \"glycine world\" and \"ornithine world\" are also conceivable, but nature has chosen none of them. Evolution of life with Proline, Glycine, or Ornithine as the basic structure for protein-like polymers (foldamers) would lead to parallel biological worlds. They would have morphologically radically different body plans and genetics from the living organisms of the known biosphere.\nNonplanetary life.\nDusty plasma-based.\nIn 2007, Vadim N. Tsytovich and colleagues proposed that lifelike behaviors could be exhibited by dust particles suspended in a plasma, under conditions that might exist in space. Computer models showed that, when the dust became charged, the particles could self-organize into microscopic helical structures, and the authors offer \"a rough sketch of a possible model of...helical grain structure reproduction\".\nCosmic necklace-based.\nIn 2020, Luis A. Anchordoqu and Eugene M. Chudnovsky of the City University of New York hypothesized that cosmic necklace-based life composed of magnetic monopoles connected by cosmic strings could evolve inside stars. This would be achieved by a stretching of cosmic strings due to the star's intense gravity, thus allowing it to take on more complex forms and potentially form structures similar to the RNA and DNA structures found within carbon-based life. As such, it is theoretically possible that such beings could eventually become intelligent and construct a civilization using the power generated by the star's nuclear fusion. Because such use would use up part of the star's energy output, the luminosity would also fall. For this reason, it is thought that such life might exist inside stars observed to be cooling faster or dimmer than current cosmological models predict.\nLife on a neutron star.\nFrank Drake suggested in 1973 that intelligent life could inhabit neutron stars. Physical models in 1973 implied that Drake's creatures would be microscopic.\nScientists who have published on this topic.\nScientists who have considered possible alternatives to carbon-water biochemistry include:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While in popular usage the term \"myth\" often refers to false or fanciful stories, members of cultures often ascribe varying degrees of truth to their creation myths. In the society in which it is told, a creation myth is usually regarded as conveying profound truths\u00a0\u2013 metaphorically, symbolically, historically, or literally. They are commonly, although not always, considered cosmogonical myths\u00a0\u2013 that is, they describe the ordering of the cosmos from a state of chaos or amorphousness.\nCreation myths often share several features. They often are considered sacred accounts and can be found in nearly all known religious traditions. They are all stories with a plot and characters who are either deities, human-like figures, or animals, who often speak and transform easily. They are often set in a dim and nonspecific past that historian of religion Mircea Eliade termed \"in illo tempore\" ('at that time'). Creation myths address questions deeply meaningful to the society that shares them, revealing their central worldview and the framework for the self-identity of the culture and individual in a universal context.\nCreation myths develop in oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions; found throughout human culture, they are the most common form of myth.\nDefinitions.\nCreation myth definitions from modern references:\nReligion professor Mircea Eliade defined the word \"myth\" in terms of creation: \nMyth narrates a sacred history; it relates an event that took place in primordial Time, the fabled time of the \"beginnings.\" In other words, myth tells how, through the deeds of Supernatural Beings, a reality came into existence, be it the whole of reality, the Cosmos, or only a fragment of reality \u2013 an island, a species of plant, a particular kind of human behavior, an institution.\nMeaning and function.\nCreation myths have been around since ancient history and have served important societal roles. Over 100 \"distinct\" ones have been discovered. All creation myths are in one sense etiological because they attempt to explain how the world formed and where humanity came from. Myths attempt to explain the unknown and sometimes teach a lesson.\nEthnologists and anthropologists who study origin myths say that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity's meaning from revealed truths and scientists investigate cosmology with the tools of empiricism and rationality, but creation myths define human reality in very different terms. In the past, historians of religion and other students of myth thought of such stories as forms of primitive or early-stage science or religion and analyzed them in a literal or logical sense. Today, however, they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context. Charles Long, for example, writes: \"The beings referred to in the myth \u2013 gods, animals, plants \u2013 are forms of power grasped existentially. The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity.\"\nWhile creation myths are not literal explications, they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story. They provide the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to the natural world, to any assumed spiritual world, and to each other. A creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality, the origin and nature of being from non-being. In this sense cosmogonic myths serve as a philosophy of life \u2013 but one expressed and conveyed through symbol rather than through systematic reason. And in this sense they go beyond etiological myths (which explain specific features in religious rites, natural phenomena, or cultural life). Creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world, giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature.\nHistorian David Christian has summarized issues common to multiple creation myths:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How did everything begin? This is the first question faced by any creation myth and ... answering it remains tricky. ... Each beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning. ... Instead of meeting a single starting point, we encounter an infinity of them, each of which poses the same problem. ... There are no entirely satisfactory solutions to this dilemma. What we have to find is not a solution but some way of dealing with the mystery ... And we have to do so using words. The words we reach for, from \"God\" to \"gravity\", are inadequate to the task. So we have to use language poetically or symbolically; and such language, whether used by a scientist, a poet, or a shaman, can easily be misunderstood.\nClassification.\nMythologists have applied various schemes to classify creation myths found throughout human cultures. Eliade and his colleague Charles Long developed a classification based on some common motifs that reappear in stories the world over. The classification identifies five basic types:\nMarta Weigle further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes, adding elements such as \"deus faber\", a creation crafted by a deity, creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other, creation from sacrifice and creation from division/conjugation, accretion/conjunction, or secretion.\nAn alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond Van Over:\n\"Ex nihilo\".\nThe belief that God created the world out of nothing \u2013 \"ex nihilo\" \u2013 is central today to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared. Nonetheless, the concept is not found anywhere in the Hebrew Bible. The authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the cosmos should function. In the early 2nd century CE, early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God, and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation \"ex nihilo\" had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.\n\"Ex nihilo\" creation is found in creation stories from ancient Egypt, the Rig Veda, and many animistic cultures in Africa, Asia, Oceania, and North America. In most of these stories, the world is brought into being by the speech, dream, breath, or pure thought of a creator but creation ex nihilo may also take place through a creator's bodily secretions.\nThe literal translation of the phrase \"ex nihilo\" is \"from nothing\" but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation \"ex nihilo\" or creation from chaos. In \"ex nihilo\" creation myths, the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator. Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water, but does not create the world from them, whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre-existing within the unformed void.\nCreation from chaos.\nIn creation from chaos myths, there is nothing initially but a formless, shapeless expanse. In these stories the word \"chaos\" means \"disorder\", and this formless expanse, which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss, contains the material with which the created world will be made. Chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water, dimensionless, and sometimes salty or muddy. These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion, in contrast to \"order\" (\"cosmos\") which is the good. The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder, and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss. One example is the Genesis creation narrative from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis.\nWorld parent.\nThere are two types of world parent myths, both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity, the world parent or parents. One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents, and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart. The two parents are commonly identified as Sky (usually male) and Earth (usually female), who were so tightly bound to each other in the primeval state that no offspring could emerge. These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it.\nIn the second form of world parent myths, creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being. Often, in these stories, the limbs, hair, blood, bones, or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky, earth, animal or plant life, and other worldly features. These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual, and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world. One example of this is the Norse creation myth described in \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", the first poem in the \"Poetic Edda\", and in \"Gylfaginning\".\nEmergence.\nIn emergence myths, humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit. The previous world is often considered the womb of the earth mother, and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth. The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider woman of several mythologies of Indigenous peoples in the Americas. Male characters rarely figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male-oriented creation myths, like those of the \"ex nihilo\" variety.\nEmergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or metamorphosis from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form. Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms. The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.\nEarth-diver.\nThe earth-diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal (most often a type of bird, but also crustaceans, insects, and fish in some narratives) into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land. Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them cosmogonically. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths.\nMotif distribution.\nAccording to Gudmund Hatt and Tristram P. Coffin, Earth-diver myths are common in Native American folklore, among the following populations: Shoshone, Meskwaki, Blackfoot, Chipewyan, Newettee, Yokuts of California, Mandan, Hidatsa, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Ojibwe, Yuchi, and Cherokee.\nAmerican anthropologist Gladys Reichard located the distribution of the motif across \"all parts of North America\", save for \"the extreme north, northeast, and southwest\". In a 1977 study, anthropologist Victor Barnouw surmised that the earth-diver motif appeared in \"hunting-gathering societies\", mainly among northerly groups such as the Hare, Dogrib, Kaska, Beaver, Carrier, Chipewyan, Sarsi, Cree, and Montagnais.\nSimilar tales are also found among the Chukchi and Yukaghir, the Tatars, and many Finno-Ugric traditions, as well as among the Buryat and the Samoyed. In addition, the earth-diver motif also exists in narratives from Eastern Europe, namely Romani, Romanian, Slavic (namely, Bulgarian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Belarusian), and Lithuanian mythological traditions.\nThe pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the eastern Asiatic coastal region, spreading as peoples migrated west into Siberia and east to the North American continent. However, there are examples of this mytheme found well outside of this boreal distribution pattern, for example the West African Yoruba creation myth of \u1eccbatala and Oduduwa.\nNative American narrative.\nCharacteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm. The earth-diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live. In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found.\nAmong the indigenous peoples of the Americas, the earth-diver cosmogony is attested in Iroquois mythology: a female sky deity falls from the heavens, and certain animals, the beaver, the otter, the duck, and the muskrat dive in the waters to fetch mud to construct an island.\nIn a similar story from the Seneca, people lived in a sky realm. One day, the chief's daughter was afflicted with a mysterious illness, and the only cure recommended for her (revealed in a dream) was to lie beside a tree and to have it be dug up. The people do so, but a man complains that the tree was their livelihood, and kicks the girl through the hole. She ends up falling from the sky to a world of only water, but is rescued by waterfowl. A turtle offers to bear her on its shell, but asked where would be a definitive dwelling place for her. They decide to create land, and the toad dives into the depths of the primal sea to get pieces of soil. The toad puts it on the turtle's back, which grows larger with every deposit of soil.\nIn another version from the Wyandot, the Wyandot lived in heaven. The daughter of the Big Chief (or Mighty Ruler) was sick, so the medicine man recommends that they dig up the wild apple tree that stands next to the Lodge of the Mighty Ruler, because the remedy is to be found on its roots. However, as the tree has been dug out, the ground begins to sink away, and the treetops catch and carry down the sick daughter with it. As the girl falls from the skies, two swans rescue her on their backs. The birds decide to summon all the Swimmers and the Water Tribes. Many volunteer to dive into the Great Water to fetch bits of earth from the bottom of the sea, but only the toad (female, in the story) is the one successful.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7324", "revid": "47023628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7324", "title": "Crucifix", "text": "Symbol of Christianity\nA crucifix (from the Latin meaning '(one) fixed to a cross') is a cross with an image of Jesus on it, as distinct from a bare cross. The representation of Jesus himself on the cross is referred to in English as the (Latin for 'body'). The crucifix emphasizes Jesus' sacrifice, including his death by crucifixion, which Christians believe brought about the redemption of mankind. Most crucifixes portray Jesus on a Latin cross, rather than a Tau cross or a Coptic cross.\nThe crucifix is a principal symbol for many groups of Christians, and one of the most common forms of the Crucifixion in the arts. It is especially important in the Catholic Church, and is also used in the Lutheran Churches, Anglican Churches, Eastern Orthodox Church, and in most Oriental Orthodox Churches (except the Armenian Church and Syriac Church). The symbol is less common in churches of other Protestant denominations, and in the Assyrian Church of the East and Armenian Apostolic Church, which prefer to use a cross without the figure of Jesus (the ). \nWestern crucifixes usually have a three-dimensional , but in Eastern Orthodoxy Jesus' body is normally painted on the cross, or in low relief. Strictly speaking, to be a crucifix, the cross must be three-dimensional, but this distinction is not always observed. An entire painting of the crucifixion of Jesus including a landscape background and other figures is not a crucifix either.\nLarge crucifixes high across the central axis of a church are known by the Old English term rood. By the Late Middle Ages these were a near-universal feature of Western churches, but they are now very rare. Modern Roman Catholic churches and many Lutheran churches often have a crucifix above the altar on the wall; for the celebration of Mass, the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church requires that \"on or close to the altar there is to be a cross with a figure of Christ crucified\".\nDescription.\nThe standard, four-pointed Latin crucifix (used in the Catholic and Lutheran traditions) consists of an upright post or and a single crosspiece to which the sufferer's arms were nailed. There may also be a short projecting nameplate, showing the letters INRI (Greek: INBI). The Russian Orthodox crucifix usually has an additional third crossbar, to which the feet are nailed, and which is angled upward toward the penitent thief Saint Dismas (to the viewer's left) and downward toward the impenitent thief Gestas (to the viewer's right). The corpus of Eastern crucifixes is normally a two-dimensional or low relief icon that shows Jesus as already dead, his face peaceful and somber. They are rarely three-dimensional figures as in the Western tradition, although these may be found where Western influences are strong, but are more typically icons painted on a piece of wood shaped to include the double-barred cross and perhaps the edge of Christ's hips and halo, and no background. More sculptural small crucifixes in metal relief are also used in Orthodoxy (see gallery examples), including as pectoral crosses and blessing crosses.\nWestern crucifixes may show Christ dead or alive, the presence of the spear wound in his ribs traditionally indicating that he is dead. In either case his face very often shows his suffering. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition he has normally been shown as dead since around the end of the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm. Eastern crucifixes have Jesus' two feet nailed side by side, rather than crossed one above the other, as Western crucifixes have shown them since around the 13th century. The crown of thorns is also generally absent in Eastern crucifixes, since the emphasis is not on Christ's suffering, but on his triumph over sin and death. The S-shaped position of Jesus' body on the cross is a Byzantine innovation of the late 10th century, though also found in the German Gero Cross of the same date. Probably more from Byzantine influence, it spread elsewhere in the West, especially to Italy, by the Romanesque period, though it was more usual in painting than sculpted crucifixes. It was in Italy that the emphasis was put on Jesus' suffering and realistic details, during a process of general humanization of Christ favored by the Franciscan order. During the 13th century the suffering Italian model () triumphed over the traditional Byzantine one () anywhere in Europe also due to the works of artists such as Giunta Pisano and Cimabue. Since the Renaissance the \"S\"-shape is generally much less pronounced. Eastern Christian blessing crosses will often have the Crucifixion depicted on one side, and the Resurrection on the other, illustrating Eastern Orthodox theology's understanding of the Crucifixion and Resurrection as two intimately related aspects of the same act of salvation.\nAnother, symbolic, depiction shows a triumphant Christ (), clothed in robes, rather than stripped as for his execution, with arms raised, appearing to rise up from the cross, sometimes accompanied by \"rays of light\", or an aureole encircling his body. He may be robed as a prophet, crowned as a king, and vested in a stole as Great High Priest.\nOn some crucifixes a skull and crossbones are shown below the corpus, referring to Golgotha (Calvary), the site at which Jesus was crucified, which the Gospels say means in Hebrew \"the place of the skull.\" Medieval tradition held that it was the burial-place of Adam and Eve, and that the cross of Christ was raised directly over Adam's skull, so many crucifixes manufactured in Catholic countries still show the skull and crossbones below the corpus.\nVery large crucifixes have been built, the largest being the Cross in the Woods in Michigan, with a high statue.\nUsage.\nIn the early Church, many Christians hung a cross on the eastern wall of their house in order to indicate the eastward direction of prayer. Prayer in front of a crucifix, which is seen as a sacramental, is often part of devotion for Christians, especially those worshipping in a church, also privately. The person may sit, stand, or kneel in front of the crucifix, sometimes looking at it in contemplation, or merely in front of it with head bowed or eyes closed. During the Middle Ages small crucifixes, generally hung on a wall, became normal in the personal cells or living quarters first of monks, then all clergy, followed by the homes of the laity, spreading down from the top of society as these became cheap enough for the average person to afford. Most towns had a large crucifix erected as a monument, or some other shrine at the crossroads of the town. Building on the ancient custom, many Catholics, Lutherans and Anglicans hang a crucifix inside their homes and also use the crucifix as a focal point of a home altar. The wealthy erected proprietary chapels as they could afford to do this.\nCatholic (both Eastern and Western), Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran, and Anglican Christians generally use the crucifix in public religious services. They believe use of the crucifix is in keeping with the statement by Paul the Apostle in 1 Corinthians: \"we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God\".\nIn the West, altar crosses and processional crosses began to be crucifixes in the 11th century, which became general around the 14th century, as they became cheaper. The Roman Rite requires that \"either on the altar or near it, there is to be a cross, with the figure of Christ crucified upon it, a cross clearly visible to the assembled people. It is desirable that such a cross should remain near the altar even outside of liturgical celebrations, so as to call to mind for the faithful the saving Passion of the Lord.\" The requirement of the altar cross was also mentioned in pre-1970 editions of the Roman Missal, though not in the original 1570 Roman Missal of Pope Pius V. The Rite of Funerals says that the Gospel Book, the Bible, or a cross (which will generally be in crucifix form) may be placed on the coffin for a Requiem Mass, but a second standing cross is not to be placed near the coffin if the altar cross can be easily seen from the body of the church.\nEastern Christian liturgical processions called crucessions include a cross or crucifix at their head. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the crucifix is often placed above the iconostasis in the church. In the Russian Orthodox Church a large crucifix (\"Golgotha\") is placed behind the Holy Table (altar). During Matins of Good Friday, a large crucifix is taken in procession to the center of the church, where it is venerated by the faithful. Sometimes the \"soma\" () is removable and is taken off the crucifix at Vespers that evening during the Gospel lesson describing the Descent from the Cross. The empty cross may then remain in the centre of the church until the Paschal vigil (local practices vary). The blessing cross which the priest uses to bless the faithful at the dismissal will often have the crucifix on one side and an icon of the Resurrection of Jesus on the other, the side with the Resurrection being used on Sundays and during Paschaltide, and the crucifix on other days.\nModern anti-Christians have used an inverted (upside-down) crucifix when showing disdain for Jesus Christ or the Catholic Church which believes in his divinity. According to Christian tradition, Saint Peter was martyred by being crucified upside-down.\nControversies.\nProtestant Reformation.\nIn the Moravian Church, Nicolaus Zinzendorf had an experience in which he believed he encountered Jesus. Seeing a painting of a crucifix, Zinzendorf fell on his knees vowing to glorify Jesus after contemplating on the wounds of Christ and an inscription that stated \"This is what I have done for you, what will you do for me?\".\nThe Lutheran Churches retained the use of the crucifix, \"justifying their continued use of medieval crucifixes with the same arguments employed since the Middle Ages, as is evident from the example of the altar of the Holy Cross in the Cistercian church of Doberan.\" Martin Luther did not object to them, and this was among his differences with Andreas Karlstadt as early as 1525. At the time of the Reformation, Luther retained the crucifix in the Lutheran Church and they remain the center of worship in Lutheran parishes across Europe. In the United States, however, Lutheranism came under the influence of Calvinism, and the plain cross came to be used in some churches, though many Lutheran churches continue to use the crucifix. \nIn contrast to the practice of the Catholic Church, Moravian Church and Lutheran Churches, the early Reformed Churches rejected the use of the crucifix, and indeed the unadorned cross, along with other traditional religious imagery, as idolatrous. Calvin, considered to be the father of the Reformed Church, was strongly opposed to both cross and crucifix. In England (where Anglican Christianity is the dominant faith), the Royal Chapels of Elizabeth I were most unusual among local churches in retaining crucifixes, following the Queen's conservative tastes. These disappeared under her successor, James I, and their brief re-appearance in the early 1620s when James' heir was seeking a Spanish marriage was the subject of rumour and close observation by both Catholics and Protestants; when the match fell through they disappeared.\nModern.\nIn 2005, a mother accused her daughter's school in Derby, England, of discriminating against Christians after the teenager was suspended for refusing to take off a crucifix necklace.\nIn 2008, a chapel in a prison in England replaced its crucifix and static altar with a cross and portable altar when it was renovated as a multi-faith chapel. Right-wing media reported that the crucifix had been removed \"in case it offends Muslims\".\nIn 2008 in Spain, a local judge ordered crucifixes removed from public schools to settle a decades-old dispute over whether crucifixes should be displayed in public buildings in a non-confessional state.\nOn 18 March 2011, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in the \"Lautsi v. Italy\" case, that the requirement in Italian law that crucifixes be displayed in classrooms of state schools does not violate the European Convention on Human Rights. Crucifixes are common in most other Italian official buildings, including courts of law.\nOn 24 March 2011, the Constitutional Court of Peru ruled that the presence of crucifixes in courts of law does not violate the secular nature of the state.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Named for Copernican heliocentrism, it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of Copernicus' argument of a moving Earth.\nOrigin and implications.\nHermann Bondi named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th\u201317th century paradigm shift away from the Ptolemaic system, which placed Earth at the center of the universe. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets could be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun is centrally located and stationary in contrast to the geocentrism. He argued that the apparent retrograde motion of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the Sun, which the Copernican model placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.\nAlthough the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as \"demoting\" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century Giordano Bruno, who adopted this new perspective. The Earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the \"lowest and filthiest parts\". Instead, as Galileo said, the Earth is part of the \"dance of the stars\" rather than the \"sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect\". In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, \"Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people.\"\nWhile the Copernican principle is derived from the negation of past assumptions, such as geocentrism, heliocentrism, or galactocentrism which state that humans are at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle is stronger than \"acentrism\", which merely states that humans are not at the center of the universe. The Copernican principle assumes acentrism and also states that human observers or observations from Earth are representative of observations from the average position in the universe. Michael Rowan-Robinson emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: \"It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe.\"\nMost modern cosmology is based on the assumption that the cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations. If one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears isotropic or the same in all directions from the vantage point of Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally homogeneous or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the cosmological principle.\nIn practice, astronomers observe that the universe has heterogeneous or non-uniform structures up to the scale of galactic superclusters, filaments and great voids. In the current Lambda-CDM model, the predominant model of cosmology in the modern era, the universe is predicted to become more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 260 million parsecs. However, recent evidence from galaxy clusters, quasars, and type Ia supernovae suggests that isotropy is violated on large scales. Furthermore, various large-scale structures have been discovered, such as the Clowes\u2013Campusano LQG, the Sloan Great Wall, U1.11, the Huge-LQG, the Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall, the Giant Arc, and the Local Hole all of which indicate that homogeneity might be violated.\nOn scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, at greater distances, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and quasars appear more numerous. If the Copernican principle is assumed, then it follows that this is evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach Earth and shows the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, cosmic microwave background radiation, is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.\nBondi and Thomas Gold used the Copernican principle to argue for the perfect cosmological principle which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the steady-state cosmology. However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier: the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the Big Bang, and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of dark energy, apparently toward the Big Freeze or Big Rip.\nSince the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with \"the Copernicus method\") for J. Richard Gott's Bayesian-inference-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the Doomsday argument.\nTests of the principle.\nThe Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics. Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the cosmological principle, slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.\nHistorical.\nBefore the term Copernican principle was even coined, past assumptions, such as geocentrism, heliocentrism, and galactocentrism, which state that Earth, the Solar System, or the Milky Way respectively were located at the center of the universe, were shown to be false. The Copernican Revolution dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. Proper motion was mentioned by Halley. William Herschel found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped Milky Way galaxy. Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of the galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the Big Bang theory and the whole of modern cosmology.\nModern tests.\nRecent and planned tests relevant to the cosmological and Copernican principles include:\nPhysics without the principle.\nThe standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, assumes the Copernican principle and the more general cosmological principle. Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists have created models without the cosmological or Copernican principles to constrain the values of observational results, to address specific known issues in the Lambda-CDM model, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.\nA prominent example in this context is inhomogeneous cosmology, to model the observed accelerating universe and cosmological constant. Instead of using the current accepted idea of dark energy, inhomogeneous-cosmology models propose that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed \u2014 for example, that the Solar System is in an extremely large low-density void. To match observations the Solar System would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.\nWhile the Big Bang model in cosmology is sometimes said to derive from the Copernican principle in conjunction with redshift observations, the Big Bang model can still be assumed to be valid in absence of the Copernican principle, because the cosmic microwave background, primordial gas clouds, and the structure, evolution, and distribution of galaxies all provide evidence, independent of the Copernican principle, in favor of the Big Bang. However, the key tenets of the Big Bang model, such as the expansion of the universe, become assumptions themselves akin to the Copernican principle, rather than derived from the Copernican principle and observations.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cyprinidae is the largest and most diverse fish family, and the largest vertebrate animal family overall, with about 1,780 species divided into 166 valid genera. Cyprinids range from about in size to the giant barb (\"Catlocarpio siamensis\"). The family name is derived from the Greek word ( 'carp').\nBiology and ecology.\nCyprinids are stomachless, or \"agastric\", fish with toothless jaws. Even so, food can be effectively chewed by the gill rakers of the specialized last gill bow. These pharyngeal teeth allow the fish to make chewing motions against a chewing plate formed by a bony process of the skull. The pharyngeal teeth are unique to each species and are used to identify species. Strong pharyngeal teeth allow fish such as the common carp and ide to eat hard baits such as snails and bivalves.\nHearing is a well-developed sense in the cyprinids since they have the Weberian organ, three specialized vertebral processes that transfer motion of the gas bladder to the inner ear. The vertebral processes of the Weberian organ also permit a cyprinid to detect changes in motion of the gas bladder due to atmospheric conditions or depth changes. The cyprinids are considered physostomes because the pneumatic duct is retained in adult stages and the fish are able to gulp air to fill the gas bladder, or they can dispose of excess gas to the gut.\nCyprinids are native to North America, Africa, and Eurasia. The largest known cyprinid is the giant barb (\"Catlocarpio siamensis\"), which may grow up to in length and in weight. Other very large species that can surpass are the golden mahseer (\"Tor putitora\") and mangar (\"Luciobarbus esocinus\").\nAll fish in this family are egg-layers and most do not guard their eggs; however, a few species build nests and/or guard the eggs.\nCyprinids contain the only known example of androgenesis in a vertebrate, in the Squalius alburnoides allopolyploid complex.\nMost cyprinids feed mainly on invertebrates and vegetation, probably due to the lack of teeth and stomach; however, some species, like the asp, are predators that specialize in fish. Many species, such as the ide and the common rudd, prey on small fish when individuals become large enough. Even small species, such as the moderlieschen, are opportunistic predators that will eat larvae of the common frog in artificial circumstances.\nSome cyprinids, such as the grass carp, are specialized herbivores; others, such as the common nase, eat algae and biofilms, while others, such as the black carp, specialize in snails, and some, such as the silver carp, are specialized filter feeders. For this reason, cyprinids are often introduced as a management tool to control various factors in the aquatic environment, such as aquatic vegetation and diseases transmitted by snails.\nUnlike most fish species, cyprinids generally increase in abundance in eutrophic lakes. Here, they contribute towards positive feedback as they are efficient at eating the zooplankton that would otherwise graze on the algae, reducing its abundance.\nRelationship with humans.\nFood.\nCyprinids are highly important food fish; they are fished and farmed across Eurasia. In land-locked countries in particular, cyprinids are often the major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of biomass in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods such as drying and salting. The prevalence of inexpensive frozen fish products made this less important now than it was in earlier times. Nonetheless, in certain places, they remain popular for food, as well as recreational fishing, for ornamental use, and have been deliberately stocked in ponds and lakes for centuries for this reason.\nSport.\nCyprinids are popular for angling especially for match fishing (due to their dominance in biomass and numbers) and fishing for common carp because of its size and strength.\nAs pest control.\nSeveral cyprinids have been introduced to waters outside their natural ranges to provide food, sport, or biological control for some pest species. The common carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\") and the grass carp (\"Ctenopharyngodon idella\") are the most important of these, for example in Florida.\nAs a pest species.\nCarp in particular can stir up sediment, reducing the clarity of the water and making plant growth difficult.\nIn America and Australia, such as the Asian carp in the Mississippi Basin, they have become invasive species that compete with native fishes or disrupt the environment.\n\"Cyprinus carpio\" is a major pest species in Australia impacting freshwater environments, amenity, and the agricultural economy, devastating biodiversity by decimating native fish populations where they first became established as a major pest in the wild in the 1960s. In the major river system of eastern Australia, the Murray-Darling Basin, they constitute 80\u201390 per cent of fish biomass.\nIn 2016 the federal government announced A$15.2 million to fund the National Carp Control Plan to investigate using Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (carp virus) as a biological control agent while minimising impacts on industry and environment should a carp virus release go ahead. Despite initial, favourable assessment, in 2020 this plan was found to be unlikely to work due to the high fecundity of the fish.\nAquarium fish.\nNumerous cyprinids have become popular and important within the aquarium and fishpond hobbies, most famously the goldfish, which was bred in China from wild Carassius species (\"Carassius auratus\"). First imported into Europe around 1728, it was originally much-fancied by the Chinese nobility as early as 1150AD and, after it arrived there in 1502, also in Japan. In addition to the goldfish, the amur carp was bred in Japan into the colorful ornamental variety known as koi \u2014 or more accurately , as simply means \"common carp\" in Japanese \u2014 from the 18th century until today.\nOther popular aquarium cyprinids include danionins, rasborines and true barbs. Larger species are bred by the thousands in outdoor ponds, particularly in Southeast Asia, and trade in these aquarium fishes is of considerable commercial importance. The small rasborines and danionines are perhaps only rivalled by characids (tetras) and poecilid livebearers in their popularity for community aquaria. Some of the most popular cyprinids among aquarists, other than goldfish and koi, include the cherry barb, Harlequin rasbora, pearl danios, rainbow sharks, tiger barbs, and the White Cloud Mountain minnow.\nOne particular species of these small and undemanding danionines is the zebrafish (\"Danio rerio\"). It has become the standard model species for studying developmental genetics of vertebrates, in particular fish.\nConservation.\nHabitat destruction and other causes have reduced the wild stocks of several cyprinids to dangerously low levels; some are already entirely extinct. In particular, the cyprinids of the subfamily Leuciscinae from southwestern North America have been severely affected by pollution and unsustainable water use in the early to mid-20th century. The majority of globally extinct cypriniform species in fact belong to the leuciscinid cyprinids from the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\nSystematics.\nThe massive diversity of cyprinids has so far made it difficult to resolve their phylogeny in sufficient detail to make assignment to subfamilies more than tentative in many cases. Some distinct lineages obviously exist \u2013 for example, the Cultrinae and Leuciscinae, regardless of their exact delimitation, are rather close relatives and stand apart from Cyprininae\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but the overall systematics and taxonomy of the Cyprinidae remain a subject of considerable debate. A large number of genera are \"incertae sedis\", too equivocal in their traits and/or too little-studied to permit assignment to a particular subfamily with any certainty.\nPart of the solution seems that the delicate rasborines are the core group, consisting of minor lineages that have not shifted far from their evolutionary niche, or have coevolved for millions of years. These are among the most basal lineages of living cyprinids. Other \"rasborines\" are apparently distributed across the diverse lineages of the family.\nThe validity and circumscription of proposed subfamilies like the Labeoninae or Squaliobarbinae also remain doubtful, although the latter do appear to correspond to a distinct lineage. The sometimes-seen grouping of the large-headed carps (Hypophthalmichthyinae) with \"Xenocypris\", though, seems quite in error. More likely, the latter are part of the Cultrinae.\nThe entirely paraphyletic \"Barbinae\" and the disputed Labeoninae might be better treated as part of the Cyprininae, forming a close-knit group whose internal relationships are still little known. The small African \"barbs\" do not belong in \"Barbus\" \"sensu stricto\" \u2013 indeed, they are as distant from the typical barbels and the typical carps (\"Cyprinus\") as these are from \"Garra\" (which is placed in the Labeoninae by most who accept the latter as distinct) and thus might form another as yet unnamed subfamily. However, as noted above, how various minor lineages tie into this has not yet been resolved; therefore, such a radical move, though reasonable, is probably premature.\nThe tench (\"Tinca tinca\"), a significant food species farmed in western Eurasia in large numbers, is unusual. It is most often grouped with the Leuciscinae, but even when these were rather loosely circumscribed, it always stood apart. A cladistic analysis of DNA sequence data of the S7 ribosomal protein intron1 supports the view that it is distinct enough to constitute a monotypic subfamily. It also suggests it may be closer to the small East Asian \"Aphyocypris\", \"Hemigrammocypris\", and \"Yaoshanicus\". They would have diverged roughly at the same time from cyprinids of east-central Asia, perhaps as a result of the Alpide orogeny that vastly changed the topography of that region in the late Paleogene, when their divergence presumably occurred.\nA DNA-based analysis of these fish places the Rasborinae as the basal lineage with the Cyprininae as a sister clade to the Leuciscinae. The subfamilies Acheilognathinae, Gobioninae, and Leuciscinae are monophyletic.\nMore recent studies split the leuciscids, danionids, xenocyprids, and many others out of the family. However, even with these splits, Cyprinidae still remains the largest fish family.\nSubfamilies and genera.\n\"Eschmeyer's Catalog of Fishes\" sets out the subfamilies and genera within the family Cyprinidae as follows:\nWith such a large and diverse family the taxonomy and phylogenies are always being worked on so alternative classifications are being created as new information is discovered. The following is a phylogeny of Cyprinoidei, with clade names from van der Laan 2017:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Data related to at Wikispecies"}
{"id": "7330", "revid": "10289486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7330", "title": "Complementary DNA", "text": "DNA reverse transcribed from RNA\nIn genetics, complementary DNA (cDNA) is DNA that was reverse transcribed (via reverse transcriptase) from an RNA (e.g., messenger RNA or microRNA). cDNA exists in both single-stranded and double-stranded forms and in both natural and engineered forms.\nIn engineered forms, it often is a copy (replicate) of the naturally occurring DNA from any particular organism's natural genome; the organism's own mRNA was naturally transcribed from its DNA, and the cDNA is reverse transcribed from the mRNA, yielding a duplicate of the original DNA. Engineered cDNA is often used to express a specific protein in a cell that does not normally express that protein (i.e., heterologous expression), or to sequence or quantify mRNA molecules using DNA based methods (qPCR, RNA-seq). cDNA that codes for a specific protein can be transferred to a recipient cell for expression as part of recombinant DNA, often bacterial or yeast expression systems. cDNA is also generated to analyze transcriptomic profiles in bulk tissue, single cells, or single nuclei in assays such as microarrays, qPCR, and RNA-seq.\nIn natural forms, cDNA is produced by retroviruses (such as HIV-1, HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus, etc.) and then integrated into the host's genome, where it creates a provirus.\nThe term \"cDNA\" is also used, typically in a bioinformatics context, to refer to an mRNA transcript's sequence, expressed as DNA bases (deoxy-GCAT) rather than RNA bases (GCAU).\nPatentability of cDNA was a subject of a 2013 US Supreme Court decision in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. As a compromise, the Court declared, that exons-only cDNA is patent-eligible, whereas isolated sequences of naturally occurring DNA comprising introns are not.\nSynthesis.\nRNA serves as a template for cDNA synthesis. In cellular life, cDNA is generated by viruses and retrotransposons for integration of RNA into target genomic DNA. In molecular biology, RNA is purified from source material after genomic DNA, proteins and other cellular components are removed. cDNA is then synthesized through \"in vitro\" reverse transcription.\nRNA purification.\nRNA is transcribed from genomic DNA in host cells and is extracted by first lysing cells then purifying RNA utilizing widely used methods such as phenol-chloroform, silica column, and bead-based RNA extraction methods. Extraction methods vary depending on the source material. For example, extracting RNA from plant tissue requires additional reagents, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), to remove phenolic compounds, carbohydrates, and other compounds that will otherwise render RNA unusable. To remove DNA and proteins, enzymes such as DNase and Proteinase K are used for degradation. Importantly, RNA integrity is maintained by inactivating RNases with chaotropic agents such as guanidinium isothiocyanate, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), phenol or chloroform. Total RNA is then separated from other cellular components and precipitated with alcohol. Various commercial kits exist for simple and rapid RNA extractions for specific applications. Additional bead-based methods can be used to isolate specific sub-types of RNA (e.g. mRNA and microRNA) based on size or unique RNA regions.\nReverse transcription.\nFirst-strand synthesis.\nUsing a reverse transcriptase enzyme and purified RNA templates, one strand of cDNA is produced (first-strand cDNA synthesis). The M-MLV reverse transcriptase from the Moloney murine leukemia virus is commonly used due to its reduced RNase H activity suited for transcription of longer RNAs. The AMV reverse transcriptase from the avian myeloblastosis virus may also be used for RNA templates with strong secondary structures (i.e. high melting temperature). cDNA is commonly generated from mRNA for gene expression analyses such as RT-qPCR and RNA-seq. mRNA is selectively reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primers that are the reverse complement of the poly-adenylated tail on the 3' end of all mRNA. The oligo-dT primer anneals to the poly-adenylated tail of the mRNA to serve as a binding site for the reverse transcriptase to begin reverse transcription. An optimized mixture of oligo-dT and random hexamer primers increases the chance of obtaining full-length cDNA while reducing 5' or 3' bias. Ribosomal RNA may also be depleted to enrich both mRNA and non-poly-adenylated transcripts such as some non-coding RNA.\nSecond-strand synthesis.\nThe result of first-strand syntheses, RNA-DNA hybrids, can be processed through multiple second-strand synthesis methods or processed directly in downstream assays. An early method known as hairpin-primed synthesis relied on hairpin formation on the 3' end of the first-strand cDNA to prime second-strand synthesis. However, priming is random and hairpin hydrolysis leads to loss of information. The Gubler and Hoffman Procedure uses E. Coli RNase H to nick mRNA that is replaced with E. Coli DNA Polymerase I and sealed with E. Coli DNA Ligase. An optimization of this procedure relies on low RNase H activity of M-MLV to nick mRNA with remaining RNA later removed by adding RNase H after DNA Polymerase translation of the second-strand cDNA. This prevents lost sequence information at the 5' end of the mRNA.\nApplications.\nComplementary DNA is often used in gene cloning or as gene probes or in the creation of a cDNA library. When scientists transfer a gene from one cell into another cell in order to express the new genetic material as a protein in the recipient cell, the cDNA will be added to the recipient (rather than the entire gene), because the DNA for an entire gene may include DNA that does not code for the protein or that interrupts the coding sequence of the protein (e.g., introns). Partial sequences of cDNAs are often obtained as expressed sequence tags.\nWith amplification of DNA sequences via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) now commonplace, one will typically conduct reverse transcription as an initial step, followed by PCR to obtain an exact sequence of cDNA for intra-cellular expression. This is achieved by designing sequence-specific DNA primers that hybridize to the 5' and 3' ends of a cDNA region coding for a protein. Once amplified, the sequence can be cut at each end with nucleases and inserted into one of many small circular DNA sequences known as expression vectors. Such vectors allow for self-replication, inside the cells, and potentially integration in the host DNA. They typically also contain a strong promoter to drive transcription of the target cDNA into mRNA, which is then translated into protein.\ncDNA is also used to study gene expression via methods such as RNA-seq or RT-qPCR. For sequencing, RNA must be fragmented due to sequencing platform size limitations. Additionally, second-strand synthesized cDNA must be ligated with adapters that allow cDNA fragments to be PCR amplified and bind to sequencing flow cells. Gene-specific analysis methods commonly use microarrays and RT-qPCR to quantify cDNA levels via fluorometric and other methods.\nOn 13 June 2013, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of \"Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics\" that while naturally occurring genes cannot be patented, cDNA is patent-eligible because it does not occur naturally.\nViruses and retrotransposons.\nSome viruses also use cDNA to turn their viral RNA into mRNA (viral RNA \u2192 cDNA \u2192 mRNA). The mRNA is used to make viral proteins to take over the host cell.\nAn example of this first step from viral RNA to cDNA can be seen in the HIV cycle of infection. Here, the host cell membrane becomes attached to the virus' lipid envelope which allows the viral capsid with two copies of viral genome RNA to enter the host. The cDNA copy is then made through reverse transcription of the viral RNA, a process facilitated by the chaperone CypA and a viral capsid associated reverse transcriptase.\ncDNA is also generated by retrotransposons in eukaryotic genomes. Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that move themselves within, and sometimes between, genomes via RNA intermediates. This mechanism is shared with viruses with the exclusion of the generation of infectious particles.\nReferences.\nMark D.

Speeds up to 19.2 kbit/s were possible, though real world speeds seldom reached higher than 9.6\u00a0kbit/s. The service was discontinued in conjunction with the retirement of the parent AMPS service; it has been functionally replaced by faster services such as 1xRTT, Evolution-Data Optimized, and UMTS/High Speed Packet Access (HSPA).\nDeveloped in the early 1990s, CDPD was large on the horizon as a future technology. However, it had difficulty competing against existing slower but less expensive Mobitex and DataTAC systems, and never quite gained widespread acceptance before newer, faster standards such as General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) became dominant.\nCDPD had very limited consumer products. AT&amp;T Wireless first sold the technology in the United States under the PocketNet brand. It was one of the first products of wireless web service. Digital Ocean, Inc. an original equipment manufacturer licensee of the Apple Newton, sold the Seahorse product, which integrated the Newton handheld computer, an AMPS/CDPD handset/modem along with a web browser in 1996, winning the CTIA's hardware product of the year award as a smartphone, arguably the world's first. A company named OmniSky provided service for Palm V devices. OmniSky then filed for bankruptcy in 2001 then was picked up by EarthLink Wireless. The technician that developed the tech support for all of the wireless technology was a man by the name of Myron Feasel he was brought from company to company ending up at Palm. Sierra Wireless sold PCMCIA devices and Airlink sold a serial modem. \nBoth of these were used by police and fire departments for dispatch. Wireless later sold CDPD under the Wireless Internet brand (not to be confused with Wireless Internet Express, their brand for GPRS/EDGE data). PocketNet was generally considered a failure with competition from 2G services such as Sprint's Wireless Web. AT&amp;T Wireless sold four PocketNet Phone models to the public: the Samsung Duette and the Mitsubishi MobileAccess-120 were AMPS/CDPD PocketNet phones introduced in October 1997; and two IS-136/CDPD Digital PocketNet phones, the Mitsubishi T-250 and the Ericsson R289LX.\nDespite its limited success as a consumer offering, CDPD was adopted in a number of enterprise and government networks. It was particularly popular as a first-generation wireless data solution for telemetry devices (machine to machine communications) and for public safety mobile data terminals.\nIn 2004, major carriers in the United States announced plans to shut down CDPD service. In July 2005, the AT&amp;T Wireless and Cingular Wireless CDPD networks were shut down.\nCDPD Network and system.\nPrimary elements of a CDPD network are:\n1. End systems: physical &amp; logical end systems that exchange information\n2. Intermediate systems: CDPD infrastructure elements that store, forward &amp; route the information\nThere are 2 kinds of End systems\n1. Mobile end system: subscriber unit to access CDPD network over a wireless interface\n2. Fixed end system: common host/server that is connected to the CDPD backbone and providing access to specific application and data\nThere are 2 kinds of Intermediate systems\n1. Generic intermediate system: simple router with no knowledge of mobility issues\n2. mobile data intermediate system: specialized intermediate system that routes data based on its knowledge of the current location of Mobile end system. It is a set of hardware and software functions that provide switching, accounting, registration, authentication, encryption, and so on.\nThe design of CDPD was based on several design objectives that are often repeated in designing overlay networks or new networks. A lot of emphasis was laid on open architectures and reusing as much of the existing RF infrastructure as possible. The design goal of CDPD included location independence and independence fro, service provider, so that coverage could be maximized; application transparency and multiprotocol support, interoperability between products from multiple vendors."}

Creatures of statute may include municipalities and other artificial legal entities or relationships. Thus, when a statute in some fashion requires the formation of a corporate body\u2014often for governmental purposes\u2014such bodies when formed are known as \"creatures of statute.\" The same concept is also expressed with the phrase \"creature of the state.\"\nThe term \"creature of statute\" is most common to the United States. In the United Kingdom, these bodies are simply called statutory corporations (or statutory bodies) and generally have some governmental function. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority is an example. In a wider sense, most companies in the UK are created under statute since the Companies Act 1985 specifies how a company may be created by a member of the public, but these companies are not called 'statutory corporations'. Often, in American legal and business documents that speak of governing bodies (\"e.g.\", a board that governs small businesses in China) these bodies are described as \"creatures of statute\" to inform readers of their origins and format although the national governments that created them may not term them as creatures of statute. Australia also uses the term \"creature of statute\" to describe some governmental bodies.\nThe importance of a corporate body, regardless of its exact function, when such a body is a creature of statute is that its active functions can only be within the scope detailed by the statute which created that corporation. Thereby, the creature of statute is the tangible manifestation of the functions or work described by a given statute. The jurisdiction of a body that is a creature of statute is also therefore limited to the functional scope written into the laws that created that body. Unlike most (private) corporate bodies, creatures of statute cannot expand their business interests into other diverse areas.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The CGPM is made up of delegates of the governments of the member states and observers from the Associates of the CGPM. It elects the International Committee for Weights and Measures (abbreviated CIPM from the ) as the supervisory board of the BIPM to direct and supervise it.\nInitially the work of the BIPM concerned the kilogram and the metre, but in 1921 the scope of the Metre Convention was extended to accommodate all physical measurements and hence all aspects of the metric system. In 1960 the 11th CGPM approved the title International System of Units, usually known as \"SI\".\nThe General Conference receives the report of the CIPM on work accomplished; it discusses and examines the arrangements required to ensure the propagation and improvement of the International System of Units (SI); it endorses the results of new fundamental metrological determinations and various scientific resolutions of international scope; and it decides all major issues concerning the organization and development of the BIPM, including its financial endowment.\nThe CGPM meets in Paris, usually once every four years. The 25th meeting of the CGPM took place from 18 to 20 November 2014, the 26th meeting of the CGPM took place in Versailles from 13 to 16 November 2018, and the 27th meeting of the CGPM took place from 15 to 18 November 2022.\nEstablishment.\nOn 20 May 1875 an international treaty known as the \"Convention du M\u00e8tre\" (Metre Convention) was signed by 17 states. This treaty established an international organization, the Bureau international des poids et mesures (BIPM), which has two governing organs:\nThe organization has a permanent laboratory and secretariat function (sometimes referred to as the Headquarters), the activities of which include the establishment of the basic standards and scales of the principal physical quantities and maintenance of the international prototype standards.\nThe CGPM acts on behalf of the governments of its members. In so doing, it elects members to the CIPM, receives reports from the CIPM which it passes on to the governments and national laboratories on member states, examines and where appropriate approves proposals from the CIPM in respect of changes to the International System of Units (SI), approves the budget for the BIPM (over \u20ac13 million in 2018) and it decides all major issues concerning the organization and development of the BIPM.\nThe structure is analogous to that of a stock corporation. The BIPM is the organization, the CGPM is the general meeting of the shareholders, the CIPM is the board of directors appointed by the CGPM, and the staff at the site in Saint-Cloud perform the day-to-day work.\nMembership criteria.\nThe CGPM recognises two classes of membership \u2013 full membership for those states that wish to participate in the activities of the BIPM and associate membership for those countries or economies that only wish to participate in the CIPM MRA program. Associate members have observer status at the CGPM. Since all formal liaison between the convention organizations and national governments is handled by the member state's ambassador to France, it is implicit that member states must have diplomatic relations with France, though during both world wars, nations that were at war with France retained their membership of the CGPM. CGPM meetings are chaired by the Pr\u00e9sident de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de Paris.\nOf the twenty countries that attended the Conference of the Metre in 1875, representatives of seventeen signed the convention on 20 May 1875. In April 1884, H. J. Chaney, Warden of Standards in London unofficially contacted the BIPM inquiring whether the BIPM would calibrate some metre standards that had been manufactured in the United Kingdom.

These committees are under the authority of the CIPM. The president of each committee, who is expected to take the chair at CC meetings, is usually a member of the CIPM. Apart from the CCU, membership of a CC is open to National Metrology Institutes (NMIs) of Member States that are recognized internationally as most expert in the field. NMIs from Member States that are active in the field, but lack the expertise to become Members, are able to attend CC meetings as observers.\nThese committees are:\nThe CCU's role is to advise on matters related to the development of the SI and the preparation of the SI brochure.

{"id": "7341", "revid": "1121468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7341", "title": "Cowboy Bebop", "text": "Japanese anime television series\n is a Japanese neo-noir space Western anime television series that aired on TV Tokyo and Wowow from 1998 to 1999. Created and animated by Sunrise, it was led by a production team of director Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane, and composer Yoko Kanno, who are collectively billed as Hajime Yatate.\nThe series, which ran for twenty-six episodes (dubbed \"sessions\"), is set in the year 2071, and follows the lives of a traveling bounty-hunting crew aboard a spaceship, the \"Bebop\". Although it incorporates a wide variety of genres, the series draws most heavily from science fiction, Western, and noir films. It explores themes such as existential boredom, loneliness, and the inability to escape one's past.\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" was a critical and commercial success both in Japanese and international markets, most notably in the United States, and has been widely hailed as one of the best animated series of all time. It garnered several major anime and science fiction awards and received acclaim from critics and audiences for its style, characters, story, voice acting, animation, and soundtrack. The English dub was particularly lauded and is regarded as one of the best anime English dubs. Credited with helping to introduce anime to a new wave of Western viewers in the early 2000s, \"Cowboy Bebop\" has also been called a gateway series.\nPlot.\nIn the year 2071, roughly fifty years after an accident with a hyperspace gateway that made Earth almost uninhabitable, humanity has colonized most of the rocky planets and moons of the Solar System. Amid a rising crime rate, the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) set up a legalized contract system, in which registered bounty hunters (also referred to as \"Cowboys\") chase criminals and bring them in alive in return for a reward. The series' protagonists are bounty hunters working from the spaceship \"Bebop\". The initial crew consists of Spike Spiegel, an exiled former hitman of the criminal Red Dragon Syndicate, and Jet Black, a former ISSP officer. They are later joined by Faye Valentine, an amnesiac con artist; Edward Wong, an eccentric child, skilled in hacking; and Ein, a genetically engineered Pembroke Welsh Corgi with human-like intelligence. Throughout the series, the team gets involved in disastrous mishaps leaving them without money, while often confronting familiar faces and events from their pasts: These include Jet's reasons for leaving the ISSP and Faye's past as a young woman from Earth injured in an accident and cryogenically frozen to save her life. \nWhile much of the show is episodic, the main story arc focuses on Spike and his deadly rivalry with Vicious, an ambitious and ruthless criminal of the Red Dragon Syndicate. Spike and Vicious were once partners and friends. However, when Spike begins an affair with Vicious's girlfriend Julia and resolves to leave the syndicate with her, Vicious seeks to eliminate Spike by blackmailing Julia into killing him. Julia hides to protect herself and Spike, while Spike fakes his death to escape the syndicate. In the present, Julia comes out of hiding and reunites with Spike, intending to make their planned future a reality. Vicious, having staged a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" and taken over the syndicate, sends hitmen after the pair. Julia is killed, leaving Spike alone. Spike leaves the \"Bebop\" after finally apologizing to Faye and Jet. Upon infiltrating the syndicate, he finds Vicious on the top floor of the building and confronts him after dispatching the remaining Red Dragon members. The final battle ends with Spike killing Vicious, only to be seriously wounded himself in the ensuing confrontation. Looking up to the sky, Spike sees a vision of Julia. The series concludes as Spike descends the main staircase of the building into the rising sun before eventually falling to the ground in front of the remaining syndicate members, presumably dead.\nGenre and themes.\nShinichir\u014d Watanabe created a special tagline for the series to promote it during its original presentation, calling it \"a new genre unto itself\". The line was inserted before and after commercial breaks during its Japanese and US broadcasts. Later, Watanabe called the phrase an \"exaggeration\". The show is a hybrid of multiple genres, most notably Westerns, noirs, pulp fiction. One reviewer described it as \"space opera meets noir, meets comedy, meets cyberpunk\". It has also been called a \"genre-busting space Western\".\nThe musical style was emphasized in many of the episode titles. Multiple philosophical themes are explored throughout the series using the characters, including existentialism, existential boredom, loneliness, and the effects of the past. Other concepts referenced include environmentalism and capitalism. The series also makes specific references to or pastiches multiple films, including the works of John Woo and Bruce Lee, \"Midnight Run\", \"\", and \"Alien\". Additionally, the series incorporates extensive references and elements from science fiction, bearing strong similarities to the cyberpunk fiction of William Gibson. Several planets and space stations in the series are made in Earth's image. The streets of celestial objects such as Ganymede resemble a modern port city, while Mars features shopping malls, theme parks, casinos and cities. This setting has been described as \"one part Chinese diaspora and two parts wild west\".\nCharacters.\nThe characters were created by Watanabe and designed by Toshihiro Kawamoto. Watanabe envisioned each character as an extension of his own personality, or as an opposite person to himself. Each character, from the main cast to supporting characters, were designed to be outlaws unable to fit into society. Kawamoto designed the characters so they could be easily distinguished from one another. All the main cast are characterized by a deep sense of loneliness or resignation to their fate and past. From the perspective of Brian Camp and Julie Davis, the main characters resemble the main ones of the manga and anime series \"Lupin III\", if only superficially, given their more troubled pasts and more complex personalities.\nThe series's primary focus is on main protagonist Spike Spiegel (voiced by Koichi Yamadera), a space cowboy with fluffy green hair and often seen wearing a blue suit, with the overall theme of the series being Spike's past and its karmic effect on him. Spike is portrayed as someone who has lost his expectations for the future, having been separated from the woman he loved, and so was in a near-constant lethargy. Spike's artificial eye was included as Watanabe wanted his characters to have flaws. He was originally going to be given an eyepatch, but this decision was vetoed by producers.\nJet Black (voiced by Unsh\u014d Ishizuka) is shown as someone who lost confidence in his former life and has become cynical about the state of society. Spike and Jet were designed to be opposites, with Spike being thin and wearing smart attire, while Jet was bulky and wore more casual clothing. The clothing, which was dark in color, also reflected their states of mind. The rebellious hustler Faye Valentine, hacker \"Radical\" Edward (voiced by Aoi Tada), and \"data dog\" Ein join the crew in later episodes. Their designs were intended to contrast with Spike's. Faye was described by her voice actress Megumi Hayashibara as initially being an \"ugly\" woman, with her defining traits being her liveliness, sensuality and humanity. To emphasize her situation when first introduced, she was compared to Poker Alice, a famous Western figure.\nEdward and Ein were the only main characters to have real-life models. The former had her behavior based on the antics of Yoko Kanno as observed by Watanabe when he first met her. While generally portrayed as carefree and eccentric, Edward is motivated by a sense of loneliness after being abandoned by her father. Kawamoto initially based Ein's design on a friend's pet corgi, later getting one himself to use as a motion model.\nProduction.\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" was created and developed by animation studio Sunrise and Hajime Yatate, the well-known pseudonym for the collective contributions of Sunrise's animation staff. The leader of the series' creative team was director Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, most notable at the time for directing \"Macross Plus\" and \"\". Other leading members of Sunrise's creative team were screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto, character designer Toshihiro Kawamoto, mechanical art designer Kimitoshi Yamane, composer Yoko Kanno, and producers Masahiko Minami and Yoshiyuki Takei. Most of them had previously worked together, in addition to having credits on other popular anime titles. Nobumoto had scripted \"Macross Plus\", Kawamoto had designed the characters for \"Gundam\", and Kanno had composed the music for \"Macross Plus\" and \"The Vision of Escaflowne\". Yamane had not worked with Watanabe yet, but his credits in anime included \"Bubblegum Crisis\" and \"The Vision of Escaflowne\". Minami joined the project as he wanted to do something different from his previous work on mecha anime.\nConcept.\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" was Watanabe's first project as solo director, as he had been co-director in his previous works. His original concept was for a film, and during production he treated each episode as a miniature movie. His main inspiration for \"Cowboy Bebop\" was the first series of the anime \"Lupin III\", a crime drama focusing on the exploits of the series' titular character. When developing the series' story, Watanabe began by creating the characters first. He explained, \"the first image that occurred to me was one of Spike, and from there I tried to build a story around him, trying to make him cool.\" While the original dialogue of the series avoided any profanities, its level of sophistication was made appropriate to adults in a criminal environment. Watanabe described \"Cowboy Bebop\" as \"80% serious story and 20% humorous touch\". The comical episodes were harder for the team to write than the serious ones, and though several events in them seemed random, they were carefully planned in advance. Watanabe conceived the series' ending early on, and each episode involving Spike and Vicious was meant to foreshadow their final confrontation. Some of the staff were unhappy about this approach as a continuation of the series would be difficult. While he considered altering the ending, he eventually settled with his original idea. The reason for the ending was that Watanabe did not want the series to become like \"Star Trek\", with him being tied to doing it for years.\nDevelopment.\nThe project had initially originated with Bandai's toy division as a sponsor, with the goal of selling spacecraft toys. Watanabe recalled his only instruction was \"So long as there's a spaceship in it, you can do whatever you want.\" But upon viewing early footage, it became clear that Watanabe's vision for the series did not match Bandai's. Believing the series would never sell toy merchandise, Bandai pulled out of the project, leaving it in development hell until sister company Bandai Visual stepped in to sponsor it. Since there was no need to merchandise toys with the property any more, Watanabe had free rein in the development of the series. Watanabe wanted to design not just a space adventure series for adolescent boys but a program that would also appeal to sophisticated adults. During the making of \"Bebop\", Watanabe often attempted to rally the animation staff by telling them that the show would be something memorable up to three decades later. While some of them were doubtful of that at the time, Watanabe many years later expressed his happiness to have been proven right in retrospect. He joked that if Bandai Visual had not intervened then \"you might be seeing me working the supermarket checkout counter right now.\"\nThe city locations of the show were generally inspired by of New York and Hong Kong. The atmospheres of the planets and the ethnic groups in \"Cowboy Bebop\" mostly originated from Watanabe's ideas, with some collaboration from set designers Isamu Imakake, Shoji Kawamori, and Dai Sat\u014d. The animation staff established the particular planet atmospheres early in the production of the series before working on the ethnic groups. It was Watanabe who wanted to have several of ethnically diverse groups appear in the series. Mars was the planet most often used in \"Cowboy Bebop\"'s storylines, with Satoshi Toba, the cultural and setting producer, explaining that the other planets \"were unexpectedly difficult to use\". He stated that each planet in the series had unique features, and the producers had to take into account the characteristics of each planet in the story. For the final episode, Toba explained that it was not possible for the staff to have the dramatic rooftop scene occur on Venus, so the staff \"ended up normally falling back to Mars\". In creating the backstory, Watanabe envisioned a world that was \"multinational rather than stateless\". In spite of certain American influences in the series, he stipulated that the country had been destroyed decades prior to the story, later saying the notion of the United States as the center of the world repelled him.\nThe specific types of guns in the show were chosen by Watanabe, and in discussion with set designer Isamu Imakake and mechanical designer Kimitoshi Yamane. Setting producer Satoshi Toba said, \"They talked about how they didn't want common guns, because that wouldn't be very interesting, and so they decided on these guns.\"\nMusic.\nThe music for \"Cowboy Bebop\" was composed by Yoko Kanno and primarily comprises jazz, along with western and opera. Kanno formed the blues and jazz band Seatbelts to perform the music. According to Kanno, the music was one of the first aspects to begin production, before most of the characters, story, or animation had been finalized.\nWatanabe said Kanno operated independently: \"She gets inspired on her own, follows up on her own imagery, and comes to me saying 'this is the song we need for \"Cowboy Bebop\"', and composes something completely on her own.\" She was sometimes surprised at how her music was mixed into the show, at times wishing it had been used elsewhere, but felt that none of its uses were \"inappropriate\". She was pleased with the working environment, finding the team more relaxed than other teams she had worked with.\nWatanabe said Kanno's music inspired him to create new scenes, which in turn inspired Kanno to create more music, including music she had not been commissioned for. According to Watanabe, while this normally would be \"unforgivable and unacceptable\", it was a \"big hit\" with \"Cowboy Bebop\". Watanabe described their collaboration \"a game of catch between the two of us in developing the music and creating the TV series\". \"Cowboy Bebop\"'s music has been released across seven soundtrack albums, two singles and EPs, and two compilations through label Victor Entertainment.\nDistribution.\nBroadcast.\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" debuted on TV Tokyo, one of the main broadcasters of anime in Japan, airing from April 3 until June 26, 1998. Due to its 6:00\u00a0p.m. timeslot and depictions of graphic violence, the show's first run only included episodes 2, 3, 7 to 15, 18 and a special. Later that year, the series aired in its entirety from October 23 until April 24, 1999, on satellite network Wowow. The full series has also been broadcast across Japan by anime television network Animax, which has aired the series via its respective networks across Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Asia.\nThe first non-Asian country to air \"Cowboy Bebop\" was Italy. There, it was first aired on October 21, 1999, on MTV, where it inaugurated the 9:00\u201310:30\u00a0p.m. \"Anime Night\" programming block.\nIn the United States, \"Cowboy Bebop\" was one of the first programs shown when Cartoon Network's late night block Adult Swim debuted on September 2, 2001, being the first anime shown on the block that night at midnight ET. During its original run on Adult Swim, episodes 6, 8, and 22 were skipped due to their violent themes in wake of the September 11 attacks. By the third run of the series, all these episodes had premiered for the first time. \"Cowboy Bebop\" was successful enough to be broadcast repeatedly for four years. It has been run at least once every year since 2007, and HD remasters of the show began broadcasting in 2015. In the United Kingdom, it was first broadcast in 2002 on the adult-oriented channel CNX. From November 6, 2007, it repeatedly aired on AnimeCentral until the channel's closure in August 2008. In Australia, \"Cowboy Bebop\" was first broadcast on pay television in 2002 on Adult Swim, and on free-to-air-TV on ABC2 (the national digital public television channel) on January 2, 2007. It has re-aired several times, most recently starting in 2008. \"\" also aired on February 23, 2009, on SBS (a hybrid-funded Australian public broadcasting television network). In Canada, \"Cowboy Bebop\" was first broadcast on December 24, 2006, on Razer.\nIn Latin America, the series was first broadcast on pay-TV in 2001 on Locomotion. It aired again on January 9, 2016, on I.Sat.\nHome media.\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" has been released in four separate editions in North America. The first edition was released in VHS format either as a box set or as seven individual tapes. The tapes were sold through Anime Village, a division of Bandai.\nThe second edition was released in 2000 individually, and featured uncut versions of the original 26 episodes. In 2001, these DVDs were collected in the special edition \"Perfect Sessions\", which included the first 6 DVDs, the first \"Cowboy Bebop\" soundtrack, and a collector's box. At the time of release, the art box from the \"Perfect Sessions\" was made available for purchase on The Right Stuff International as a solo item for collectors who already owned the series.\nThe third edition, \"The Best Sessions\", was released in 2002 and featured what Bandai considered to be the best 6 episodes of the series remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS surround sound.\nThe fourth edition, \"Cowboy Bebop Remix\", was also distributed on 6 discs and included the original 26 uncut episodes, with sound remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and video remastered under the supervision of Shinichir\u014d Watanabe. This release also included various extras that were not present in the original release. \"Cowboy Bebop Remix\" was itself collected as the \"Cowboy Bebop Remix: The Complete Collection\" in 2008.\nIn December 2012, newly founded distributor Anime Limited announced via Facebook and Twitter that they had acquired the home video license of the series for release in the United Kingdom. Part 1 of the Blu-ray collection was released on July 29, 2013, while Part 2 was released on October 14. The standard DVD Complete Collection was originally meant to be released on September 23, 2013, with Part 2 of the Blu-ray release, but due to mastering and manufacturing errors, the Complete Collection was delayed until November 27. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment in 2012, Funimation (later Crunchyroll, LLC) and Sunrise had announced that they rescued \"Cowboy Bebop\", along with a handful of other former Bandai Entertainment properties, for home video and digital release. Funimation released the series on Blu-ray and DVD on December 16, 2014. The series was released in four separate editions: standard DVD, standard Blu-ray, an Amazon.com exclusive Blu-ray/DVD combo, and a Funimation.com exclusive Blu-ray/DVD combo. Crunchyroll released a limited edition Blu-ray box set on April 4, 2023, for its 25th anniversary.\nStreaming.\nNetflix acquired the streaming rights to the original anime, with all 26 episodes available worldwide as of October 21, 2021. As of October 21, 2023, the show is unavailable in the United States and Canada. The series is available on Hulu and Funimation in the United States. On March 1, 2022, the anime became available on Crunchyroll to consolidate both Funimation and Wakanim into the service.\nRelated media.\nManga.\nTwo \"Cowboy Bebop\" manga series adaptations have been released, both published by Kadokawa Shoten and serialized in Kadokawa Corporation's \"sh\u014djo\" manga magazine \"Asuka Fantasy DX\".&lt;ref name=\"DX 10/1997\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"DX 11/1998\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first manga series, titled \"Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star\" and illustrated by Cain Kuga, was serialized from October 1997, before the anime series' release, to July 1998. It was collected into two \"tank\u014dbon\" volumes in 1998, the first one in May and the second one in September. The second manga series, simply titled \"Cowboy Bebop\" and illustrated by Yutaka Nanten, was serialized from November 1998 to March 2000. It was collected into three volumes, the first two in April and October 1999, and the third one in April 2000. Both manga series were licensed by Tokyopop for release in North America.\nVideo games.\nA \"Cowboy Bebop\" video game, developed and published by Bandai, was released in Japan for the PlayStation on May 14, 1998. A PlayStation 2 video game, \"\", was released in Japan on August 25, 2005, and an English version had been set for release in North America. However, in January 2007, \"IGN\" reported that the release had likely been cancelled, speculating that it did not survive Bandai's merger with Namco to form Bandai Namco Games.\nIn 2022, \"Cowboy Bebop\" made its debut in the Bandai Namco crossover game \"Super Robot Wars T\", which is traditionally focused on turn-based mecha combat. In 2024, skins based on \"Cowboy Bebop\" characters were added to Blizzard Entertainment's first-person shooter \"Overwatch 2\". In 2025, skins based on \"Cowboy Bebop\" characters Spike Spiegel and Faye Valentine were added to Epic Games' \"Fortnite Battle Royale.\"\nFilm.\nAn anime film taking place between episodes 22 and 23 of the television series, titled , known in English as \"\", was produced, with the staff and crew from the show returning to their roles. It was released in Japan in September 2001 and in the United States in August 2002.\nOn July 22, 2008, \"If\" published an article on its website regarding a rumor of a live-action \"Cowboy Bebop\" film in development by 20th Century Fox. Producer Erwin Stoff said that the film's development was in the early stages, and that they had \"just signed it\". Keanu Reeves was to play the role of Spike Spiegel. \"Variety\" confirmed on January 15, 2009 that production company Sunrise Animation would be \"closely involved with the development of the English-language project\". The site also confirmed Kenji Uchida, Shinichir\u014d Watanabe and series writer Keiko Nobumoto as associate producers, series producer Masahiko Minami as a production consultant, and Peter Craig as screenwriter. This was lauded by various sources as a promising move for the potential quality of the film. At the time, it was slated to release in 2011, but problems with the budget delayed its production. The submitted script was sent back for rewrite to reduce the cost and little has been heard about it since an interview with producer Joshua Long on October 15, 2010; the project currently languishes in development hell. On October 25, 2014, series director Watanabe was asked about the live action film at the MCM London Comic Con. He stated: \"I'm afraid I don't know what they're thinking in Hollywood. Apparently the project hasn't come to a stop but I don't know how it's going to progress from here on. I hear that there are a lot of 'Hollywood' problems.\"\nLive-action series.\nIn 2017, it was announced that an American live-action adaptation of the series was being developed by Tomorrow Studios, a partnership between Marty Adelstein and ITV Studios, with executive production by Sunrise Inc. Christopher Yost was to write the series, and Netflix announced that it would distribute it. On April 4, 2019, Variety reported that John Cho, Mustafa Shakir, Daniella Pineda and Alex Hassell had been cast. Production was shut down in October 2019 due to a knee injury sustained by Cho, setting production back by more than six months. On April 17, 2020, it was revealed that the episodes would be an hour long. On May 19, 2020, Adelstein revealed that there were three finished episodes and that they had shot at least six episodes before Cho's knee injury. In the same interview it was revealed that the director of the anime series, Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, had been hired as a creative consultant. Production in New Zealand resumed on September 30, 2020, following a COVID-19 lockdown in the country. The series was released on November 19, 2021, to mixed-to-negative reviews. On December 9, 2021, it was announced that it would not be renewed for a second season, with Netflix cancelling it entirely due to poor ratings and reception.\nOther media.\nAn official side story titled \"Cowboy Bebop: UT\" tells the story of Ural and Victoria Terpsichore (V.T. from the episode \"Heavy Metal Queen\") when they were bounty hunters. The story was available in its own official site; however the website was closed and is currently available at the site mirror.\nA deck-building board game, \"Cowboy Bebop: Space Serenade\", was released in 2019.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" received unanimous acclaim upon its debut. In 1998, Japanese critic Keith Rhee highlighted the series as a standout in an otherwise \"run-of-the-mill\" season, praising its overall production values, and singling out Kanno's soundtrack as \"a much-welcome change from all the sugary J-pop tunes of most anime features\". Rhee also highlighted the show's Japanese \"all-star cast\", which his colleague Mark L. Johnson described as being filled with \"veteran voice talent\", turning in even greater performances than those of their \"above average\" US counterparts. In 1999, Australian magazine \"Hyper\" reviewed the anime and rated it 9.5 out of 10.\nAnime News Network's Mike Crandol gave the series an 'A+' rating for the dubbed version, and an 'A' rating for the subbed version. He characterized the series as \"one of the most popular and respected anime titles in history\", before adding that it was \"a unique television show which skillfully transcends all kinds of genres\". Crandol praised its characters as \"some of the most endearing characters to ever grace an anime\", and commended the voice acting, especially the \"flawless English cast\". He also complimented the series' \"movie-quality\" animation, \"sophisticated\" writing, and its \"incredible\" musical score. Crandol hailed \"Cowboy Bebop\" as a \"landmark\" anime \"that will be remembered long after many others have been forgotten\", and went on to call it \"one of the greatest anime titles ever\". Additionally, Michael Toole of \"Anime News Network\" named \"Cowboy Bebop\" as one of the most important anime of the 1990s.\nT.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the entire series a perfect score of 5 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Christina Carpenter believing \"Cowboy Bebop\" as \"one of the best [anime]\" and touting it as a masterpiece that \"puts most anime...and Hollywood, to shame\". She described it as a \"very stylish, beautifully crafted series that deserves much more attention than it gets\". Carpenter praised the animation as \"a rarity and a marvel to behold\" and that it was \"beyond superb\", and the plot and characterization as having \"a sophistication and subtlety that is practically one-of-a-kind\". She also praised the soundtrack, and hailed the opening theme as one of the best intro pieces she had ever heard. Carpenter went to say that \"Bebop\" was a \"must-have for any serious collector of Japanese animation\".\nIn his article \"Asteroid Blues: The Lasting Legacy of \"Cowboy Bebop\"\", \"The Atlantic\" writer Alex Suskind states, \"On paper, \"Cowboy Bebop\", the legendary cult anime series from Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, reads like something John Wayne, Elmore Leonard, and Philip K. Dick came up with during a wild, all-night whiskey bender.\" He goes on to write, \"The response from critics and fans may have sounded hyperbolic\u2014the word 'masterpiece' was thrown around a great deal\u2014but the praise was justified. First-time solo director Watanabe had created a gorgeous tale of morality, romance, and violence\u2013a dark look at the lives of outlaws that's shot like an independent film.\"\nIn January 2015, television writer Kyle Mills of \"DVD Talk\" awarded the series five stars upon review. He stated, \"Regardless of the medium, be it live action television, film, or animation, \"Cowboy Bebop\" is simply one of the finest examples of storytelling ever created.\" In his review, he describes the finale as \"one of the best in television history\", referring to it as a \"widely revered\" ending that \"still sparks fan conversation, resonating with viewers 15 years on\". He closes by writing, \"\"Cowboy Bebop\" ends with a bang.\"\nIn his 2018 review of the series, \"Paste\" critic John Maher wrote, \"It feels like a \"magnum opus\" produced at the pinnacle of a long career despite being, almost unbelievably, Watanabe's first series as a director. It is a masterwork that should justly rank among the best works of television of all time.\" It was also placed at #1 on the publication's list of the \"50 Best Anime Series of All Time\".\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 100% based on 23 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Blending a head-spinning array of genres and references, \"Cowboy Bebop\" is an anime television classic that must be experienced.\"\nIn an April 2019 interview with Diego Molano, creator of \"Victor &amp; Valentino\", he said that Cowboy Bebop was the first anime he \"obsessed over\", as he spent time tracking down VHS tapes of the show in high school. He also argued that this series showed him \"how cinematic and emotional animation can be\".\nAccolades.\nAt the 1999 Anime Grand Prix awards for the anime of 1998, \"Cowboy Bebop\" won two first place awards: Spike Spiegel was awarded the best male character; and Megumi Hayashibara was awarded the best voice actor for her role as Faye Valentine. \"Cowboy Bebop\" also received rankings in other categories: the series itself was awarded the second best anime series; Faye Valentine and Ed were ranked the fifth and ninth best female characters respectively; \"Tank!\" and \"The Real Folk Blues\" were ranked the third and fifteenth best songs respectively; and \"Ballad of Fallen Angels\", \"Speak Like a Child\", \"Jamming with Edward\" and \"Mish-Mash Blues\" were ranked the second, eighth, eighteenth and 20th best episodes respectively.\nAt the 2000 Anime Grand Prix awards for the anime of 1999, \"Cowboy Bebop\" won the same two first place awards again: best male character for Spike Spiegel; and best voice actor for Megumi Hayashibara. Other rankings the series received are: second best anime series; sixth best female character for Faye Valentine; seventh and twelfth best song for \"Tank!\" and \"Blue\" respectively; and third and seventeenth best episode for \"The Real Folk Blues (Part 2)\" and \"Hard Luck Woman\" respectively. In the 2000 Seiun Awards, Cowboy Bebop was awarded for Best Media of the Year.\nA 2004 poll in \"Newtype USA\", the US edition of the Japanese magazine \"Newtype\", asked its readers to vote the \"Top 25 Anime Titles of All Time\"; \"Cowboy Bebop\" ranked second on the list, after \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\", placing it as one of the most socially relevant and influential anime series ever created. During that same year, \"Cinefantastique\" listed the anime as one of the \"10 Essential Animations\", citing the series' \"gleeful mix of noir-style, culture-hopping inclusiveness and music\". In 2007, the American Anime magazine \"Anime Insider\" listed the \"50 Best Anime Ever\" by compiling lists of industry regulars and magazine staff, and \"Cowboy Bebop\" topped the list. In 2012, Madman Entertainment compiled the votes of fans online for \"The Top 20 Madman Anime Titles\" and ranked \"Cowboy Bebop\" at seventh.\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" has been featured in several lists published by \"IGN\". In the 2009 \"Top 100 Animated TV Series\" list, \"Cowboy Bebop\", labelled as \"a very original\u00a0\u2013 and arguably one of the best\u00a0\u2013 anime\", was placed fourteenth, making it the second highest ranking anime on the list after \"Evangelion\", and one of the most influential series of the 1990s. In 2011, \"Bebop\" was ranked 29th in the \"Top 50 Sci-Fi TV Shows\" list, once again being the second-highest ranking anime on the list after \"Evangelion\". In 2006, \"Cowboy Bebop\"'s soundtrack was ranked first in the \"Top Ten Anime Themes and Soundtracks of All-Time\" list, with the series being commented as \"one of the best anime ever and certainly is tops when it comes to music.\" Spike Spiegel was ranked fourth in the \"Top 25 Anime Characters of All Time\" article. \"IGN Movies\" also placed \"Cowboy Bebop\" in its list of \"10 Cartoon Adaptations We'd Like to See\".\nAnalysis.\nThe series has been subject to study and analysis since its debut, with the main focus being on its style and mixture of genres. Miguel Douglas, describing the series style in a review, said that \"the series distinctly establishes itself outside the realm of conventional Japanese animation and instead chooses to forge its own path. With a setting within the realm of science fiction, the series wisely offers a world that seems entirely realistic considering our present time. Free from many of the elements that accompany science fiction in general\u2014whether that be space aliens, giant robots, or laser guns\u2014the series delegates itself towards presenting a world that is quite similar to our own albeit showcasing some technological advances.\" Daryl Surat of \"Otaku USA\", commenting on the series' appeal, said that it was \"that rare breed of science-fiction: 'accessible'. Unlike many anime titles, viewers weren't expected to have knowledge of Japanese culture\u2014character names, signs, and the like were primarily in English to begin with\u2014or have seen any other anime series prior.\" Michelle Onley Pirkle, in her book \"Science Fiction Film, Television, and Adaptation: Across the Screens\", said that \"\"Cowboy Bebop\" is taking a new take on genre, not by creating unique images and sounds, but by playing 'freely' with, 'remixing', or adapting the images and sounds of other familiar genres in a dynamic way.\" Robert Baigent, writing for the \"Graduate Journal of Asia-Pacific Studies\", said that the series' appeal likely stemmed from the trend in anime to emulate Western fiction.\nLegacy.\nIn March 2009, the print and web editions of \"The Onion\"'s \"The A.V. Club\" called \"Cowboy Bebop\" \"rightly a huge hit\", and listed it as a gateway series to understanding the medium of anime as a whole. Suskind said: \"It was unlike anything the genre had seen before. It even approached its music differently. The show kicked off with a wormhole of a theme song, and the soundtrack moves so seamlessly through genres, from rock to country to pop to jazz to funk, it's shocking to learn that one set of musicians is behind it all\". In an interview, producer Sean Akins also stated that the series \"created a whole new world\". \"It's hard for me to quantify the impact that I think it has had. It changed anime. I think people began to think about what shows would be cool. I think it redefined cool within animation, not only in Japan but in the States\". One of the series' main animators, Tensai Okamura, went on to create his own anime in 2007: \"Darker than Black\". Okamura used his experience from \"Cowboy Bebop\" to write the screenplay of \"Darker than Black\", leading to narratives composed of two episodes similar to Japanese dramas.\nAmerican film director, screenwriter, and producer Rian Johnson has cited \"Cowboy Bebop\" as a visual influence on his films, most notably \"Brick\" (2005). \"Ender's Game\" writer Orson Scott Card also praised the series. He stated that the series is \"better than most sci-fi films out there\". He goes on to say that he \"found this series brilliant, but what held me was a combination of strong relationship-based storytelling, a moody visual style that never got old and really smart dialogue\".\nAfter the creation of the series, an interviewer asked Watanabe if he had any plans to create more \"Cowboy Bebop\" material. Watanabe responded by saying that he does not believe that he \"should just keep on making \"Cowboy Bebop\" sequels for the sake of it\". Watanabe added that ending production and \"to quit while we're ahead when people still want more\" is more \"in keeping with the \"Bebop\" spirit\". In a later interview from 2006 with \"The Daily Texan\", Watanabe was asked if there would ever be more \"Cowboy Bebop\". Watanabe's answer was \"someday...maybe, someday\".\nIn May 2020, composer Mason Lieberman partnered with Sunrise and Funimation to produce an official \"Cowboy Bebop\" charity track for COVID-19 relief. This track was released on vinyl and featured the return of original series composer Y\u014dko Kanno, the original recording band Seatbelts, and a collection of forty other special musical guests.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7342", "revid": "51020600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7342", "title": "Clement of Alexandria", "text": "Christian theologian (c. 150 \u2013 c. 215)\nTitus Flavius Clemens, also known as Clement of Alexandria (; c.\u2009150 \u2013 c.\u2009215 AD), was a schematic Christian theologian and philosopher who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. Among his pupils were Origen and Alexander of Jerusalem. A convert to Christianity, he was an educated man who was familiar with classical Greek philosophy and literature. As his three major works demonstrate, Clement was influenced by Hellenistic philosophy to a greater extent than any other Christian thinker of his time, and in particular, by Plato and the Stoics. His secret works, which exist only in fragments, suggest that he was familiar with pre-Christian Jewish esotericism and Gnosticism as well. In one of his works he argued that Greek philosophy had its origin among non-Greeks, claiming that both Plato and Pythagoras were taught by Egyptian scholars.\nClement is usually regarded as a Church Father. He is venerated as a saint in Coptic Christianity, Eastern Catholicism, Ethiopian Christianity, and Anglicanism. He was revered in Western Catholicism until 1586, when his name was removed from the Roman Martyrology by Pope Sixtus V on the advice of Baronius. The Eastern Orthodox Church officially stopped any veneration of Clement of Alexandria in the 10th century. Nonetheless, he is still sometimes referred to as \"Saint Clement of Alexandria\" by both Eastern Orthodox and Catholic authors.\nBiography.\nNeither Clement's birthdate or birthplace is known with any degree of certainty. It is speculated that he was born sometime around 150 AD. According to Epiphanius of Salamis, he was born in Athens, but there is also a tradition of an Alexandrian birth.\nHis parents were pagans and Clement was a convert to Christianity. In the \"Protrepticus\" he displays an extensive knowledge of Greek religion and mystery religions, which could have arisen only from the practice of his family's religion.\nHaving rejected paganism as a young man due to its perceived moral corruption, he travelled in Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine, and Egypt. Clement's journeys were primarily a religious undertaking. In Greece, he encountered an Ionian theologian, who has been identified as Athenagoras of Athens; while in the east, he was taught by an Assyrian, sometimes identified with Tatian, and a Jew, possibly Theophilus of Caesarea.\nIn around 180 AD, Clement reached Alexandria, where he met Pantaenus, who taught at the Catechetical School of Alexandria. Eusebius suggests that Pantaenus was the head of the school, but controversy exists about whether the institutions of the school were formalized in this way before the time of Origen. Clement studied under Pantaenus, and was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Julian before 189. Otherwise, virtually nothing is known of Clement's personal life in Alexandria. He may have been married, a conjecture supported by his writings.\nDuring the Severian persecution of 202\u2013203, Clement left Alexandria. In 211, Alexander of Jerusalem wrote a letter commending him to the Church of Antioch, which may imply that Clement was living in Cappadocia or Jerusalem at that time. He died c.\u2009215 AD at an unknown location.\nTheological works.\nTrilogy.\nThree of Clement's major works have survived in full and they are collectively referred to as a trilogy:\n\"Protrepticus\".\nThe \"Protrepticus\" (: \"Exhortation to the Greeks\") is, as its title suggests, an exhortation to the pagans of Greece to adopt Christianity. Within it, Clement demonstrates his extensive knowledge of pagan mythology and theology. It is chiefly important due to Clement's exposition of religion as an anthropological phenomenon. After a short philosophical discussion, it opens with a history of Greek religion in seven stages. Clement suggests that at first, humans mistakenly believed the Sun, the Moon, and other heavenly bodies to be deities. The next developmental stage was the worship of the products of agriculture, from which he contends the cults of Demeter and Dionysus arose. Humans then paid reverence to revenge and deified human feelings of love and fear, among others. In the following stage, the poets Hesiod and Homer attempt to enumerate the deities; Hesiod's Theogony giving the number of twelve. Finally, humans reached a stage when they proclaimed others, such as Asclepius and Heracles, as deities. Discussing idolatry, Clement contends that the objects of primitive religion were unshaped wood and stone, and idols thus arose when such natural items were carved. Following Plato, Clement is critical of all forms of visual art, suggesting that artworks are but illusions and \"deadly toys\".\nClement criticizes Greek paganism in the \"Protrepticus\" on the basis that its deities are both false and poor moral examples. He attacks the mystery religions for their ritualism and mysticism. In particular, the worshippers of Dionysus are ridiculed by him for their family-based rituals (such as the use of children's toys in ceremony). He suggests at some points that the pagan deities are based on humans, but at other times he suggests that they are misanthropic demons, and he cites several classical sources in support of this second hypothesis. Clement, like many pre-Nicene church fathers, writes favourably about Euhemerus and other rationalist philosophers, on the grounds that they at least saw the flaws in paganism. However, his greatest praise is reserved for Plato, whose apophatic views of God prefigure Christianity.\nThe figure of Orpheus is prominent throughout the Protrepticus narrative, and Clement contrasts the song of Orpheus, representing pagan superstition, with the divine Logos of Christ. According to Clement, through conversion to Christianity alone can one fully participate in the Logos, which is universal truth.\n\"Paedagogus\".\nThe title of \"Paedagogus\", translatable as \"tutor\", refers to Christ as the teacher of all humans, and it features an extended metaphor of Christians as children. It is not simply instructional: Clement intends to show how the Christian should respond to the Love of God authentically. Following Plato (Republic 4:441), he divides life into three elements: character, actions, and passions. The first having been dealt with in the \"Protrepticus\", he devotes the \"Paedagogus\" to reflections on Christ's role in teaching humans to act morally and to control their passions. Despite its explicitly Christian nature, Clement's work draws on Stoic philosophy and pagan literature; Homer, alone, is cited more than sixty times in the work.\nAlthough Christ, like a human, is made in the image of God, he alone shares the likeness of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, one can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational (), removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on and is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.\nClement argues for the equality of sexes, on the grounds that salvation is extended to all humans equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither female nor male, and that God the Father has both female and male aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. Clement is supportive of women playing an active role in the leadership of the church and he provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on gender as set out in the \"Paedagogus\" were influenced by Gnosticism; however, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge (), is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that one is enlightened and comes to know God.\nIn the second book, Clement provides practical rules on living a Christian life. He argues against overindulgence in food and in favour of good table manners. While prohibiting drunkenness, he promotes the drinking of alcohol in moderation following 1 Timothy 5:23. Clement argues for a simple way of life in accordance with the innate simplicity of Christian monotheism. He condemns elaborate and expensive furnishings and clothing, and argues against overly passionate music and perfumes, but Clement does not believe in the abandonment of worldly pleasures and argues that the Christian should be able to express joy in God's creation through gaiety and partying. He opposes the wearing of garlands, because the picking of the flowers ultimately kills a beautiful creation of God, and the garland resembles the crown of thorns.\nClement treats sex at some length. He argues that both promiscuity and sexual abstinence are unnatural, and that the main goal of human sexuality is procreation. He argues that adultery, sex with pregnant women, concubinage, homosexuality, and prostitution all should be avoided as they will not contribute toward the generation of legitimate offspring.\nIn his third book, Clement continues along a similar vein, condemning cosmetics on the grounds that it is one's soul, not the body, one should seek to beautify. Clement also opposes the dyeing of men's hair and male depilation as being effeminate. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth that is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a hymn.\n\"Stromata\".\nThe contents of the \"Stromata\", as its title suggests, are miscellaneous. Its place in the trilogy is disputed \u2013 Clement initially intended to write the \"Didasculus\", a work that would complement the practical guidance of the \"Paedagogus\" with a more intellectual schooling in theology. The \"Stromata\" is less systematic and ordered than Clement's other works, and it has been theorized by Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9hat that it was intended for a limited, esoteric readership. Although Eusebius wrote of the eight books of the work, only seven undoubtedly survive. Photius, writing in the 9th century, found various text appended to manuscripts of the seven canonical books, which led Daniel Heinsius to suggest that the original eighth book is lost, and he identified the text purported to be from the eighth book as fragments of the \"Hypotyposes\".\nThe first book starts on the topic of Greek philosophy. Consistent with his other writing, Clement affirms that philosophy had a propaedeutic role for the Greeks, similar to the function of the law for the Jews. He then embarks on a discussion of the origins of Greek culture and technology, arguing that most of the important figures in the Greek world were foreigners, and that Jewish culture was the most significant influence on Greece. In an attempt to demonstrate the primacy of Moses, Clement gives an extended chronology of the world, wherein he dates the birth of Christ to 25 April or May, 4\u20132 BC, and the creation of the world to 5592 BC. The books ends with a discussion on the origin of languages and the possibility of a Jewish influence on Plato.\nThe second book is largely devoted to the respective roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy that is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded on the knowledge of the truth of the Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.\nThe third book covers asceticism. He discusses marriage, which is treated similarly in the \"Paedagogus\". Clement rejects the Gnostic opposition to marriage, arguing that only men who are uninterested in women should remain celibate, and that sex is a positive good if performed within marriage for the purposes of procreation. He argues that this has not always been so: the Fall occurred because Adam and Eve succumbed to their desire for each other, and copulated before the allotted time. He argues against the idea that Christians should reject their family for an ascetic life, which stems from Luke, contending that Jesus would not have contradicted the precept to \"Honour thy Father and thy Mother\", one of the Ten Commandments. Clement concludes that asceticism will only be rewarded if the motivation is Christian in nature, and thus the asceticism of non-Christians such as the gymnosophists is pointless.\nClement begins the fourth book with a belated explanation of the disorganized nature of the work, and gives a brief description of his aims for the remaining three or four books. The fourth book focuses on martyrdom. While all good Christians should be unafraid of death, Clement condemns those who actively seek out a martyr's death, arguing that they do not have sufficient respect for God's gift of life. He is ambivalent about whether any believing Christians can become martyrs by virtue of the manner of their death, or whether martyrdom is reserved for those who have lived exceptional lives. Marcionites cannot become martyrs, because they do not believe in the divinity of God the Father, so their sufferings are in vain. There is then a digression to the subject of theological epistemology. According to Clement, there is no way of empirically testing the existence of God the Father, because the Logos has revelatory, not analysable meaning, although Christ was an object of the senses. God had no beginning, and is the universal first principle.\nThe fifth book returns to the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice, and goodness can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is spiritual, not physical comprehension of him that is important.\nIn the beginning of the sixth book, Clement intends to demonstrate that the works of Greek poets were derived from the prophetic books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined toward plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from \"On Plagiarism\", an anonymous 3rd-century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and hell, arguing that Adam was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, even those condemned to hell.\nThe final extant book begins with Clement arguing that his version of Gnosticism (what he calls the \u2018Christian gnostic\u2019 earlier in Stromata) is the true religion and states they should be an example of what a true Christian is, even saying they are \"holy and pious\" and \"worships the true God in a manner worthy of him\". Clement then gives a description of the nature of Christ, and that of the true Christian, who aims to be as similar as possible to both the Father and the Son. Clement then criticizes the simplistic anthropomorphism of most ancient religions, quoting Xenophanes' famous description of African, Thracian, and Egyptian deities. He indicates that the Greek deities may also have had their origins in the personification of material objects: Ares representing iron, and Dionysus wine. Prayer, and the relationship between love and knowledge are then discussed. Corinthians 13:8 seems to contradict the characterization of the true Christian as one who knows; but to Clement knowledge vanishes only in that it is subsumed by the universal love expressed by the Christian in reverence for the Creator. Following Socrates, he argues that vice arises from a state of ignorance, not from intention. The Christian is a \"laborer in God's vineyard\", responsible both for one's own path to salvation and that of one's neighbor. The work ends with an extended passage against the contemporary divisions and heresies within the church.\nOther works.\nBesides the great trilogy, Clement's only other extant work is the treatise \"Salvation for the Rich\", also known as \"Who is the Rich Man who is Saved?\" written c.\u2009203 AD Having begun with a scathing criticism of the corrupting effects of money and misguided servile attitudes toward the wealthy, Clement discusses the implications of Mark 10:25. The rich are either unconvinced by the promise of eternal life, or unaware of the conflict between the possession of material and spiritual wealth, and the good Christian has a duty to guide them toward a better life through the Gospel. Jesus' words are not to be taken literally \u2014 the supercelestial () meanings should be sought in which the true route to salvation is revealed. The holding of material wealth in itself is not a wrong, so long as it is used charitably, but Christians should be careful not to let their wealth dominate their spirit. It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth. If the rich are to be saved, all they must do is to follow the two commandments, and while material wealth is of no value to God, it can be used to alleviate the suffering of neighbors.\nOther known works exist in fragments alone, including the four eschatological works in the secret tradition: \"Hypotyposes\", \"Excerpta ex Theodoto\", \"Eclogae Propheticae\", and the \"Adumbraetiones\". These cover Clement's celestial hierarchy, a complex schema in which the universe is headed by the Face of God, below which lie seven \"protoctists\", followed by archangels, angels, and humans. According to Jean Dani\u00e9lou, this schema is inherited from a Judaeo-Christian esotericism, followed by the Apostles, which was only imparted orally to those Christians who could be trusted with such mysteries. The \"proctocists\" are the first beings created by God, and act as priests to the archangels. Clement identifies them both as the \"Eyes of the Lord\" and with the Thrones. Clement characterizes the celestial forms as entirely different from anything earthly, although he argues that members of each order only seem incorporeal to those of lower orders. According to the \"Eclogae Propheticae\", every thousand years every member of each order moves up a degree, and thus humans can become angels. Even the \"protoctists\" can be elevated, although their new position in the hierarchy is not clearly defined. The apparent contradiction between the fact that there can be only seven \"protoctists\" but also a vast number of archangels to be promoted to their order is problematical. One modern solution regards the story as an example of \"interiorized apocalypticism\": imagistic details are not to be taken literally, but as symbolizing interior transformation.\nThe titles of several lost works are known because of a list in Eusebius' \"Ecclesiastical History\", 6.13.1\u20133. They include the \"Outlines\", in eight books, and \"Against Judaizers\". Others are known only from mentions in Clement's own writings, including \"On Marriage\" and \"On Prophecy\", although few are attested by other writers and it is difficult to separate works that he intended to write from those that were completed.\nThe Mar Saba letter was attributed to Clement by Morton Smith, but there remains much debate today over whether it is an authentic letter from Clement, an ancient pseudepigraph, or a modern forgery. If authentic, its main significance would be in its relating that the Apostle Mark came to Alexandria from Rome and there, wrote a more spiritual Gospel, which he entrusted to the Church in Alexandria on his death; if genuine, the letter pushes back the tradition related by Eusebius connecting Mark with Alexandria by a century.\nLegacy.\nEusebius, the fourth-century early church historian, is the first writer to provide an account of Clement's life and works, in his \"Ecclesiastical History\", 5.11.1\u20135, 6.6.1 He provides a list of Clement's works, biographical information, and an extended quotation from the \"Stromata\". From this and other accounts, it is evident that Clement was highly revered by his contemporaries and later patristic figures. As J.B. Mayor observes, \u201cThe piety and learning of Clement, his power as a teacher and philosopher, are spoken of in the highest terms by succeeding fathers.\u201d\nIn the same work, Eusebius cites Alexander of Jerusalem (180\u2013251) lauding \u201cthe holy Clement, who was both my master and benefactor,\u201d describing him as one of the \u201cblessed fathers who have trod the path before us,\u201d while Eusebius himself is quoted as calling him \u201can incomparable master of Christian philosophy.\u201d Jerome (342\u2013420) calls Clement \u201cthe most learned of men,\u201d recording that his writings are \u201cfull of eloquence and learning, both in sacred Scripture and in secular literature.\u201d The aforementioned Alexander of Jerusalem is quoted by Jerome praising \u201cthe blessed presbyter Clement, a man illustrious and approved.\u201d According to Theodoret (393\u2013450), \u201che surpassed all others, and was a holy man.\u201d Likewise, Cyril of Alexandria (376\u2013444) says Clement was \u201ca man admirably learned and skillful, and one that searched to the depths all the learning of the Greeks, with an exactness rarely attained before.\u201d Maximus the Confessor (580\u2013662) refers to him reverentially as \u201cthe great Clement.\u201d\nMore recently, scholars have acknowledged Clement's primacy and importance in various respects. He has been called \u201cthe first Christian scholar\u201d (Shelley), \u201cthe first systematic teacher of Christian doctrine\u201d (Patrick), \u201cthe first great teacher of philosophical Christianity\u201d (Hatch), \u201cthe first self-conscious theologian and ethicist\u201d (Backhouse), \u201cthe first great Christian teacher in Alexandria\u201d (Needham), \u201cthe founder of Christian philosophical theology\u201d (Bray), \u201cthe true creator of ecclesiastical theology\u201d (DeFaye), \u201cthe first major commentator on the Bible\u201d (Bray), \u201cthe founder of Christian literature\u201d (ANF), \u201cthe great founder of the Alexandrian School\u201d (Coxe), a \u201cpioneer of Christian scholarship\u201d (ACCS), \u201can intellectual giant in the early church\u201d (Kruger), \u201cthat man of genius who introduced Christianity to itself, as reflected in the burnished mirror of his intellect\u201d (Coxe), and \u201cthe most inquisitive and independent spirit that has perhaps ever appeared in the Church\u201d (DeFaye).\nStylistically, it has been noted that \u201chis writings shine with a happy, peaceful, optimistic spirit; reading them can be a remarkably uplifting experience\u201d (Needham). \u201cHe loves God\u2019s creation and sees it as good; he gives us a warm, joyous picture of life; he is richly human, sane, and moderate\u201d (Ferguson). Additionally, Clement's works \u201care a storehouse of curious ancient lore\u2014a museum of the fossil remains of the beauties and monstrosities of the world of pagan antiquity, during all the epochs and phases of its history\u201d (Wilson). \u201cHis prodigious erudition was unsurpassed even by that of Origen\u201d (Cayre). \u201cI do not know where we shall look for a purer or a truer man than this Clemens of Alexandria; he seems to me one of the old fathers whom we should all have reverenced most as a teacher, and loved best as a friend\u201d (Maurice).\nNonetheless, there have been a few detracting voices. Photios I of Constantinople writes polemically against Clement's theology in the \"Bibliotheca\", although he also is appreciative of Clement's learning and the literary merits of his work. In particular, he is highly critical of the \"Hypotyposes\", a work of biblical exegesis of which only a few fragments have survived. Photios compared Clement's treatise, which, like his other works, was highly syncretic, featuring ideas of Hellenistic, Jewish, and Gnostic origin, unfavorably against the prevailing orthodoxy of the 9th century. Amongst the particular ideas Photios deemed heretical were:\nHowever, it is not clear that these are accurate representations of Clement's actual beliefs, since his extant writings appear to be mostly in line with what would come to be considered orthodox Christian theology. It has been suggested that Photios may have misunderstood Clement to be speaking for himself when he was often quoting from Gnostics and other sects without agreeing with their teachings.\nAs one of the earliest of the Church fathers whose works have survived, he is the subject of a significant amount of recent academic work, focusing on, among other things, his exegesis of scripture, his Logos-theology and pneumatology, his belief in apokatastasis, the relationship between his thought and non-Christian philosophy, and his influence on Origen.\nVeneration.\nUp until the 17th century Clement was venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. His name was to be found in the martyrologies, and his feast fell on the fourth of December, but when the Roman Martyrology was revised by Pope Clement VIII his name was dropped from the calendar on the advice of Cardinal Baronius. Benedict XIV maintained this decision of his predecessor on the grounds that Clement's life was little known, that he had never obtained public cultus in the Church, and that some of his doctrines were, if not erroneous, at least suspect.\nAlthough Clement is not widely venerated in Eastern Christianity, the Prologue of Ohrid repeatedly refers to him as a saint, as do various Orthodox authorities including the Greek Metropolitan Kallinikos of Edessa.\nThe Coptic tradition considers Clement a saint. Saint Clement Coptic Orthodox Christian Academy in Nashville, Tennessee, is specifically named after him.\nClement is commemorated in Anglicanism.\nTheology.\nGnosis.\nClement taught that faith was the basis of salvation; he also believed that faith was the basis of \"gnosis\"\u2014which to him meant spiritual and mystical knowledge. Clement of Alexandria appropriated the word \"gnosis\" from the Gnostics (whom he opposed) but reinterpreted the word in a more Christian manner. He distinguished between two kinds of Christians: the \"pistic\" Christian who lives according to God's law, and the Christian \"gnostic\" who lives on the level of the gospel and responds by discipline and love. Clement's views of \"gnosis\" can be considered a forerunner of the Christian monastic movement that began in Egypt after his death.\nPhilosophy.\nClement suggested that philosophy was a preparatory discipline to the Greek world preceding its wide acceptance of Christianity and often sought to harmonize insights of Greek philosophy with biblical teaching. He defined philosophy as \"the desire for true being and the studies which lead to it.\" Clement has been described as \"the founder of what was to become the great tradition of Christian philosophical theology.\" He was a forerunner to some of the later views of Augustine, such as just war theory and the theory of the two cities.\nUniversalism.\nClement is often regarded as one of the first Christian universalists. He espoused a belief in the eventual salvation of all, though with less systematic clarity than his disciple Origen. As Patristics scholar Illaria Ramelli has observed, Clement believed divine punishment to be corrective and remedial rather than merely retributive or destructive, and \"In \"Stromateis\" 7:2:12 Clement is clear that God's project, aim, and activity is universal salvation: 'The God of the universe has disposed eveything for universal salvation, in general and singularly.'\"\nEducation.\nFor Clement, disciplining the body would help the Christian discipline the soul; he gave detailed instructions on proper Christian conduct, decorum, and relationships in the second and third books of \"The Instructor\". According to Clement, once the passions are subject to the authority of the Word (or reason), the Christian can embark on an advanced course of philosophical study and contemplation.\nClement adopted a position that gave rise to a whole stream of later Christian thought: true philosophy and authentic human knowledge have their origin in the Logos, which is the unique source of all truth. He accepts the conception of \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 as he conducts the wisdom taught by the Logos through education in the sacred letters: on the one hand, the Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 prepares the mind of the Christian to distinguish and defend the truth, and, on the other, the liberal arts help the new Christian to direct all his efforts towards the truly useful of each particular discipline, geometry, music, grammar and philosophy.\nNotably (considering the time period), Clement seemed to advocate for the equality of women and men in the area of education, at least within the context of Christian spirituality and ethics. He wrote, \"Let us recognize, too, that both men and women practice the same sort of virtue; surely, if there is but one God for both, then there is but one Educator for both.\"\nEconomics.\nClement opposed a literal interpretation of the command \"sell what you have and give to the poor,\" and argued that the Bible does not command every person to renounce all property, and that wealth can be used either for good or evil. David Bentley Hart argues that Clement did so grudgingly, referring to private property as \"the fruit of wickedness\" and encouraged communal pooling of resources for the purpose of redistribution to the poor.\nCreation.\nClement believed that the days mentioned in Genesis are allegorical. Clement assumed a double creation, one of an invisible world and the second being material creation. He believed that formless matter existed before the creation of the world, being influenced by Plato. Clement tried to interpret Genesis 6 in harmony with the Book of Enoch.\nOthers.\nThe first person in church history to introduce a view of an invisible and a visible church is Clement of Alexandria. Because Clement saw the Protoevangelium of James as canonical, it could imply he believed in the perpetual virginity of Mary, though some have argued that he does not seem to believe in the sinlessness of Mary.\nClement of Alexandria interprets \"Fire of Wisdom\" which prevades the soul as by a baptism.\nClement of Alexandria used the word \"symbol\" to define the Eucharist, and interpreted \"John 6\" to be an allegory about faith, however his views on real presence are disputed.\nClement of Alexandria was apparently an amillennialist.\nWorks.\nEditions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranslations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7344", "revid": "45397322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7344", "title": "Cogito, ergo sum", "text": "Philosophical statement made by Ren\u00e9 Descartes\nThe Latin , usually translated into English as \"I think, therefore I am\", is the \"first principle\" of Ren\u00e9 Descartes' philosophy. He originally published it in French as , in his 1637 \"Discourse on the Method\", so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed. It later appeared in Latin in his \"Principles of Philosophy\", and a similar phrase () also featured prominently in his \"Meditations on First Philosophy\". The dictum is also sometimes referred to as the cogito. As Descartes explained in a margin note, \"we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt.\" In the posthumously published \"The Search for Truth by Natural Light\", he expressed this insight as (\"I doubt, therefore I am\u2014or what is the same\u2014I think, therefore I am.\"). Antoine L\u00e9onard Thomas, in a 1765 essay in honor of Descartes, presented it as (\"I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am.\").\nDescartes's statement became a fundamental element of Western philosophy, as it purported to provide a certain foundation for knowledge in the face of radical doubt. While other knowledge could be a figment of imagination, deception, or mistake, Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served\u2014at minimum\u2014as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a thinking entity\u2014in this case the self\u2014for there to be a thought.\nOne critique of the dictum, first suggested by Pierre Gassendi, is that it presupposes that there is an \"I\" which must be doing the thinking. According to this line of criticism, the most that Descartes was entitled to say was that \"thinking is occurring\", not that \"I am thinking\".\nIn Descartes's writings.\nDescartes first wrote the phrase in French in his 1637 \"Discourse on the Method\". He referred to it in Latin without explicitly stating the familiar form of the phrase in his 1641 \"Meditations on First Philosophy\". The earliest written record of the phrase in Latin is in his 1644 \"Principles of Philosophy\", where, in a margin note (see below), he provides a clear explanation of his intent: \"[W]e cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt\". Fuller forms of the phrase are attributable to other authors.\n\"Discourse on the Method\".\nThe phrase first appeared (in French) in Descartes's 1637 \"Discourse on the Method\" in the first paragraph of its fourth part:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\n\"Meditations on First Philosophy\".\nIn 1641, Descartes published (in Latin) \"Meditations on first philosophy\" in which he referred to the proposition, though not explicitly as \"cogito, ergo sum\" in Meditation II:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nIn Response to an Objection from Marin Mersenne, he wrote \"cogito, ergo sum\u201d in an extended form and, again, prefaced with \u2018ego\u2019:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\n\"Principles of Philosophy\".\nIn 1644, Descartes published (in Latin) his \"Principles of Philosophy\" which begins (That in order to seek truth, it is necessary once in the course of our life, to doubt, as far as possible, of all things.) The phrase \"ego cogito, ergo sum\" appears in Part 1, article 7:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nDescartes's margin note for the above paragraph is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\n\"The Search for Truth by Natural Light\".\nDescartes, in a lesser-known posthumously published work written ca. 1647, originally in French with the title (\"The Search for Truth by Natural Light\") and later in Latin with the title , provides his only known phrasing of the cogito as and admits that his insight is also expressible as dubito, ergo sum:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\n\" or \"?\nPeter J. Markie notes: \"Descartes stresses the first person in his premise twice in the Principles and once in his Reply to Mersenne. . . . . (AT VIII, 7; AT VIII, 8; AT VII, 140)\" and adds \"It is unlikely that Descartes would stress the first person in his premise, if he wanted us to read the premise as 'Thought is taking place' rather than 'I think.'\" Gary Hatfield writes: \"[I]n Latin the first-person voice need not be expressed through a separate pronoun, but may be included in the verb form; nonetheless, Descartes used the Latin first-person pronoun more than thirty times in the six Meditations.\"\nOther forms.\nThe proposition is sometimes given as . This form was penned by the French literary critic, Antoine L\u00e9onard Thomas, in an award-winning 1765 essay in praise of Descartes, where it appeared as \"\" ('Since I doubt, I think; since I think, I exist'). With rearrangement and compaction, the passage translates to \"I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am,\" or in Latin, \"\"dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum\".\" This aptly captures Descartes's intent as expressed in his posthumously published \"La Recherche de la V\u00e9rit\u00e9 par La Lumiere Naturale\" as noted above: I doubt, therefore I am \u2013 or what is the same \u2013 I think, therefore I am.\nA further expansion, (\"\u2026\u2014a thinking thing\") extends the \"cogito\" with Descartes's statement in the subsequent \"Meditation\", (\"I am a thinking [conscious] thing, that is, a being who doubts, affirms, denies, knows a few objects, and is ignorant of many, [who loves, hates,] wills, refuses, who imagines likewise, and perceives\"). This has been referred to as \"the expanded \"cogito\".\"\nTranslation.\n\"I am thinking\" vs. \"I think\".\nWhile the Latin \"c\u014dgit\u014d\" may be translated rather easily as \"I think/ponder/visualize\", does not indicate whether the verb form corresponds to the English present simple (\"think\") or progressive aspect (\"is thinking\"). Following John Lyons (1982), Vladimir \u017degarac notes, \"The temptation to use the present simple is said to arise from the lack of progressive forms in Latin and French, and from a misinterpretation of the meaning of \"cogito\" as habitual or generic\" (cf. gnomic aspect). Also following Lyons, Ann Banfield writes, \"In order for the statement on which Descartes's argument depends to represent certain knowledge,\u2026 its tense must be a true present\u2014in English, a progressive,\u2026 not as 'I think' but as 'I am thinking, in conformity with the general translation of the Latin or French present tense in such nongeneric, nonstative contexts.\" Or in the words of Simon Blackburn, \"Descartes's premise is not 'I think' in the sense of 'I ski', which can be true even if you are not at the moment skiing. It is supposed to be parallel to 'I am skiing'.\"\nThe similar translation \"I am thinking, therefore I exist\" of Descartes's correspondence in French (\", \") appears in \"The Philosophical Writings of Descartes\" by Cottingham et al. (1988).\nThe earliest known translation as \"I am thinking, therefore I am\" is from 1872 by Charles Porterfield Krauth.\nFumitaka Suzuki writes \"Taking consideration of Cartesian theory of continuous creation, which theory was developed especially in the Meditations and in the Principles, we would assure that 'I am thinking, therefore I am/exist' is the most appropriate English translation of 'ego cogito, ergo sum'.\"\n\"I exist\" vs. \"I am\".\nAlexis Deodato S. Itao notes that is \"literally 'I think, therefore I am'.\" Others differ: 1) \"[A] precise English translation will read as 'I am thinking, therefore I exist'; and 2) \"[S]ince Descartes ... emphasized that existence is such an important 'notion,' a better translation is 'I am thinking, therefore I exist.'\"\nPunctuation.\nDescartes wrote this phrase as such only once, in the posthumously published lesser-known work noted above, \"The Search for Truth by Natural Light\". It appeared there mid-sentence, uncapitalized, and with a comma. (Commas were not used in Classical Latin but were a regular feature of scholastic Latin, the Latin Descartes \"had learned in a Jesuit college at La Fl\u00e8che.\") Most modern reference works show it with a comma, but it is often presented without a comma in academic work and in popular usage. In Descartes's \"Principia Philosophiae\", the proposition appears as ego cogito, ergo sum.\nInterpretation.\nAs put succinctly by Krauth (1872), \"That cannot doubt which does not think, and that cannot think which does not exist. I doubt, I think, I exist.\"\nThe phrase \"cogito, ergo sum\" is not used in Descartes's \"Meditations on First Philosophy\", but the term \"the \"cogito\"\" is used to refer to an argument from it. In the \"Meditations\", Descartes phrases the conclusion of the argument as \"that the proposition, \"I am, I exist,\" is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind\" (\"Meditation\" II). George Henry Lewes says Descartes \"has told us that [his objective] was to find a starting point from which to reason\u2014to find an irreversible certainty. And where did he find this? In his own consciousness. Doubt as I may, I cannot doubt of my own existence, because my very doubts reveal to me a something which doubts. You may call this an assumption, if you will; I point out the fact as one above and beyond all logic; which logic can neither prove nor disprove; but which must always remain an irreversible certainty, and as such a fitting basis of philosophy.\"\nAt the beginning of the second meditation, having reached what he considers to be the ultimate level of doubt\u2014his argument from the existence of a deceiving god\u2014Descartes examines his beliefs to see if any have survived the doubt. In his belief in his own existence, he finds that it is impossible to doubt that he exists. Even if there were a deceiving god (or an evil demon), one's belief in their own existence would be secure, for there is no way one could be deceived unless one existed in order to be deceived.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But I have convinced myself that there is absolutely nothing in the world, no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Does it now follow that I, too, do not exist? No. If I convinced myself of something [or thought anything at all], then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who deliberately and constantly deceives me. In that case, I, too, undoubtedly exist, if he deceives me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, so long as I think that I am something. So, after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that the proposition, \"I am, I exist,\" is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind. (AT VII 25; CSM II 16\u201317)\nThere are three important notes to keep in mind here. First, he claims only the certainty of \"his own\" existence from the first-person point of view \u2014 he has not proved the existence of other minds at this point. This is something that has to be thought through by each of us for ourselves, as we follow the course of the meditations. Second, he does not say that his existence is necessary; he says that \"if he thinks\", then necessarily he exists (see the instantiation principle). Third, this proposition \"I am, I exist\" is held true not based on a deduction (as mentioned above) or on empirical induction but on the clarity and self-evidence of the proposition. Descartes does not use this first certainty, the \"cogito\", as a foundation upon which to build further knowledge; rather, it is the firm ground upon which he can stand as he works to discover further truths. As he puts it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakable. (AT VII 24; CSM II 16)\nAccording to many Descartes specialists, including \u00c9tienne Gilson, the goal of Descartes in establishing this first truth is to demonstrate the capacity of his criterion \u2014 the immediate clarity and distinctiveness of self-evident propositions \u2014 to establish true and justified propositions despite having adopted a method of generalized doubt. As a consequence of this demonstration, Descartes considers science and mathematics to be justified to the extent that their proposals are established on a similarly immediate clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence that presents itself to the mind. The originality of Descartes's thinking, therefore, is not so much in expressing the \"cogito\"\u2014a feat accomplished by other predecessors, as we shall see\u2014but on using the \"cogito\" as demonstrating the most fundamental epistemological principle, that science and mathematics are justified by relying on clarity, distinctiveness, and self-evidence.\nBaruch Spinoza in \"Principia philosophiae cartesianae\" at its \"Prolegomenon\" identified \"cogito ergo sum\" the \"ego sum cogitans\" (I am a thinking being) as the thinking substance with his ontological interpretation.\nPredecessors.\nAlthough the idea expressed in \"cogito, ergo sum\" is widely attributed to Descartes, he was not the first to mention it. In the late sixth or early fifth century BC, Parmenides is quoted as saying \"For to be aware and to be are the same\". (Fragment B3) Plato spoke about the \"knowledge of knowledge\" (Greek: \u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03bd\u03bf\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2, \"n\u00f3esis no\u00e9seos\") and Aristotle explains the idea in full length:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But if life itself is good and pleasant\u2026and if one who sees is conscious that he sees, one who hears that he hears, one who walks that he walks and similarly for all the other human activities there is a faculty that is conscious of their exercise, so that whenever we perceive, we are conscious that we perceive, and whenever we think, we are conscious that we think, and to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious that we exist... (\"Nicomachean Ethics\", 1170a 25 ff.)\nThe Cartesian statement was interpreted to be an Aristotelian syllogism where the premise that all thinkers are also beings is not made explicit.\nIn the early fifth century AD, Augustine of Hippo in \"De Civitate Dei\" (book XI, 26) affirmed his certain knowledge of his own existence, and added: \"So far as these truths are concerned, I do not at all fear the arguments of the Academics when they say, What if you are mistaken? For if I am mistaken, I exist.\" This formulation () is sometimes called the Augustinian . In 1640, Descartes wrote to thank Andreas Colvius (a friend of Descartes's mentor, Isaac Beeckman) for drawing his attention to Augustine:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am obliged to you for drawing my attention to the passage of St Augustine relevant to my \"I am thinking, therefore I exist\". I went today to the library of this town to read it, and I do indeed find that he does use it to prove the certainty of our existence. He goes on to show that there is a certain likeness of the Trinity in us, in that we exist, we know that we exist, and we love the existence and the knowledge we have. I, on the other hand, use the argument to show that this \"I\" which is thinking is an immaterial substance with no bodily element. These are two very different things. In itself it is such a simple and natural thing to infer that one exists from the fact that one is doubting that it could have occurred to any writer. But I am very glad to find myself in agreement with St Augustine, if only to hush the little minds who have tried to find fault with the principle.\nAnother predecessor was Avicenna's \"Floating Man\" thought experiment on human self-awareness and self-consciousness.\nThe 8th century Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara wrote, in a similar fashion, that no one thinks 'I am not', arguing that one's existence cannot be doubted, as there must be someone there to doubt.\nSpanish philosopher G\u00f3mez Pereira in his 1554 work \"Antoniana Margarita\", wrote \"nosco me aliquid noscere, &amp; quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum\" ('I know that I know something, anyone who knows is, therefore I am').\nCritique.\nUse of \"I\".\nIn \"Descartes, The Project of Pure Enquiry\", English philosopher Bernard Williams provides a history and full evaluation of this issue. The first to raise the \"I\" problem was Pierre Gassendi, who in his , as noted by Saul Fisher, \"points out that recognition that one has a set of thoughts does not imply that one is a particular thinker or another. \u2026[T]he only claim that is indubitable here is the agent-independent claim that there is cognitive activity present.\"\nThe objection, as presented by Georg Lichtenberg, is that rather than supposing an entity that is thinking, Descartes should have said: \"thinking is occurring.\" That is, whatever the force of the \"cogito\", Descartes draws too much from it; the existence of a thinking thing, the reference of the \"I,\" is more than the \"cogito\" can justify. Friedrich Nietzsche criticized the phrase in that it presupposes that there is an \"I\", that there is such an activity as \"thinking\", and that \"I\" know what \"thinking\" is. He suggested a more appropriate phrase would be \"it thinks\" wherein the \"it\" could be an impersonal subject as in the sentence \"It is raining.\"\nS\u00f8ren Kierkegaard.\nThe Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard called the phrase a tautology in his \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\". He argues that the \"cogito\" already presupposes the existence of \"I\", and therefore concluding with existence is logically trivial. Kierkegaard's argument can be made clearer if one extracts the premise \"I think\" into the premises \"'x' thinks\" and \"I am that 'x'\", where \"x\" is used as a placeholder in order to disambiguate the \"I\" from the thinking thing.\nHere, the \"cogito\" has already assumed the \"I\"'s existence as that which thinks. For Kierkegaard, Descartes is merely \"developing the content of a concept\", namely that the \"I\", which already exists, thinks. As Kierkegaard argues, the proper logical flow of argument is that existence is already assumed or presupposed in order for thinking to occur, not that existence is concluded from that thinking.\nBernard Williams.\nWilliams himself claimed that what we are dealing with when we talk of thought, or when we say \"I am thinking,\" is something conceivable from a third-person perspective\u2014namely objective \"thought-events\" in the former case, and an objective thinker in the latter. He argues, first, that it is impossible to make sense of \"there is thinking\" without relativizing it to \"something.\" However, this something cannot be Cartesian egos, because it is impossible to differentiate objectively between things just on the basis of the pure content of consciousness. The obvious problem is that, through introspection, or our experience of consciousness, we have no way of moving to conclude the existence of any third-personal fact, to conceive of which would require something above and beyond just the purely subjective contents of the mind.\nMartin Heidegger.\nAs a critic of Cartesian subjectivity, German philosopher Martin Heidegger sought to ground human subjectivity in death as that certainty which individualizes and authenticates our Being (Dasein). As he wrote in 1925 in \"History of the Concept of Time\":&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This certainty, that \"I myself \"am\", in that I will die,\" is the basic certainty of Dasein itself. It is a genuine statement of Dasein, while \"cogito sum\" is only the semblance of such a statement. If such pointed formulations mean anything at all, then the appropriate statement pertaining to Dasein in its being would have to be \"sum moribundus\" [I am in dying], \"moribundus\" not as someone gravely ill or wounded, but insofar as I am, I am \"moribundus\". The \"MORIBUNDUS\" first gives the \"SUM\" its sense.\nJohn Macmurray.\nThe Scottish philosopher John Macmurray rejected the \"cogito\" outright in order to place action at the center of a philosophical system he entitled the Form of the Personal. \"We must reject this, both as standpoint and as method. If this be philosophy, then philosophy is a bubble floating in an atmosphere of unreality.\" The reliance on thought creates an irreconcilable dualism between thought and action in which the unity of experience is lost, thus dissolving the integrity of our selves and destroying any connection with reality. In order to formulate a more adequate \"cogito\", Macmurray proposes the substitution of \"I do\" for \"I think,\" ultimately leading to a belief in God as an agent to whom all persons stand in relation.\nAlfred North Whitehead.\nIn \"Process and Reality\", Whitehead wrote \"Descartes in his own philosophy conceives the thinker as creating the occasional thought. The philosophy of organism inverts the order, and conceives the thought as a constituent operation in the creation of the occasional thinker. The thinker is the final end whereby there is the thought. In this inversion we have the final contrast between a philosophy of substance and a philosophy of organism.\"\nIn popular culture.\nIn the short story, \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream,\" by Harlan Ellison, Gorrister, when asked what 'AM' means, says \"At first it meant Allied Mastercomputer, and then it meant Adaptive Manipulator, and later on it developed sentience and linked itself up and they called it an Aggressive Menace, but by then it was too late, and finally called \"itself\" AM, emerging intelligence, and what it meant was I am ... \"cogito ergo sum\" ... I think, therefore I am.\"\nIn the Japanese animated television series, Ergo Proxy, a computer virus that affects the autoreivs, the series' version of robots, known as the Cogito virus begins infecting the autoreivs, which is named such due to the fact that it makes the infected conscious, and experience emotions as a human would.\nIn Monty Python's Bruces' Philosophers Song, one of the lyrics jokingly quotes Descartes's axiom as \"I drink therefore I am.\"\nIn the episode \"Work Experience\" of \"The Office\", David Brent says, \"We are the most efficient branch, cogito ergo sum, we'll be fine.\"\nIn the video game , Dr. Ratio (real name Veritas Ratio), a playable character and, according to in-game lore, a philosopher, has a skill, named \"Cogito, Ergo Sum\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7345", "revid": "24198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7345", "title": "Carl Barks", "text": "American cartoonist (1901\u20132000)\nCarl Barks (March 27, 1901 \u2013 August 25, 2000) was an American cartoonist, author, and painter. He is best known for his work in Disney comic books, as the writer and artist of the first Donald Duck stories and as the creator of Scrooge McDuck. He worked anonymously until late in his career; fans dubbed him \"The Duck Man\" and \"The Good Duck Artist\". In 1987, Barks was one of the three inaugural inductees of the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.\nBarks worked for the Disney Studio and Western Publishing where he created Duckburg and many of its inhabitants, such as Scrooge McDuck (1947), Gladstone Gander (1948), the Beagle Boys (1951), The Junior Woodchucks (1951), Gyro Gearloose (1952), Cornelius Coot (1952), Flintheart Glomgold (1956), John D. Rockerduck (1961) and Magica De Spell (1961).\nHe has been named by animation historian Leonard Maltin as \"the most popular and widely read artist-writer in the world\". Will Eisner called him \"the Hans Christian Andersen of comic books.\" Beginning especially in the 1980s, Barks' artistic contributions would be a primary source for animated adaptations such as \"DuckTales\" and its 2017 remake.\nBiography.\nBarks was born near Merrill, Oregon, to William Barks and his wife, Arminta Johnson. He had an older brother named Clyde. His paternal grandparents were David Barks and his wife Ruth Shrum. Barks' maternal grandparents were Carl Johnson and his wife, Suzanna Massey, but little else is known about his ancestors. Barks was the descendant of Jacob Barks, who came to Missouri from North Carolina c. 1800. They lived in Marble Hill in Bollinger County. Jacob Barks' son Isaac was the father of the David Barks noted above.\nChildhood.\nAccording to Barks's description of his childhood, he was a rather lonely child. His parents owned of land that served as their farm. The nearest neighbor lived away, but he was more an acquaintance to Barks's parents than a friend. The closest school was about away and Barks had to walk that distance every day. The rural area had few children, though, and Barks later remembered that his school had only about eight or ten students including himself. He had high praise for the quality of the education he received in that small school. \"Schools were good in those days,\" he used to say.\nThe lessons lasted from nine o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon and then he had to return to the farm. There he remembered not having anybody to talk to, as his parents were busy, and he had little in common with his brother.\nIn 1908, William Barks (in an attempt to increase the family income) moved with his family to Midland, Oregon, some miles north of Merrill, to be closer to the new railway lines. He established a new stock-breeding farm and sold his produce to the local slaughterhouses.\nNine-year-old Clyde and seven-year-old Carl worked long hours there. But Carl later remembered that the crowd which gathered at Midland's market place made a strong impression on him. This was expected, as he was not used to crowds up until then. According to Barks, his attention was mostly drawn to the cowboys that frequented the market with their revolvers, strange nicknames for each other and sense of humor.\nBy 1911, they had been successful enough to move to Santa Rosa, California. There they started cultivating vegetables and set up some orchards. Unfortunately, the profits were not as high as William expected and they started having financial difficulties. William's anxiety over them was probably what caused his first nervous breakdown.\nAs soon as William recovered, he made the decision to move back to Merrill. The year was 1913, and Barks was already 12 years old; but, due to the constant moving, he had not yet managed to complete grade school. He resumed his education at this point and finally managed to graduate in 1916.\n1916 served as a turning point in Barks's life for various reasons. First, Arminta, his mother, died in this year. Second, his hearing problems, which had already appeared earlier, had at the time become severe enough for him to have difficulties listening to his teachers talking. His hearing would continue to get worse later, but at that point he had not yet acquired a hearing aid. Later in life, he couldn't do without one. Third, the closest high school to their farm was away and even if he did enroll in it, his bad hearing was likely to contribute to his learning problems. He had to decide to stop his school education, much to his disappointment.\nFrom job to job.\nBarks started taking various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer, woodcutter, turner, mule driver, cowboy and printer. He later averred that from those jobs he learned how eccentric, stubborn, and unpredictable men, animals, and machines can be. At the same time he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles. Barks later declared that he was sure that if not for a little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane. It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt. Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters. According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters: Walt Disney's Donald Duck and his own Scrooge McDuck.\nDonald's drifting from job to job was reportedly inspired by Barks's own experiences. So was his usual lack of success. And even in those that he was successful this would be temporary, just until a mistake or chance event caused another failure, another disappointment for the frustrated duck. Barks also reported that this was another thing he was familiar with.\nScrooge's main difference to Donald, according to Barks, was that he too had faced the same difficulties in his past but through intelligence, determination and hard work, he was able to overcome them. Or, as Scrooge himself would say to Huey, Dewey, and Louie: by being \"tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties.\" In Barks's stories Scrooge would work to solve his many problems, even though the stories would often point out that his constant efforts seemed futile at the end.\nThrough both characters Barks would often exhibit his rather sarcastic sense of humor. It seems that this difficult period for the artist helped shape many of his later views in life that were expressed through his characters.\nProfessional artist.\nAt the same time, Barks had started thinking about turning a hobby that he always enjoyed into a profession: that of drawing. Since his early childhood he spent his free time by drawing on any material he could find. He had attempted to improve his style by copying the drawings of his favorite comic strip artists from the newspapers where he could find them. As he later said, he wanted to create his own facial expressions, figures and comical situations in his drawings but wanted to study the master comic artists' use of the pen and their use of color and shading.\nAmong his early favorites were Winsor McCay (mostly known for \"Little Nemo\") and Frederick Burr Opper (mostly known for \"Happy Hooligan\") but he would later study any style that managed to draw his attention.\nAt age 16, he was mostly self-taught but at this point he decided to take some lessons through correspondence. He only followed the first four lessons and then had to stop because his working left him with little free time. But as he later said, the lessons proved very useful in improving his style.\nBy December 1918, he left his father's home to attempt to find a job in San Francisco, California. He worked for a while in a small publishing house while attempting to sell his drawings to newspapers and other printed material with little success.\nFirst and second marriages.\nWhile he continued drifting through various jobs, he met Pearl Turner (1904\u20131987). In 1921 they married and had two daughters:\nIn 1923 he returned to his paternal farm in Merrill in an attempt to return to the life of a farmer, but that ended soon. He continued searching for a job while attempting to sell his drawings. He soon managed to sell some of them to \"Judge\" magazine and then started having success submitting to the Minneapolis-based \"Calgary Eye-Opener\", a racy men's cartoon magazine of the era. He was eventually hired as editor and scripted and drew most of the contents while continuing to sell occasional work to other magazines. His salary of $90 per month was considered respectable enough for the time. A facsimile of one of the racy magazines he did cartoons for in this period, \"Coo Coo\" #1, was published by Hamilton Comics in 1997.\nMeanwhile, he had his first divorce. He and Pearl were separated in 1929 and divorced in 1930. After he moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where \"Calgary-Eye-Opener\" had its offices, he met Clara Balken, who in 1938 became his second wife.\nDisney.\nIn November 1935, when he learned that Walt Disney was seeking more artists for his studio, Barks decided to apply. He was approved for a try-out which entailed a move to Los Angeles, California. He was one of two in his class of trainees who was hired. His starting salary was 20 dollars a week. He started at Disney Studios in 1935, more than a year after the debut of Donald Duck on June 9, 1934, in the short animated film \"The Wise Little Hen\".\nBarks initially worked as an inbetweener. This involved being teamed and supervised by one of the head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement. While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such a knack for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department. His first story sale was the climax of \"Modern Inventions\", for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his bottom.\nIn 1937, when Donald Duck became the star of his own series of cartoons instead of co-starring with Mickey Mouse and Goofy as previously, a new unit of storymen and animators was created devoted solely to this series. Though he originally just contributed gag ideas to some duck cartoons, by 1937 Barks was (principally with partner Jack Hannah) originating story ideas that were storyboarded and (if approved by Walt) put into production. He collaborated on such cartoons as \"Donald's Nephews\" (1938), \"Donald's Cousin Gus\" (1939), \"Mr. Duck Steps Out\" (1940), \"Timber\" (1941), \"The Vanishing Private\" (1942) and \"The Plastics Inventor\" (1944).\nThe Good Duck Artist.\nUnhappy at the emerging wartime working conditions at Disney, and bothered by ongoing sinus problems caused by the studio's air conditioning, Barks quit in 1942. Shortly before quitting, he moonlighted as a comic book artist, contributing half the artwork for a one-shot comic book (the other half of the art being done by story partner Jack Hannah) titled \"Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold\". This 64-page story was adapted by Donald Duck comic strip writer Bob Karp from an unproduced feature, and published in October 1942 in Dell Comics \"Four Color Comics\" #9. It was the first original Donald Duck story produced for an American comic book and also the first involving Donald and his nephews in a treasure hunting expedition, in this case for the treasure of Henry Morgan. Barks would later use the treasure hunting theme in many of his stories. This actually was not his first work in comics, as earlier the same year Barks along with Hannah and fellow storyman Nick George scripted \"Pluto Saves the Ship\", which was among the first original Disney comic book stories published in the United States.\nAfter quitting the Disney Studio, Barks relocated to the Hemet/San Jacinto area in the semi-desert Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles where he hoped to start a chicken farm.\nWhen asked which of his stories was a favorite in several interviews Barks cited the ten-pager in \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #146 (Nov. 1952) in which Donald tells the story of the chain of unfortunate events that took place when he owned a chicken farm in a town which subsequently was renamed Omelet. Likely one reason it was a favorite is that it was inspired by Barks' own experiences in the poultry business.\nBut to earn a living in the meantime he inquired whether Western Publishing, which had published \"Pirate Gold\", had any need for artists for Donald Duck comic book stories. He was immediately assigned to illustrate the script for a ten-page Donald Duck story for the monthly \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\". At the publisher's invitation he revised the storyline and the improvements impressed the editor sufficiently to invite Barks to try his hand at contributing both the script and the artwork of his follow-up story. This set the pattern for Barks' career in that (with rare exceptions) he provided art (pencil, inking, solid blacks and lettering) and scripting for his stories.\n\"The Victory Garden\", that initial ten-page story published in April, 1943 was the first of about 500 stories featuring the Disney ducks Barks would produce for Western Publishing over the next three decades, well into his purported retirement. These can be mostly divided into three categories:\nBarks' artistic growth during his first decade in comics saw a transformation from rather rudimentary storytelling derived from his years as an animation artist and storyman into a virtuoso creator of complex narratives, notably in his longer adventure tales. According to critic Geoffrey Blum, the process that saw its beginnings in 1942's \"Pirate Gold\" first bore its full fruit in 1950's \"Vacation Time\", which he describes as \"a visual primer for reading comics and understanding\u00a0... the form\".\nHe surrounded Donald Duck and nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie with a cast of eccentric and colorful characters, such as the aforementioned Scrooge McDuck, the wealthiest duck in the world; Gladstone Gander, Donald's obscenely lucky cousin; inventor Gyro Gearloose; the persistent Beagle Boys; the sorceress Magica De Spell; Scrooge's rivals Flintheart Glomgold and John D. Rockerduck; Daisy's nieces April, May and June; Donald's neighbor Jones, and The Junior Woodchucks organization.\nBarks's stories (whether humorous adventures or domestic comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises of everyday life with the nephews often acting as a Greek chorus commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling, his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of Hal Foster's \"Prince Valiant\".\nThird marriage.\nAs Barks blossomed creatively, his marriage to Clara deteriorated. This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that he could feel his creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head. They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce. In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows. It was at one of these in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 \u2013 March 10, 1993), nicknamed Gar\u00e9. She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are in the collection of the Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art. During her lifetime, and to this day, note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree. Her nickname appears as a store name in the story \"Christmas in Duckburg\", featured on page 1 of \"Walt Disney's Christmas Parade\" #9, published in 1958. Soon after they met, she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous. They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death.\nNo longer anonymous.\nPeople who worked for Disney (and its comic book licensees) generally did so in relative anonymity; stories would only carry Walt Disney's name and (sometimes) a short identification number. Prior to 1960 Barks' identity remained a mystery to his readers. However, many readers recognized Barks' work and drawing style and began to call him the Good Duck Artist, a label that stuck even after his true identity was discovered by fans in the late 1950s. Malcolm Willits was the first person to learn Barks's name and address, but two brothers named John and Bill Spicer became the first fans to contact Barks after independently discovering the same information. After Barks received a 1960 visit from the Spicer brothers and Ron Leonard, he was no longer anonymous, as word of his identity spread through the emerging network of comic book fandom fanzines and conventions.\nLater life.\nCarl Barks retired in 1966, but was persuaded by editor Chase Craig to continue to script stories for Western. The last new comic book story drawn by Carl Barks was a Daisy Duck tale (\"The Dainty Daredevil\") published in \"Walt Disney Comics Digest\" issue 5 (Nov. 1968). When bibliographer Michael Barrier asked Barks why he drew it, Barks' vague recollection was no one was available and he was asked to do it as a favor by Craig.\nHe wrote one Uncle Scrooge story, and three Donald Duck stories. From 1970 to 1974, Barks was the main writer for the Junior Woodchucks comic book (issues 6 through 25). The latter included environmental themes that Barks first explored in 1957 [\"Land of the Pygmy Indians\", \"Uncle Scrooge\" #18]. Barks also sold a few sketches to Western that were redrawn as covers. For a time the Barkses lived in Goleta, California, before returning to the Inland Empire by moving to Temecula.\nTo make a little extra money beyond what his pension and scripting earnings brought in, Barks started doing oil paintings to sell at the local art shows where he and Gar\u00e9 exhibited. Subjects included humorous depictions of life on the farm and portraits of Native American princesses. These skillfully rendered paintings encouraged fan Glenn Bray to ask Barks if he could commission a painting of the ducks (\"A Tall Ship and a Star to Steer Her By\", taken from the cover of \"Walt Disney's Comics and Stories\" #108 by Barks). This prompted Barks to contact George Sherman at Disney's Publications Department to request permission to produce and sell oil paintings of scenes from his stories. In July 1971 Barks was granted a royalty-free license by Disney. When word spread that Barks was taking commissions from those interested in purchasing an oil of the ducks, much to his astonishment the response quickly outstripped what he reasonably could produce in the next few years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOde to the Disney Ducks\n&lt;poem&gt;They ride tall ships to the far away,\nand see the long ago.\nThey walk where fabled people trod,\nand Yetis trod the snow.\nThey meet the folks who live on stars,\nand find them much like us,\nWith food and love and happiness\nthe things they most discuss.\nThe world is full of clans and cults\nabuzz as angry bees,\nAnd Junior Woodchucks snapping jeers\nat Littlest Chickadees.\nThe ducks show us that part of life\nis to forgive a slight.\nThat black eyes given in revenge\nkeep hatred burning bright.\nSo when our walks in sun or shade\npass graveyards filled by wars,\nIt's nice to stop and read of ducks\nwhose battles leave no scars.\nTo read of ducks who parody\nour vain attempts at glory,\nThey don't exist, but somehow leave\nus glad we bought their story.&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014Carl Barks, 1999\nWhen Barks expressed dismay at coping with the backlog of orders he faced, fan/dealers Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran suggested Barks instead auction his paintings at conventions and via Cochran's catalog \"Graphic Gallery\". By September 1974 Barks had discontinued taking commissions.\nAt Boston's NewCon convention, in October 1975, the first Carl Barks oil painting auctioned at a comic book convention (\"She Was Spangled and Flashy\") sold for $2,500. Subsequent offerings saw an escalation in the prices realized.\nIn 1976, Barks and Gar\u00e9 went to Boston for the NewCon show, their first comic convention appearance. Among the other attendees was famed \"Little Lulu\" comic book scripter John Stanley; despite both having worked for Western Publishing this was the first time they met. The highlight of the convention was the auctioning of what was to that time the largest duck oil painting Barks had done, \"July Fourth in Duckburg\", which included depictions of several prominent Barks fans and collectors. It sold for a then record high amount: $6,400.\nSoon thereafter a fan sold unauthorized prints of some of the Scrooge McDuck paintings, leading Disney to withdraw permission for further paintings. To meet demand for new work Barks embarked on a series of paintings of non-Disney ducks and fantasy subjects such as Beowulf and Xerxes. These were eventually collected in the limited-edition book \"Animal Quackers\".\nAs the result of efforts by \"Star Wars\" producer Gary Kurtz and screenwriter Edward Summer, Disney relented and, in 1981, allowed Barks to produce an oil painting called \"Wanderers of Wonderlands\" for a limited edition book entitled \"Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times\". The book collected 11 classic Barks stories of Uncle Scrooge colored by artist Peter Ledger along with a new Scrooge story by Barks done storybook style with watercolor illustrations, \"Go Slowly, Sands of Time\". After being turned down by every major publisher in New York City, Kurtz and Summer published the book through Celestial Arts, which Kurtz acquired partly for this purpose. The book went on to become the model for virtually every important collection of comic book stories. It was the first book of its kind ever reviewed in \"Time\" magazine and subsequently in \"Newsweek\", and the first book review in \"Time\" with large color illustrations.\nIn 1977 and 1982, Barks attended San Diego Comic-Con. As with his appearance in Boston, the response to his presence was overwhelming, with long lines of fans waiting to meet Barks and get his autograph.\nIn 1981, Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran, two long-time Disney comics fans, decided to combine forces to bring greater recognition to the works of Carl Barks. Their first efforts went into establishing Another Rainbow Publishing, the banner under which they produced and issued the award-winning book \"The Fine Art of Walt Disney's Donald Duck by Carl Barks\", a comprehensive collection of the Disney duck paintings of this artist and storyteller. Not long after, the company began producing fine art lithographs of many of these paintings, in strictly limited editions, all signed by Barks, who eventually produced many original works for the series.\nIn 1983, Barks relocated one last time to Grants Pass, Oregon, near where he grew up, partly at the urging of friend and \"Broom Hilda\" artist Russell Myers, who lived in the area. The move also was motivated, Barks stated in another famous quip, by Temecula being too close to Disneyland and thus facilitating a growing torrent of drop-in visits by vacationing fans. In this period Barks made only one public appearance, at a comic book shop near Grants Pass.\nIn 1983, Another Rainbow took up the daunting task of collecting the entire Disney comic book oeuvre of Barks\u2014over 500 stories in all\u2014in the ten-set, thirty-volume \"Carl Barks Library\". These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks' pages in pristine black and white line art, as close as possible to the way he would originally draw them, and included mountains of special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, critiques, and more than a few surprises. This monumental project was finally completed in mid-1990.\nIn 1985, a new division was founded, Gladstone Publishing, which took up the then-dormant Disney comic book license. Gladstone introduced a new generation of Disney comic book readers to the storytelling of Barks, Paul Murry, and Floyd Gottfredson, as well as presenting the first works of modern Disney comics artists Don Rosa and William Van Horn. Seven years after Gladstone's founding, the \"Carl Barks Library\" was revived as the \"Carl Barks Library in Color\", as full-color, high-quality squarebound comic albums (including the first-ever Carl Barks trading cards).\nFrom 1993 to 1998, Barks' career was managed by the \"Carl Barks Studio\" (Bill Grandey and Kathy Morby\u2014they had sold Barks original art since 1979). This involved numerous art projects and activities, including a tour of 11 European countries in 1994, Iceland being the first foreign country he ever visited. Barks appeared at the first of many Disneyana conventions in 1993. Silk screen prints of paintings along with high-end art objects (such as original water colors, bronze figurines and ceramic tiles) were produced based on designs by Barks.\nDuring the summer of 1994 and until his death, Barks and his studio personally assigned Peter Reichelt, a museum exhibition producer from Mannheim, Germany, as his agent for Europe. Publisher \"Edition 313\" put out numerous lithographs. In 1997, tensions between Barks and the Studio eventually resulted in a lawsuit that was settled with an agreement that included the disbanding of the Studio. Barks never traveled to make another Disney appearance. He was represented by Ed Bergen, as he completed a final project. Gerry Tank and Jim Mitchell were to assist Barks in his final years.\nDuring his Carl Barks Studio years, Barks created two more stories: the script for the final Uncle Scrooge story \"Horsing Around with History\", which was first published in Denmark in 1994 with Bill Van Horn art. The outlines for Barks' final Donald Duck story \"Somewhere in Nowhere\", were first published in 1997, in Italy, with art by Pat Block.\nAustrian artist Gottfried Helnwein curated and organized the first solo museum-exhibition of Barks. Between 1994 and 1998 the retrospective was shown in ten European museums and seen by more than 400,000 visitors.\nAt the same time in spring 1994, Reichelt and Ina Brockmann designed a special museum exhibition tour about Barks' life and work. Also represented for the first time at this exhibition were Disney artists Al Taliaferro and Floyd Gottfredson. Since 1995, more than 500,000 visitors have attended the shows in Europe.\nReichelt also translated Michael Barrier's biography of Barks into German and published it in 1994.\nFinal days and death.\nBarks spent his final years in a new home in Grants Pass, Oregon, which he and Gar\u00e9, who died in 1993, had built next door to their original home. In July 1999, he was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a form of cancer arising from the white blood cells in the bone marrow, for which he received oral chemotherapy. However, as the disease progressed, causing him great discomfort, the ailing Barks decided to stop receiving treatment in June 2000. In spite of his terminal condition, Barks remained, according to caregiver Serene Hunicke, \"funny up to the end\".\nThe year before, Barks had told the university professor Donald Ault:\nI have no apprehension, no fear of death. I do not believe in an afterlife.\u00a0... I think of death as total peace. You're beyond the clutches of all those who would crush you.\nOn August 25, 2000, shortly after midnight, Carl Barks died quietly in his sleep at the age of 99. He was interred in Hillcrest Memorial Cemetery in Grants Pass, beside Gar\u00e9's grave.\nInfluence.\n\"(A)n asteroid was named after the Duck Man in 1983 --- 2730 Barks, a carbonaceous C-type asteroid with a diameter of between 10 and 16 kilometers, an ordital period of six years and four months, and a rotation period of just over six hours.\" In a 1983 interview, Barks says that \"Island in the Sky\", a story about the Ducks traveling to the asteroid belt to find a place Uncle Scrooge can store his money, was his favorite story.\nBarks' Donald Duck stories were rated #7 on \"The Comics Journal\" list of 100 top comics; his Uncle Scrooge stories were rated #20.\nSteven Spielberg and George Lucas have acknowledged that the rolling-boulder booby trap in the opening scene of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" was inspired by the 1954 Carl Barks Uncle Scrooge adventure \"The Seven Cities of Cibola\" (\"Uncle Scrooge\" #7). Lucas and Spielberg have also said that some of Barks' stories about space travel and the depiction of aliens had an influence on them. Lucas wrote the foreword to the 1982 \"Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times\". In it he calls Barks' stories \"cinematic\" and \"a priceless part of our literary heritage\".\nThe Walt Disney Treasures DVD set \"\" includes a salute to Barks.\nIn Almere, Netherlands, a street was named after him: Carl Barksweg. The same neighborhood also includes a Donald Ducklaan and a Goofystraat.\nJapanese animator and cartoonist Osamu Tezuka, who created manga such as \"Astro Boy\" and \"Black Jack\", was a fan of Barks' work. \"New Treasure Island\", one of Tezuka's first works, was partly influenced by \"Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold\".\nA 1949 Donald Duck ten-pager features Donald raising a yacht from the ocean floor by filling it with ping pong balls. In December 1965 Karl Kr\u00f8yer, a Dane, lifted the sunken freight vessel \"Al Kuwait\" in the Kuwait Harbor by filling the hull with 27 million tiny inflatable balls of polystyrene. Kr\u00f8yer denies having been inspired by this Barks story. Some sources claim Kr\u00f8yer was denied a Dutch patent registration (application number NL 6514306) for his invention on the grounds that the Barks story was a prior publication of the invention. Kr\u00f8yer later successfully raised another ship off Greenland using the same method, and several other sunken vessels worldwide have since been raised by modified versions of this concept. The television show \"MythBusters\" also tested this method and was able to raise a small boat.\nDon Rosa, one of the most popular living Disney artists, and possibly the one who has been most keen on connecting the various stories into a coherent universe and chronology, considers (with few exceptions) all Barks' duck stories as canon, and all others as apocryphal. Rosa has said that a number of novelists and movie-makers cite Carl Barks as their 'major influence and inspiration'. Don Rosa created \"The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck\" based on Carl Barks references in Scrooge McDuck stories.\nWhen the news of Barks' passing was hardly covered by the press in America, \"in Europe the sad news was flashed instantly across the airwaves and every newspaper\u00a0\u2014 they realized the world had lost one of the most beloved, influential and well-known creators in international culture.\"\nThe video game \"\", released late in 2000, is dedicated to the memory of Carl Barks.\nIn 2010 Oregon Cartoon Institute produced a video about the influence of Carl Barks and Basil Wolverton on Robert Crumb.\nCarl Barks drew an early Andy Panda comic book story published in \"New Funnies\" #76, 1943. It is one of his few stories to feature humans interacting with talking animal characters (another is \"Dangerous Disguise\", \"Four Color\" #308, 1951. See List of fictional pandas.)\nThe first image ever to be displayed on an Apple Macintosh was a scan of Carl Barks' Scrooge McDuck.\nThe life story of Carl Barks, largely drawing upon his relationship with Disney and the phonetic similarity of his name to Karl Marx, serves as a loose inspiration to one of the subplots in \"The Last Song of Manuel Sendero\" by Ariel Dorfman.\nFilmography.\nFilms where Barks served as storyman or story director include:\nArt materials.\nBarks was an enthusiastic user of Esterbrook pens, and used a N\u00ba 356 model to ink and letter his Donald Duck comic-book pages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I used a #356 Esterbrook art and drafting pen which could do everything from thin \"fadeaways\" to broad accented curve sweeps on foreground circles such as the ducks' forms.

All CGS mechanical units are unambiguously derived from these three base units, but there are several different ways in which the CGS system was extended to cover electromagnetism.\nThe CGS system has mainly been supplanted by the MKS system based on the metre, kilogram, and second, which was in turn extended and replaced by the International System of Units (SI). In many fields of science and engineering, SI is the only system of units in use, but CGS is still prevalent in certain subfields.\nIn measurements of purely mechanical systems (involving units of length, mass, force, energy, pressure, and so on), the differences between CGS and SI are straightforward: the unit-conversion factors are all powers of 10 as 100 cm = 1 m and 1000 g = 1 kg. For example, the CGS unit of force is the dyne, which is defined as , so the SI unit of force, the newton (), is equal to .\nIn contrast, converting measurements of electromagnetic quantities \u2014 such as electric charge, electric and magnetic fields, and voltage \u2014 between CGS and SI systems is considerably more complex. This is because the form of the equations governing electromagnetic phenomena, including Maxwell's equations, depends on the system of units employed; electromagnetic quantities are defined differently in SI and in CGS. Moreover, several distinct versions of the CGS system exist, each defining electromagnetic units differently. These include the electrostatic (ESU), electromagnetic (EMU), Gaussian units, and Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units. Gaussian units are the most widely used in modern scientific literature, and the term \"CGS units\" is often understood to refer specifically to the CGS\u2013Gaussian system.\nHistory.\nThe CGS system goes back to a proposal in 1832 by the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss to base a system of absolute units on the three fundamental units of length, mass and time. Gauss chose the units of millimetre, milligram and second. In 1873, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, including physicists James Clerk Maxwell and William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin recommended the general adoption of centimetre, gram and second as fundamental units, and to express all derived electromagnetic units in these fundamental units, using the prefix \"C.G.S. unit of ...\".\nThe sizes of many CGS units turned out to be inconvenient for practical purposes. For example, many everyday objects are hundreds or thousands of centimetres long, such as humans, rooms and buildings. Thus the CGS system never gained wide use outside the field of science. Starting in the 1880s, and more significantly by the mid-20th century, CGS was gradually superseded internationally for scientific purposes by the MKS (metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second) system, which in turn developed into the modern SI standard.\nSince the international adoption of the MKS standard in the 1940s and the SI standard in the 1960s, the technical use of CGS units has gradually declined worldwide. CGS units have been deprecated in favour of SI units by NIST, as well as organisations such as the American Physical Society and the International Astronomical Union. SI units are predominantly used in engineering applications and physics education, while Gaussian CGS units are still commonly used in theoretical physics, describing microscopic systems, relativistic electrodynamics, and astrophysics.\nThe units gram and centimetre remain useful as noncoherent units within the SI system, as with any other prefixed SI units.\nDefinition of CGS units in mechanics.\nIn mechanics, the quantities in the CGS and SI systems are defined identically. The two systems differ only in the scale of the three base units (centimetre versus metre and gram versus kilogram, respectively), with the third unit (second) being the same in both systems.\nThere is a direct correspondence between the base units of mechanics in CGS and SI. Since the formulae expressing the laws of mechanics are the same in both systems and since both systems are coherent, the definitions of all coherent derived units in terms of the base units are the same in both systems, and there is an unambiguous relationship between derived units:\nThus, for example, the CGS unit of pressure, barye, is related to the CGS base units of length, mass, and time in the same way as the SI unit of pressure, pascal, is related to the SI base units of length, mass, and time:\n 1\u00a0unit of pressure = 1\u00a0unit of force / (1\u00a0unit of length)2 = 1\u00a0unit of mass / (1\u00a0unit of length \u00d7 (1\u00a0unit of time)2)\n 1\u00a0Ba = 1\u00a0g/(cm\u22c5s2)\n 1\u00a0Pa = 1\u00a0kg/(m\u22c5s2).\nExpressing a CGS derived unit in terms of the SI base units, or vice versa, requires combining the scale factors that relate the two systems:\n 1\u00a0Ba = 1\u00a0g/(cm\u22c5s2) = 10\u22123\u00a0kg / (10\u22122\u00a0m\u22c5s2) = 10\u22121\u00a0kg/(m\u22c5s2) = 10\u22121\u00a0Pa.\nDerivation of CGS units in electromagnetism.\nCGS approach to electromagnetic units.\nThe conversion factors relating electromagnetic units in the CGS and SI systems are made more complex by the differences in the formulas expressing physical laws of electromagnetism as assumed by each system of units, specifically in the nature of the constants that appear in these formulas. This illustrates the fundamental difference in the ways the two systems are built: \nAlternative derivations of CGS units in electromagnetism.\nElectromagnetic relationships to length, time and mass may be derived by several equally appealing methods. Two of them rely on the forces observed on charges. Two fundamental laws relate (seemingly independently of each other) the electric charge or its rate of change (electric current) to a mechanical quantity such as force. They can be written in system-independent form as follows:\nMaxwell's theory of electromagnetism relates these two laws to each other. It states that the ratio of the proportionality constants formula_10 and formula_14 must obey formula_17, where \"c\" is the speed of light in vacuum. Therefore, if one derives the unit of charge from Coulomb's law by setting formula_18 then Amp\u00e8re's force law will contain a factor formula_19. Alternatively, deriving the unit of current, and therefore the unit of charge, from Amp\u00e8re's force law by setting formula_20 or formula_21, will lead to a constant factor in Coulomb's law.\nIndeed, both of these mutually exclusive approaches have been practiced by users of the CGS system, leading to the two independent and mutually exclusive branches of CGS, described in the subsections below. However, the freedom of choice in deriving electromagnetic units from the units of length, mass, and time is not limited to the definition of charge. While the electric field can be related to the work performed by it on a moving electric charge, the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge, and thus the work performed by the magnetic field on any charge is always zero. This leads to a choice between two laws of magnetism, each relating magnetic field to mechanical quantities and electric charge:\nThese two laws can be used to derive Amp\u00e8re's force law above, resulting in the relationship: formula_25. Therefore, if the unit of charge is based on Amp\u00e8re's force law such that formula_26, it is natural to derive the unit of magnetic field by setting formula_27. However, if it is not the case, a choice has to be made as to which of the two laws above is a more convenient basis for deriving the unit of magnetic field.\nFurthermore, if we wish to describe the electric displacement field D and the magnetic field H in a medium other than vacuum, we need to also define the constants \"\u03b5\"0 and \"\u03bc\"0, which are the vacuum permittivity and permeability, respectively. Then we have (generally) formula_28 and formula_29, where P and M are polarisation density and magnetisation vectors. The units of P and M are usually so chosen that the factors \ud835\udf06 and \ud835\udf06\u2032 are equal to the \"rationalisation constants\" formula_30 and formula_31, respectively. If the rationalisation constants are equal, then formula_32. If they are equal to one, then the system is said to be \"rationalised\": the laws for systems of spherical geometry contain factors of 4\u03c0 (for example, point charges), those of cylindrical geometry factors of 2\u03c0 (for example, wires), and those of planar geometry contain no factors of \u03c0 (for example, parallel-plate capacitors). However, the modern CGS systems, except Heaviside\u2013Lorentz, use \ud835\udf06 = \ud835\udf06\u2032 = 4\u03c0, or, equivalently, formula_33. Therefore, Gaussian, ESU, and EMU subsystems of CGS (described below) are not rationalised.\nVarious extensions of the CGS system to electromagnetism.\nThe table below shows the values of the above constants used in some common CGS subsystems:\nIn the CGS systems \"c\" = 2.9979 \u00d7 1010 cm/s, and in the SI system \"c\" = 2.9979 \u00d7 108 m/s and \"b\" \u2248 107 A2/N = 107 m/H.\nIn each of these systems the quantities called \"charge\" etc. may be a different quantity; they are distinguished here by a superscript. The corresponding quantities of each system are related through a proportionality constant.\nMaxwell's equations can be written in each of these systems as:\nElectrostatic units (ESU).\nIn the electrostatic units variant of the CGS system, (CGS-ESU), charge is defined as the quantity that obeys a form of Coulomb's law without a multiplying constant (and current is then defined as charge per unit time):\n formula_34\nThe ESU unit of charge, franklin (Fr), also known as statcoulomb or esu charge, is therefore defined as follows: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;two equal point charges spaced 1 centimetre apart are said to be of 1 franklin each if the electrostatic force between them is 1 dyne. Therefore, in CGS-ESU, a franklin is equal to a centimetre times square root of dyne:\n formula_35\nThe unit of current is defined as:\n formula_36\nIn the CGS-ESU system, charge \"q\" therefore has the dimension of M1/2L3/2T\u22121.\nOther units in the CGS-ESU system include the statampere (1\u00a0statC/s) and statvolt (1\u00a0erg/statC).\nIn CGS-ESU, all electric and magnetic quantities are dimensionally expressible in terms of length, mass, and time, and none has an independent dimension. Such a system of units of electromagnetism, in which the dimensions of all electric and magnetic quantities are expressible in terms of the mechanical dimensions of mass, length, and time, is traditionally called an 'absolute system'.:https://\nESU notation.\nAll electromagnetic units in the CGS-ESU system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix \"stat\" or with a separate abbreviation \"esu\". The franklin was introduced as a fourth ESU base unit; it is not strictly identical with the statcoulomb. (The unit of permittivity is also sometimes used as a fourth base unit.)\nElectromagnetic units (EMU).\nIn another variant of the CGS system, electromagnetic units (EMU), current is defined via the force existing between two thin, parallel, infinitely long wires carrying it, and charge is then defined as current multiplied by time. (This approach was eventually used to define the SI unit of ampere as well).\nThe EMU unit of current, biot (Bi), also known as abampere or emu current, is therefore defined as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The biot is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one centimetre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to two dynes per centimetre of length. Therefore, in electromagnetic CGS units, a biot is equal to a square root of dyne:\n formula_37\nThe unit of charge in CGS EMU is:\n formula_38\nDimensionally in the CGS-EMU system, charge \"q\" is therefore equivalent to M1/2L1/2. Hence, neither charge nor current is an independent physical quantity in the CGS-EMU system.\nEMU notation.\nAll electromagnetic units in the CGS-EMU system that do not have proper names are denoted by a corresponding SI name with an attached prefix \"ab\" or with a separate abbreviation \"emu\". The biot was introduced as a fourth EMU base unit; it is not strictly identical with the abampere. (The unit of permeability is also sometimes used as a fourth base unit.) EMU magnetic unit names formed from abampere, biot, or abvolt should not be used for Gaussian units; other names should be used instead, e.g., oersted, gilbert, erg per gauss, and maxwell (abtesla and abweber are rarely used even with EMU).\nPractical CGS units.\nThe practical CGS system is a hybrid system that uses the volt and the ampere as the units of voltage and current respectively. Doing this avoids the inconveniently large and small electrical units that arise in the esu and emu systems. This system was at one time widely used by electrical engineers because the volt and ampere had been adopted as international standard units by the International Electrical Congress of 1881. As well as the volt and ampere, the farad (capacitance), ohm (resistance), coulomb (electric charge), and henry (inductance) are consequently also used in the practical system and are the same as the SI units. The magnetic units are those of the emu system.\nThe electrical units, other than the volt and ampere, are determined by the requirement that any equation involving only electrical and kinematical quantities that is valid in SI should also be valid in the system. For example, since electric field strength is voltage per unit length, its unit is the volt per centimetre, which is one hundred times the SI unit.\nThe system is electrically rationalised and magnetically unrationalised; i.e., \ud835\udf06 = 1 and \ud835\udf06\u2032 = 4\u03c0, but the above formula for \ud835\udf06 is invalid. A closely related system is the International System of Electric and Magnetic Units, which has a different unit of mass so that the formula for \ud835\udf06\u2032 is invalid. The unit of mass was chosen to remove powers of ten from contexts in which they were considered to be objectionable (e.g., \"P\" = \"VI\" and \"F\" = \"qE\"). Inevitably, the powers of ten reappeared in other contexts, but the effect was to make the familiar joule and watt the units of work and power respectively.\nThe ampere-turn system is constructed in a similar way by considering magnetomotive force and magnetic field strength to be electrical quantities and rationalising the system by dividing the units of magnetic pole strength and magnetisation by 4\u03c0. The units of the first two quantities are the ampere and the ampere per centimetre respectively. The unit of magnetic permeability is that of the emu system, and the magnetic constitutive equations are B = (4\u03c0/10)\"\u03bc\"H and B = (4\u03c0/10)\"\u03bc\"0H + \"\u03bc\"0M. Magnetic reluctance is given a hybrid unit to ensure the validity of Ohm's law for magnetic circuits.\nIn all the practical systems \"\u03b5\"0 = 8.8542 \u00d7 10\u221214 A\u22c5s/(V\u22c5cm), \"\u03bc\"0 = 1 V\u22c5s/(A\u22c5cm), and \"c\"2 = 1/(4\u03c0 \u00d7 10\u22129 \"\u03b5\"0\"\u03bc\"0). Maxwell's equations in free space are also the same in all the systems.\nIn the practical systems inductance is considered to be an electrical quantity and is defined by \"L\" = 10\u22128 \"N\"\u03a6B/\"I\".\nOther variants.\nThere were at various points in time about half a dozen systems of electromagnetic units in use, most based on the CGS system. These include the Gaussian units and the Heaviside\u2013Lorentz units.\nElectromagnetic units in various CGS systems.\nIn this table, \"c\" = is the numeric value of the speed of light in vacuum when expressed in units of centimetres per second. The correspondence symbol \"\u2258\" is used instead of the equality sign \"=\" as a reminder that the conversion statements in the table are not equations. For example, according to the capacitance row of the table, if a capacitor has a capacitance of 1\u00a0F in SI, then it has a capacitance of (10\u22129\u00a0\"c\"2) cm in ESU; this statement is not an equation, and hence it is incorrect to replace \"1\u00a0F\" with \"(10\u22129\u00a0\"c\"2)\u00a0cm\" within an equation or formula. (This warning is a special aspect of electromagnetism units. By contrast it is \"always\" correct to replace, e.g., \"1\u00a0m\" with \"100\u00a0cm\" within an equation or formula.)\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nLack of unique unit names leads to potential confusion: \"15 emu\" may mean either 15 abvolts, or 15 emu units of electric dipole moment, or 15 emu units of magnetic susceptibility, sometimes (but not always) per gram, or per mole. With its system of uniquely named units, the SI removes any confusion in usage: 1 ampere is a fixed value of a specified quantity, and so are 1 henry, 1\u00a0ohm, and 1\u00a0volt.\nIn the CGS-Gaussian system, electric and magnetic fields have the same units, 4\u03c0\"\u03b5\"0 is replaced by 1, and the only dimensional constant appearing in the Maxwell equations is \"c\", the speed of light. The Heaviside\u2013Lorentz system has these properties as well (with \"\u03b5\"0 equaling 1).\nIn SI, and other rationalised systems (for example, Heaviside\u2013Lorentz), the unit of current was chosen such that electromagnetic equations concerning charged spheres contain 4\u03c0, those concerning coils of current and straight wires contain 2\u03c0 and those dealing with charged surfaces lack \u03c0 entirely, which was the most convenient choice for applications in electrical engineering and relates directly to the geometric symmetry of the system being described by the equation.\nSpecialised unit systems are used to simplify formulas further than either SI or CGS do, by eliminating constants through a convention of normalising quantities with respect to some system of natural units. For example, in particle physics a system is in use where every quantity is expressed by only one unit of energy, the electronvolt, with lengths, times, and so on all converted into units of energy by inserting factors of speed of light \"c\" and the reduced Planck constant \"\u0127\". This unit system is convenient for calculations in particle physics, but is impractical in other contexts.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "7355", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7355", "title": "Christology", "text": "Theological study of Jesus Christ\nChristology is a branch of Christian theology that concerns Jesus. Different denominations have different opinions on questions such as whether Jesus was human, divine, or both, and as a messiah what his role would be in the freeing of the Jewish people from foreign rulers or in the prophesied Kingdom of God, and in the salvation from what would otherwise be the consequences of sin.\nThe earliest Christian writings gave several titles to Jesus, such as Son of Man, Son of God, Messiah, and , which were all derived from Hebrew scripture. These terms centered around two opposing themes, namely \"Jesus as a preexistent figure who becomes human and then returns to God\", versus adoptionism\u2014the idea that Jesus was a human who was \"adopted\" by God at his baptism, crucifixion, or resurrection. Prior to 2007, the scholarly consensus was that the divinity of Christ was a later development, though most scholars now argue that a high Christology existed prior to Paul.\nFrom the second to the fifth centuries, the relation of the human and divine nature of Christ was a major focus of debates in the early church and at the first seven ecumenical councils. The Council of Chalcedon in 451 issued a formulation of the hypostatic union of the two natures of Christ, one human and one divine, \"united with neither confusion nor division\", affirmed by most of the major branches of Western Christianity and Eastern Orthodoxy, and rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Churches which subscribe to Miaphysitism as articulated by Second Council of Ephesus, where it affirmed the first Council of Ephesus's doctrine of one composite divine-human nature after the union.\nDefinition and approaches.\n\"Christology\" (from the Greek and ), literally 'the understanding of Christ', is the study of the nature (person) and work (role in salvation) of Jesus Christ.\nIt studies Jesus Christ's humanity and divinity, and the relationship between these two aspects; as well as the role he plays in salvation.\nOntological Christology analyzes the nature or being\nof Jesus Christ. Functional Christology analyzes the works of Jesus Christ, while soteriological Christology analyzes the \"salvific\" standpoints of Christology.\nTheologians may take several different approaches to Christology. For example:\nPerson of Christ.\nA fundamental Christological teaching describes Jesus Christ as possessing two natures: human and divine; debates have emerged regarding the unity of these natures. According to post-Chalcedonian definitions, the human and divine natures of Jesus Christ apparently (\"prosopic\") form a duality, as they coexist within one person (\"hypostasis\"). In the Oriental Orthodox paradigm, these two natures unite to create one composite nature that is fully human and fully divine. There are no direct discussions in the New Testament regarding the dual nature of Christ as both divine and human, and since the early days of Christianity, theologians have debated various approaches to the understanding of these natures, at times resulting in ecumenical councils, and in schisms.\nSome historical christological doctrines gained broad support:\nInfluential Christologies broadly condemned as heretical\ninclude:\nAs councils were convened, some theological positions were rejected as heresies, yet the acceptance of these councils remains partial. Notably, certain Christological views reemerged in later centuries, such as the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, which reflect elements of Arianism.\nSalvation.\nIn Christian theology, atonement is the method by which human beings can be reconciled to God through Christ's sacrificial suffering and death. Atonement is the forgiving or pardoning of sin in general and original sin in particular through the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus,\nenabling the reconciliation between God and his creation. Due to the influence of Gustaf Aul\u00e9n (1879\u20131978), whose book came out in English translation in 1931, the various theories or paradigmata of atonement are often grouped under the headings of the \"classical paradigm\", the \"objective paradigm\", and the \"subjective paradigm\":\nOther theories are the \"embracement theory\" and the \"shared atonement\" theory.\nEarly Christologies (1st century).\nEarly notions of Christ.\nThe earliest christological reflections were shaped by both the Jewish background of the earliest Christians, and by the Greek world of the eastern Mediterranean in which they operated. The earliest Christian writings give several titles to Jesus, such as Son of Man, Son of God, Messiah, and \"Kyrios\", which were all derived from Hebrew scripture. According to Matt Stefon and Hans J. Hillerbrand:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Until the middle of the 2nd century, such terms emphasized two themes: that of Jesus as a preexistent figure who becomes human and then returns to God and that of Jesus as a creature elected and \"adopted\" by God. The first theme makes use of concepts drawn from Classical antiquity, whereas the second relies on concepts characteristic of ancient Jewish thought. The second theme subsequently became the basis of \"adoptionist Christology\" (see adoptionism), which viewed Jesus' baptism as a crucial event in his adoption by God.\nHistorically in the Alexandrian school of thought (fashioned on the Gospel of John), Jesus Christ is the eternal \"Logos\" who already possesses unity with the Father before the act of Incarnation. In contrast, the Antiochian school viewed Christ as a single, unified human person apart from his relationship to the divine.\nPre-existence.\nThe notion of pre-existence is deeply rooted in Jewish thought, and can be found in apocalyptic thought and among the rabbis of Paul's time, but Paul was most influenced by Jewish-Hellenistic wisdom literature, where \"'Wisdom' is extolled as something existing before the world and already working in creation. According to Witherington, Paul \"subscribed to the christological notion that Christ existed prior to taking on human flesh[,] founding the story of Christ[...] on the story of divine Wisdom\".\n\"Kyrios\".\nThe title \"Kyrios\" for Jesus is central to the development of New Testament Christology. In the Septuagint it translates the Tetragrammaton, the holy Name of God. As such, it closely links Jesus with God \u2013 in the same way a verse such as Matthew 28:19, \"The Name (singular) of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\".\n\"Kyrios\" is also conjectured to be the Greek translation of Aramaic , which in everyday Aramaic usage was a very respectful form of polite address, which means more than just 'teacher' and was somewhat similar to 'rabbi'. While the term expressed the relationship between Jesus and his disciples during his life, the Greek \"Kyrios\" came to represent his lordship over the world.\nThe early Christians placed \"Kyrios\" at the center of their understanding, and from that center attempted to understand the other issues related to the Christian mysteries. The question of the deity of Christ in the New Testament is inherently related to the \"Kyrios\" title of Jesus used in the early Christian writings and its implications for the absolute lordship of Jesus. In early Christian belief, the concept of \"Kyrios\" included the pre-existence of Christ, for they believed if Christ is one with God, he must have been united with God from the very beginning.\nDevelopment of \"low Christology\" and \"high Christology\".\nTwo fundamentally different Christologies developed in the early Church, namely a \"low\" or adoptionist Christology, and a \"high\" or \"incarnation\" Christology. The chronology of the development of these early Christologies is a matter of debate within contemporary scholarship. There is no consensus on the continuity or discontinuity of earthly Jesus and post-Easter christology.\nThe \"low Christology\" or \"adoptionist Christology\" is the belief \"that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead\", thereby raising him to \"divine status\". According to the \"evolutionary model\" or evolutionary theories, the Christological understanding of Jesus developed over time, as witnessed in the Gospels, with the earliest Christians believing that Jesus was a human who was exalted, or else adopted as God's Son, when he was resurrected. Later beliefs shifted the exaltation to his baptism, to his birth, and subsequently to the idea of his pre-existence, as witnessed in the Gospel of John. This \"evolutionary model\" was proposed by proponents of the , especially Wilhelm Bousset's influential \"Kyrios Christos\" (1913). This evolutionary model was very influential, and the \"low Christology\" has long been regarded as the oldest Christology.\nThe other early Christology is \"high Christology\", which is \"the view that Jesus was a pre-existent divine being who became a human, did the Father's will on earth, and then was taken back up into heaven whence he had originally come\", and from where he appeared on earth. According to Bousset, this \"high Christology\" developed at the time of Paul's writing, under the influence of Gentile Christians, who brought their pagan Hellenistic traditions to the early Christian communities, introducing divine honours to Jesus. According to Casey and Dunn, this \"high Christology\" developed after the time of Paul, at the end of the first century CE when the Gospel of John was written.\nSince the 1970s, these late datings for the development of a \"high Christology\" have been contested, and a majority of scholars argue that this \"high Christology\" existed already before the writings of Paul. According to the \"New \", or the Early High Christology Club, which includes Martin Hengel, Larry Hurtado, N. T. Wright, and Richard Bauckham, this \"incarnation Christology\" or \"high Christology\" did not evolve over a longer time, but was a \"big bang\" of ideas which were already present at the start of Christianity, and took further shape in the first few decades of the church, as witnessed in the writings of Paul.\nNew Testament scholar Larry Hurtado supports this early high Christology position, emphasizing that devotional practices directed toward Jesus, such as prayer, hymns, invocation of his name, and the Aramaic liturgical expression Maranatha emerged remarkably early, likely within the first months or years following Jesus\u2019 crucifixion. Hurtado argues that this reverence arose initially within Jewish-Christian communities in Roman Judea and involved assigning to Jesus divine prerogatives previously reserved for God alone, such as participation in worship and the divine throne. He views this as a historically unprecedented development in Jewish monotheistic devotion.\nThere is a controversy regarding whether Jesus himself claimed to be divine. In \"Honest to God\" (1963), then-Bishop of Woolwich, John A. T. Robinson, questioned the idea. John Hick, writing in 1993, mentioned changes in New Testament studies, citing \"broad agreement\" that scholars do not today support the view that Jesus claimed to be God, quoting as examples Michael Ramsey (1980), C. F. D. Moule (1977), James Dunn (1980), Brian Hebblethwaite (1985) and David Brown (1985). Larry Hurtado, who argues that the followers of Jesus within a very short period developed an exceedingly high level of devotional reverence to Jesus. According to Gerd L\u00fcdemann, the broad consensus among modern New Testament scholars is that the proclamation of the divinity of Jesus was a development within the earliest Christian communities. N. T. Wright points out that arguments over the claims of Jesus regarding divinity have been passed over by more recent scholarship, which sees a more complex understanding of the idea of God in first century Judaism.\nNew Testament writings.\nThe study of the various Christologies of the Apostolic Age is based on early Christian documents.\nPaul.\nThe oldest Christian sources are the writings of Paul. According to most scholars, the central Christology of Paul conveys the notion of Christ's pre-existence Although this is disputed by a minority of scholars. and the identification of Christ as \"Kyrios\". Both notions likely existed before him in the early Christian communities, and Paul deepened them and used them for preaching in the Hellenistic communities.\nWhat exactly Paul believed about the nature of Jesus cannot be determined decisively. In Philippians 2, Paul possibly implies that Jesus was preexistent and came to Earth \"by taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness\". This sounds like an incarnation Christology according to the view of most scholars. Although this interpretation has been disputed by a few scholars. In Romans 1:4, however, Paul states that Jesus \"was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead\", which sounds like an adoptionistic Christology, where Jesus was a human being who was \"adopted\" after his death. Different views would be debated for centuries by Christians and finally settled on the idea that he was both fully human and fully divine by the middle of the 5th century in the Council of Ephesus. Paul's thoughts on Jesus' teachings, versus his nature and being, are more defined, in that Paul believed Jesus was sent as an atonement for the sins of everyone.\nThe Pauline epistles use \"Kyrios\" to identify Jesus almost 230 times, and express the theme that the true mark of a Christian is the confession of Jesus as the true Lord. Paul viewed the superiority of the Christian revelation over all other divine manifestations as a consequence of the fact that Christ is the Son of God.\nThe Pauline epistles also advanced the \"cosmic Christology\" later developed in the Gospel of John, elaborating the cosmic implications of Jesus' existence as the Son of God: \"Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.\" In the Epistle to the Colossians, which purports to be written by Paul (though this is disputed), relevant claims are made: \"Through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven\"; \"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation\".\nThe Gospels.\nThe synoptic Gospels date from after the writings of Paul. They provide episodes from the life of Jesus and some of his works, but the authors of the New Testament show little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life, and as in , the Gospels do not claim to be an exhaustive list of his works.\nChristologies that can be gleaned from the three synoptic Gospels generally emphasize the humanity of Jesus, his sayings, his parables, and his miracles. The Gospel of John provides a different perspective that focuses on his divinity. The first 14 verses of the Gospel of John are devoted to the divinity of Jesus as the \"Logos\", usually translated as \"Word\", along with his pre-existence, and they emphasize the cosmic significance of Christ, e.g.: \"All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.\" In the context of these verses, the Word made flesh is identical with the Word who was in the beginning with God, being exegetically equated with Jesus.\nControversies and ecumenical councils (2nd\u20138th century).\nPost-Apostolic controversies.\nFollowing the Apostolic Age, from the second century onwards, a number of controversies developed about how the human and divine are related within the person of Jesus. As of the second century, a number of different and opposing approaches developed among various groups. In contrast to prevailing monoprosopic views on the Person of Christ, alternative dyoprosopic notions were also promoted by some theologians, but such views were rejected by the ecumenical councils. For example, Arianism did not endorse divinity, Ebionism argued Jesus was an ordinary mortal, while Gnosticism held docetic views which argued Christ was a spiritual being who only appeared to have a physical body. The resulting tensions led to schisms within the church in the second and third centuries, and ecumenical councils were convened in the fourth and fifth centuries to deal with the issues.\nAlthough some of the debates may seem to various modern students to be over a theological iota, they took place in controversial political circumstances, reflecting the relations of temporal powers and divine authority, and certainly resulted in schisms, among others that separated the Church of the East from the Church of the Roman Empire.\nFirst Council of Nicaea (325) and First Council of Constantinople (381).\nIn 325, the First Council of Nicaea defined the persons of the Godhead and their relationship with one another, decisions which were ratified at the First Council of Constantinople in 381. The language used was that the one God exists in three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit); in particular, it was affirmed that the Son was \"homoousios\" (of the same being) as the Father. The Nicene Creed declared the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus. After the First Council of Nicaea in 325 the \"Logos\" and the second Person of the Trinity were being used interchangeably.\nFirst Council of Ephesus (431).\nIn 431, the First Council of Ephesus was initially called to address the views of Nestorius on Mariology, but the problems soon extended to Christology, and schisms followed. The 431 council was called because in defense of his loyal priest Anastasius, Nestorius had preferred that the title \"Christokos\" (Christ-bearer) be used over \"Theotokos\" (God-bearer) for Mary and later contradicted Proclus during a sermon in Constantinople. Pope Celestine I (who was already upset with Nestorius due to other matters) wrote about this to Cyril of Alexandria, who orchestrated the council. During the council, Nestorius defended his position by arguing that there are two distinct and separate natures of Christ, one human and the other divine, hence Mary gave birth only to the human nature, suggesting that the title Theotokos (God-bearer) is insufficient to fully describe the Incarnation, as it does not encompass Christ's humanity. The debate about the single or dual nature of Christ ensued in Ephesus.\nThe First Council of Ephesus debated miaphysitism (two natures united as one after the hypostatic union) versus dyophysitism (coexisting natures after the hypostatic union) versus monophysitism (only one nature) versus Nestorianism (two hypostases). From the Christological viewpoint, the council adopted ('but being made one', ) \u2013 Council of Ephesus, Epistle of Cyril to Nestorius, i.e. 'one nature of the Word of God incarnate' (, ). In 451, the Council of Chalcedon affirmed dyophysitism. The Oriental Orthodox rejected this and subsequent councils and continued to consider themselves as \"miaphysite\" according to the faith put forth at the Councils of Nicaea and Ephesus. The council also confirmed the \"Theotokos\" title and excommunicated Nestorius.\nCouncil of Chalcedon (451).\nThe 451 Council of Chalcedon was highly influential, and marked a key turning point in the christological debates. It is the last council which many Lutherans, Anglicans and other Protestants consider ecumenical.\nThe Council of Chalcedon fully promulgated the Western dyophysite understanding put forth by Pope Leo I of Rome of the \"hypostatic union\", the proposition that Christ has one human nature \"(physis)\" and one divine nature \"(physis)\", each distinct and complete, and united with neither confusion nor division. Most of the major branches of Western Christianity (Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Lutheranism, and Reformed), Church of the East, Eastern Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy subscribe to the Chalcedonian Christological formulation, while Oriental Orthodoxy (in Antioch, Alexandria, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Armenia) reject it.\nAlthough the Chalcedonian Creed did not put an end to all christological debate, it did clarify the terms used and became a point of reference for many future Christologies. But it also broke apart the church of the Eastern Roman Empire in the fifth century, and unquestionably established the primacy of Rome in the East over those who accepted the Council of Chalcedon. This was reaffirmed in 519, when the Eastern Chalcedonians accepted the Formula of Hormisdas, anathematizing all of their own Eastern Chalcedonian hierarchy, who died out of communion with Rome from 482 to 519.\nFifth\u2013Seventh Ecumenical Council (553, 681, 787).\nThe Second Council of Constantinople in 553 interpreted the decrees of Chalcedon, and further explained the relationship of the two natures of Jesus. It also condemned the alleged teachings of Origen on the pre-existence of the soul, and other topics.\nThe Third Council of Constantinople in 681 declared that Christ has two wills of his two natures, human and divine, contrary to the teachings of the Monothelites, with the divine will having precedence, leading and guiding the human will.\nThe Second Council of Nicaea was called under the Empress Regent Irene of Athens in 787. It affirmed the veneration of icons while forbidding their worship. It is often referred to as \"The Triumph of Orthodoxy\".\nWestern medieval Christology.\nThe Franciscan piety of the 12th and 13th centuries led to \"popular Christology\". Systematic approaches by theologians, such as Thomas Aquinas, are called \"scholastic Christology\".\nIn the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas provided the first systematic Christology that consistently resolved a number of the existing issues. In his Christology from above, Aquinas also championed the principle of perfection of Christ's human attributes.\nThe Middle Ages also witnessed the emergence of the \"tender image of Jesus\" as a friend and a living source of love and comfort, rather than just the \"Kyrios\" image.\nReformation.\n, a confessional standard of the Reformed faith, subscribes to Nicene orthodoxy regarding the deity of Christ. The article places emphasis on the eternal generation of the Son and the eternal divine nature of Christ as Creator.We believe that Jesus Christ, according to his divine nature, is the only begotten Son of God, begotten from eternity, not made nor created (for then He should be a creature), but co-essential and co-eternal with the Father, \"the express image of His person, and the brightness of His glory\" (), equal unto him in all things. He is the Son of God, not only from the time that He assumed our nature, but from all eternity, as these testimonies, when compared together, teach us. Moses says that God created the world; and John saith that \"all things were made by that Word\" (), which he calls God. And the apostle says that God made the worlds by His Son (); likewise, that \"God created all things by Jesus Christ\" (). Therefore, it must needs follow, that he who is called God, the Word, the Son, and Jesus Christ did exist at that time, when all things were created by him. Therefore, the prophet Micah says, \"His goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting\" (). And the apostle: \"He has neither beginning of days, nor end of life\" (). He therefore is that true, eternal, and almighty God, whom we invoke, worship and serve.John Calvin maintained there was no human element in the Person of Christ which could be separated from the Person of the Word. Calvin also emphasized the importance of the \"Work of Christ\" in any attempt at understanding the Person of Christ and cautioned against ignoring the works of Jesus during his ministry.\nModern developments.\nLiberal Protestant theology.\nThe 19th century saw the rise of Liberal Protestant theology, which questioned the dogmatic foundations of Christianity, and approached the Bible with critical-historical tools. The divinity of Jesus became of less emphasis or importance, and was replaced with a focus on the ethical aspects of his teachings.\nRoman Catholicism.\nCatholic theologian Karl Rahner sees the purpose of modern Christology as to formulate the Christian belief that \"God became man and that God-made-man is the individual Jesus Christ\" in a manner that this statement can be understood consistently, without the confusions of past debates and mythologies. Rahner pointed out the coincidence between the Person of Christ and the Word of God, referring to and which state whoever is ashamed of the words of Jesus is ashamed of the Lord himself.\nHans von Balthasar argued the union of the human and divine natures of Christ was achieved not by the \"absorption\" of human attributes, but by their \"assumption\". Thus, in his view, the divine nature of Christ was not affected by the human attributes and remained forever divine. The same distinction is recorded in the Second Vatican Council's pastoral constitution, \"Gaudium et spes\": \"in Him, human nature was assumed, not absorbed\".\nPope Francis, in his 2024 encyclical letter \"Dilexit nos\", refers to the \"divinity and plenary humanity\" of Jesus.\nTopics.\nNativity and the Holy Name.\nThe Nativity of Jesus impacted the Christological issues about his person from the earliest days of Christianity. Luke's Christology centers on the dialectics of the dual natures of the earthly and heavenly manifestations of existence of the Christ, while Matthew's Christology focuses on the mission of Jesus and his role as the savior. The salvific emphasis of later impacted the theological issues and the devotions to Holy Name of Jesus.\n provides a key to the \"Emmanuel Christology\" of Matthew. Beginning with 1:23, the Gospel of Matthew shows a clear interest in identifying Jesus as \"God with us\" and in later developing the Emmanuel characterization of Jesus at key points throughout the rest of the Gospel. The name 'Emmanuel' does not appear elsewhere in the New Testament, but Matthew builds on it in (\"I am with you always, even unto the end of the world\") to indicate Jesus will be with the faithful to the end of the age. According to Ulrich Luz, the Emmanuel motif brackets the entire Gospel of Matthew between 1:23 and 28:20, appearing explicitly and implicitly in several other passages.\nCrucifixion and resurrection.\nThe accounts of the crucifixion and subsequent resurrection of Jesus provides a rich background for christological analysis, from the canonical Gospels to the Pauline Epistles.\nA central element in the christology presented in the Acts of the Apostles is the affirmation of the belief that the death of Jesus by crucifixion happened \"with the foreknowledge of God, according to a definite plan\". In this view, as in , the cross is not viewed as a scandal, for the crucifixion of Jesus \"at the hands of the lawless\" is viewed as the fulfilment of the plan of God.\nPaul's Christology has a specific focus on the death and resurrection of Jesus. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus is directly related to his resurrection and the term \"the cross of Christ\" used in Galatians 6:12 may be viewed as his abbreviation of the message of the Gospels. For Paul, the crucifixion of Jesus was not an isolated event in history, but a cosmic event with significant eschatological consequences, as in 1 Corinthians 2:8. In the Pauline view, Jesus, obedient to the point of death (Philippians 2:8), died \"at the right time\" (Romans 5:6) based on the plan of God. For Paul, the \"power of the cross\" is not separable from the resurrection of Jesus.\nThreefold office.\nThe threefold office (Latin ) of Jesus Christ is a Christian doctrine based upon the teachings of the Old Testament. It was described by Eusebius and more fully developed by John Calvin. It states that Jesus Christ performed three functions (or \"offices\") in his earthly ministry \u2013 those of prophet, priest, and king. In the Old Testament, the appointment of someone to any of these three positions could be indicated by anointing him or her by pouring oil over the head. Thus, the term \"messiah\", meaning \"anointed one\", is associated with the concept of the threefold office. While the office of king is that most frequently associated with the Messiah, the role of Jesus as priest is also prominent in the New Testament, being most fully explained in chapters 7 to 10 of the Book of Hebrews.\nMariology.\nSome Christians, notably Roman Catholics, view Mariology as a key component of Christology. In this view, not only is Mariology a logical and necessary consequence of Christology, but without it, Christology is incomplete, since the figure of Mary contributes to a fuller understanding of who Christ is and what he did.\nProtestants have criticized Mariology because many of its assertions lack any Biblical foundation. Strong Protestant reaction against Roman Catholic Marian devotion and teaching has been a significant issue for ecumenical dialogue.\nJoseph Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) expressed this sentiment about Roman Catholic Mariology when in two separate occasions he stated, \"The appearance of a truly Marian awareness serves as the touchstone indicating whether or not the christological substance is fully present\" and \"It is necessary to go back to Mary, if we want to return to the truth about Jesus Christ.\"\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7357", "revid": "45227015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7357", "title": "Complaint", "text": "Legal document, the filing of which initiates a lawsuit\nIn legal terminology, a complaint is any formal legal document that sets out the facts and legal reasons (see: cause of action) that the filing party or parties (the plaintiff(s)) believes are sufficient to support a claim against the party or parties against whom the claim is brought (the defendant(s)) that entitles the plaintiff(s) to a remedy (either money damages or injunctive relief). For example, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) that govern civil litigation in United States courts provide that a civil action is commenced with the filing or service of a pleading called a complaint. Civil court rules in states that have incorporated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure use the same term for the same pleading. \nIn Civil Law, a \"complaint\" is the first formal action taken to officially begin a lawsuit. This written document contains the allegations against the defense, the specific laws violated, the facts that led to the dispute, and any demands made by the plaintiff to restore justice.\nIn some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be commenced by the filing of a complaint, also sometimes called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. Most criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority that promulgates criminal statutes and enforces the police power of the state with the goal of seeking criminal sanctions, such as the State (also sometimes called the People) or Crown (in Commonwealth realms). In the United States, the complaint is often associated with misdemeanor criminal charges presented by the prosecutor without the grand jury process. In most U.S. jurisdictions, the charging instrument presented to and authorized by a grand jury is referred to as an indictment.\nUnited States.\nEvery U.S. state has some forms available on the web for most common complaints for lawyers and self-representing litigants; if a petitioner cannot find an appropriate form in their state, they often can modify a form from another state to fit his or her request. Several United States federal courts publish general guidelines for the petitioners and Civil Rights complaint forms.\nAfter the complaint has been filed with the court, it has to be properly served to the opposite parties, but usually petitioners are not allowed to serve the complaint personally. The court also can issue a summons \u2013 an official summary document which the plaintiff needs to have served together with the complaint. The defendants have limited time to respond, depending on the State or Federal rules. A defendant's failure to answer a complaint can result in a default judgment in favor of the petitioner.\nFor example, in United States federal courts, any person who is at least 18 years old and not a party may serve a summons and complaint in a civil case. The defendant must submit an answer within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint, or request a waiver, according to FRCP Rule 12. After the civil complaint has been served to the defendants, the plaintiff must, as soon as practicable initiate a conference between the parties to plan for the rest of the discovery process and then the parties should submit a proposed discovery plan to the judge within 14 days after the conference.\nIn many U.S. jurisdictions, a complaint submitted to a court must be accompanied by a Case Information Statement, which sets forth specific key information about the case and the lawyers representing the parties. This allows the judge to make determinations about which deadlines to set for different phases of the case, as it moves through the court system.\nThere are also freely accessible web search engines to assist parties in finding court decisions that can be cited in the complaint as an example or analogy to resolve similar questions of law. Google Scholar is the biggest database of full text state and federal courts decisions that can be accessed without charge. These web search engines often allow one to select specific state courts to search.\nFederal courts created the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system to obtain case and docket information from the United States district courts, United States courts of appeals, and United States bankruptcy courts. The system is managed by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts; it allows lawyers and self-represented clients to obtain documents entered in the case much faster than regular mail.\nFiling and privacy.\nIn addition to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, many of the U.S. district courts have developed their own requirements included in Local Rules for filing with the Court. Local Rules can set up a limit on the number of pages, establish deadlines for motions and responses, explain whether it is acceptable to combine a motion petition with a response, specify if a judge needs an additional copy of the documents (called \"judge's copy\"), etc. Local Rules can define page layout elements like: margins, text font/size, distance between lines, mandatory footer text, page numbering, and provide directions on how the pages need to be bound together \u2013 i.e. acceptable fasteners, number and location of fastening holes, etc. If the filed motion does not comply with the Local Rules then the judge can choose to strike the motion completely, or order the party to re-file its motion, or grant a special exception to the Local Rules.\nAccording to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) https://, sensitive text like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts and children's names, should be redacted from the filings made with the court and accompanying exhibits, (exhibits normally do not need to be attached to the original complaint, but should be presented to Court after the discovery). The redacted text can be erased with black-out or white-out, and the page should have an indication that it was redacted - most often by stamping word \"redacted\" on the bottom. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court's permission to file some exhibits completely under seal. A minor's name of the petitions should be replaced with initials.\nA person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the Court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Copies of both redacted and unredacted documents filed with court should be provided to the other parties in the case. Some courts also require that an additional electronic courtesy copy be emailed to the other parties.\nAttorney fees.\nBefore filing the complaint, it is important for plaintiff(s) to remember that Federal courts can impose liability for the prevailing party's attorney fees to the losing party, if the judge considers the case frivolous or for purposes of harassment, even when the case was voluntarily dismissed. In the case of \"Fox v. Vice\", the U.S. Supreme Court held that reasonable attorneys' fees could be awarded to the defendant under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988, but only for costs that the defendant would not have incurred \"but for the frivolous claims.\" Even when there is no actual trial or judgment, if there is only pre-trial motion practice such as motions to dismiss, attorney fee shifting still can be awarded under FRCP Rule 11 when the opposing party files a Motion for Sanctions and the court issue an order identifying the sanctioned conduct and the basis for the sanction. The losing party has a right to appeal any order for sanctions in the higher court. In the state courts, each party is generally responsible only for its own attorney fees, with certain exceptions.\nEngland and Wales.\nIn 1883, the Rules of the Supreme Court replaced the term \"complaint\" with \"statement of claim\". This was then replaced in 1998 with \"particulars of claim\" by the Civil Procedure Rules, which also replaced the word \"plaintiff\" with \"claimant\" as part of a drastic reform of English legal terminology. Thus, in England and Wales, a claimant now initiates a claim by filing a claim form (instead of a writ of summons), and either pleads particulars of claim on the claim form itself or as a separate document.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7362", "revid": "6488475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7362", "title": "Casimir III the Great", "text": "King of Poland from 1333 to 1370\nCasimir III the Great (; 30 April 1310 \u2013 5 November 1370) reigned as the King of Poland from 1333 to 1370. He also later became King of Ruthenia in 1340, retaining the title throughout the Galicia\u2013Volhynia Wars. He was the last Polish king from the Piast dynasty.\nCasimir inherited a kingdom weakened by war and under his rule it became relatively prosperous and wealthy. He reformed the Polish army and doubled the size of the kingdom. He reformed the judicial system and introduced several undying codified statutes, gaining the title \"the Polish Justinian\". Casimir built extensively and founded the Jagiellonian University (back then simply called the University of Krakow), the oldest Polish university and one of the oldest in the world. He also confirmed privileges and protections previously granted to Jews and encouraged them to settle in Poland in great numbers.\nCasimir left no legitimate sons. When he died in 1370 from an injury received while hunting, his nephew, King Louis I of Hungary, succeeded him as king of Poland in personal union with Hungary.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nCasimir was born on 30 April 1310 in Kowal, Kuyavia, the third son of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I \u0141okietek and Jadwiga of Kalisz. At the time of Kazimierz's birth, his father was one of the most powerful Polish princes, ruling over most of Lesser Poland and Kujawy, including the capital of the kingdom, Krak\u00f3w. \u0141okietek had royal ambitions, which were rekindled by the deaths in 1305 of Wenceslaus II and, a year later, Wenceslaus III, kings of Bohemia, who also ruled over a significant part of Poland and were kings of Poland. In 1311, the legal title to the Polish crown was taken over by the new Czech king, John of Luxembourg, who, although he was never crowned, used the title of Polish king until 1335.\nThrough considerable military and diplomatic effort, W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u0141okietek managed to take control of a large part of the Polish lands and was crowned king in Krak\u00f3w on January 20, 1320. A sign of his growing political importance was the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth to the Hungarian king Charles Robert on June 6, 1320.\nIt was probably around that time that the king began to look for a bride for his son and only heir. According to some accounts, the first candidate was Jutta, daughter of John of Luxembourg, but these plans never came to fruition. Subsequently, seeking allies against the Teutonic Order, the king turned to Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, who in 1323 announced his willingness to accept baptism. The marriage of Casimir to the Lithuanian princess Aldona Anna took place on October 16, 1325, in Wawel Cathedral.\nAn important episode in Casimir\u2019s youth was his stay at the Buda court on a diplomatic mission around 1329/1330. There, he became involved in a romance with Kl\u00e1ra Z\u00e1h, the daughter of the Hungarian magnate Felician Z\u00e1h. Klara\u2019s father learned of the affair only after Casimir had left Hungary. Seeking revenge for the dishonor brought upon his daughter, and accusing Queen Elizabeth, Casimir\u2019s sister, of complicity, he burst into Buda Castle during a royal feast and attacked the royal couple, wounding the king and cutting off the queen\u2019s fingers. Zach was killed on the spot, and his family suffered severe repressions.\nMeanwhile, Poland became entangled in a war with the King of Bohemia, who sought to reclaim the Krak\u00f3w throne, aided by Brandenburg and the Teutonic Order. Although Poland was supported by Lithuania and Hungary, the war did not go well for her. W\u0142adys\u0142aw managed to defend his crown, yet the overall outcome of the conflict was unfavorable. The Teutonic Order seized Kuyavia, a move later confirmed by John of Luxembourg, while John himself occupied the Dobrzy\u0144 Land, driving out \u0141okietek\u2019s cousins, and received homage from the Duke of P\u0142ock and most of the Silesian princes as King of Poland.\nIn 1331, Casimir was granted the governorship of Greater Poland and Kuyavia, thus becoming both a witness to and a participant in the wars that were going unfavorably for the kingdom. After concluding a truce with the Teutonic Knights, King W\u0142adys\u0142aw went to Greater Poland to deal with the Dukes of G\u0142og\u00f3w, who ruled over the southern part of that province and supported the Teutonic Order. In the fighting, Casimir distinguished himself by leading his Polish-Hungarian unit in a successful assault on besieged Ko\u015bcian, during which he carried out a massacre of its defenders.\nAt the time of his father's death on 2 March 1333, he inherited a small and weakened realm consisting of two ravaged provinces, Lesser Poland and Greater Poland, between which lay the \u0141\u0119czyca and Sieradz lands, granted in lifetime administration to the Kuyavian Piasts as compensation.\nReign.\nSuccession to the throne by Casimir met with no major obstacles. The king was crowned in the Wawel Cathedral on April 25, 1333, eight weeks after his father\u2019s death. The coronation was performed by Archbishop Janis\u0142aw of Gniezno, assisted by Bishop Jan Grot of Krak\u00f3w and Bishop Jan Doliwa of Pozna\u0144. Casimir\u2019s wife, Aldona Anna, was crowned alongside him. The king\u2019s mother, Jadwiga of Kalisz, withdrew to the convent of the Poor Clares in Stary S\u0105cz.\nThe political situation of Poland, however, was very difficult. The Czech king, John of Luxembourg, was still widely regarded as the rightful king of Poland and remained formally at war with Casimir. As such, he was the overlord of the Silesian dukes (with the exception of the Duchy of \u015awidnica) and the Duke of P\u0142ock, whose lands surrounded Casimir\u2019s small realm. The truce with the Teutonic Order had been extended before the coronation, but it was set to expire in mid-1334. Casimir\u2019s only strong asset was his alliance with Hungary. The alliance with Lithuania had weakened and was also politically inconvenient, as the Lithuanians still adhered to paganism.\nIn order to improve the political situation, Casimir launched a diplomatic campaign. He first extended the truce with the Teutonic Order for another year, and then, in July 1333, signed a peace treaty with Louis I, Margrave of Brandenburg, the emperor\u2019s son.\nNew prospects opened for Casimir after the death of Henry, Duke of Carinthia and Tyrol, former King of Bohemia, whose inheritance became the subject of rivalry among the Habsburgs, Luxembourgs, and Wittelsbachs. Casimir skillfully maneuvered between these powerful German dynasties. In May 1335 he began negotiations for a marriage between his daughter and the emperor\u2019s younger son, Louis the Roman. The Luxembourgs, alarmed by this rapprochement, sent Charles, Margrave of Moravia and son of King John, to Krak\u00f3w with a proposal to settle all disputes amicably.\nMeanwhile, in June 1335, an agreement was signed in Chojna, setting the terms for the marriage of Elizabeth, younger daughter of Casimir, to Louis the Roman and establishing an alliance between Poland and the Empire. At the same time, Casimir dispatched an embassy to Tren\u010d\u00edn, where a meeting was taking place between John of Luxembourg, his son Charles, and the Hungarian king Charles Robert. On August 24, 1335, after the meeting, the Polish envoys issued a document stating that the Luxembourgs were ready to renounce the title of Kings of Poland in exchange for Casimir\u2019s pledge not to infringe upon Bohemian possessions in Silesia and Mazovia. Following the meeting, the Bohemian chancery ceased to style John as King of Poland, and Casimir as King of Krak\u00f3w. Casimir, however, delayed the ratification of this agreement. At the same time, in July 1335, he submitted a complaint to Pope Benedict XII against the Teutonic Order for seizing lands belonging to the Polish kingdom, while the Primate of Poland accused the Order of destroying churches and plundering church property. The Pope initiated an investigation into the matter, delegating it to two cardinals.\nMeanwhile, the Polish\u2013Teutonic dispute was also being settled by an arbitration court, a process already initiated by W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u0141okietek. The court convened in Visegr\u00e1d, with John of Luxembourg and Charles Robert acting as arbiters. It was the first personal meeting of the three monarchs. The verdict was issued in November 1335. John of Luxembourg annulled the grant of the Dobrzy\u0144 Land and Kuyavia to the Teutonic Knights, and these territories were to be returned to the Kingdom of Poland. In return, Casimir was forced to renounce Pomerania and the Che\u0142mno Land, which were formally declared a perpetual alms of the King of Poland to the Teutonic Order.\nCasimir began to rebuild the country and strengthen its defenses. During his reign, nearly 30 towns were supplied with fortification walls and some 50 castles were constructed, including castles along the Trail of the Eagle's Nests. These achievements are still celebrated today, in a commonly-known ditty that translates as follows: \"inherited wooden towns and left them fortified with stone and brick\" (Kazimierz Wielki zasta\u0142 Polsk\u0119 drewnian\u0105, a zostawi\u0142 murowan\u0105).\nHe organized a meeting of kings in Krak\u00f3w in 1364 at which he exhibited the wealth of the Polish kingdom. Casimir is the only king in Polish history to both receive and retain the title of \"Great\", as Boles\u0142aw I is more commonly known as \"the Brave\".\nReforms.\nCasimir ensured stability and great prospects for the future of the country. He established the Corona Regni Poloniae \u2013 the Crown of the Polish Kingdom, which certified the existence of the Polish lands independently from the monarch. Prior to that, the lands were only the property of the Piast dynasty.\nAt the Sejm in Wi\u015blica, on 11 March 1347, Casimir introduced reforms to the Polish judicial system and sanctioned civil and criminal codes for Great and Lesser Poland, earning the title \"the Polish Justinian\". In 1364, having received permission from Pope Urban V, Casimir established the University of Krak\u00f3w, now the oldest university in Poland. It was regarded as a rare distinction, since it was only the second university founded in Central Europe, after the Charles University in Prague.\nPolitics and expansion.\nCasimir demonstrated competence in foreign diplomacy and managed to double the size of his kingdom. He neutralized relations with potential enemies to the west and north, and began to expand his territory eastward. He conquered the Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia (in modern-day Ukraine), known in Polish history as Red Ruthenia. By extending the borders far south-east, the Polish kingdom gained access to the lucrative Black Sea trade.\nSuccession.\nIn 1355, in Buda, Casimir designated his nephew Louis I of Hungary as his successor should he produce no male heir, just as his father had with Charles I of Hungary to gain help against Bohemia. In exchange Casimir gained a favourable Hungarian attitude, needed in disputes with the hostile Teutonic Order and the Kingdom of Bohemia. At the time Casimir was 45 years old, and so producing a son did not seem unreasonable.\nCasimir left no legal son, however, begetting five daughters instead. He tried to adopt his grandson, Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania, in his last will. The child had been born to his eldest daughter, Elisabeth, Duchess of Pomerania, in 1351. This part of the testament was invalidated by Louis I of Hungary, however, who had traveled to Krak\u00f3w quickly after Casimir died (in 1370) and bribed the nobles with future privileges. Casimir III also had a son-in-law, Louis VI of Bavaria, Margrave and Prince-elector of Brandenburg, who was considered a possible successor, but he was deemed ineligible as his wife, Casimir's daughter Cunigunde, had died in 1357 without issue.Thus King Louis I of Hungary became successor in Poland. Louis was proclaimed king upon Casimir's death in 1370, though Casimir's sister Elisabeth (Louis's mother) held much of the real power until her death in 1380.\nSociety.\nCasimir was facetiously named \"the Peasants' King\". He introduced the codes of law of Greater and Lesser Poland as an attempt to end the overwhelming superiority of the nobility. During his reign all three major classes \u2014 the nobility, priesthood, and bourgeoisie \u2014 were more or less counterbalanced, allowing Casimir to strengthen his monarchic position. He was known for siding with the weak when the law did not protect them from nobles and clergymen. He reportedly even supported a peasant whose house had been demolished by his own mistress, after she had ordered it to be pulled down because it disturbed her enjoyment of the beautiful landscape.\nHis popularity with the peasants helped to rebuild the country, as part of the reconstruction program was funded by a land tax paid by the lower social class.\nRelationship with Jews.\nOn 9 October 1334, Casimir confirmed the privileges granted to Jews in 1264 by Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste. Under penalty of death, he prohibited the kidnapping of Jewish children for the purpose of enforced baptism, and he inflicted heavy punishment for the desecration of Jewish cemeteries. While Jews had lived in Poland since before his reign, Casimir allowed them to settle in Poland in great numbers and protected them as \"people of the king\". About 70 percent of the world's European Jews, or Ashkenazi, can trace their ancestry to Poland due to Casimir's reforms. Casimir's legendary Jewish mistress Esterka remains unconfirmed by direct historical evidence.\nFamily.\nCasimir III was married four times:\nAldona of Lithuania.\nOn 30 April or 16 October 1325, Casimir married Aldona of Lithuania, daughter of Grand Duke Gediminas of Lithuania and Jewna. They had:\nAldona died on 26 May 1339. Casimir remained a widower for two years.\nAdelaide of Hesse.\nOn 29 September 1341, Casimir married his second wife, Adelaide of Hesse. She was a daughter of Henry II, Landgrave of Hesse, and Elizabeth of Meissen. They had no children. Casimir started living separately from Adelaide soon after the marriage. Their loveless marriage lasted until 1356, when he declared himself divorced.\nKrystyna Rokiczana.\nAfter Casimir \"divorced\" Adelaide he married his mistress Krystyna Rokiczana, the widow of Mikul\u00e1\u0161 of Rokycany, a wealthy merchant. Her own origins are unknown. Following the death of her first husband she had entered the court of Bohemia in Prague as a lady-in-waiting. Casimir brought her with him from Prague and convinced the abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Tyniec to marry them. The marriage was held in a secret ceremony but soon became known. Queen Adelaide renounced it as bigamous and returned to Hesse. Casimir continued living with Christine despite complaints by Pope Innocent VI on behalf of Queen Adelaide. This marriage lasted until 1363\u201364 when Casimir again declared himself divorced. They had no children.\nHedwig of \u017baga\u0144.\nIn about 1365, Casimir married his fourth wife Hedwig of \u017baga\u0144. She was a daughter of Henry V of Iron, Duke of \u017baga\u0144 and Anna of Mazovia. They had three children:\nAs Adelheid was still alive (and possibly Christina as well), the marriage to Hedwig was also considered bigamous. Because of this, the legitimacy of his three young daughters was disputed. Casimir managed to have Anna and Kunigunde legitimated by Pope Urban V on 5 December 1369. Jadwiga the younger was legitimated by Pope Gregory XI on 11 October 1371 (after Casimir's death).\nTitle and style.\nCasimir's full title was: \"Casimir by the grace of God king of Poland and Rus' (Ruthenia), lord and heir of the land of Krak\u00f3w, Sandomierz, Sieradz, \u0141\u0119czyca, Kuyavia, Pomerania (Pomerelia)\". The title in Latin was: \"Kazimirus, Dei gratia rex Polonie et Russie, nec non Cracovie, Sandomirie, Siradie, Lancicie, Cuiavie, et Pomeranieque Terrarum et Ducatuum Dominus et Heres.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7363", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7363", "title": "Complexity", "text": "Properties of systems that cannot be simply described or modeled\nComplexity characterizes the behavior of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, leading to non-linearity, randomness, collective dynamics, hierarchy, and emergence.\nThe term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of emergence greater than the sum of its parts. The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of complex systems theory.\nThe intuitive criterion of complexity can be formulated as follows: a system would be more complex if more parts could be distinguished, and if more connections between them existed.\nAs of 2010[ [update]], a number of approaches to characterizing complexity have been used in science; Zayed \"et al.\"\nreflect many of these. Neil Johnson states that \"even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity \u2013 and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples...\" Ultimately Johnson adopts the definition of \"complexity science\" as \"the study of the phenomena which emerge from a collection of interacting objects\".\nOverview.\nDefinitions of complexity often depend on the concept of a \"system\" \u2013 a set of parts or elements that have relationships among them differentiated from relationships with other elements outside the relational regime. Many definitions tend to postulate or assume that complexity expresses a condition of numerous elements in a system and numerous forms of relationships among the elements. However, what one sees as complex and what one sees as simple is relative and changes with time.\nWarren Weaver posited in 1948 two forms of complexity: disorganized complexity, and organized complexity.\nPhenomena of 'disorganized complexity' are treated using probability theory and statistical mechanics, while 'organized complexity' deals with phenomena that escape such approaches and confront \"dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole\". Weaver's 1948 paper has influenced subsequent thinking about complexity.\nThe approaches that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and state spaces might be summarized as implying that complexity arises from the number of distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated state spaces) in a defined system.\nSome definitions relate to the algorithmic basis for the expression of a complex phenomenon or model or mathematical expression, as later set out herein.\nDisorganized vs. organized.\nOne of the problems in addressing complexity issues has been formalizing the intuitive conceptual distinction between the large number of variances in relationships extant in random collections, and the sometimes large, but smaller, number of relationships between elements in systems where constraints (related to correlation of otherwise independent elements) simultaneously reduce the variations from element independence and create distinguishable regimes of more-uniform, or correlated, relationships, or interactions.\nWeaver perceived and addressed this problem, in at least a preliminary way, in drawing a distinction between \"disorganized complexity\" and \"organized complexity\".\nIn Weaver's view, disorganized complexity results from the particular system having a very large number of parts, say millions of parts, or many more. Though the interactions of the parts in a \"disorganized complexity\" situation can be seen as largely random, the properties of the system as a whole can be understood by using probability and statistical methods.\nA prime example of disorganized complexity is a gas in a container, with the gas molecules as the parts. Some would suggest that a system of disorganized complexity may be compared with the (relative) simplicity of planetary orbits \u2013 the latter can be predicted by applying Newton's laws of motion. Of course, most real-world systems, including planetary orbits, eventually become theoretically unpredictable even using Newtonian dynamics; as discovered by modern chaos theory.\nOrganized complexity, in Weaver's view, resides in nothing else than the non-random, or correlated, interaction between the parts. These correlated relationships create a differentiated structure that can, as a system, interact with other systems. The coordinated system manifests properties not carried or dictated by individual parts. The organized aspect of this form of complexity with regard to other systems, rather than the subject system, can be said to \"emerge,\" without any \"guiding hand\".\nThe number of parts does not have to be very large for a particular system to have emergent properties. A system of organized complexity may be understood in its properties (behavior among the properties) through modeling and simulation, particularly modeling and simulation with computers. An example of organized complexity is a city neighborhood as a living mechanism, with the neighborhood people among the system's parts.\nSources and factors.\nThere are generally rules which can be invoked to explain the origin of complexity in a given system.\nThe source of disorganized complexity is the large number of parts in the system of interest, and the lack of correlation between elements in the system.\nIn the case of self-organizing living systems, usefully organized complexity comes from beneficially mutated organisms being selected to survive by their environment for their differential reproductive ability or at least success over inanimate matter or less organized complex organisms. See e.g. Robert Ulanowicz's treatment of ecosystems.\nComplexity of an object or system is a relative property. For instance, for many functions (problems), such a computational complexity as time of computation is smaller when multitape Turing machines are used than when Turing machines with one tape are used. Random Access Machines allow one to even more decrease time complexity (Greenlaw and Hoover 1998: 226), while inductive Turing machines can decrease even the complexity class of a function, language or set (Burgin 2005). This shows that tools of activity can be an important factor of complexity.\nVaried meanings.\nIn several scientific fields, \"complexity\" has a precise meaning:\nOther fields introduce less precisely defined notions of complexity:\nStudy.\nComplexity has always been a part of our environment, and therefore many scientific fields have dealt with complex systems and phenomena. From one perspective, that which is somehow complex \u2013 displaying variation without being random \u2013 is most worthy of interest given the rewards found in the depths of exploration.\nThe use of the term complex is often confused with the term complicated. In today's systems, this is the difference between myriad connecting \"stovepipes\" and effective \"integrated\" solutions. This means that complex is the opposite of independent, while complicated is the opposite of simple.\nWhile this has led some fields to come up with specific definitions of complexity, there is a more recent movement to regroup observations from different fields to study complexity in itself, whether it appears in anthills, human brains or social systems. One such interdisciplinary group of fields is relational order theories.\nTopics.\nBehaviour.\nThe behavior of a complex system is often said to be due to emergence and self-organization. Chaos theory has investigated the sensitivity of systems to variations in initial conditions as one cause of complex behaviour.\nMechanisms.\nRecent developments in artificial life, evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms have led to an increasing emphasis on complexity and complex adaptive systems.\nSimulations.\nIn social science, the study on the emergence of macro-properties from the micro-properties, also known as macro-micro view in sociology. The topic is commonly recognized as social complexity that is often related to the use of computer simulation in social science, i.e. computational sociology.\nSystems.\nSystems theory has long been concerned with the study of complex systems (in recent times, \"complexity theory\" and \"complex systems\" have also been used as names of the field). These systems are present in the research of a variety of disciplines, including biology, economics, social studies and technology. Recently, complexity has become a natural domain of interest of real-world socio-cognitive systems and emerging systemics research. Complex systems tend to be high-dimensional, non-linear, and difficult to model. In specific circumstances, they may exhibit low-dimensional behaviour.\nData.\nIn information theory, algorithmic information theory is concerned with the complexity of strings of data.\nComplex strings are harder to compress. While intuition tells us that this may depend on the codec used to compress a string (a codec could be theoretically created in any arbitrary language, including one in which the very small command \"X\" could cause the computer to output a very complicated string like \"18995316\"), any two Turing-complete languages can be implemented in each other, meaning that the length of two encodings in different languages will vary by at most the length of the \"translation\" language \u2013 which will end up being negligible for sufficiently large data strings.\nThese algorithmic measures of complexity tend to assign high values to random noise. However, under a certain understanding of complexity, arguably the most intuitive one, random noise is meaningless and so not complex at all.\nInformation entropy is also sometimes used in information theory as indicative of complexity, but entropy is also high for randomness. In the case of complex systems, information fluctuation complexity was designed so as not to measure randomness as complex and has been useful in many applications. More recently, a complexity metric was developed for images that can avoid measuring noise as complex by using the minimum description length principle.\nClassification Problems.\nThere has also been interest in measuring the complexity of classification problems in supervised machine learning. This can be useful in meta-learning to determine for which data sets filtering (or removing suspected noisy instances from the training set) is the most beneficial and could be expanded to other areas. For binary classification, such measures can consider the overlaps in feature values from differing classes, the separability of the classes, and measures of geometry, topology, and density of manifolds.\nFor non-binary classification problems, instance hardness is a bottom-up approach that first seeks to identify instances that are likely to be misclassified (assumed to be the most complex). The characteristics of such instances are then measured using supervised measures such as the number of disagreeing neighbors or the likelihood of the assigned class label given the input features.\nIn molecular recognition.\nA recent study based on molecular simulations and compliance constants describes molecular recognition as a phenomenon of organisation.\nEven for small molecules like carbohydrates, the recognition process can not be predicted or designed even assuming that each individual hydrogen bond's strength is exactly known.\nThe law of requisite complexity.\nDeriving from the law of requisite variety, Boisot and McKelvey formulated the \u2018Law of Requisite Complexity\u2019, that holds that, in order to be efficaciously adaptive, the internal complexity of a system must match the external complexity it confronts.\nPositive, appropriate and negative complexity.\nThe application in project management of the Law of Requisite Complexity, as proposed by Stefan Morcov, is the analysis of positive, appropriate and negative complexity.\nIn project management.\nProject complexity is the property of a project which makes it difficult to understand, foresee, and keep under control its overall behavior, even when given reasonably complete information about the project system.\nIn systems engineering.\nMaik Maurer considers complexity as a reality in engineering. He proposed a methodology for managing complexity in systems engineering :\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Define the system.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Identify the type of complexity.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Determine the strategy.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Determine the method.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a05. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Model the system.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a06. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Implement the method.\nApplications.\nComputational complexity theory is the study of the complexity of problems \u2013 that is, the difficulty of solving them. Problems can be classified by complexity class according to the time it takes for an algorithm \u2013 usually a computer program \u2013 to solve them as a function of the problem size. Some problems are difficult to solve, while others are easy. For example, some difficult problems need algorithms that take an exponential amount of time in terms of the size of the problem to solve. Take the travelling salesman problem, for example. It can be solved, as denoted in Big O notation, in time formula_1 (where \"n\" is the size of the network to visit \u2013 the number of cities the travelling salesman must visit exactly once). As the size of the network of cities grows, the time needed to find the route grows (more than) exponentially.\nEven though a problem may be computationally solvable in principle, in actual practice it may not be that simple. These problems might require large amounts of time or an inordinate amount of space. Computational complexity may be approached from many different aspects. Computational complexity can be investigated on the basis of time, memory or other resources used to solve the problem. Time and space are two of the most important and popular considerations when problems of complexity are analyzed.\nThere exist a certain class of problems that although they are solvable in principle they require so much time or space that it is not practical to attempt to solve them. These problems are called intractable.\nThere is another form of complexity called hierarchical complexity. It is orthogonal to the forms of complexity discussed so far, which are called horizontal complexity.\nEmerging applications in other fields.\nThe concept of complexity is being increasingly used in the study of cosmology, big history, and cultural evolution with increasing granularity, as well as increasing quantification.\nApplication in cosmology.\nEric Chaisson has advanced a cosmological complexity metric which he terms Energy Rate Density. This approach has been expanded in various works, most recently applied to measuring evolving complexity of nation-states and their growing cities.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Someone who is \"chaste\" refrains from sexual activity that is considered immoral or from any sexual activity, according to their state of life. In some contexts, for example when making a vow of chastity, chastity means celibacy.\nEtymology.\nThe words \"chaste\" and \"chastity\" stem from the Latin adjective (\"cut off\", \"separated\", \"pure\"). The words entered the English language around the middle of the 13th century. \"Chaste\" meant \"virtuous\", \"pure from unlawful sexual intercourse\" or (from the early 14th century on) as a noun, a virgin, while \"chastity\" meant \"(sexual) purity\".\nThomas Aquinas links (chastity) to the Latin verb (\"chastise, reprimand, correct\"), with a reference to Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\": \"Chastity takes its name from the fact that reason 'chastises' concupiscence, which, like a child, needs curbing, as the Philosopher states\".\nIn Abrahamic religions.\nFor many Orthodox Jews, Christians, and Muslims, people should restrict their acts of a sexual nature to the context of marriage. For unmarried people, chastity is equivalent to sexual abstinence. Sexual acts outside of or apart from marriage, such as adultery, fornication, masturbation, and prostitution, are considered immoral due to lust.\nChristianity.\nTraditions.\nIn many Christian traditions, chastity is synonymous with purity. The Catholic Church teaches that chastity involves, in the words of cardinal bishop Alfonso L\u00f3pez Trujillo, \"the successful integration of sexuality within the person and thus the inner unity of man in his bodily and spiritual being\", which according to one's marital status requires either having no sexual relationship, or only having sexual relations with one's spouse. In Western Christian morality, chastity is placed opposite the deadly sin of lust, and is classified as one of seven virtues. The moderation of sexual desires is also required to be virtuous. Reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.\nAs an emblem of inward chastity, some Christians choose to wear a cord, girdle or a cincture of one of the several Confraternities of the Cord or a purity ring. The cord is worn as a symbol of chastity in honour of a chaste saint whom the bearer asks for intercession. The purity ring is worn before holy matrimony by those who marry or for the rest of their lives by those who stay single.\nMarital chastity.\nIn marriage, the spouses commit to a lifelong relationship that excludes sexual intimacy with other persons. A third form of chastity, often called \"vidual chastity\", is expected by the society for a period after the woman's husband dies. For example, Anglican Bishop Jeremy Taylor defined five rules in \"Holy Living\" (1650), including abstaining from marrying \"so long as she is with child by her former husband\" and \"within the year of mourning\".\nCelibacy.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, members of the consecrated life vow or promise celibacy as one of the evangelical counsels. In 306, the Synod of Elvira proscribed clergy from marrying. This was unevenly enforced until the Second Lateran Council in 1139 when it found its way into canon law. Unmarried deacons promise celibacy to their local bishop when ordained.\nEastern Catholic priests are permitted to marry, provided they do so before ordination and outside monastic life.\nVows of chastity.\n\"Vows of chastity\" can be taken either as part of an organised religious life (such as Roman Catholic Beguines and Beghards in the past) or on an individual basis: as a voluntary act of devotion, or as part of an ascetic lifestyle (often devoted to contemplation), or both. Some Protestant religious communities, such as the Bruderhof, take vows of chastity as part of the church membership process.\nTeaching by denomination.\nCatholicism.\nChastity is a central and pivotal concept in Roman Catholic praxis. Roman Catholic teaching regards chastity as essential in maintaining and cultivating the unity of body with spirit and thus the integrity of the human being. It is also fundamental to the practise of the Catholic life because it involves an \"apprenticeship in self-mastery\". By attaining mastery over one's passions, reason, will, and desire can harmoniously work together to do what is good.\nLutheranism.\nThe theology of the body of the Lutheran Churches emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit, who sanctified the bodies of Christians to be God's temple.\nMany Lutheran monks (e.g. \u00d6stanb\u00e4ck Monastery) and Lutheran nuns (e.g. Daughters of Mary) practice celibacy, though in some Lutheran religious orders it is not compulsory.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) chastity is very important:\nPhysical intimacy between husband and wife is a beautiful and sacred part of God's plan for His children. It is an expression of love within marriage and allows husband and wife to participate in the creation of life. God has commanded that this sacred power be expressed only between a man and a woman who are legally married. The law of chastity applies to both men and women. It includes strict abstinence from sexual relations before marriage and complete fidelity and loyalty to one's spouse after marriage.\nThe law of chastity requires that sexual relations be reserved for marriage between a man and a woman.\nIn addition to reserving sexual intimacy for marriage, we obey the law of chastity by controlling our thoughts, words, and actions. Jesus Christ taught, \"Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart\" ().\"\nTeachings of the LDS Church also include that sexual expression within marriage is an important dimension of spousal bonding apart from, but not necessarily avoiding, its procreative result.\nIslam.\nQuran.\nThe most famous personal example of chastity in the Quran is the Virgin Mary (Mariam):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And \u02f9remember\u02fa the one who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her through Our angel, \u02f9Gabriel,\u02fa making her and her son a sign for all peoples.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;screening herself off from them. Then We sent to her Our angel, \u02f9Gabriel,\u02fa appearing before her as a man, perfectly formed. She appealed, \u201cI truly seek refuge in the Most Compassionate from you! \u02f9So leave me alone\u02fa if you are God-fearing.\u201d He responded, \u201cI am only a messenger from your Lord, \u02f9sent\u02fa to bless you with a pure son.\u201d She wondered, \u201cHow can I have a son when no man has ever touched me, nor am I unchaste?\u201d\u2014\u200a\nExtramarital sex is forbidden. The Quran says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do not go near adultery. It is truly a shameful deed and an evil way.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u02f9They are\u02fa those who do not invoke any other god besides Allah, nor take a \u02f9human\u02fa life\u2014made sacred by Allah\u2014except with \u02f9legal\u02fa right, nor commit fornication. And whoever does \u02f9any of\u02fa this will face the penalty. Their punishment will be multiplied on the Day of Judgment, and they will remain in it forever, in disgrace. As for those who repent, believe, and do good deeds, they are the ones whose evil deeds Allah will change into good deeds. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\u2014\u200a\nIn a list of commendable deeds the Quran says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Surely \u02f9for\u02fa Muslim men and women, believing men and women, devout men and women, truthful men and women, patient men and women, humble men and women, charitable men and women, fasting men and women, men and women who guard their chastity, and men and women who remember Allah often\u2014for \u02f9all of\u02fa them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.\u2014\u200a\nBecause the sex desire is usually attained before a man is financially capable of marriage, the love to God and mindfulness of Him should be sufficient motive for chastity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And let those who do not have the means to marry keep themselves chaste until Allah enriches them out of His bounty. And if any of those \u02f9bondspeople\u02fa in your possession desires a deed of emancipation, make it possible for them, if you find goodness in them. And give them some of Allah\u2019s wealth which He has granted you. Do not force your \u02f9slave\u02fa girls into prostitution for your own worldly gains while they wish to remain chaste. And if someone coerces them, then after such a coercion Allah is certainly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful \u02f9to them\u02fa.\u2014\u200a\nSharia (Law).\nChastity is mandatory in Islam. Sex outside legitimacy is prohibited, for both men and women, whether married or unmarried. The injunctions and forbiddings in Islam apply equally to men and women. The legal punishment for adultery is equal for men and women. \nThe prophet's prescription to the youth was:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.\"\u2014\u200a\nChastity is an attitude and a way of life. In Islam it is both a personal and a social value. A Muslim society should not condone relations entailing or conducive to sexual license. Social patterns and practices calculated to inflame sexual desire are frowned upon by Islam, such incitements to immorality including permissive ideologies, titillating works of art, and the failure to inculcate sound moral principles in the young. At the heart of such a view of human sexuality lies the conviction that the notion of personal freedom should never be misconstrued as the freedom to flout God's laws by overstepping the bounds which, in his infinite wisdom, he has set upon the relations of the sexes.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nChastity is highly prized in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. Similar to other Abrahamic religions, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings call for the restriction of sexual activity to that between a wife and husband in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed marriage, and discourage members from using pornography or engaging in sexually explicit recreational activities. The concept of chastity is extended to include avoidance of alcohol and mind-altering drugs, profanity, and gaudy or immodest attire.\nIn Eastern religions.\nHinduism.\nHinduism's view on premarital sex is rooted in its concept of , or the stages of life. The first of these stages, known as , roughly translates as chastity. Celibacy and chastity are considered the appropriate behavior for both male and female students during this stage, which precedes the stage of the married householder (). and Hindu monks, or , are also celibate as part of their ascetic discipline.\nSikhism.\nIn Sikhism, premarital or extramarital sex is strictly forbidden. However, it is encouraged to marry and live as a family unit to provide and nurture children for the perpetual benefit of creation (as opposed to , or living as a monk, which was, and remains, a common spiritual practice in India). A Sikh is encouraged not to live as a recluse, beggar, monk, nun, celibate, or in any similar vein.\nJainism.\nThe Jain ethical code contains the vow of (meaning \"pure conduct\"), which prescribes the expectations for Jains concerning sexual activity. is one of the five major and minor vows of Jainism, prescribing slightly different expectations for ascetics and laypeople, respectively.\nComplete celibacy is expected only of Jain ascetics (who are also referred to as monks and nuns). For laypeople, chastity is expected, with extramarital sex and adultery being prohibited.\nBuddhism.\nThe teachings of Buddhism include the Noble Eightfold Path, comprising a division called right action. Under the Five Precepts ethical code, and lay followers should abstain from sexual misconduct, while and monastics should practice strict chastity.\nTaoism.\nThe Five Precepts of the Taoist religion include \"no sexual misconduct\", which is interpreted as prohibiting extramarital sex for lay practitioners and marriage or sexual intercourse for monks and nuns.\nGovernment.\nIn Iran, women are required to wear hijabs as part of that society's efforts to enforce chastity. In 2023 the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance announced a new bill titled the Protection of the Culture of Chastity and Hijab Law, expanding its number of sections from 15 to 70.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a standard optical telescope, the background space between stars and galaxies is almost completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope detects a faint background glow that is almost uniform and is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Its energy density exceeds that of all the photons emitted by all the stars in the history of the universe. The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s.\nThe CMB is landmark evidence of the Big Bang theory for the origin of the universe. In the Big Bang cosmological models, during the earliest periods, the universe was filled with an opaque fog of dense, hot plasma of sub-atomic particles. As the universe expanded, this plasma cooled to the point where protons and electrons combined to form neutral atoms of mostly hydrogen. Unlike the plasma, these atoms could not scatter thermal radiation by Thomson scattering, and so the universe became transparent. Known as the recombination epoch, this decoupling event released photons to travel freely through space. However, the photons have grown less energetic due to the cosmological redshift associated with the expansion of the universe. The \"surface of last scattering\" refers to a shell at the right distance in space so photons are now received that were originally emitted at the time of decoupling.\nThe CMB is very smooth and uniform, but maps by sensitive detectors detect small but important temperature variations. Ground and space-based experiments such as COBE, WMAP and Planck have been used to measure these temperature inhomogeneities. The anisotropy structure is influenced by various interactions of matter and photons up to the point of decoupling, which results in a characteristic pattern of tiny ripples that varies with angular scale. The distribution of the anisotropy across the sky has frequency components that can be represented by a power spectrum displaying a sequence of peaks and valleys. The peak values of this spectrum hold important information about the physical properties of the early universe: the first peak determines the overall curvature of the universe, while the second and third peak detail the density of normal matter and so-called dark matter, respectively. Extracting fine details from the CMB data can be challenging, since the emission has undergone modification by foreground features such as galaxy clusters.\nFeatures.\nThe cosmic microwave background radiation is an emission of uniform black body thermal energy coming from all directions. Intensity of the CMB is expressed in kelvin (K), the SI unit of temperature. The CMB has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of . Variations in intensity are expressed as variations in temperature. The blackbody temperature uniquely characterizes the intensity of the radiation at all wavelengths; a measured brightness temperature at any wavelength can be converted to a blackbody temperature.\nThe radiation is remarkably uniform across the sky, very unlike the almost point-like structure of stars or clumps of stars in galaxies. The radiation is isotropic to roughly one part in 25,000: the root mean square variations are just over 100\u00a0\u03bcK, after subtracting a dipole anisotropy from the Doppler shift of the background radiation. The latter is caused by the peculiar velocity of the Sun relative to the comoving cosmic rest frame as it moves at 369.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0km/s towards the constellation Crater near its boundary with the constellation Leo. The CMB dipole and aberration at higher multipoles have been measured, consistent with galactic motion.\nDespite the very small degree of anisotropy in the CMB, many aspects can be measured with high precision and such measurements are critical for cosmological theories.\nIn addition to temperature anisotropy, the CMB should have an angular variation in polarization. The polarisation at each direction in the sky has an orientation described in terms of E-mode and B-mode polarization. The E-mode signal is a factor of 10 less strong than the temperature anisotropy; it supplements the temperature data as they are correlated. The B-mode signal is even weaker but may contain additional cosmological data.\nThe anisotropy is related to physical origin of the polarisation. Excitation of an electron by linear polarised light generates polarized light at 90 degrees to the incident direction. If the incoming radiation is isotropic, different incoming directions create polarizations that cancel out. If the incoming radiation has quadrupole anisotropy, residual polarization will be seen.\nOther than the temperature and polarization anisotropy, the CMB frequency spectrum is expected to feature tiny departures from the black-body law known as spectral distortions. These are also at the focus of an active research effort with the hope of a first measurement within the forthcoming decades, as they contain a wealth of information about the primordial universe and the formation of structures at late time.\nThe CMB contains the vast majority of photons in the universe by a factor of 400 to 1; the number density of photons in the CMB is one billion times (109) the number density of matter in the universe. The present-day energy density of CMB photons greatly exceeds that of the photons emitted by all the stars over the history of the universe. Without the expansion of the universe to cause the cooling of the CMB, the night sky would shine as brightly as the Sun. The energy density of the CMB is , about 411 photons/cm3.\nHistory.\nEarly speculations.\nIn 1931, Georges Lema\u00eetre speculated that remnants of the early universe may be observable as radiation, but his candidate was cosmic rays. Richard C. Tolman showed in 1934 that expansion of the universe would cool blackbody radiation while maintaining a thermal spectrum.\nThe cosmic microwave background was first predicted in 1948 by Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, in a correction they prepared for a paper by Alpher's PhD advisor George Gamow. Alpher and Herman were able to estimate the temperature of the cosmic microwave background to be 5\u00a0K.\nDiscovery.\nThe first published recognition of the CMB radiation as a detectable phenomenon appeared in a brief paper by Soviet astrophysicists A. G. Doroshkevich and Igor Novikov, in the spring of 1964. In 1964, David Todd Wilkinson and Peter Roll, Robert H. Dicke's colleagues at Princeton University, began constructing a Dicke radiometer to measure the cosmic microwave background. In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson at the Crawford Hill location of Bell Telephone Laboratories in nearby Holmdel Township, New Jersey had built a Dicke radiometer that they intended to use for radio astronomy and satellite communication experiments. The antenna was constructed in 1959 to support Project Echo\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's passive communications satellites, which used large Earth orbiting aluminized plastic balloons as reflectors to bounce radio signals from one point on the Earth to another. On 20\u00a0May 1964 they made their first measurement clearly showing the presence of the microwave background, with their instrument having an excess 4.2K antenna temperature which they could not account for. After receiving a telephone call from Crawford Hill, Dicke said \"Boys, we've been scooped.\" A meeting between the Princeton and Crawford Hill groups determined that the antenna temperature was indeed due to the microwave background. Penzias and Wilson received the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.\nCosmic origin.\nThe interpretation of the cosmic microwave background was a controversial issue in the late 1960s. Alternative explanations included energy from within the Solar System, from galaxies, from intergalactic plasma and from multiple extragalactic radio sources. Two requirements would show that the microwave radiation was truly \"cosmic\". First, the intensity vs frequency or spectrum needed to be shown to match a thermal or blackbody source. This was accomplished by 1968 in a series of measurements of the radiation temperature at higher and lower wavelengths. Second, the radiation needed be shown to be isotropic, the same from all directions. This was also accomplished by 1970, demonstrating that this radiation was truly cosmic in origin.\nProgress on theory.\nIn the 1970s numerous studies showed that tiny deviations from isotropy in the CMB could result from events in the early universe.\nHarrison, Peebles and Yu, and Zel'dovich realized that the early universe would require quantum inhomogeneities that would result in temperature anisotropy at the level of 10\u22124 or 10\u22125. Rashid Sunyaev, using the alternative name \"relic radiation\", calculated the observable imprint that these inhomogeneities would have on the cosmic microwave background.\nCOBE.\nAfter a lull in the 1970s caused in part by the many experimental difficulties in measuring CMB at high precision,\nincreasingly stringent limits on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background were set by ground-based experiments during the 1980s. RELIKT-1, a Soviet cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiment on board the Prognoz 9 satellite (launched 1 July 1983), gave the first upper limits on the large-scale anisotropy.\nThe other key event in the 1980s was the proposal by Alan Guth for cosmic inflation. This theory of rapid spatial expansion gave an explanation for large-scale isotropy by allowing causal connection just before the epoch of last scattering. With this and similar theories, detailed prediction encouraged larger and more ambitious experiments.\nThe NASA Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite orbited Earth in 1989\u20131996 detected and quantified the large-scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities.\nThe NASA COBE mission clearly confirmed the primary anisotropy with the Differential Microwave Radiometer instrument, publishing their findings in 1992. The team received the Nobel Prize in physics for 2006 for this discovery.\nPrecision cosmology.\nInspired by the COBE results, a series of ground and balloon-based experiments measured cosmic microwave background anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the two decades. The sensitivity of the new experiments improved dramatically, with a reduction in internal noise by three orders of magnitude. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the scale of the first acoustic peak, which COBE did not have sufficient resolution to resolve. This peak corresponds to large scale density variations in the early universe that are created by gravitational instabilities, resulting in acoustical oscillations in the plasma. The first peak in the anisotropy was tentatively detected by the MAT/TOCO experiment and the result was confirmed by the BOOMERanG and MAXIMA experiments. These measurements demonstrated that the geometry of the universe is approximately flat, rather than curved. They ruled out cosmic strings as a major component of cosmic structure formation and suggested cosmic inflation was the right theory of structure formation.\nObservations after COBE.\nInspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution. These measurements were able to rule out cosmic strings as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested cosmic inflation was the right theory.\nDuring the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the BOOMERanG experiment reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one angular degree. Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the universe is flat. A number of ground-based interferometers provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the Very Small Array, Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI), and the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum.\nWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe.\nIn June 2001, NASA launched a second CMB space mission, WMAP, to make much more precise measurements of the large-scale anisotropies over the full sky. WMAP used symmetric, rapid-multi-modulated scanning, rapid switching radiometers at five frequencies to minimize non-sky signal noise. The data from the mission was released in five installments, the last being the nine-year summary.\nThe results are broadly consistent Lambda CDM models based on 6 free parameters and fitting in to Big Bang cosmology with cosmic inflation.\nPlanck Surveyor.\nA third space mission, the ESA (European Space Agency) Planck Surveyor, was launched in May 2009 and performed an even more detailed investigation until it was shut down in October 2013. Planck employed both HEMT radiometers and bolometer technology and measured the CMB at a smaller scale than WMAP. Its detectors were trialled in the Antarctic Viper telescope as ACBAR (Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver) experiment\u2014which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date\u2014and in the Archeops balloon telescope.\nOn 21 March 2013, the European-led research team behind the \"Planck\" cosmology probe released the mission's all-sky map (https://, https://) of the cosmic microwave background. The map suggests the universe is slightly older than researchers expected. According to the map, subtle fluctuations in temperature were imprinted on the deep sky when the cosmos was about years old. The imprint reflects ripples that arose as early, in the existence of the universe, as the first nonillionth (10\u221230) of a second. Apparently, these ripples gave rise to the present vast cosmic web of galaxy clusters and dark matter. Based on the 2013 data, the universe contains 4.9% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter and 68.3% dark energy. On 5 February 2015, new data was released by the \"Planck\" mission, according to which the age of the universe is billion years old and the Hubble constant was measured to be .\nTheoretical models.\nThe cosmic microwave background radiation and the cosmological redshift-distance relation are together regarded as the best available evidence for the Big Bang event. Measurements of the CMB have made the inflationary Big Bang model the Standard Cosmological Model. The discovery of the CMB in the mid-1960s curtailed interest in alternatives such as the steady state theory.\nIn the Big Bang model for the formation of the universe, inflationary cosmology predicts that after about 10\u221237 seconds the nascent universe underwent exponential growth that smoothed out nearly all irregularities. The remaining irregularities were caused by quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field that caused the inflation event. Long before the formation of stars and planets, the early universe was more compact, much hotter and, starting 10\u22126 seconds after the Big Bang, filled with a uniform glow from its white-hot fog of interacting plasma of photons, electrons, and baryons.\nAs the universe expanded, adiabatic cooling caused the energy density of the plasma to decrease until it became favorable for electrons to combine with protons, forming hydrogen atoms. This recombination event happened when the temperature was around 3000\u00a0K or when the universe was approximately 379,000\u00a0years old. As photons did not interact with these electrically neutral atoms, the former began to travel freely through space, resulting in the decoupling of matter and radiation.\nThe color temperature of the ensemble of decoupled photons has continued to diminish ever since; now down to , it will continue to drop as the universe expands. The intensity of the radiation corresponds to black-body radiation at 2.726\u00a0K because red-shifted black-body radiation is just like black-body radiation at a lower temperature. According to the Big Bang model, the radiation from the sky we measure today comes from a spherical surface called \"the surface of last scattering\". This represents the set of locations in space at which the decoupling event is estimated to have occurred and at a point in time such that the photons from that distance have just reached observers. Most of the radiation energy in the universe is in the cosmic microwave background, making up a fraction of roughly of the total density of the universe.\nTwo of the greatest successes of the Big Bang theory are its prediction of the almost perfect black body spectrum and its detailed prediction of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. The CMB spectrum has become the most precisely measured black body spectrum in nature.\nPredictions based on the Big Bang model.\nIn the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned that if there was a Big Bang, the expansion of the universe would have stretched the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and down to a temperature of about 5\u00a0K. They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had the right idea. They predicted the CMB. It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to discover that the microwave background was actually there.\nAccording to standard cosmology, the CMB gives a snapshot of the hot early universe at the point in time when the temperature dropped enough to allow electrons and protons to form hydrogen atoms. This event made the universe nearly transparent to radiation because light was no longer being scattered off free electrons. When this occurred some 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature of the universe was about 3,000\u00a0K. This corresponds to an ambient energy of about , which is much less than the ionization energy of hydrogen. This epoch is generally known as the \"time of last scattering\" or the period of recombination or decoupling.\nSince decoupling, the color temperature of the background radiation has dropped by an average factor of 1,089 due to the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the CMB photons are redshifted, causing them to decrease in energy. The color temperature of this radiation stays inversely proportional to a parameter that describes the relative expansion of the universe over time, known as the scale length. The color temperature \"T\"r of the CMB as a function of redshift, \"z\", can be shown to be proportional to the color temperature of the CMB as observed in the present day (2.725\u00a0K or 0.2348\u00a0meV):\n\"T\"r = 2.725\u00a0K \u00d7 (1 + \"z\")\nThe high degree of uniformity throughout the observable universe and its faint but measured anisotropy lend strong support for the Big Bang model in general and the \u039bCDM (\"Lambda Cold Dark Matter\") model in particular. Moreover, the fluctuations are coherent on angular scales that are larger than the apparent cosmological horizon at recombination. Either such coherence is acausally fine-tuned, or cosmic inflation occurred.&lt;ref name=\"hep-ph/0309057\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nPrimary anisotropy.\nThe anisotropy, or directional dependency, of the cosmic microwave background is divided into two types: primary anisotropy, due to effects that occur at the surface of last scattering and before; and secondary anisotropy, due to effects such as interactions of the background radiation with intervening hot gas or gravitational potentials, which occur between the last scattering surface and the observer.\nThe structure of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and diffusion damping (also called collisionless damping or Silk damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a conflict in the photon\u2013baryon plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons, moving at speeds much slower than light, makes them tend to collapse to form overdensities. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations, which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude.\nThe peaks contain interesting physical signatures. The angular scale of the first peak determines the curvature of the universe (but not the topology of the universe). The next peak\u2014ratio of the odd peaks to the even peaks\u2014determines the reduced baryon density. The third peak can be used to get information about the dark-matter density.\nThe locations of the peaks give important information about the nature of the primordial density perturbations. There are two fundamental types of density perturbations called \"adiabatic\" and \"isocurvature\". A general density perturbation is a mixture of both, and different theories that purport to explain the primordial density perturbation spectrum predict different mixtures.\nThe CMB spectrum can distinguish between these two because these two types of perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (\"\u2113\" values of the peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1\u00a0:\u00a03\u00a0:\u00a05\u00a0:\u00a0..., while adiabatic density perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1\u00a0:\u00a02\u00a0:\u00a03\u00a0:\u00a0... Observations are consistent with the primordial density perturbations being entirely adiabatic, providing key support for inflation, and ruling out many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings.\nCollisionless damping is caused by two effects, when the treatment of the primordial plasma as fluid begins to break down:\nThese effects contribute about equally to the suppression of anisotropies at small scales and give rise to the characteristic exponential damping tail seen in the very small angular scale anisotropies.\nThe depth of the LSS refers to the fact that the decoupling of the photons and baryons does not happen instantaneously, but instead requires an appreciable fraction of the age of the universe up to that era. One method of quantifying how long this process took uses the \"photon visibility function\" (PVF). This function is defined so that, denoting the PVF by \"P\"(\"t\"), the probability that a CMB photon last scattered between time \"t\" and \"t\" + \"dt\" is given by \"P\"(\"t\")\u2009\"dt\".\nThe maximum of the PVF (the time when it is most likely that a given CMB photon last scattered) is known quite precisely. The first-year WMAP results put the time at which \"P\"(\"t\") has a maximum as 372,000 years. This is often taken as the \"time\" at which the CMB formed. However, to figure out how long it took the photons and baryons to decouple, we need a measure of the width of the PVF. The WMAP team finds that the PVF is greater than half of its maximal value (the \"full width at half maximum\", or FWHM) over an interval of 115,000 years. By this measure, decoupling took place over roughly 115,000 years, and thus when it was complete, the universe was roughly 487,000 years old.\nLate time anisotropy.\nSince the CMB came into existence, it has apparently been modified by several subsequent physical processes, which are collectively referred to as late-time anisotropy, or secondary anisotropy. When the CMB photons became free to travel unimpeded, ordinary matter in the universe was mostly in the form of neutral hydrogen and helium atoms. However, observations of galaxies today seem to indicate that most of the volume of the intergalactic medium (IGM) consists of ionized material (since there are few absorption lines due to hydrogen atoms). This implies a period of reionization during which some of the material of the universe was broken into hydrogen ions.\nThe CMB photons are scattered by free charges such as electrons that are not bound in atoms. In an ionized universe, such charged particles have been liberated from neutral atoms by ionizing (ultraviolet) radiation. Today these free charges are at sufficiently low density in most of the volume of the universe that they do not measurably affect the CMB. However, if the IGM was ionized at very early times when the universe was still denser, then there are two main effects on the CMB:\nBoth of these effects have been observed by the WMAP spacecraft, providing evidence that the universe was ionized at very early times, at a redshift around 10. The detailed provenance of this early ionizing radiation is still a matter of scientific debate. It may have included starlight from the very first population of stars (population III stars), supernovae when these first stars reached the end of their lives, or the ionizing radiation produced by the accretion disks of massive black holes.\nThe time following the emission of the cosmic microwave background\u2014and before the observation of the first stars\u2014is semi-humorously referred to by cosmologists as the Dark Age, and is a period which is under intense study by astronomers (see 21 centimeter radiation).\nTwo other effects which occurred between reionization and our observations of the cosmic microwave background, and which appear to cause anisotropies, are the Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect, where a cloud of high-energy electrons scatters the radiation, transferring some of its energy to the CMB photons, and the Sachs\u2013Wolfe effect, which causes photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background to be gravitationally redshifted or blueshifted due to changing gravitational fields.\nAlternative theories.\nThe standard cosmology that includes the Big Bang \"enjoys considerable popularity among the practicing cosmologists\"\nHowever, there are challenges to the standard big bang framework for explaining CMB data. In particular standard cosmology requires fine-tuning of some free parameters, with different values supported by different experimental data.\nAs an example of the fine-tuning issue, standard cosmology cannot predict the present temperature of the relic radiation, formula_1. This value of formula_1 is one of the best results of experimental cosmology and the steady state model can predict it.\nHowever, alternative models have their own set of problems and they have only made post-facto explanations of existing observations. Nevertheless, these alternatives have played an important historic role in providing ideas for and challenges to the standard explanation.\nPolarization.\nThe cosmic microwave background is polarized at the level of a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-mode (or gradient-mode) and B-mode (or curl mode). This is in analogy to electrostatics, in which the electric field (\"E\"-field) has a vanishing curl and the magnetic field (\"B\"-field) has a vanishing divergence.\nE-modes.\nThe E-modes arise from Thomson scattering in a heterogeneous plasma.\nE-modes were first seen in 2002 by the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI).\nB-modes.\nB-modes are expected to be an order of magnitude weaker than the E-modes. The former are not produced by standard scalar type perturbations, but are generated by gravitational waves during cosmic inflation shortly after the big bang.\nHowever, gravitational lensing of the stronger E-modes can also produce B-mode polarization. Detecting the original B-modes signal requires analysis of the contamination caused by lensing of the relatively strong E-mode signal.\nPrimordial gravitational waves.\nModels of \"slow-roll\" cosmic inflation in the early universe predicts primordial gravitational waves that would impact the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background, creating a specific pattern of B-mode polarization. Detection of this pattern would support the theory of inflation and their strength can confirm and exclude different models of inflation.\nWhile claims that this characteristic pattern of B-mode polarization had been measured by BICEP2 instrument were later attributed to cosmic dust due to new results of the Planck experiment, subsequent reanalysis with compensation for foreground dust show limits in agreement with results from Lambda-CDM models.\nGravitational lensing.\nThe second type of B-modes was discovered in 2013 using the South Pole Telescope with help from the Herschel Space Observatory. In October 2014, a measurement of the B-mode polarization at 150\u00a0GHz was published by the POLARBEAR experiment. Compared to BICEP2, POLARBEAR focuses on a smaller patch of the sky and is less susceptible to dust effects. The team reported that POLARBEAR's measured B-mode polarization was of cosmological origin (and not just due to dust) at a 97.2% confidence level.\nMultipole analysis.\nThe CMB angular anisotropies are usually presented in terms of power per multipole.\nThe map of temperature across the sky, formula_3 is written as coefficients of spherical harmonics,\nformula_4\nwhere the formula_5 term measures the strength of the angular oscillation in formula_6, and \"\u2113\" is the multipole number while \"m\" is the azimuthal number.\nThe azimuthal variation is not significant and is removed by applying the angular correlation function, giving power spectrum term\u00a0formula_7 Increasing values of \"\u2113\" correspond to higher multipole moments of CMB, meaning more rapid variation with angle.\nCMBR monopole term (\"\u2113\" = 0).\nThe monopole term, \"\u2113\" = 0, is the constant isotropic mean temperature of the CMB, \"T\"\"\u03b3\" = with one standard deviation confidence. This term must be measured with absolute temperature devices, such as the FIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite.\nCMBR dipole anisotropy (\"\u2113\" = 1).\nCMB dipole represents the largest anisotropy, which is in the first spherical harmonic (\"\u2113\" = 1), a cosine function. The amplitude of CMB dipole is around . The CMB dipole moment is interpreted as the peculiar motion of the Earth relative to the CMB. Its amplitude depends on the time due to the Earth's orbit about the barycenter of the solar system. This enables us to add a time-dependent term to the dipole expression. The modulation of this term is 1 year, which fits the observation done by COBE FIRAS. The dipole moment does not encode any primordial information.\nFrom the CMB data, it is seen that the Sun appears to be moving at relative to the reference frame of the CMB (also called the CMB rest frame, or the frame of reference in which there is no motion through the CMB). The Local Group\u200a\u2014\u200athe galaxy group that includes our own Milky Way galaxy\u200a\u2014\u200aappears to be moving at in the direction of galactic longitude \"\u2113\" =, \"b\" =. The dipole is now used to calibrate mapping studies.\nMultipole (\"\u2113\" \u2265 2).\nThe temperature variation in the CMB temperature maps at higher multipoles, or \"\u2113\" \u2265 2, is considered to be the result of perturbations of the density in the early Universe, before the recombination epoch at a redshift of around\u00a0\"z\" \u22cd 1100. Before recombination, the Universe consisted of a hot, dense plasma of electrons and baryons. In such a hot dense environment, electrons and protons could not form any neutral atoms. The baryons in such early Universe remained highly ionized and so were tightly coupled with photons through the effect of Thompson scattering. These phenomena caused the pressure and gravitational effects to act against each other, and triggered fluctuations in the photon-baryon plasma. Quickly after the recombination epoch, the rapid expansion of the universe caused the plasma to cool down and these fluctuations are \"frozen into\" the CMB maps we observe today.\nAnomalies.\nWith the increasingly precise data provided by WMAP, there have been a number of claims that the CMB exhibits anomalies, such as very large scale anisotropies, anomalous alignments, and non-Gaussian distributions.&lt;ref name=\"arXiv:astro-ph/0511666\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"arXiv:astro-ph/0503213\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The most longstanding of these is the low-\"\u2113\" multipole controversy. Even in the COBE map, it was observed that the quadrupole (\"\u2113\" = 2, spherical harmonic) has a low amplitude compared to the predictions of the Big Bang. In particular, the quadrupole and octupole (\"\u2113\" = 3) modes appear to have an unexplained alignment with each other and with both the ecliptic plane and equinoxes. A number of groups have suggested that this could be the signature of quantum corrections or new physics at the greatest observable scales; other groups suspect systematic errors in the data.\nUltimately, due to the foregrounds and the cosmic variance problem, the greatest modes will never be as well measured as the small angular scale modes. The analyses were performed on two maps that have had the foregrounds removed as far as possible: the \"internal linear combination\" map of the WMAP collaboration and a similar map prepared by Max Tegmark and others. Later analyses have pointed out that these are the modes most susceptible to foreground contamination from synchrotron, dust, and bremsstrahlung emission, and from experimental uncertainty in the monopole and dipole.\nA full Bayesian analysis of the WMAP power spectrum demonstrates that the quadrupole prediction of Lambda-CDM cosmology is consistent with the data at the 10% level and that the observed octupole is not remarkable. Carefully accounting for the procedure used to remove the foregrounds from the full sky map further reduces the significance of the alignment by ~5%.\nRecent observations with the Planck telescope, which is very much more sensitive than WMAP and has a larger angular resolution, record the same anomaly, and so instrumental error (but not foreground contamination) appears to be ruled out. Coincidence is a possible explanation, chief scientist from WMAP, Charles L. Bennett suggested coincidence and human psychology were involved, \"I do think there is a bit of a psychological effect; people want to find unusual things.\"\nMeasurements of the density of quasars based on Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data finds a dipole significantly different from the one extracted from the CMB anisotropy. This difference is conflict with the cosmological principle.\nFuture evolution.\nAssuming the universe keeps expanding and it does not suffer a Big Crunch, a Big Rip, or another similar fate, the cosmic microwave background will continue redshifting until it will no longer be detectable, and will be superseded first by the one produced by starlight, and perhaps, later by the background radiation fields of processes that may take place in the far future of the universe such as proton decay, evaporation of black holes, and positronium decay.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7378", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7378", "title": "Comparative law", "text": "Study of relationship between legal systems\nComparative law is the study of differences and similarities between the law and legal systems of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal systems (or \"families\") in existence around the world, including common law, civil law, socialist law, Canon law, Jewish Law, Islamic law, Hindu law, and Chinese law. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism and economic globalization.\nHistory.\nThe origins of modern comparative law can be traced back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1667 in his Latin-language book (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence). Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. A few years later, Leibniz introduced an idea of Language families.\nAlthough every legal system is unique, comparative law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of legal systems, wherein law families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between law families are found in the source(s) of law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the legal system. Montesquieu is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, \"De l'esprit des lois\" (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]he political and civil laws of each nation ... should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it should be a great chance if those of one nation suit another.\nThey should be in relation to the nature and principle of each government: whether they form it, as may be said of politic laws; or whether they support it, as in the case of civil institutions.\nThey should be in relation to the climate of each country, to the quality of its soil, to its situation and extent, to the principal occupation of the natives, whether husbandmen, huntsmen, or shepherds: they should have relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear; to the religion of the inhabitants, to their inclinations, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, and customs.\nAlso, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that \"to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety.\" Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As the civil laws depend on the political institutions, because they are made for the same society, whenever there is a design of adopting the civil law of another nation, it would be proper to examine beforehand whether they have both the same institutions and the same political law.\nThe modern founding figure of comparative and anthropological jurisprudence was Sir Henry Maine, a British jurist and legal historian. In his 1861 work \"Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas\", he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of Eastern and Western legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.\nThe first university course on the subject was established at the University of Oxford in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.\nComparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, Rudolf Schlesinger. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at Cornell Law School helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.\nPurpose.\nComparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ, and how their elements combine into a system.\nSeveral disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative constitutional law, comparative administrative law, comparative civil law (in the sense of the law of torts, contracts, property and obligations), comparative commercial law (in the sense of business organisations and trade), and comparative criminal law. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:\nRelationship with other legal subjects.\nComparative law is different from general jurisprudence (i.e. legal theory) and from public and private international law. However, it helps inform all of these areas of normativity.\nFor example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the United Nations System, in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of legal transplants, i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of legal transplants was coined by Alan Watson, one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law. Gunther Teubner expanded the notion of legal transplantation to include \"legal irritation\": Rather than smoothly integrating into domestic legal systems, a foreign rule disrupts established norms and societal arrangements. This disruption sparks an evolution where the external rule's meaning is redefined and where significant transformations within the internal context are triggered. Lasse Schuldt added that irritation is not spontaneous, but requires institutional drivers.\nAlso, the usefulness of comparative law for sociology of law and law and economics (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law &amp; economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as:\nClassifications of legal systems.\nDavid.\nRen\u00e9 David proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:\nEspecially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Civil and Common laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Common law and Civil law systems, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between, say, Italian and American laws, and of a different kind than between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese laws. According to David, the Civil law legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman law, whereas Common law countries are those dominated by judge-made law. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are:\nArminjon, Nolde, and Wolff.\nArminjon, Nolde, and Wolff believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems \"per se\" get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the:\nZweigert and K\u00f6tz.\nKonrad Zweigert and Hein K\u00f6tz propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:\nUp to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and K\u00f6tz also used to mention Soviet or socialist law as another family of laws.\nGlenn.\nH. Patrick Glenn proposed the classification of legal systems places national laws in the broader context of major legal tradition:\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7381", "revid": "50809006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7381", "title": "Cyberspace", "text": "Concept describing a widespread, interconnected digital technology\nCyberspace is an interconnected digital environment. It is a type of virtual world popularized with the rise of the Internet. The term entered popular culture from science fiction and the arts but is now used by technology strategists, security professionals, governments, military and industry leaders and entrepreneurs to describe the domain of the global technology environment, commonly defined as standing for the global network of interdependent information technology infrastructures, telecommunications networks and computer processing systems. Others consider cyberspace to be just a notional environment in which communication over computer networks occurs. The word became popular in the 1990s when the use of the Internet, networking, and digital communication were all growing dramatically; the term \"cyberspace\" was able to represent the many new ideas and phenomena that were emerging.\nAs a social experience, individuals can interact, exchange ideas, share information, provide social support, conduct business, direct actions, create artistic media, play games, engage in political discussion, and so on, using this global network. Cyberspace users are sometimes referred to as \"cybernauts\". \nThe term \"cyberspace\" has become a conventional means to describe anything associated with general computing, the Internet and the diverse Internet culture. The U.S. government recognizes the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures and cyber-physical systems operating across this medium as part of the US national critical infrastructure. Amongst individuals on cyberspace, there is believed to be a code of shared rules and ethics mutually beneficial for all to follow, referred to as cyberethics. Many view the right to privacy as most important to a functional code of cyberethics. Such moral responsibilities go hand in hand when working online with global networks, specifically when opinions are involved with online social experiences.\nAccording to Chip Morningstar and F. Randall Farmer, cyberspace is defined more by the social interactions involved rather than its technical implementation. In their view, the computational medium in cyberspace is an augmentation of the communication channel between real people; the core characteristic of cyberspace is that it offers an environment that consists of many participants with the ability to affect and influence each other. They derive this concept from the observation that people seek richness, complexity, and depth within a virtual world.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"cyberspace\" first appeared in the visual arts in the late 1960s, when Danish artist Susanne Ussing (1940\u20131998) and her partner architect Carsten Hoff (b. 1934) constituted themselves as Atelier Cyberspace. Under this name the two made a series of installations and images entitled \"sensory spaces\" that were based on the principle of open systems adaptable to various influences, such as human movement and the behaviour of new materials.\nAtelier Cyberspace worked at a time when the Internet did not exist and computers were more or less off-limit to artists and creative engagement. In a 2015 interview with Scandinavian art magazine \"Kunstkritikk\", Carsten Hoff recollects that although Atelier Cyberspace did try to implement computers, they had no interest in the virtual space as such:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To us, \"cyberspace\" was simply about managing spaces. There was nothing esoteric about it. Nothing digital, either. It was just a tool. The space was concrete, physical.\nIn the same interview, Hoff continues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Our shared point of departure was that we were working with physical settings, and we were both frustrated and displeased with the architecture from the period, particularly when it came to spaces for living. We felt that there was a need to loosen up the rigid confines of urban planning, giving back the gift of creativity to individual human beings and allowing them to shape and design their houses or dwellings themselves \u2013 instead of having some clever architect pop up, telling you how you should live. We were thinking in terms of open-ended systems where things could grow and evolve as required.\nFor instance, we imagined a kind of mobile production unit, but unfortunately the drawings have been lost. It was a kind of truck with a nozzle at the back. Like a bee building its hive. The nozzle would emit and apply material that grew to form amorphous mushrooms or whatever you might imagine. It was supposed to be computer-controlled, allowing you to create interesting shapes and sequences of spaces. It was a merging of organic and technological systems, a new way of structuring the world. And a response that counteracted industrial uniformity. We had this idea that sophisticated software might enable us to mimic the way in which nature creates products \u2013 where things that belong to the same family can take different forms. All oak trees are oak trees, but no two oak trees are exactly alike. And then a whole new material \u2013 polystyrene foam \u2013 arrived on the scene. It behaved like nature in the sense that it grew when its two component parts were mixed. Almost like a fungal growth. This made it an obvious choice for our work in Atelier Cyberspace.\nThe works of Atelier Cyberspace were originally shown at a number of Copenhagen venues and have later been exhibited at The National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen as part of the exhibition \"What's Happening?\"\nThe term \"cyberspace\" first appeared in fiction in the 1980s in the work of cyberpunk science fiction author William Gibson, first in his 1982 short story \"Burning Chrome\" and later in his 1984 novel \"Neuromancer\". In the next few years, the word became prominently identified with online computer networks. The portion of \"Neuromancer\" cited in this respect is usually the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.\nNow widely used, the term has since been criticized by Gibson, who commented on the origin of the term in the 2000 documentary \"No Maps for These Territories\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All I knew about the word \"cyberspace\" when I coined it, was that it seemed like an effective buzzword. It seemed evocative and essentially meaningless. It was suggestive of something, but had no real semantic meaning, even for me, as I saw it emerge on the page.\nMetaphorical.\nDon Slater uses a metaphor to define cyberspace, describing the \"sense of a social setting that exists purely within a space of representation and communication ... it exists entirely within a computer space, distributed across increasingly complex and fluid networks.\" The term \"cyberspace\" started to become a de facto synonym for the Internet, and later the World Wide Web, during the 1990s, especially in academic circles and activist communities. Author Bruce Sterling, who popularized this meaning, credits John Perry Barlow as the first to use it to refer to \"the present-day nexus of computer and telecommunications networks\". Barlow describes it thus in his essay to announce the formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (note the spatial metaphor) in June 1990:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In this silent world, all conversation is typed. To enter it, one forsakes both body and place and becomes a thing of words alone. You can see what your neighbors are saying (or recently said), but not what either they or their physical surroundings look like. Town meetings are continuous and discussions rage on everything from sexual kinks to depreciation schedules.\nWhether by one telephonic tendril or millions, they are all connected to one another. Collectively, they form what their inhabitants call the Net. It extends across that immense region of electron states, microwaves, magnetic fields, light pulses and thought which sci-fi writer William Gibson named Cyberspace.\u2014\u200a\nAs Barlow and the EFF continued public education efforts to promote the idea of \"digital rights\", the term was increasingly used during the Internet boom of the late 1990s.\nVirtual environments.\nAlthough in the present-day, loose use of the term \"cyberspace\" no longer implies or suggests immersion in a virtual reality, current technology allows the integration of a number of capabilities (sensors, signals, connections, transmissions, processors, and controllers) sufficient to generate a virtual interactive experience that is accessible regardless of a geographic location. It is for these reasons cyberspace has been described as the ultimate tax haven.\nIn 1989, Autodesk, an American multinational corporation that focuses on 2D and 3D design software, developed a virtual design system called Cyberspace.\nRecent definitions of Cyberspace.\nAlthough several definitions of cyberspace can be found both in scientific literature and in official governmental sources, there is no fully agreed official definition yet. According to F. D. Kramer ,there are 28 different definitions of the term \"cyberspace\".\nThe most recent draft definition is the following:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cyberspace is a global and dynamic domain (subject to constant change) characterized by the combined use of electrons and the electromagnetic spectrum, whose purpose is to create, store, modify, exchange, share, and extract, use, eliminate information and disrupt physical resources. Cyberspace includes: a) physical infrastructures and telecommunications devices that allow for the connection of technological and communication system networks, understood in the broadest sense (SCADA devices, smartphones/tablets, computers, servers, etc.); b) computer systems (see point a) and the related (sometimes embedded) software that guarantee the domain's basic operational functioning and connectivity; c) networks between computer systems; d) networks of networks that connect computer systems (the distinction between networks and networks of networks is mainly organizational); e) the access nodes of users and intermediaries routing nodes; f) constituent data (or resident data). Often, in common parlance (and sometimes in commercial language), networks of networks are called the Internet (with a lowercase i), while networks between computers are called intranet. Internet (with a capital I, in journalistic language sometimes called the Net) can be considered a part of the system a). A distinctive and constitutive feature of cyberspace is that no central entity exercises control over all the networks that make up this new domain.\nJust as in the real world there is no world government, cyberspace lacks an institutionally predefined hierarchical center. To cyberspace, a domain without a hierarchical ordering principle, we can, therefore, extend the definition of international politics coined by Kenneth Waltz: as being \"with no system of law enforceable.\" This does not mean that the dimension of power in cyberspace is absent, nor that power is dispersed and scattered into a thousand invisible streams, nor that it is evenly spread across myriad people and organizations, as some scholars had predicted. On the contrary, cyberspace is characterized by a precise structuring of hierarchies of power.\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Department of Defense define cyberspace as one of five interdependent domains, the remaining four being land, air, maritime, and space. \"See United States Cyber Command\"\nCyberspace as an Internet metaphor.\nWhile cyberspace should not be confused with the Internet, the term is often used to refer to objects and identities that exist largely within the communication network itself, so that a website, for example, might be metaphorically said to \"exist in cyberspace\". According to this interpretation, events taking place on the Internet are not happening in the locations where participants or servers are physically located, but \"in cyberspace\". The philosopher Michel Foucault used the term \"heterotopias\" to describe such spaces which are simultaneously physical and mental.\nFirstly, cyberspace describes the flow of digital data through the network of interconnected computers: it is at once not \"real\"\u2014since one could not spatially locate it as a tangible object\u2014and clearly \"real\" in its effects. There have been several attempts to create a concise model about how cyberspace works since it is not a physical thing that can be looked at. Secondly, cyberspace is the site of computer-mediated communication (CMC), in which online relationships and alternative forms of online identity are enacted, raising important questions about the social psychology of Internet use, the relationship between \"online\" and \"offline\" forms of life and interaction, and the relationship between the \"real\" and the virtual. Cyberspace draws attention to the remediation of culture through new media technologies: it is not just a communication tool, but a social destination, and is culturally significant in its own right. Finally, cyberspace can be seen as providing new opportunities to reshape society and culture through \"hidden\" identities, or it can be seen as borderless communication and culture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Cyberspace is the \"place\" where a telephone conversation appears to occur. Not inside your actual phone, the plastic device on your desk. Not inside the other person's phone, in some other city. The place between the phones. [...] in the past twenty years, this electrical \"space,\" which was once thin and dark and one-dimensional\u2014little more than a narrow speaking-tube, stretching from phone to phone\u2014has flung itself open like a gigantic jack-in-the-box. Light has flooded upon it, the eerie light of the glowing computer screen. This dark electric netherworld has become a vast flowering electronic landscape. Since the 1960s, the world of the telephone has cross-bred itself with computers and television, and though there is still no substance to cyberspace, nothing you can handle, it has a strange kind of physicality now. It makes good sense today to talk of cyberspace as a place all its own.\u2014\u200a\nThe \"space\" in cyberspace has more in common with the abstract, mathematical meanings of the term (see space) than physical space. It does not have the duality of positive and negative volume (while in physical space, for example, a room has the negative volume of usable space delineated by positive volume of walls, Internet users cannot enter the screen and explore the unknown part of the Internet as an extension of the space they are in), but spatial meaning can be attributed to the relationship between different pages (of books as well as web servers), considering the unturned pages to be somewhere \"out there.\" The concept of cyberspace, therefore, refers not to the content being presented to the surfer, but rather to the possibility of surfing among different sites, with feedback loops between the user and the rest of the system creating the potential to always encounter something unknown or unexpected.\nVideo games differ from text-based communication in that on-screen images are meant to be figures that actually occupy a space and the animation shows the movement of those figures. Images are supposed to form the positive volume that delineates the empty space. A game adopts the cyberspace metaphor by engaging more players in the game, and then figuratively representing them on the screen as avatars. Games do not have to stop at the avatar-player level, but current implementations aiming for more immersive playing space (i.e. Laser tag) take the form of augmented reality rather than cyberspace, fully immersive virtual realities remaining impractical.\nAlthough the more radical consequences of the global communication network predicted by some cyberspace proponents (i.e. the diminishing of state influence envisioned by John Perry Barlow) failed to materialize and the word lost some of its novelty appeal, it remains current as of 2006[ [update]].\nSome virtual communities explicitly refer to the concept of cyberspace\u2014for example, Linden Lab calling their customers \"Residents\" of Second Life\u2014while all such communities can be positioned \"in cyberspace\" for explanatory and comparative purposes (as did Sterling in \"The Hacker Crackdown\", followed by many journalists), integrating the metaphor into a wider cyber-culture.\nThe metaphor has been useful in helping a new generation of thought leaders to reason through new military strategies around the world, led largely by the US Department of Defense (DoD). The use of cyberspace as a metaphor has had its limits, however, especially in areas where the metaphor becomes confused with physical infrastructure. It has also been critiqued as being unhelpful for falsely employing a spatial metaphor to describe what is inherently a network.\nAlternate realities in philosophy and art.\nPredating computers.\nA forerunner of the modern ideas of cyberspace is the Cartesian notion that people might be deceived by an evil demon that feeds them a false reality. This argument is the direct predecessor of modern ideas of a brain in a vat and many popular conceptions of cyberspace take Descartes's ideas as their starting point.\nVisual arts have a tradition, stretching back to antiquity, of artifacts meant to fool the eye and be mistaken for reality. This questioning of reality occasionally led some philosophers and especially theologians to distrust art as deceiving people into entering a world which was not real (see Aniconism). The artistic challenge was resurrected with increasing ambition as art became more and more realistic with the invention of photography, film (see \"Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat\"), and immersive computer simulations.\nInfluenced by computers.\nPhilosophy.\nAmerican counterculture exponents like William S. Burroughs (whose literary influence on Gibson and cyberpunk in general is widely acknowledged) and Timothy Leary were among the first to extol the potential of computers and computer networks for individual empowerment.\nSome contemporary philosophers and scientists (e.g. David Deutsch in \"The Fabric of Reality\") employ virtual reality in various thought experiments. For example, Philip Zhai in \"Get Real: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality\" connects cyberspace to the Platonic tradition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let us imagine a nation in which everyone is hooked up to a network of VR infrastructure. They have been so hooked up since they left their mother's wombs. Immersed in cyberspace and maintaining their life by teleoperation, they have never imagined that life could be any different from that. The first person that thinks of the possibility of an alternative world like ours would be ridiculed by the majority of these citizens, just like the few enlightened ones in Plato's allegory of the cave.\nNote that this brain-in-a-vat argument conflates cyberspace with reality, while the more common descriptions of cyberspace contrast it with the \"real world\".\nCyber-geography.\nThe \u201cGeography of Notopia\u201d (Papadimitriou, 2006) theorizes about the complex interplay of cyber-cultures and the geographical space. This interplay has several philosophical and psychological facets (Papadimitriou, 2009).\nA new communication model.\nThe technological convergence of the mass media is the result of a long adaptation process of their communicative resources to the evolutionary changes of each historical moment. Thus, the new media became an extension of the traditional media in cyberspace, allowing the public access to information in a wide range of digital devices. In other words, it is a cultural virtualization of human reality as a result of the migration from physical to virtual space (mediated by the ICTs), ruled by codes, signs and particular social relationships. Forwards, arise instant ways of communication, interaction and possible quick access to information, in which we are no longer mere senders, but also producers, reproducers, co-workers and providers. New technologies also help to \"connect\" people from different cultures outside the virtual space, which was unthinkable fifty years ago. In this giant relationships web, we mutually absorb each other's beliefs, customs, values, laws and habits, cultural legacies perpetuated by a physical-virtual dynamics in constant metamorphosis (ibidem). In this sense, Professor Doctor Marcelo Mendon\u00e7a Teixeira created, in 2013, a new model of communication to the virtual universe, based in Claude Elwood Shannon (1948) article \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\".\nArt.\nHaving originated among writers, the concept of cyberspace remains most popular in literature and film. Although artists working with other media have expressed interest in the concept, such as Roy Ascott, \"cyberspace\" in digital art is mostly used as a synonym for immersive virtual reality and remains more discussed than enacted.\nComputer crime.\nCyberspace also brings together every service and facility imaginable to expedite money laundering. One can purchase anonymous credit cards, bank accounts, encrypted global mobile telephones, and false passports. From there one can pay professional advisors to set up IBCs (International Business Corporations, or corporations with anonymous ownership) or similar structures in OFCs (Offshore Financial Centers). Such advisors are loath to ask any penetrating questions about the wealth and activities of their clients, since the average fees criminals pay them to launder their money can be as much as 20 percent.\n5-level model.\nIn 2010, a five-level model was designed in France. According to this model, cyberspace is composed of five layers based on information discoveries: 1) language, 2) writing, 3) printing, 4) Internet, 5) Etc., i.e. the rest, e.g. noosphere, artificial life, artificial intelligence, etc., etc. This original model links the world of information to telecommunication technologies.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7382", "revid": "40727880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7382", "title": "The Maritimes", "text": "Region of Eastern Canada\nThe Maritimes, also called the Maritime provinces, is a region of Eastern Canada consisting of three provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. The Maritimes had a population of 1,899,324 in 2021, which makes up 5.1% of Canada's population. Together with Canada's easternmost province, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Maritime provinces make up the region of Atlantic Canada.\nLocated along the Atlantic coast, various aquatic sub-basins are located in the Maritimes, such as the Gulf of Maine and Gulf of St. Lawrence. The region is located northeast of New England in the United States, south and southeast of Quebec's Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, and southwest of the island of Newfoundland. The notion of a Maritime Union has been proposed at various times in Canada's history; the first discussions in 1864 at the Charlottetown Conference contributed to Canadian Confederation. This movement formed the larger Dominion of Canada. The Mi'kmaq, Wolastoqiyik and Passamaquoddy people are indigenous to the Maritimes, while Acadian and British settlements date to the 17th century. The Maritimes are within the Atlantic time zone, putting them one hour ahead of Quebec and the New England region of the United States.\nName.\nThe word \"maritime\" is an adjective that means \"of the sea\"; from Latin \"of the sea, near the sea\", from \"sea\". Thus any land adjacent to the sea can be considered maritime. But the term \"Maritimes\" has historically been collectively applied to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, all of which border the Atlantic Ocean.\nHistory.\nThe pre-history of the Canadian Maritimes begins after the northerly retreat of glaciers at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation over 10,000 years ago; human settlement by First Nations began in the Maritimes with Paleo-Indians during the \"Early Period\", ending around 6,000 years ago.\nThe \"Middle Period\", starting 6,000 years ago, and ending 3,000 years ago, was dominated by rising sea levels from the melting glaciers in polar regions. This is when what is called the \"Laurentian tradition\" started among Archaic Indians, the term used for First Nations peoples of the time. Evidence of Archaic Indian burial mounds and other ceremonial sites existing in the Saint John River valley has been uncovered.\nThe \"Late Period\" extended from 3,000 years ago until first contact with European settlers. This period was dominated by the organization of First Nations peoples into the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki Nation, which occupied territory largely in present-day interior Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, and the Mi'kmaq Nation, which inhabited all of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, eastern New Brunswick and the southern Gasp\u00e9. The primarily agrarian Wolastoqiyik Nation settled throughout the Saint John River and Allagash River valleys of present-day New Brunswick and Maine. The Passamaquoddy Nation inhabited the northwestern coastal regions of the present-day Bay of Fundy. The Mi'kmaq Nation is also believed to have crossed the present-day Cabot Strait at around this time to settle on the south coast of Newfoundland, but they were a minority compared to the Beothuk Nation.\nEuropean contact.\nAfter Newfoundland, the Maritimes were the second area in Canada to be settled by Europeans. There is evidence that Viking explorers discovered and settled in the Vinland region around 1000 AD, which is when the L'Anse aux Meadows settlement in Newfoundland and Labrador has been dated. They may have made further exploration into the present-day Maritimes and northeastern United States.\nBoth Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot) and Giovanni da Verrazzano are reported to have sailed in or near Maritime waters during their voyages of discovery for England and France, respectively. Several Portuguese explorers / cartographers have also documented various parts of the Maritimes, namely Diogo Homem. However, it was French explorer Jacques Cartier who made the first detailed reconnaissance of the region for a European power and, in so doing, claimed the region for the King of France. Cartier was followed by nobleman Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons, who was accompanied by explorer / cartographer Samuel de Champlain in a 1604 expedition. During this they established the second permanent European settlement in what is now the United States and Canada, following Spain's settlement at St. Augustine in present-day Florida in the American South. Champlain's settlement at Saint Croix Island, later moved to Port Royal (Annapolis Royal), survived. By contrast, the ill-fated English settlement at Roanoke Colony off the southern American coast did not. The French settlement pre-dated the more successful English settlement at Jamestown in present-day Virginia by three years. Champlain was considered the founder of New France's province of Canada, which comprises much of the present-day lower St. Lawrence River valley in the province of Quebec.\nAcadia.\nChamplain's success in the region, which came to be called , led to the fertile tidal marshes surrounding the southeastern and northeastern reaches of the Bay of Fundy being populated by French immigrants who called themselves . The Acadians eventually built small settlements throughout what is today mainland Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, as well as \u00cele-Saint-Jean (Prince Edward Island), \u00cele-Royale (Cape Breton Island), and other shorelines of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in present-day Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec. Acadian settlements had primarily agrarian economies. Early examples of Acadian fishing settlements developed in southwestern Nova Scotia and in \u00cele-Royale, as well as along the south and west coasts of Newfoundland, the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, and the present-day C\u00f4te-Nord region of Quebec. Most Acadian fishing activities were overshadowed by the much larger seasonal European fishing fleets that were based out of Newfoundland and took advantage of proximity to the Grand Banks.\nThe growing English colonies along the American seaboard to the south and various European wars between England and France during the 17th and 18th centuries brought Acadia to the centre of world-scale geopolitical forces. In 1613, Virginian raiders captured Port-Royal, and in 1621 France ceded Acadia to Scotland's Sir William Alexander, who renamed it \"Nova Scotia\".\nBy 1632, Acadia was returned from Scotland to France under the \"Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.\" The Port Royale settlement was moved to the site of nearby present-day Annapolis Royal. More French immigrant settlers, primarily from the Brittany, Normandie, and Vienne regions of France, continued to populate the colony of Acadia during the latter part of the 17th and early part of the 18th centuries. Important settlements also began in the Beaubassin region of the present-day Isthmus of Chignecto, and in the Saint John River valley, as well as smaller communities on \u00cele-Saint-Jean and \u00cele-Royale.\nIn 1654, raiders from New England attacked Acadian settlements on the Annapolis Basin. Acadians lived with uncertainty throughout the English constitutional crises under Oliver Cromwell, and it was not until the Treaty of Breda in 1667 that France's claim to the region was reaffirmed. Colonial administration by France throughout the history of Acadia was of low priority. France's priorities were in settling and strengthening its claim on the larger territory of New France and the exploration and settlement of interior North America and the Mississippi River valley.\nColonial wars.\nOver 74 years (1689\u20131763) there were six colonial wars, which involved continuous warfare between New England and Acadia (see the French and Indian Wars reflecting English and French tensions in Europe, as well as Father Rale's War (Dummer's War) and Father Le Loutre's War). Throughout these wars, New England was allied with the Iroquois Confederacy based around the southern Great Lakes and west of the Hudson River. Acadian settlers were allied with the Wabanaki Confederacy. In the first war, King William's War (the North American theatre of the Nine Years' War), natives from the Maritime region participated in numerous attacks with the French on the Acadia / New England border in southern Maine (e.g., Raid on Salmon Falls). New England retaliatory raids on Acadia, such as the Raid on Chignecto, were conducted by Benjamin Church. In the second war, Queen Anne's War (the North American theatre of the War of the Spanish Succession), the British conducted the Conquest of Acadia, while the region remained primarily in control of Wolastoqey militia, Acadia militia and Mi'kmaw militia.\nIn 1719, to further protect strategic interests in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River, France began the 20-year construction of a large fortress at Louisbourg on \u00cele-Royale. Massachusetts was increasingly concerned over reports of the capabilities of this fortress, and of privateers staging out of its harbour to raid New England fishermen on the Grand Banks. In the fourth war, King George's War (the North American theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession), the British engaged successfully in the Siege of Louisbourg. The British returned control of \u00cele-Royale to France with the fortress virtually intact three years later under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and the French reestablished their forces there.\nIn 1749, to counter the rising threat of Louisbourg, Halifax was founded and the Royal Navy established a major naval base and citadel. The founding of Halifax sparked Father Le Loutre's War.\nDuring the sixth and final colonial war, the French and Indian War (the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War), the military conflicts in Nova Scotia continued. The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710. Over the next forty-five years, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour. The British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia.\nThe British began the Expulsion of the Acadians with the Bay of Fundy campaign in 1755. Over the next nine years over 12,000 Acadians of 15,000 were removed from Nova Scotia.\nIn 1758, the fortress of Louisbourg was laid siege for a second time within 15 years, this time by more than 27,000 British soldiers and sailors with over 150 warships. After the French surrender, Louisbourg was thoroughly destroyed by British engineers to ensure it would never be reclaimed. With the fall of Louisbourg, French and Mi'kmaw resistance in the region crumbled. British forces seized remaining French control over Acadia in the coming months, with \u00cele-Saint-Jean falling in 1759 to British forces on their way to Quebec City for the first siege of Quebec and the ensuing Battle of the Plains of Abraham.\nThe war ended and Britain had gained control over the entire Maritime region and the Indigenous people signed the Halifax Treaties.\nAmerican Revolution.\nFollowing the Seven Years' War, empty Acadian lands were settled first by 8,000 New England Planters and then by immigrants brought from Yorkshire. \u00cele-Royale was renamed Cape Breton Island and incorporated into the Colony of Nova Scotia. Some of the Acadians who had been deported came back but went to the eastern coasts of New Brunswick.\nBoth the colonies of Nova Scotia (present-day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and St. John's Island (Prince Edward Island) were affected by the American Revolutionary War, largely by privateering against American shipping, but several coastal communities were also the targets of American raiders. Charlottetown, the capital of the new colony of St. John's Island, was ransacked in 1775 with the provincial secretary kidnapped and the Great Seal stolen. The largest military action in the Maritimes during the revolutionary war was the attack on Fort Cumberland (the renamed Fort Beaus\u00e9jour) in 1776 by a force of American sympathizers led by Jonathan Eddy. The fort was partially overrun after a month-long siege, but the attackers were ultimately repelled after the arrival of British reinforcements from Halifax.\nThe most significant impact from this war was the settling of large numbers of Loyalist refugees in the region (34,000 to the 17,000 settlers already there), especially in Shelburne and Parrtown (Saint John). Following the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Loyalist settlers in what would become New Brunswick persuaded British administrators to split the Colony of Nova Scotia to create the new colony of New Brunswick in 1784. At the same time, another part of the Colony of Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, was split off to become the Colony of Cape Breton Island. The Colony of St. John's Island was renamed Prince Edward Island on November 29, 1798.\nThe War of 1812 had some effect on the shipping industry in the Maritime colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton Island; however, the significant Royal Navy presence in Halifax and other ports in the region prevented any serious attempts by American raiders. Maritime and American privateers targeted unprotected shipping of both the United States and Britain respectively, further reducing trade. New Brunswick's section of the Canada\u2013US border did not have any significant action during this conflict, although British forces did occupy a portion of coastal Maine at one point. The most significant incident from this war which occurred in the Maritimes was the British capture and detention of USS \"Chesapeake\", an American frigate in Halifax.\n19th century.\nIn 1820, the Colony of Cape Breton Island was merged back into the Colony of Nova Scotia for the second time by the British government.\nBritish settlement of the Maritimes, as the colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island came to be known, accelerated throughout the late 18th century and into the 19th century with significant immigration to the region as a result of Scottish migrants displaced by the Highland Clearances and Irish escaping the Great Irish Famine (1845\u20131849). As a result, significant portions of the three provinces are influenced by Celtic heritages, with Scottish Gaelic (and to a lesser degree, Irish Gaelic) having been widely spoken, particularly in Cape Breton, although it is less prevalent today.\nDuring the American Civil War, a significant number of Maritimers volunteered to fight for the armies of the Union, while a small handful joined the Confederate Army. However, the majority of the conflict's impact was felt in the shipping industry. Maritime shipping boomed during the war due to large-scale Northern imports of war supplies which were often carried by Maritime ships as Union ships were vulnerable to Confederate naval raiders. Diplomatic tensions between Britain and the Unionist North had deteriorated after some interests in Britain expressed support for the secessionist Confederate South. The Union Navy, although much smaller than the British Royal Navy and no threat to the Maritimes, did posture off Maritime coasts at times chasing Confederate naval ships which sought repairs and reprovisioning in Maritime ports, especially Halifax.\nThe immense size of the Union Army (the largest on the planet toward the end of the Civil War), however, was viewed with increasing concern by Maritimers throughout the early 1860s. Another concern was the rising threat of Fenian raids on border communities in New Brunswick by the Fenian Brotherhood seeking to end British rule in Ireland. This combination of events, coupled with an ongoing decline in British military and economic support to the region as the Home Office favoured newer colonial endeavours in Africa and elsewhere, led to a call among Maritime politicians for a conference on Maritime Union, to be held in early September 1864 in Charlottetown \u2013 chosen in part because of Prince Edward Island's reluctance to give up its jurisdictional sovereignty in favour of uniting with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia into a single colony. New Brunswick and Nova Scotia felt that if the union conference were held in Charlottetown, they might be able to convince Island politicians to support the proposal.\nThe Charlottetown Conference, as it came to be called, was also attended by a slew of visiting delegates from the neighbouring Crown colony, the Province of Canada, who had largely arrived at their own invitation with their own agenda. This agenda saw the conference dominated by discussions of creating an even larger union of the entire territory of British North America into a united colony. The Charlottetown Conference ended with an agreement to meet the following month in Quebec City, where more formal discussions ensued, culminating with meetings in London and the signing of the \"British North America Act, 1867\" (BNA Act). Of the Maritime provinces, only Nova Scotia and New Brunswick were initially party to the BNA Act: Prince Edward Island's reluctance, combined with a booming agricultural and fishing export economy having led to that colony opting not to sign on.\nMajor population centres.\nThe major communities of the region include Halifax and Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, Moncton, Saint John, and Fredericton in New Brunswick, and Charlottetown in Prince Edward Island.\nClimate.\nIn spite of its name, the Maritimes has a humid continental climate of the warm-summer subtype. Especially in coastal Nova Scotia, differences between summers and winters are narrow compared to the rest of Canada. The inland climate of New Brunswick is in stark contrast during winter, resembling more continental areas. Summers are somewhat tempered by the marine influence throughout the provinces, but due to the southerly parallels still remain similar to more continental areas further west. Yarmouth in Nova Scotia has significant marine influence to have a borderline oceanic microclimate, but winter nights are still cold even in all coastal areas. The northernmost areas of New Brunswick are only just above subarctic with very cold continental winters.\nDemographics.\nMaritimers are predominantly of west European origin: Scottish Canadians, Irish Canadians, English Canadians, and Acadians. New Brunswick, in general, differs from the other two Maritime provinces in that it has a much higher Francophone population. There was once a significant Canadian Gaelic speaking population. Helen Creighton recorded Celtic traditions of rural Nova Scotia in the mid-1900s.\nThere are Black Canadians who are mostly descendants of Black Loyalists or black refugees from the War of 1812. This Maritime population is mainly among Black Nova Scotians.\nThere are Mi'kmaw nations in all Atlantic regions. There are also Wolastoqey nations along the Saint John River, also along parts of the Saint Lawrence River, and in Quebec toward Montreal. There are also Passamaquoddy nations along the Fundy Bay, along the edge of the US border, and across the border into Maine. Together these nations form the Wabanaki Confederacy.\nEconomy.\nPresent status.\nGiven the small population of the region (compared with the Central Canadian provinces or the New England states), the regional economy is a net exporter of natural resources, manufactured goods, and services. The regional economy has long been tied to natural resources such as fishing, logging, farming, and mining activities. Significant industrialization in the second half of the 19th century brought steel to Trenton, Nova Scotia, and subsequent creation of a widespread industrial base to take advantage of the region's large underground coal deposits. After Confederation, however, this industrial base withered with technological change, and trading links to Europe and the U.S. were reduced in favour of those with Ontario and Quebec. In recent years, however, the Maritime regional economy has begun increased contributions from manufacturing again and the steady transition to a service economy.\nHistorical.\nGrowth.\nWhile the economic underperformance of the Maritime economy has been long lasting, it has not always been present. The mid-19th century, especially the 1850s and 1860s, has long been seen as a \"Golden Age\" in the Maritimes. Growth was strong, and the region had one of British North America's most extensive manufacturing sectors as well as a large international shipping industry. The question of why the Maritimes fell from being a centre of Canadian manufacturing to being an economic hinterland is thus a central one to the study of the region's pecuniary difficulties. The period in which the decline occurred had a great many potential culprits. In 1867 Nova Scotia and New Brunswick merged with the Canadas in Confederation, with Prince Edward Island joining them six years later in 1873. Canada was formed only a year after free trade with the United States (in the form of the Reciprocity Treaty) had ended. In the 1870s John A. Macdonald's National Policy was implemented, creating a system of protective tariffs around the new nation. Throughout the period there was also significant technological change both in the production and transportation of goods.\nReputed Golden Age.\nSeveral scholars have explored the so-called \"Golden Age\" of the Maritimes in the years just before Confederation. In Nova Scotia, the population grew steadily from 277,000 in 1851 to 388,000 in 1871, mostly from natural increase since immigration was slight. The era has been called a Golden Age, but that was a myth created in the 1930s to lure tourists to a romantic era of tall ships and antiques. Recent historians using census data have shown that is a fallacy. In 1851\u20131871 there was an overall increase in per capita wealth holding. However most of the gains went to the urban elite class, especially businessmen and financiers living in Halifax. The wealth held by the top 10% rose considerably over the two decades, but there was little improvement in the wealth levels in rural areas, which comprised the great majority of the population. Likewise Gwyn reports that gentlemen, merchants, bankers, colliery owners, shipowners, shipbuilders, and master mariners flourished. However the great majority of families were headed by farmers, fishermen, craftsmen and labourers. Most of them\u2014and many widows as well\u2014lived in poverty. Out migration became an increasingly necessary option. Thus the era was indeed a golden age but only for a small but powerful and highly visible elite.\nEconomic decline.\nThe cause of economic malaise in the Maritimes is an issue of great debate and controversy among historians, economists, and geographers. The differing opinions can approximately be divided into the \"structuralists\", who argue that poor policy decisions are to blame, and the others, who argue that unavoidable technological and geographical factors caused the decline.\nThe exact date that the Maritimes began to fall behind the rest of Canada is difficult to determine. Historian Kris Inwood places the date very early, at least in Nova Scotia, finding clear signs that the Maritimes \"Golden Age\" of the mid-19th century was over by 1870, before Confederation or the National Policy could have had any significant impact. Richard Caves places the date closer to 1885. T.W. Acheson takes a similar view and provides considerable evidence that the early 1880s were in fact a booming period in Nova Scotia and this growth was only undermined towards the end of that decade. David Alexander argues that any earlier declines were simply part of the global Long Depression, and that the Maritimes first fell behind the rest of Canada when the great boom period of the early 20th century had little effect on the region. E.R. Forbes, however, emphasizes that the precipitous decline did not occur until after the First World War during the 1920s when new railway policies were implemented. Forbes also contends that significant Canadian defence spending during the Second World War favoured powerful political interests in Central Canada such as C. D. Howe, when major Maritime shipyards and factories, as well as Canada's largest steel mill, located in Cape Breton Island, fared poorly.\nOne of the most important changes, and one that almost certainly had an effect, was the revolution in transportation that occurred at this time. The Maritimes were connected to central Canada by the Intercolonial Railway in the 1870s, removing a longstanding barrier to trade. For the first time this placed the Maritime manufacturers in direct competition with those of Central Canada. Maritime trading patterns shifted considerably from mainly trading with New England, Britain, and the Caribbean, to being focused on commerce with the Canadian interior, enforced by the federal government's tariff policies.\nCoincident with the construction of railways in the region, the age of the wooden sailing ship began to come to an end, being replaced by larger and faster steel steamships. The Maritimes had long been a centre for shipbuilding, and this industry was hurt by the change. The larger ships were also less likely to call on the smaller population centres such as Saint John and Halifax, preferring to travel to cities like New York and Montreal. Even the Cunard Line, founded by Maritime-born Samuel Cunard, stopped making more than a single ceremonial voyage to Halifax each year.\nMore controversial than the role of technology is the argument over the role of politics in the origins of the region's decline. Confederation and the tariff and railway freight policies that followed have often been blamed for having a deleterious effect on the Maritime economies. Arguments have been made that the Maritimes' poverty was caused by control over policy by Central Canada which used the national structures for its own enrichment. This was the central view of the Maritime Rights Movement of the 1920s, which advocated greater local control over the region's finances. T.W. Acheson is one of the main proponents of this theory. He notes the growth that was occurring during the early years of the National Policy in Nova Scotia demonstrates how the effects of railway fares and the tariff structure helped undermine this growth. Capitalists from Central Canada purchased the factories and industries of the Maritimes from their bankrupt local owners and proceeded to close down many of them, consolidating the industry in Central Canada.\nThe policies in the early years of Confederation were designed by Central Canadian interests, and they reflected the needs of that region. The unified Canadian market and the introduction of railroads created a relative weakness in the Maritime economies. Central to this concept, according to Acheson, was the lack of metropolises in the Maritimes.\nMontreal and Toronto were well-suited to benefit from the development of large-scale manufacturing and extensive railway systems in Quebec and Ontario, these being the goals of the Macdonald and Laurier governments. In the Maritimes the situation was very different. Today New Brunswick has several mid-sized centres in Saint John, Moncton, and Fredericton but no significant population centre. Nova Scotia has a growing metropolitan area surrounding Halifax, but a contracting population in industrial Cape Breton County, and several smaller centres in Bridgewater, Kentville, Yarmouth, and Pictou County. Prince Edward Island's only significant population centres are in Charlottetown and Summerside. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, just the opposite was the case with little to no population concentration in major industrial centres as the predominantly rural resource-dependent Maritime economy continued on the same path as it had since European settlement on the region's shores.\nDespite the region's absence of economic growth on the same scale as other parts of the nation, the Maritimes has changed markedly throughout the 20th century, partly as a result of global and national economic trends, and partly as a result of government intervention. Each sub-region within the Maritimes has developed over time to exploit different resources and expertise. Saint John became a centre of the timber trade and shipbuilding and is currently a centre for oil refining and some manufacturing. The northern New Brunswick communities of Edmundston, Campbellton, Dalhousie, Bathurst, and Miramichi are focused on the pulp and paper industry and some mining activity. Moncton was a centre for railways and has changed its focus to becoming a multi-modal transportation centre with associated manufacturing and retail interests. The Halifax metropolitan area has come to dominate peninsular Nova Scotia as a retail and service centre, but that province's industries were spread out from the coal and steel industries of industrial Cape Breton and Pictou counties, the mixed farming of the North Shore and Annapolis Valley, and the fishing industry was primarily focused on the South Shore and Eastern Shore. Prince Edward Island is largely dominated by farming, fishing, and tourism.\nGiven the geographic diversity of the various sub-regions within the Maritimes, policies to centralize the population and economy were not initially successful, thus Maritime factories closed while those in Ontario and Quebec prospered.\nThe traditional staples thesis, advocated by scholars such as S.A. Saunders, looks at the resource endowments of the Maritimes and argues that it was the decline of the traditional industries of shipbuilding and fishing that led to Maritime poverty, since these processes were rooted in geography, and thus all but inevitable. Kris Inwood has revived the staples approach and looks at a number of geographic weaknesses relative to Central Canada. He repeats Acheson's argument that the region lacks major urban centres, but adds that the Maritimes were also lacking the great rivers that led to the cheap and abundant hydro-electric power, key to Quebec and Ontario's urban and manufacturing development, that the extraction costs of Maritime resources were higher (particularly in the case of Cape Breton coal), and that the soils of the region were poorer and thus the agricultural sector weaker.\nThe Maritimes are the only provinces in Canada which entered Confederation in the 19th century and have kept their original colonial boundaries. All three provinces have the smallest land base in the country and have been forced to make do with resources within. By comparison, the former colony of the Province of Canada (divided into the District of Canada East, and the District of Canada West) and the western provinces were dozens of times larger and in some cases were expanded to take in territory formerly held in British Crown grants to companies such as the Hudson's Bay Company; in particular the November 19, 1869 sale of Rupert's Land to the Government of Canada under the \"Rupert's Land Act 1868\" was facilitated in part by Maritime taxpayers. The economic riches of energy and natural resources held within this larger land base were only realized by other provinces during the 20th century.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Nestorian bishops at their synod at the Council of Ephesus declared him a heretic, labelling him as a \"monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church\".\nCyril is well known for his dispute with Nestorius and his supporter, Patriarch John of Antioch, whom Cyril excluded from the Council of Ephesus for arriving late. He is also known for his expulsion of Novatians and Jews from Alexandria and for inflaming tensions that led to the murder of the Hellenistic philosopher Hypatia by a Christian mob. Historians disagree over the extent of his responsibility in this.\nCyril tried to oblige the pious Christian emperor Theodosius II (AD 408\u2013450) to himself by dedicating his Paschal table to him. Cyril's Paschal table was provided with a Metonic basic structure in the form of a 19-year lunar cycle adopted by him around AD 425, which was very different from the first Metonic 19-year lunar cycle invented around AD 260 by Anatolius, but exactly equal to the lunar cycle which had been introduced around AD 412 by Annianus; the Julian equivalent of this Alexandrian cycle adopted by Cyril and nowadays referred to as the \"classical (Alexandrian) 19-year lunar cycle\" would emerge a century later in Rome as the basic structure of Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 Paschal table (AD 525).\nThe Catholic Church did not commemorate Saint Cyril in the Tridentine calendar: it added his feast only in 1882, assigning to it the date of 9 February. Yet the 1969 Catholic Calendar revision moved it to 27 June, considered to be the day of the saint's death, as celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The same date has been chosen for the Lutheran calendar. The Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic Churches celebrate his feast day on 9 June and also, together with Pope Athanasius I of Alexandria, on 18 January. Cyril is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 27 June.\nWestern Rite Orthodox Christians within the Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate, which is under the auspices of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, celebrate the Feast of Saint Cyril of Alexandria on 28 January, which is when his Feast Day occurs in the Roman Martyrology.\nEarly life.\nLittle is known for certain of Cyril's early life. He was born circa 376, in the town of Didouseya, Egypt, modern-day El-Mahalla El-Kubra. A few years after his birth, his maternal uncle Theophilus rose to the powerful position of Patriarch of Alexandria. His mother remained close to her brother and under his guidance, Cyril was well educated. His writings show his knowledge of Christian writers of his day, including Eusebius, Origen, Didymus the Blind, and writers of the Church of Alexandria. He received the formal Christian education standard for his day: he studied grammar from age twelve to fourteen (390\u2013392), rhetoric and humanities from fifteen to twenty (393\u2013397) and finally theology and biblical studies (398\u2013402).\nIn 403, he accompanied his uncle to attend the \"Synod of the Oak\" in Constantinople, which deposed John Chrysostom as Archbishop of Constantinople. The prior year, Theophilus had been summoned by the emperor to Constantinople to apologize before a synod, over which Chrysostom would preside, on account of several charges which were brought against him by certain Egyptian monks. Theophilus had them persecuted as Origenists. Placing himself at the head of soldiers and armed servants, Theophilus had marched against the monks, burned their dwellings, and ill-treated those whom he captured. Theophilus arrived at Constantinople with twenty-nine of his suffragan bishops, and conferring with those opposed to the Archbishop, drafted a long list of largely unfounded accusations against Chrysostom, who refused to recognize the legality of a synod in which his open enemies were judges. Chrysostom was subsequently deposed.\nPatriarch of Alexandria.\nTheophilus died on 15 October 412, and Cyril was made Pope or Patriarch of Alexandria on 18 October 412, but only after a riot between his supporters and those of his rival Archdeacon Timotheus. According to Socrates Scholasticus, the Alexandrians were always rioting.\nThus, Cyril followed his uncle in a position that had become powerful and influential, rivalling that of the prefect in a time of turmoil and frequently violent conflict between the cosmopolitan city's pagan, Jewish, and Christian inhabitants. He began to exert his authority by causing the churches of the Novatianists to be closed and their sacred vessels to be seized.\nControversies.\nDispute with the Prefect.\nOrestes, \"Praefectus augustalis\" of the Diocese of Egypt, steadfastly resisted Cyril's ecclesiastical encroachment upon secular prerogatives.\nTension between the parties increased when in 415, Orestes published an edict that outlined new regulations regarding mime shows and dancing exhibitions in the city, which attracted large crowds and were commonly prone to civil disorder of varying degrees. Crowds gathered to read the edict shortly after it was posted in the city's theater. Cyril sent the \"grammaticus\" Hierax to discover the content of the edict. The edict angered Christians as well as Jews. At one such gathering, Hierax read the edict and applauded the new regulations, prompting a disturbance. Many people felt that Hierax was attempting to incite the crowd\u2014particularly the Jews\u2014into sedition. Orestes had Hierax tortured in public in a theatre. This order had two aims: one to quell the riot, the other to mark Orestes' authority over Cyril.\nSocrates Scholasticus recounts that upon hearing of Hierax's severe and public punishment, Cyril threatened to retaliate against the Jews of Alexandria with \"the utmost severities\" if the harassment of Christians did not cease immediately. In response to Cyril's threat, the Jews of Alexandria grew even more furious, eventually resorting to violence against the Christians. They plotted to flush the Christians out at night by running through the streets claiming that the Church of Alexander was on fire. When Christians responded to what they were led to believe was the burning down of their church, \"the Jews immediately fell upon and slew them\" by using rings to recognize one another in the dark and killing everyone else in sight. When the morning came, Cyril, along with many of his followers, took to the city's synagogues in search of the perpetrators of the massacre.\nAccording to Socrates, after Cyril rounded up all the Jews in Alexandria he ordered them to be stripped of all possessions, banished them from Alexandria, and allowed their goods to be pillaged by the remaining citizens of Alexandria. Scholasticus alleges that all the Jews of Alexandria were banished, while John of Niki\u00fb says it was only those involved in the ambush and massacre. Susan Wessel says that, while it is not clear whether Scholasticus was a Novationist (whose churches Cyril had closed), he was apparently sympathetic towards them, and repeatedly accuses Cyril of abusing his episcopal power by infringing on the rights and duties of the secular authorities. Wessel says, however, \"...Socrates probably does not provide accurate and unambiguous information about Cyril's relationship to imperial authority\".\nNonetheless, with Cyril's banishment of the Jews, however many, \"Orestes [...] was filled with great indignation at these transactions, and was excessively grieved that a city of such magnitude should have been suddenly bereft of so large a portion of its population.\" Because of this, the feud between Cyril and Orestes intensified, and both men wrote to the emperor regarding the situation. Eventually, Cyril attempted to reach out to Orestes through several peace overtures, including attempted mediation and, when that failed, showed him the Gospels, which he interpreted to indicate that the religious authority of Cyril would require Orestes' acquiescence in the bishop's policy. Nevertheless, Orestes remained unmoved by such gestures.\nThis refusal almost cost Orestes his life. Nitrian monks came from the desert and instigated a riot against Orestes among the population of Alexandria. These monks had resorted to violence 15 years before, during a controversy between Theophilus (Cyril's uncle) and the \"Tall Brothers\"; the monks assaulted Orestes and accused him of being a pagan. Orestes rejected the accusations, showing that he had been baptised by the Archbishop of Constantinople. A monk named Ammonius threw a stone hitting Orestes in the head. The prefect had Ammonius tortured to death, whereupon the Patriarch allegedly honored him as a martyr. However, at least according to Scholasticus, the Christian community displayed a general lack of enthusiasm for Ammonius's case for martyrdom. The prefect then wrote to the emperor Theodosius II, as did Cyril.\nMurder of Hypatia.\nThe Prefect Orestes enjoyed the political backing of Hypatia, an astronomer, philosopher and mathematician who had considerable moral authority in the city of Alexandria, and who had extensive influence. Indeed, many students from wealthy and influential families came to Alexandria purposely to study privately with Hypatia, and many of these later attained high posts in government and the Church. Several Christians thought that Hypatia's influence had caused Orestes to reject all conciliatory offerings by Cyril. Modern historians think that Orestes had cultivated his relationship with Hypatia to strengthen a bond with the pagan community of Alexandria, as he had done with the Jewish one, in order to better manage the tumultuous political life of the Egyptian capital.\nAccording to Socrates Scholasticus during the Christian season of Lent in March 415, a mob of Christians under the leadership of a lector named Peter, raided Hypatia's carriage as she was travelling home. They dragged her into a building known as the \"Kaisarion\", a former pagan temple and center of the Roman imperial cult in Alexandria that had been converted into a Christian church. There, the mob stripped Hypatia naked and murdered her using \"ostraka\", which can either be translated as \"roof tiles\" or \"oyster shells\". Later historian John of Niki\u00fb also tells a similar story. Even later historian Byzantinist Fr. Adrian Fortescue, says that the mob of Christian Parabalanies and Peter, cruelly tore her to pieces on the \"steps\" of a church. Damascius adds that they also cut out her eyeballs. They tore her body into pieces and dragged her limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire. According to Watts, this was in line with the traditional manner in which Alexandrians carried the bodies of the \"vilest criminals\" outside the city limits to cremate them as a way of symbolically purifying the city.\nCyril's involvement.\nAlthough Socrates Scholasticus never explicitly identifies Hypatia's murderers, they are commonly assumed to have been members of the \"parabalani\". Christopher Haas disputes this identification, arguing that the murderers were more likely \"a crowd of Alexandrian laymen\". Socrates Scholasticus unequivocally condemns the actions of the mob, declaring, \"Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort.\"\nNeoplatonist historian Damascius (c.\u00a0458 \u2013 c.\u00a0538) was \"anxious to exploit the scandal of Hypatia's death\", and attributed responsibility for her murder to Bishop Cyril and his Christian followers. Damascius's account of the Christian murder of Hypatia is the sole historical source naming Bishop Cyril. Some modern studies, as well as the 2009 Hypatia biopic \"Agora\" represent Hypatia as falling casualty to a conflict between two Christian factions, one peaceful and moderate and led by Orestes, with the support of Hypatia, and fundamentalist faction enforced by Parabalani and led by Patriarch Cyril. According to lexicographer William Smith, \"She was accused of too much familiarity with Orestes, prefect of Alexandria, and the charge spread among the clergy, who took up the notion that she interrupted the friendship of Orestes with their archbishop, Cyril.\" Scholasticus, alleges that Hypatia fell \"victim to the political jealousy which at the time prevailed\" and that news of Hypatia's murder, \"brought no small disgrace\", not only to Patriarch Cyril but to the whole Christian Church in Alexandria, \"for murder and slaughter and all such things are altogether opposed to the Christian religion.\"\nAfter the murder, a deputation of citizens went to Constantinople to petition the Emperor for an investigation so as to prevent such horrors in the future and to put down the disorderly Parabalani, however they urged for the Patriarch to be allowed to remain in the city (Orestes wanted him banished). One could deduce from this that there were some who didn't think Cyril responsible for this or that even his own followers thought he went too far. However, according to Damascius, Cyril himself allegedly only managed to escape even more serious punishment by bribing one of Theodosius's officials. Indeed, the investigation resulted in the emperors Honorius and Theodosius II issuing an edict in autumn of 416, which attempted to remove the \"parabalani\" from Cyril's power and instead place them under the authority of Orestes. The edict restricted the parabalani from attending \"any public spectacle whatever\" or entering \"the meeting place of a municipal council or a courtroom.\" It also severely restricted their recruitment by limiting the total number of parabalani to no more than five hundred.\nConflict with Nestorius.\nAnother major conflict was between the Alexandrian and Antiochian schools of ecclesiastical reflection, piety, and discourse. This long running conflict widened with the third canon of the First Council of Constantinople which granted the see of Constantinople primacy over the older sees of Alexandria and Antioch. Thus, the struggle between the sees of Alexandria and Antioch now included Constantinople. The conflict came to a head in 428 after Nestorius, who originated in Antioch, was made Archbishop of Constantinople.\nCyril gained an opportunity to restore Alexandria's pre-eminence over both Antioch and Constantinople when an Antiochine priest who was in Constantinople at Nestorius' behest began to preach against calling Mary the \"Mother of God\" (\"Theotokos\"). As the term \"Mother of God\" had long been attached to Mary, the laity in Constantinople complained against the priest. Rather than repudiating the priest, Nestorius intervened on his behalf. Nestorius argued that Mary was neither a \"Mother of Man\" nor \"Mother of God\" as these referred to Christ's two natures; rather, Mary was the \"Mother of Christ\" (Greek: \"Christotokos\"). Christ, according to Nestorius, was the conjunction of the Godhead with his \"temple\" (which Nestorius was fond of calling his human nature). The controversy seemed to be centered on the issue of the suffering of Christ. Cyril maintained that the Son of God or the divine Word, truly suffered \"in the flesh.\" However, Nestorius claimed that the Son of God was altogether incapable of suffering, even within his union with the flesh. Eusebius of Dorylaeum went so far as to accuse Nestorius of adoptionism. By this time, news of the controversy in the capital had reached Alexandria. At Easter 429 A.D., Cyril wrote a letter to the Egyptian monks warning them of Nestorius's views. A copy of this letter reached Constantinople where Nestorius preached a sermon against it. This began a series of letters between Cyril and Nestorius which gradually became more strident in tone. Finally, Emperor Theodosius II convoked the Council of Ephesus (in 431) to solve the dispute. Cyril selected Ephesus as the venue since it supported the veneration of Mary. The council was convoked before Nestorius's supporters from Antioch and Syria had arrived and thus Nestorius refused to attend when summoned. Predictably, the Council ordered the deposition and exile of Nestorius for heresy.\nHowever, when John of Antioch and the other pro-Nestorius bishops finally reached Ephesus, they assembled their own Council, condemned Cyril for heresy, deposed him from his see, and labelled him as a \"monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church\". Theodosius, by now old enough to hold power by himself, annulled the verdict of the Council and arrested Cyril, but Cyril eventually escaped. Having fled to Egypt, Cyril bribed Theodosius's courtiers, and sent a mob led by Dalmatius, a hermit, to besiege Theodosius's palace, and shout abuse; the emperor eventually gave in, sending Nestorius into minor exile (Upper Egypt).\nCyril died about 444, but the controversies were to continue for decades, from the \"Robber Synod\" of Ephesus (449) to the Council of Chalcedon (451) and beyond.\nTheology.\nCyril regarded the embodiment of God in the person of Jesus Christ to be so mystically powerful that it spread out from the body of the God-man into the rest of the race, to reconstitute human nature into a graced and deified condition of the saints, one that promised immortality and transfiguration to believers. Nestorius, on the other hand, saw the incarnation as primarily a moral and ethical example to the faithful, to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Cyril's constant stress was on the simple idea that it was God who walked the streets of Nazareth (hence Mary was \"Theotokos\", meaning \"God bearer\", which became in Latin \"Mater Dei\" or \"Dei Genitrix\", or Mother of God), and God who had appeared in a transfigured humanity. Nestorius spoke of the distinct \"Jesus the man\" and \"the divine Logos\" in ways that Cyril thought were too dichotomous, widening the ontological gap between man and God in a way that some of his contemporaries believed would annihilate the person of Christ.\nThe main issue that prompted this dispute between Cyril and Nestorius was the question which arose at the Council of Constantinople: What exactly was the being to which Mary gave birth? Cyril affirmed that the Holy Trinity consists of a singular divine nature, essence, and being (\"ousia\") in three distinct aspects, instantiations, or subsistencies of being (\"hypostases\"). These distinct hypostases are the Father, the Son or Word (\"Logos\"), and the Holy Spirit. His christology is a topic of debate. He taught of \"\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\", meaning \"one physis of the Word of God made flesh\". This resulted in the miaphysite slogan \"One Nature united out of two\" being used to encapsulate the theological position of this Alexandrian bishop.\nAccording to Cyril's theology, there were two states for the Son of God: the state that existed \"prior\" to the Son (or Word/Logos) becoming enfleshed in the person of Jesus and the state that actually became enfleshed. The Logos Incarnate suffered and died on the Cross, and therefore the Son was able to suffer without suffering. Cyril passionately argued for the continuity of a single subject, God the Word, from the pre-Incarnate state to the Incarnate state. The divine Logos was really present in the flesh and in the world\u2014not merely bestowed upon, semantically affixed to, or morally associated with the man Jesus, as the adoptionists and, he believed, Nestorius had taught.\nMariology.\nCyril of Alexandria became noted in Church history because of his spirited fight for the title \"Theotokos\" during the First Council of Ephesus (431), establishing the ecclesiastically settled basis for all subsequent mariological developments. Prior to the controversy over the theology of Nestorius, Cyril rarely if ever used the Mariological title, but theo-political circumstances compelled him as Archbishop of one of the Empire's chief sees, to become involved and develop his theology.\"\nBeginning in 429 Cyril wrote a series of letters to various ecclesiastical authorities in which he espoused the orthodoxy of \"Theotokos\". The propriety of the term was justified through appeals to earlier theologians who had used it, like Athanasius, the Cappadocians, and Atticus. Following an epistolary exchange with the increasingly unpopular archbishop of Constantinople, in 430 Cyril wrote his famous 12 Anathemas in which anyone who refused to call Mary Theotokos was condemned. The following year over 100 bishops met in council at Ephesus to rule on the disputes. In between sessions at the Council Cyril delivered a number of sermons; some of those attributed to his hand are of disputed authorship, but 6 are recognised as genuine. Homily IV delivered upon the late arrival of western delegates is a particularly striking example of Cyril's developed Mariology. It is the foremost expression of Cyril's devotion to Mary, and is one of the first historical attestations of the salutation \u03a7\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c1\u03b5 (\"Hail\") being used to invoke the Virgin, a practice later standardised in Byzantine homiletics and hymnography such as the sermons of Chrysippus and Basil of Selecucia, and the Akathist hymn. Mary, who is credited with calling the council fathers together, embodies for Cyril the paradoxes of orthodox Christology, \"container of the uncontained\" and \"the place for the infinite\", among other lauded descriptions. Cyril's notions of the identity of Christ, therefore, have direct bearing on the identity of Mary. Wessell explains how \"Cyril's spatial metaphors construed Mary as a sacred place\" and how he \"applied metaphors depicting royalty and exaltation to Mary: she was the treasure of the world, the crown of virginity, and the sceptre of orthodoxy.\" Subsequently, such praise would become normative in Marian theology.\nIn several of his works, Cyril focuses on the love of Jesus for his mother. On the Cross, he overcomes his pain and thinks of his mother. At the wedding in Cana, he bows to her wishes. The conflict with Nestorius was mainly over this issue, and some have argued that it has often been misunderstood. \"[T]he debate was not so much about Mary as about Jesus. The question was not what honors were due to Mary, but how one was to speak of the birth of Jesus.\" Wessell notes that in Homily V delivered at the council, Cyril argued that Nestorius' refusal to acknowledge God's incarnate birth from Mary was a blasphemy against Christ. At the same time, the close relationship between Christological and Mariological formulations going back to the Cappadocian Fathers created a climate wherein intellectual argumentation over disputed theology overlapped with blossoming lay piety. When the Council of Ephesus convened under Cyril's presidency it did so in the newly constructed Church of Mary, a venue that contributed to the devotional matrix of the debates. Whereas in the past scholars have often argued that Marian piety and theology only developed in the wake of the conciliar decrees, Shoemaker considers this to be refuted by the picture emerging from liturgical and archaeological evidence. The substance of Cyril's arumentation was Christological in orientation. His mature Mariology was chiefly in service to this, and to the end of discrediting Nestorius. Yet Wessel, quoting Homily IV, notes that the enthusiastic praises go beyond the strictly Christological. \"She was not only valuable as a vessel storing something sacred but was herself precious and venerated: \u2018Is it even possible for people to speak of the celebrated Mary? The virginal womb; O thing of wonder! The marvel strikes me with awe!\u2019\" Such sentiments served to further distinguish what Cyril believed to be orthodox theology from that which Nestorius taught, characterising the latter as subversive to both church and empire. As \"scepter of orthodoxy\", Mary became the standard of Christological fidelity in Cyril's theology; Nestorius's denial of \"Theotokos\" became the identifiable sign of his impugning of the divinity of Jesus.\nSt. Cyril received an important recognition of his preachings by the Second Council of Constantinople (553 d.C.) which declared;\n\"St. Cyril who announced the right faith of Christians\" (Anathematism XIV, Denzinger et Schoenmetzer 437).\nWorks.\nCyril was a scholarly archbishop and a prolific writer. In the early years of his active life in the Church he wrote several exegetical documents. Among these were: \"Commentaries on the Old Testament\", \"Thesaurus\", \"Discourse Against Arians\", \"Commentary on St. John's Gospel\", and \"Dialogues on the Trinity\". In 429 as the Christological controversies increased, the output of his writings was so extensive that his opponents could not match it. His writings and his theology have remained central to the tradition of the Fathers and to all Orthodox to this day.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
