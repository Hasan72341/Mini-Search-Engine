{"id": "4060", "revid": "41906662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4060", "title": "Baldr", "text": "Norse deity\nBaldr (Old Norse also Balder, Baldur) is a god in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, he is a son of the god Odin and the goddess Frigg, and has numerous brothers, such as Thor and V\u00e1li. In wider Germanic mythology, the god was known in Old English as ', and in Old High German as ', all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym ('hero' or 'prince').\nDuring the 12th century, Danish accounts by Saxo Grammaticus and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a euhemerized account of his story. Compiled in Iceland during the 13th century, but based on older Old Norse poetry, the \"Poetic Edda\" and the \"Prose Edda\" contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the \u00c6sir and a harbinger of Ragnar\u00f6k.\nAccording to \"Gylfaginning\", a book of Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda, Baldr's wife is Nanna and their son is Forseti. Baldr had the greatest ship ever built, \"Hringhorni\", and there is no place more beautiful than his hall, Breidablik.\nName.\nThe Old Norse theonym \"Baldr\" ('brave, defiant'; also 'lord, prince') and its various Germanic cognates \u2013 including Old English \"B\u00e6ld\u00e6g\" and Old High German \"Balder\" (or \"Palter\") \u2013 probably stems from Proto-Germanic \"*Bal\u00f0raz\" ('Hero, Prince'; cf. Old Norse \"mann-baldr\" 'great man', Old English \"bealdor\" 'prince, hero'), itself a derivative of \"*bal\u00feaz\", meaning 'brave' (cf. Old Norse \"ballr\" 'hard, stubborn', Gothic \"bal\u00fea*\" 'bold, frank', Old English \"beald\" 'bold, brave, confident', Old Saxon \"bald\" 'valiant, bold', Old High German \"bald\" 'brave, courageous').\nThis etymology was originally proposed by Jacob Grimm (1835), who also speculated on a comparison with the Lithuanian \"b\u00e1ltas\" ('white', also the name of a light-god) based on the semantic development from 'white' to 'shining' then 'strong'. According to linguist Vladimir Orel, this could be linguistically tenable. Philologist Rudolf Simek also argues that the Old English \"B\u00e6ld\u00e6g\" should be interpreted as meaning 'shining day', from a Proto-Germanic root *\"b\u0113l\"- (cf. Old English \"b\u00e6l\", Old Norse \"b\u00e1l\" 'fire') attached to \"d\u00e6g\" ('day').\nOld Norse also shows the usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in \"baldur \u00ee brynju\" (S\u00e6m. 272b) and \"herbaldr\" (S\u00e6m. 218b), in general epithets of heroes. In continental Saxon and Anglo-Saxon tradition, the son of Woden is called not \"Bealdor\" but \"Baldag\" (Saxon) and \"B\u00e6ld\u00e6g, Beldeg\" (Anglo-Saxon), which shows association with \"day\", possibly with Day personified as a deity. This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning \"shining one, white one, a god\" derived from the meaning of Baltic \"baltas\", further adducing Slavic \"Belobog\" and German \"Berhta\".\nAttestations.\nMerseburg Incantation.\nOne of the two Merseburg Incantations names \"Balder\" (in the genitive singular \"Balderes\"), but also mentions a figure named \"Phol\", considered to be a byname for Baldr (as in Scandinavian \"Falr\", \"Fjalarr\"; (in Saxo) \"Balderus\" : \"Fjallerus\"). The incantation relates of \"Phol ende Wotan\" riding to the woods, where the foot of Baldr's foal is sprained. Sinthgunt (the sister of the sun), Frigg and Odin sing to the foot in order for it to heal. The identification with Balder is not conclusive. Modern scholarship suggests that the god Freyr might be meant.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nUnlike the Prose Edda, in the Poetic Edda the tale of Baldr's death is referred to rather than recounted at length. Baldr is mentioned in \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", in \"Lokasenna\", and is the subject of the Eddic poem \"Baldr's Dreams\".\nAmong the visions which the V\u00f6lva sees and describes in V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 is Baldr's death. In stanza 32, the V\u00f6lva says she saw the fate of Baldr \"the bleeding god\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the next two stanzas, the V\u00f6lva refers to Baldr's killing, describes the birth of V\u00e1li for the slaying of H\u00f6\u00f0r and the weeping of Frigg:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;so slender and fair\nCame a harmful shaft\nIn stanza 62 of V\u00f6lusp\u00e1, looking far into the future, the V\u00f6lva says that H\u00f6\u00f0r and Baldr will come back, with the union, according to Bellows, being a symbol of the new age of peace:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;bear ripened fruit,\nAll ills grow better,\nBaldr is mentioned in two stanzas of Lokasenna, a poem which describes a flyting between the gods and the god Loki. In the first of the two stanzas, Frigg, Baldr's mother, tells Loki that if she had a son like Baldr, Loki would be killed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the next stanza, Loki responds to Frigg, and says that he is the reason Baldr \"will never ride home again\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Eddic poem \"Baldr's Dreams\" opens with the gods holding a council discussing why Baldr had had bad dreams:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;together met,\nAnd the goddesses came\nOdin then rides to Hel to a V\u00f6lva's grave and awakens her using magic. The V\u00f6lva asks Odin, who she does not recognize, who he is, and Odin answers that he is Vegtam (\"Wanderer\"). Odin asks the V\u00f6lva for whom are the benches covered in rings and the floor covered in gold. The V\u00f6lva tells him that in their location mead is brewed for Baldr, and that she spoke unwillingly, so she will speak no more:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the mead is brewed,\nThe shining drink,\nOdin asks the V\u00f6lva to not be silent and asks her who will kill Baldr. The V\u00f6lva replies and says that H\u00f6\u00f0r will kill Baldr, and again says that she spoke unwillingly, and that she will speak no more:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the far-famed branch,\nHe shall the bane\nOdin again asks the V\u00f6lva to not be silent and asks her who will avenge Baldr's death. The V\u00f6lva replies that V\u00e1li will, when he will be one night old. Once again, she says that she will speak no more:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in Vestrsalir,\nAnd one night old\nOdin again asks the V\u00f6lva to not be silent and says that he seeks to know who the women that will then weep be. The V\u00f6lva realizes that Vegtam is Odin in disguise. Odin says that the V\u00f6lva is not a V\u00f6lva, and that she is the mother of three giants. The V\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride back home proud, because she will speak to no more men until Loki escapes his bounds.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nIn \"Gylfaginning\", Baldr is described as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014\"Brodeur's translation\"\nApart from this description, Baldr is known primarily for the story of his death, which is seen as the first in a chain of events that will ultimately lead to the destruction of the gods at Ragnar\u00f6k.\nBaldr had a dream of his own death and his mother, Frigg, had the same dream. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this depressed him, and so Frigg made every object on earth vow never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow, save for the mistletoe\u2014a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.\nWhen Loki, the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god H\u00f6\u00f0r, who then inadvertently killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the \"\u00e1synja\" Rindr gave birth to V\u00e1li, who grew to adulthood within a day and slew H\u00f6\u00f0r.\nBaldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship Hringhorni, the largest of all ships. On the pyre he was given the magical ring Draupnir. At first the gods were not able to push the ship out onto sea, and so they sent for Hyrrokin, a giantess, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.\nAs he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered something in his ear. The import of this speech was held to be unknowable, and the question of what was said was thus used as an unanswerable riddle by Odin in other sources, namely against the giant Vafthrudnir in the Eddic poem \"Vafthrudnismal\" and in the riddles of Gestumblindi in \"Hervarar saga\".\nUpon seeing the corpse being carried to the ship, Nanna, his wife, died of grief. She was then placed on the funeral fire (perhaps a toned-down instance of Sati, also attested in the Arab traveller Ibn Fadlan's account of a funeral among the Rus'), after which it was set on fire. Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also laid on the pyre.\nAs the pyre was set on fire, Thor blessed it with his hammer Mj\u01ebllnir. As he did a small dwarf named Litr came running before his feet. Thor then kicked him into the pyre.\nUpon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger Hermod, Hel promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. All did, except a giantess, \u00de\u00f6kk (often presumed to be the god Loki in disguise), who refused to mourn the slain god. Thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnar\u00f6k, when he and his brother H\u00f6\u00f0r would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.\nBesides these descriptions of Baldr, the Prose Edda also explicitly links him to the Anglo-Saxon \"Beldeg\" in its prologue.\n\"Gesta Danorum\".\nWriting during the end of the 12th century, the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus tells the story of Baldr (recorded as \"Balderus\") in a form that professes to be historical. According to him, Balderus and H\u00f8therus were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of Norway. Balderus was a demigod and common steel could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the other gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and H\u00f8therus married the princess.\nNevertheless, Balderus took heart of grace and again met H\u00f8therus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. H\u00f8therus dealt him a deadly wound with a magic sword which he had received from Mimir, the satyr of the woods; after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.\nUtrecht Inscription.\nA Latin votive inscription from Utrecht, from the 3rd or 4th century C.E., has been theorized as containing the dative form \"Baldruo\", pointing to a Latin nominative singular *\"Baldruus\", which some have identified with the Norse/Germanic god, although both the reading and this interpretation have been questioned.\n\"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\".\nIn the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Baldr is named as the ancestor of the monarchy of Kent, Bernicia, Deira, and Wessex through his supposed son Brond.\nToponyms.\nThere are a few old place names in Scandinavia that contain the name \"Baldr\". The most certain and notable one is the (former) parish name Balleshol in Hedmark county, Norway: \"a Balldrshole\" 1356 (where the last element is \"h\u00f3ll\" m \"mound; small hill\"). Others may be (in Norse forms) \"Baldrsberg\" in Vestfold county, \"Baldrsheimr\" in Hordaland county \"Baldrsnes\" in S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag county\u2014and (very uncertain) the Balsfjorden fjord and Balsfjord Municipality in Troms county.\nIn Copenhagen, there is also a Baldersgade, or \"Balder's Street\". A street in downtown Reykjav\u00edk is called Baldursgata (Baldur's Street).\nIn Sweden there is a Baldersgatan (Balder's Street) in Stockholm. There is also Baldersn\u00e4s (Balder's isthmus), Baldersvik (Balder's bay), Balders udde (Balder's headland) and Baldersberg (Balder's mountain) at various places.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has been derived from Old Norse \"br\u00edsingr\", a poetic term for \"fire\" or \"amber\" mentioned in the anonymous versified word-lists (\"\u00feulur\") appended to many manuscripts of the Prose Edda, making Br\u00edsingamen \"gleaming torc\", \"sunny torc\", or the like. However, \"Br\u00edsingr\" can also be an ethnonym, in which case \"Br\u00edsinga men\" is \"torc of the Br\u00edsings\"; the Old English parallel in \"Beowulf\" supports this derivation, though who the Br\u00edsings (Old Norse \"Br\u00edsingar\") may have been remains unknown.\nAttestations.\n\"Beowulf\".\nBr\u00edsingamen is referred to in the Anglo-Saxon epic \"Beowulf\" as \"Brosinga mene\". The brief mention in \"Beowulf\" is as follows (trans. by Howell Chickering, 1977):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe \"Beowulf\" poet is clearly referring to the legends about Theoderic the Great. The \"\u00dei\u00f0rekssaga\" tells that the warrior Heime (\"H\u00e1ma\" in Old English) takes sides against Ermanaric (\"Eormanric\"), king of the Goths, and has to flee his kingdom after robbing him; later in life, Hama enters a monastery and gives them all his stolen treasure. However, this saga makes no mention of the great necklace.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the poem \"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\" of the \"Poetic Edda\", \u00derymr, the king of the j\u01ebtnar, steals Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6lnir. Freyja lends Loki her falcon cloak to search for it; but upon returning, Loki tells Freyja that \u00derymr has hidden the hammer and demanded to marry her in return. Freyja is so wrathful that all the \u00c6sir\u2019s halls beneath her are shaken and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen breaks off from her neck. Later, Thor borrows Br\u00edsingamen when he dresses up as Freyja to go to the wedding at J\u01ebtunheimr.\n\"Prose Edda\".\n\"H\u00fasdr\u00e1pa\", a skaldic poem partially preserved in the \"Prose Edda\", relates the story of the theft of Br\u00edsingamen by Loki. One day when Freyja wakes up and finds Br\u00edsingamen missing, she enlists the help of Heimdallr to help her search for it. Eventually they find the thief, who turns out to be Loki and who has transformed himself into a seal. Heimdallr turns into a seal as well and fights Loki (trans. Byock 2005):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...it was on this occasion that [Heimdall] and Loki came to blows over the ring of the Brisings. The skald Ulf Uggason devotes a lengthy passage to that story in his poem \"Husdrapa\", and it is stated there that Heimdall and Loki took on the shape of seals.\nAfter a lengthy battle at Singasteinn, Heimdallr wins and returns Br\u00edsingamen to Freyja.\nSnorri Sturluson quoted this old poem in \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", saying that because of this legend Heimdallr is called \"Seeker of Freyja's Necklace\" (\"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", section 8) and Loki is called \"Thief of Br\u00edsingamen\" (\"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", section 16). A similar story appears in the later \"S\u00f6rla \u00fe\u00e1ttr\", where Heimdallr does not appear.\n\"S\u00f6rla \u00fe\u00e1ttr\".\nS\u00f6rla \u00fe\u00e1ttr is a short story in the later and extended version of the \"Saga of Olaf Tryggvason\" in the manuscript of the \"Flateyjarb\u00f3k\", which was written and compiled by two Christian priests, Jon Thordson and Magnus Thorhalson, in the late 14th century. In the end of the story, the arrival of Christianity dissolves the old curse that traditionally was to endure until Ragnar\u00f6k.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Freyja was a human in Asia and was the favorite concubine of Odin, King of Asialand. When this woman wanted to buy a golden necklace (no name given) forged by four dwarves (named Dvalinn, Alfrik, Berlingr, and Grer), she offered them gold and silver but they replied that they would only sell it to her if she would lie a night by each of them. She came home afterward with the necklace and kept silent as if nothing happened. But a man called Loki somehow knew it, and came to tell Odin. King Odin commanded Loki to steal the necklace, so Loki turned into a fly to sneak into Freyja's bower and stole it. When Freyja found her necklace missing, she came to ask king Odin. In exchange for it, Odin ordered her to make two kings, each served by twenty kings, fight forever unless some christened men so brave would dare to enter the battle and slay them. She said yes, and got that necklace back. Under the spell, king H\u00f6gni and king He\u00f0inn battled for one hundred and forty-three years, as soon as they fell down they had to stand up again and fight on. But in the end, the Christian lord Olaf Tryggvason, who has a great fate and luck, arrived with his christened men, and whoever slain by a Christian would stay dead. Thus the pagan curse was finally dissolved by the arrival of Christianity. After that, the noble man, king Olaf, went back to his realm.\nThe battle of H\u00f6gni and He\u00f0inn is recorded in several medieval sources, including the skaldic poem \"Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa\", \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" (section 49), and \"Gesta Danorum\": king H\u00f6gni's daughter, Hildr, is kidnapped by king He\u00f0inn. When H\u00f6gni comes to fight He\u00f0inn on an island, Hildr comes to offer her father a necklace on behalf of He\u00f0inn for peace; but the two kings still battle, and Hildr resurrects the fallen to make them fight until Ragnar\u00f6k. None of these earlier sources mentions Freyja or king Olaf Tryggvason, the historical figure who Christianized Norway and Iceland in the 10th Century.\nArchaeological record.\nA V\u00f6lva was buried c.\u20091000 with considerable splendour in Hagebyh\u00f6ga in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, Sweden. In addition to being buried with her wand, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant, which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as Freyja's necklace Br\u00edsingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself.\nModern influence.\nAlan Garner wrote a children's fantasy novel called \"The Weirdstone of Brisingamen\", published in 1960, about an enchanted teardrop bracelet.\nDiana Paxson's novel \"Brisingamen\" features Freyja and her necklace.\nBlack Phoenix Alchemy Lab has a perfumed oil scent named Brisingamen.\nFreyja's necklace Brisingamen features prominently in Betsy Tobin's novel \"Iceland\", where the necklace is seen to have significant protective powers.\nThe Brisingamen feature as a major item in Joel Rosenberg's Keepers of the Hidden Ways series of books. In it, there are seven jewels that were created for the necklace by the Dwarfs and given to the Norse goddess. She in turn eventually split them up into the seven separate jewels and hid them throughout the realm, as together they hold the power to shape the universe by its holder. The book's plot is about discovering one of them and deciding what to do with the power they allow while avoiding Loki and other Norse characters.\nIn Christopher Paolini's \"The Inheritance Cycle\", the word \"brisingr\" means fire. This is probably a distillation of the word \"brisinga\".\nUrsula Le Guin's short story \"Semley's Necklace\", the first part of her novel \"Rocannon's World\", is a retelling of the Brisingamen story on an alien planet.\nBrisingamen is represented as a card in the \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" Trading Card Game, \"Nordic Relic Brisingamen\".\nBrisingamen was part of MMORPG \"Ragnarok Online\" lore, which is ranked as \"God item\". The game is heavily based from Norse mythology.\nIn the \"Firefly Online\" game, one of the planets of the Himinbj\u00f6rg system (which features planets named after figures from Germanic mythology) is named Brisingamen. It is third from the star, and has moons named Freya, Beowulf, and Alberich.\nThe Brisingamen is an item that can be found and equipped in the video game, \"\".\nIn the French comics \"Freaks' Squeele\", the character of Valkyrie accesses her costume change ability by touching a decorative torc necklace affixed to her forehead, named Brizingamen.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they lie in exactly opposite directions from the center\u2014like the North and South Poles.\nThe Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem has several equivalent statements in terms of odd functions. Recall that formula_1 is the \"n\"-sphere and formula_2 is the \"n\"-ball:\nExamples.\nMore compactly: if formula_11 is continuous then there exists an formula_4 such that: formula_13.\nThe case formula_14 can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the Earth's equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously in space, which is, however, not always the case.\nThe case formula_15 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the Earth's surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures, assuming that both parameters vary continuously in space.\nHistory.\nAccording to , the first historical mention of the statement of the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem appears in . The first proof was given by Karol Borsuk\u00a0(1933), where the formulation of the problem was attributed to Stanis\u0142aw Ulam. Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected by .\nEquivalent statements.\nThe following statements are equivalent to the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem.\nWith odd functions.\nA function formula_16 is called \"odd\" (aka \"antipodal\" or \"antipode-preserving\") if for every formula_17, formula_18.\nThe Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem is equivalent to each of the following statements:\n(1) Each continuous odd function formula_19 has a zero.\n(2) There is no continuous odd function formula_20.\nHere is a proof that the Borsuk-Ulam theorem is equivalent to (1): \n(formula_21) If the theorem is correct, then it is specifically correct for odd functions, and for an odd function, formula_22 iff formula_5. Hence every odd continuous function has a zero.\n(formula_24) For every continuous function formula_25, the following function is continuous and odd: formula_26. If every odd continuous function has a zero, then formula_16 has a zero, and therefore, formula_28. \nTo prove that (1) and (2) are equivalent, we use the following continuous odd maps:\nThe proof now writes itself.\nformula_32 We prove the contrapositive. If there exists a continuous odd function formula_33, then formula_34 is a continuous odd function formula_35.\nformula_36 Again we prove the contrapositive. If there exists a continuous odd function formula_37, then formula_38 is a continuous odd function formula_39.\nProofs.\n1-dimensional case.\nThe 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the intermediate value theorem (IVT).\nLet formula_16 be the odd real-valued continuous function on a circle defined by formula_26. Pick an arbitrary formula_17. If formula_5 then we are done. Otherwise, without loss of generality, formula_44 But formula_45 Hence, by the IVT, there is a point formula_46 at which formula_47.\nGeneral case.\nAlgebraic topological proof.\nAssume that formula_48 is an odd continuous function with formula_49 (the case formula_50 is treated above, the case formula_51 can be handled using basic covering theory). By passing to orbits under the antipodal action, we then get an induced continuous function formula_52 between real projective spaces, which induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. By the Hurewicz theorem, the induced ring homomorphism on cohomology with formula_53 coefficients [where formula_53 denotes the field with two elements], \nformula_55\nsends formula_56 to formula_57. But then we get that formula_58 is sent to formula_59, a contradiction.\nOne can also show the stronger statement that any odd map formula_60 has odd degree and then deduce the theorem from this result.\nCombinatorial proof.\nThe Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem can be proved from Tucker's lemma.\nLet formula_3 be a continuous odd function. Because \"g\" is continuous on a compact domain, it is uniformly continuous. Therefore, for every formula_62, there is a formula_63 such that, for every two points of formula_64 which are within formula_65 of each other, their images under \"g\" are within formula_66 of each other.\nDefine a triangulation of formula_64 with edges of length at most formula_65. Label each vertex formula_69 of the triangulation with a label formula_70 in the following way:\nBecause \"g\" is odd, the labeling is also odd: formula_73. Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices formula_74 with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are formula_75. By the definition of \"l\", this means that in both formula_76 and formula_77, coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate: in formula_76 this coordinate is positive while in formula_77 it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between formula_76 and formula_77 is at most formula_66, so in particular formula_83 (since formula_84 and formula_85 have opposite signs) and so formula_86. But since the largest coordinate of formula_76 is coordinate #1, this means that formula_88 for each formula_89. So formula_90, where formula_91 is some constant depending on formula_92 and the norm formula_93 which you have chosen.\nThe above is true for every formula_62; since formula_64 is compact there must hence be a point \"u\" in which formula_96.\nEquivalent results.\nAbove we showed how to prove the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem from Tucker's lemma. The converse is also true: it is possible to prove Tucker's lemma from the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem. Therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.\nThere are several fixed-point theorems which come in three equivalent variants: an algebraic topology variant, a combinatorial variant and a set-covering variant. Each variant can be proved separately using totally different arguments, but each variant can also be reduced to the other variants in its row. Additionally, each result in \nthe top row can be deduced from the one below it in the same column.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4067", "revid": "41906662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4067", "title": "Bragi", "text": "Skaldic god of poetry in Norse mythology\nBragi (Old Norse) is the skaldic god of poetry in Norse mythology.\nEtymology.\nThe theonym Bragi probably stems from the masculine noun \"bragr\", which can be translated in Old Norse as 'poetry' (cf. Icelandic \"bragur\" 'poem, melody, wise') or as 'the first, noblest' (cf. poetic Old Norse \"bragnar\" 'chiefs, men', \"bragningr\" 'king'). It is unclear whether the theonym semantically derives from the first meaning or the second.\nA connection has been also suggested with the Old Norse \"bragarfull\", the cup drunk in solemn occasions with the taking of vows. The word is usually taken to semantically derive from the second meaning of \"bragr\" ('first one, noblest'). A relation with the Old English term \"brego\" ('lord, prince') remains uncertain.\n\"Bragi\" regularly appears as a personal name in Old Norse and Old Swedish sources, which according to linguist Jan de Vries might indicate the secondary character of the god's name.\nAttestations.\nSnorri Sturluson writes in the \"Gylfaginning\" after describing Odin, Thor, and Baldr:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One is called Bragi: he is renowned for wisdom, and most of all for fluency of speech and skill with words. He knows most of skaldship, and after him skaldship is called \"bragr\", and from his name that one is called \"bragr\"-man or -woman, who possesses eloquence surpassing others, of women or of men. His wife is I\u00f0unn.\nIn \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" Snorri writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How should one periphrase Bragi? By calling him \"husband of I\u00f0unn\", \"first maker of poetry\", and \"the long-bearded god\" (after his name, a man who has a great beard is called Beard-Bragi), and \"son of Odin\".\nThat Bragi is Odin's son is clearly mentioned only here and in some versions of a list of the sons of Odin (see Sons of Odin). But \"wish-son\" in stanza 16 of the \"Lokasenna\" could mean \"Odin's son\" and is translated by Hollander as \"Odin's kin\". Bragi's mother is possibly Frigg.\nIn that poem Bragi at first forbids Loki to enter the hall but is overruled by Odin. Loki then gives a greeting to all gods and goddesses who are in the hall save to Bragi. Bragi generously offers his sword, horse, and an arm ring as peace gift but Loki only responds by accusing Bragi of cowardice, of being the most afraid to fight of any of the \u00c6sir and Elves within the hall. Bragi responds that if they were outside the hall, he would have Loki's head, but Loki only repeats the accusation. When Bragi's wife I\u00f0unn attempts to calm Bragi, Loki accuses her of embracing her brother's slayer, a reference to matters that have not survived. It may be that Bragi had slain I\u00f0unn's brother.\nA passage in the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\" describes runes being graven on the sun, on the ear of one of the sun-horses and on the hoofs of the other, on Sleipnir's teeth, on bear's paw, on eagle's beak, on wolf's claw, and on several other things including on Bragi's tongue. Then the runes are shaved off and the shavings are mixed with mead and sent abroad so that \u00c6sir have some, Elves have some, Vanir have some, and Men have some, these being speech runes and birth runes, ale runes, and magic runes. The meaning of this is obscure.\nThe first part of Snorri Sturluson's \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" is a dialogue between \u00c6gir and Bragi about the nature of poetry, particularly skaldic poetry. Bragi tells the origin of the mead of poetry from the blood of Kvasir and how Odin obtained this mead. He then goes on to discuss various poetic metaphors known as \"kennings\".\nSnorri Sturluson clearly distinguishes the god Bragi from the mortal skald Bragi Boddason, whom he often mentions separately. The appearance of Bragi in the \"Lokasenna\" indicates that if these two Bragis were originally the same, they have become separated for that author also, or that chronology has become very muddled and Bragi Boddason has been relocated to mythological time. Compare the appearance of the Welsh Taliesin in the second branch of the Mabinogi. Legendary chronology sometimes does become muddled. Whether Bragi the god originally arose as a deified version of Bragi Boddason was much debated in the 19th century, especially by the scholars Eugen Mogk and Sophus Bugge. The debate remains undecided.\nIn the poem \"Eir\u00edksm\u00e1l\" Odin, in Valhalla, hears the coming of the dead Norwegian king Eric Bloodaxe and his host, and bids the heroes Sigmund and Sinfj\u00f6tli rise to greet him. Bragi is then mentioned, questioning how Odin knows that it is Eric and why Odin has let such a king die. In the poem \"H\u00e1konarm\u00e1l\", H\u00e1kon the Good is taken to Valhalla by the valkyrie G\u00f6ndul and Odin sends Herm\u00f3\u00f0r and Bragi to greet him. In these poems Bragi could be either a god or a dead hero in Valhalla. Attempting to decide is further confused because \"Herm\u00f3\u00f0r\" also seems to be sometimes the name of a god and sometimes the name of a hero. That Bragi was also the first to speak to Loki in the \"Lokasenna\" as Loki attempted to enter the hall might be a parallel. It might have been useful and customary that a man of great eloquence and versed in poetry should greet those entering a hall. He is also depicted in tenth-century court poetry of helping to prepare Valhalla for new arrivals and welcoming the kings who have been slain in battle to the hall of Odin.\nSkalds named Bragi.\nBragi Boddason.\nIn the \"Prose Edda\" Snorri Sturluson quotes many stanzas attributed to Bragi Boddason the old (\"Bragi Boddason inn gamli\"), a Norwegian court poet who served several Swedish kings, Ragnar Lodbrok, \u00d6sten Beli and Bj\u00f6rn at Hauge who reigned in the first half of the 9th century. This Bragi was reckoned as the first skaldic poet, and was certainly the earliest skaldic poet then remembered by name whose verse survived in memory.\nSnorri especially quotes passages from Bragi's \"Ragnarsdr\u00e1pa\", a poem supposedly composed in honor of the famous legendary Viking Ragnar Lodbrok ('Hairy-breeches') describing the images on a decorated shield which Ragnar had given to Bragi. The images included Thor's fishing for J\u00f6rmungandr, Gefjun's ploughing of Zealand from the soil of Sweden, the attack of Hamdir and Sorli against King J\u00f6rmunrekk, and the never-ending battle between Hedin and H\u00f6gni.\nBragi son of H\u00e1lfdan the Old.\nBragi son of H\u00e1lfdan the Old is mentioned only in the \"Skj\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\". This Bragi is the sixth of the second of two groups of nine sons fathered by King H\u00e1lfdan the Old on Alvig the Wise, daughter of King Eymund of H\u00f3lmgard. This second group of sons are all eponymous ancestors of legendary families of the north. Snorri says:\nBragi, from whom the Bragnings are sprung (that is the race of H\u00e1lfdan the Generous).\nOf the Bragnings as a race and of H\u00e1lfdan the Generous nothing else is known. However, \"Bragning\" is often, like some others of these dynastic names, used in poetry as a general word for 'king' or 'ruler'.\nBragi H\u00f6gnason.\nIn the eddic poem \"Helgakvi\u00f0a Hundingsbana II\", Bragi H\u00f6gnason, his brother Dag, and his sister Sigr\u00fan were children of H\u00f6gne, the king of East G\u00f6taland. The poem relates how Sigmund's son Helgi Hundingsbane agreed to take Sigr\u00fan daughter of H\u00f6gni as his wife against her unwilling betrothal to Hodbrodd son of Granmar the king of S\u00f6dermanland. In the subsequent battle of Frekastein (probably one of the 300 hill forts of S\u00f6dermanland, as \"stein\" meant \"hill fort\") against H\u00f6gni and Granmar, all the chieftains on Granmar's side are slain, including Bragi, except for Bragi's brother Dag.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 2002 Ensemble Studios game \"Age of Mythology\", Bragi is one of nine minor gods Norse players can worship.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4068", "revid": "39152912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4068", "title": "Blaise Pascal", "text": "French mathematician, physicist, inventor, writer, and Christian philosopher (1623\u20131662)\nBlaise Pascal (19June 1623\u00a0\u2013 19August 1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher, and Catholic writer.\nPascal was a child prodigy who was educated by his father \u00c9tienne Pascal, a tax collector in Rouen. His earliest mathematical work was on projective geometry; he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of conic sections at the age of 16. He later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and social science. In 1642, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines (called Pascal's calculators and later Pascalines), establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the mechanical calculator.\nLike his contemporary Ren\u00e9 Descartes, Pascal was also a pioneer in the natural and applied sciences. Pascal wrote in defense of the scientific method and produced several controversial results. He made important contributions to the study of fluids, and clarified the concepts of pressure and vacuum by generalising the work of Evangelista Torricelli. The SI unit for pressure is named for Pascal. Following Torricelli and Galileo Galilei, in 1647 he rebutted the likes of Aristotle and Descartes who insisted that nature abhors a vacuum.\nHe is also credited as the inventor of modern public transportation, having established the carrosses \u00e0 cinq sols, the first modern public transport service, shortly before his death in 1662.\nIn 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within Catholicism known by its detractors as Jansenism. Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the and the \"Pens\u00e9es\", the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and Jesuits. The latter contains Pascal's wager, known in the original as the \"Discourse on the Machine\", a fideistic probabilistic argument for why one should believe in God. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659, he wrote on the cycloid and its use in calculating the volume of solids. Following several years of illness, Pascal died in Paris at the age of 39.\nEarly life and education.\nPascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand, which is in France's Auvergne region, by the Massif Central. He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three. His father, \u00c9tienne Pascal, also an amateur mathematician, was a local judge and member of the \"Noblesse de Robe\". Pascal had two sisters, the younger Jacqueline and the elder Gilberte.\nMove to Paris.\nIn 1631, five years after the death of his wife, \u00c9tienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became a key member of the family. \u00c9tienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children.\nThe young Pascal showed an extraordinary intellectual ability, with an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science. Etienne had tried to keep his son from learning mathematics; but by the age of 12, Pascal had rediscovered, on his own, using charcoal on a tile floor, Euclid\u2019s first thirty-two geometric propositions, and was thus given a copy of Euclid's \"Elements\".\n\"Essay on Conics\".\nParticularly of interest to Pascal was a work of Desargues on conic sections. Following Desargues' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the \"Mystic Hexagram\", \"Essai pour les coniques\" (\"Essay on Conics\") and sent it \u2014 his first serious work of mathematics \u2014 to P\u00e8re Mersenne in Paris; it is known still today as Pascal's theorem. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).\nPascal's work was so precocious that Ren\u00e9 Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: \"I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients,\" adding, \"but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child.\"\nLeaving Paris.\nIn France at that time offices and positions could be\u2014and were\u2014bought and sold. In 1631, \u00c9tienne sold his position as second president of the \"Cour des Aides\" for 65,665 livres. The money was invested in a government bond which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris, but in 1638 Cardinal Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the Thirty Years' War, defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly \u00c9tienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.\nLike so many others, \u00c9tienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of Richelieu, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that \u00c9tienne was pardoned. In time, \u00c9tienne was back in good graces with the Cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of Rouen\u2014a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.\nPascaline.\nIn 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called \"Pascal's calculator\" or the \"Pascaline\". Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the Mus\u00e9e des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Paris and one more by the Zwinger museum in Dresden, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators.\nAlthough these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of computer engineering, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a status symbol, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. He also presented the first mechanical calculator to Christina, Queen of Sweden in 1632. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design. He built 20 finished machines over the following 10 years.\nMathematics.\nProbability.\nIn 1654, prompted by his friend the Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9, Pascal corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on the subject of gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of probability. The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to divide the stakes fairly, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of expected value was introduced. John Ross writes, \"Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events.\" Pascal, in the \"Pens\u00e9es\", used a probabilistic argument, Pascal's wager, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. However, Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. Christiaan Huygens, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include Abraham de Moivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for Leibniz's formulation of the calculus.\n\"Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\".\nPascal's \"Trait\u00e9 du triangle arithm\u00e9tique\", written in 1654 but published posthumously in 1665, described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients which he called the arithmetical triangle, but is now called Pascal's triangle. The triangle can also be represented:\nHe defined the numbers in the triangle by recursion: Call the number in the (\"m\"\u00a0+\u00a01)th row and (\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a01)th column \"t\"\"mn\". Then \"t\"\"mn\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"t\"\"m\"\u22121,\"n\"\u00a0+\u00a0\"t\"\"m\",\"n\"\u22121, for \"m\"\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a0... and \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a00,\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a0... The boundary conditions are \"t\"\"m\",\u22121\u00a0=\u00a00, \"t\"\u22121,\"n\"\u00a0=\u00a00 for \"m\"\u00a0=\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0... and \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a01,\u00a02,\u00a03,\u00a0... The generator \"t\"00\u00a0=\u00a01. Pascal concluded with the proof,\nformula_1\nIn the same treatise, Pascal gave an explicit statement of the principle of mathematical induction. In 1654, he proved \"Pascal's identity\" relating the sums of the \"p\"-th powers of the first \"n\" positive integers for \"p\" = 0, 1, 2, ..., \"k\".\nThat same year, Pascal had a religious experience, and mostly gave up work in mathematics.\nCycloid.\nIn 1658, Pascal, while suffering from a toothache, began considering several problems concerning the cycloid. His toothache disappeared, and he took this as a heavenly sign to proceed with his research. Eight days later he had completed his essay and, to publicize the results, proposed a contest.\nPascal proposed three questions relating to the center of gravity, area and volume of the cycloid, with the winner or winners to receive prizes of 20 and 40 Spanish doubloons. Pascal, Gilles de Roberval and Pierre de Carcavi were the judges, and neither of the two submissions (by John Wallis and Antoine de Lalouv\u00e8re) were judged to be adequate. While the contest was ongoing, Christopher Wren sent Pascal a proposal for a proof of the rectification of the cycloid; Roberval claimed promptly that he had known of the proof for years. Wallis published Wren's proof (crediting Wren) in Wallis's \"Tractus Duo\", giving Wren priority for the first published proof.\nPhysics.\nPascal contributed to several fields in physics, most notably the fields of fluid mechanics and pressure. In honour of his scientific contributions, the name \"Pascal\" has been given to the SI unit of pressure and Pascal's law (an important principle of hydrostatics). He introduced a primitive form of roulette and the roulette wheel in his search for a perpetual motion machine.\nFluid dynamics.\nHis work in the fields of hydrodynamics and hydrostatics centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His inventions include the hydraulic press (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the syringe. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as Pascal's barrel experiment.\nVacuum.\nBy 1647, Pascal had learned of Evangelista Torricelli's experimentation with barometers. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists including Descartes believed in a plenum, i. e. some invisible matter filled all of space, rather than a vacuum (\"Nature abhors a vacuum).\" This was based on the Aristotelian notion that everything in motion was a substance, moved by another substance. Furthermore, light passed through the glass tube, suggesting a substance such as aether rather than vacuum filled the space.\nFollowing more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced \"Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide\" (\"New experiments with the vacuum\"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by \"R\u00e9cit de la grande exp\u00e9rience de l'\u00e9quilibre des liqueurs\" (\"Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids\") published in 1648.\nFirst atmospheric pressure vs. altitude experiment.\nThe Torricellian vacuum found that air pressure is equal to the weight of 30 inches of mercury. If air has a finite weight, Earth's atmosphere must have a maximum height. Pascal reasoned that if true, air pressure on a high mountain must be less than at a lower altitude. He lived near the Puy de D\u00f4me mountain, tall, but his health was poor so could not climb it. On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, Florin P\u00e9rier, husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by P\u00e9rier, reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The weather was chancy last Saturday...[but] around five o'clock that morning...the Puy-de-D\u00f4me was visible...so I decided to give it a try. Several important people of the city of Clermont had asked me to let them know when I would make the ascent...I was delighted to have them with me in this great work...\n...at eight o'clock we met in the gardens of the Minim Fathers, which has the lowest elevation in town...First I poured 16 pounds of quicksilver...into a vessel...then took several glass tubes...each four feet long and hermetically sealed at one end and opened at the other...then placed them in the vessel [of quicksilver]...I found the quick silver stood at 26\" and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 lines above the quicksilver in the vessel...I repeated the experiment two more times while standing in the same spot...[they] produced the same result each time...\nI attached one of the tubes to the vessel and marked the height of the quicksilver and...asked Father Chastin, one of the Minim Brothers...to watch if any changes should occur through the day...Taking the other tube and a portion of the quick silver...I walked to the top of Puy-de-D\u00f4me, about 500 fathoms higher than the monastery, where upon experiment...found that the quicksilver reached a height of only 23\" and 2 lines...I repeated the experiment five times with care...each at different points on the summit...found the same height of quicksilver...in each case...\nPascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines. He found with both experiments that an ascent of 7 fathoms lowers the mercury by half a line. Note: Pascal used \"pouce\" and \"ligne\" for \"inch\" and \"line\", and \"toise\" for \"fathom\".\nIn a reply to \u00c9tienne No\u00ebl, who believed in the plenum, Pascal wrote, echoing contemporary notions of science and falsifiability: \"In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity.\"\nBlaise Pascal Chairs are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the Ile de France region.\nAdult life: religion, literature, and philosophy.\nReligious conversion.\nIn the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a broken hip could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France, Deslandes and de la Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal \"would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again...\" However treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become regular visitors.\nBoth men were followers of Jean Guillebert, proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as Jansenism. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous Augustinism. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and after their successful treatment of his father, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of \"first conversion\" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.\nPascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his \"worldly period\" (1648\u201354). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and his sister Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a postulant in the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he needed her just as she had needed him.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Suddenly there was war in the Pascal household. Blaise pleaded with Jacqueline not to leave, but she was adamant. He commanded her to stay, but that didn't work, either. At the heart of this was...Blaise's fear of abandonment...if Jacqueline entered Port-Royal, she would have to leave her inheritance behind...[but] nothing would change her mind.\nBy the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, \"He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor...\"\nIn early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,\nPascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, \"had begun to smell like a cult.\" With two-thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.\nFor a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.\n\"Memorial\".\nOn the 23 of November, 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense religious experience and immediately wrote a brief note to himself which began: \"Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars...\" and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: \"I will not forget thy word. Amen.\" He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. This piece is now known as the \"Memorial\". The story of a carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the \"Memorial\" is disputed by some scholars.\nHis belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at Port-Royal for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the \"Provincial Letters\".\nLiterature.\nIn literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later polemicists.\nThe \"Provincial Letters\".\nBeginning in 1656\u201357, Pascal published his memorable attack on casuistry, a popular ethical method used by Catholic thinkers in the early modern period (especially the Jesuits, and in particular Antonio Escobar). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of sins. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed Louis XIV. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midst of the formulary controversy, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 papal bull condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied Alexander VII himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments.\nAside from their religious influence, the \"Provincial Letters\" were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\nIt is in the \"Provincial Letters\" that Pascal made his oft-quoted apology for writing a long letter, as he had not had time to write a shorter one.\nFrom Letter XVI, as translated by Thomas M'Crie:\n'Reverend fathers, my letters were not wont either to be so prolix, or to follow so closely on\none another. Want of time must plead my excuse for both of these faults. The present letter is\na very long one, simply because I had no leisure to make it shorter.'\nCharles Perrault wrote of the \"Letters\": \"Everything is there\u2014purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an \"agr\u00e9ment\" not to be found anywhere else.\"\nPhilosophy.\nPascal is arguably best known as a philosopher, considered by some the second greatest French mind behind Ren\u00e9 Descartes. He was a dualist following Descartes. However, he is also remembered for his opposition to both the rationalism of the likes of Descartes and simultaneous opposition to the main countervailing epistemology, empiricism, preferring fideism.\nIn terms of God, Descartes and Pascal disagreed. Pascal wrote that \"I cannot forgive Descartes. In all his philosophy he would have been quite willing to dispense with God, but he couldn't avoid letting him put the world in motion; afterwards he didn't need God anymore\". He opposed the rationalism of people like Descartes as applied to the existence of a God, preferring faith as \"reason can decide nothing here\". For Pascal the nature of God was such that such proofs cannot reveal God. Humans \"are in darkness and estranged from God\" because \"he has hidden Himself from their knowledge\".\nHe cared above all about the philosophy of religion. Pascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that humans are, according to Wood, \"born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness\".\nPhilosophy of mathematics.\nPascal's major contribution to the philosophy of mathematics came with his \"De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique\" (\"Of the Geometrical Spirit\"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous Petites \u00e9coles de Port-Royal (\"Little Schools of Port-Royal\"). The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up\u2014first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.\nPascal also used \"De l'Esprit g\u00e9om\u00e9trique\" to develop a theory of definition. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of essentialism. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of formalism as formulated by Descartes.\nIn \"De l'Art de persuader\" (\"On the Art of Persuasion\"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's axiomatic method, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the axioms upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with Montaigne that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.\nPens\u00e9es.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Man is only a reed, the weakest in nature, but he is a thinking reed.\u2014\u200a\nPascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the \"Pens\u00e9es\" (\"Thoughts\") is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in French prose. When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), Sainte-Beuve praised it as the finest pages in the French language. Will Durant hailed the Pens\u00e9es as \"the most eloquent book in French prose\".\nThe \"Pens\u00e9es\" was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the Christian faith, with the original title \"Apologie de la religion Chr\u00e9tienne\" (\"Defense of the Christian Religion\"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled \"Pens\u00e9es de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets\" (\"Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects\") and soon thereafter became a classic.\nOne of the \"Apologie\"'s main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of Pyrrhonism and Stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.\nLast works and death.\nT. S. Eliot described him during this phase of his life as \"a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world.\" Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, \"Don't pity me, sickness is the natural state of Christians, because in it we are, as we should always be, in the suffering of evils, in the deprivation of all the goods and pleasures of the senses, free from all the passions that work throughout the course of life, without ambition, without avarice, in the continual expectation of death.\" Desiring to imitate Jesus\u2019 poverty of spirit, in his spirit of zeal and charity, Pascal said if God allowed him to recover from his illness, he would be resolved to \"have no other employment or occupation for the rest of my life than the service of the poor.\"\nLouis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, \"\u00c9crit sur la signature du formulaire\" (\"Writ on the Signing of the Form\"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his polemics on Jansenism.\nInventor of public transportation.\nPascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating one of the first land-based public transport services, the carrosses \u00e0 cinq sols, a network of horse-drawn multi-seat carriages that carried passengers on five fixed routes. Pascal also designated the operation principles which were later used to plan public transportation; the carriages had a fixed route, fixed price (five sols, hence the name), and left even if there were no passengers. The lines were not commercially successful, and the last one closed by 1675. Nonetheless, he has been described as the inventor of public transportation.\nIllness and death.\nIn 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister's death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received extreme unction. He died the next morning, his last words being \"May God never abandon me,\" and was buried in the cemetery of Saint-\u00c9tienne-du-Mont.\nAn autopsy performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with damage to his brain. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on tuberculosis, stomach cancer, or a combination of the two. The headaches which affected Pascal are generally attributed to his brain lesion.\nLegacy.\nOne of the Universities of Clermont-Ferrand, France\u2014Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal\u2014is named after him. \u00c9tablissement scolaire fran\u00e7ais Blaise-Pascal in Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after Pascal.\nThe 1969 Eric Rohmer film \"My Night at Maud's\" is based on the work of Pascal. Roberto Rossellini directed a filmed biopic, \"Blaise Pascal\", which originally aired on Italian television in 1971. Pascal was a subject of the first edition of the 1984 BBC Two documentary, \"Sea of Faith\", presented by Don Cupitt. The chameleon in the animated film \"Tangled\" is named for Pascal.\nA programming language is named for Pascal. In 2014, Nvidia announced its new Pascal microarchitecture, which is named for Pascal. The first graphics cards featuring Pascal were released in 2016.\nThe 2017 game \"\" has multiple characters named after famous philosophers; one of these is a sentient pacifistic machine named Pascal, who serves as a major supporting character. Pascal creates a village for machines to live peacefully with the androids they are at war with and acts as a parental figure for other machines trying to adapt to their newly-found individuality.\nThe otter in the \"Animal Crossing\" series is named for Pascal.\nThe minor planet 4500 Pascal is named in his honor.\nPope Paul VI, in encyclical \"Populorum progressio\", issued in 1967, quotes Pascal's \"Pens\u00e9es\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;True humanism points the way toward God and acknowledges the task to which we are called, the task which offers us the real meaning of human life. Man is not the ultimate measure of man. Man becomes truly man only by passing beyond himself. In the words of Pascal: \"Man infinitely surpasses man.\nIn 2023, Pope Francis released an apostolic letter, \"Sublimitas et miseria hominis\", dedicated to Blaise Pascal, in commemoration of the fourth centenary of his birth.\nPascal influenced both French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who named his \"Pascalian Meditations\" (1997) after him, and French philosopher Louis Althusser.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4069", "revid": "50549889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4069", "title": "Brittonic languages", "text": "Celtic language family branch\nThe Brittonic languages (also Brythonic or British Celtic; ; ; and ) form one of the two branches of the Insular Celtic languages; the other is Goidelic. It comprises the extant languages Breton, Cornish, and Welsh. The name \"Brythonic\" was derived by Welsh Celticist John Rhys from the Welsh word , denoting a Celtic Briton as distinguished from Anglo-Saxons or Gaels.\nThe Brittonic languages derive from the Common Brittonic language, spoken throughout Great Britain during the Iron Age and Roman period. In the 5th and 6th centuries emigrating Britons also took Brittonic speech to the continent, most significantly in Brittany and Britonia. During the next few centuries, in much of Britain the language was replaced by Old English and Scottish Gaelic, with the remaining Common Brittonic language splitting into regional dialects, eventually evolving into Welsh, Cornish, Breton, Cumbric, and probably Pictish. Welsh and Breton continue to be spoken as native languages, while a revival in Cornish has led to an increase in speakers of that language. Cumbric and Pictish are extinct, having been replaced by Goidelic and Anglic speech. There is also a community of Brittonic language speakers in (the Welsh settlement in Patagonia).\nName.\nThe names \"Brittonic\" and \"Brythonic\" are scholarly conventions referring to the Celtic languages of Britain and to the ancestral language they originated from, designated Common Brittonic, in contrast to the Goidelic languages originating in Ireland. Both were created in the 19th century to avoid the ambiguity of earlier terms such as \"British\" and \"Cymric\". \"Brythonic\" was coined in 1879 by the Celticist John Rhys from the Welsh word . \"Brittonic\", derived from \"Briton\" and also earlier spelled \"Britonic\" and \"Britonnic\", emerged later in the 19th century. \"Brittonic\" became more prominent through the 20th century, and was used in Kenneth H. Jackson's highly influential 1953 work on the topic, \"Language and History in Early Britain\". Jackson noted by that time that \"Brythonic\" had become a dated term: \"of late there has been an increasing tendency to use Brittonic instead.\" Today, \"Brittonic\" often replaces \"Brythonic\" in the literature. Rudolf Thurneysen used \"Britannic\" in his influential \"A Grammar of Old Irish\", although this never became popular among subsequent scholars.\nComparable historical terms include the Medieval Latin and and the Welsh . Some writers use \"British\" for the language and its descendants, although, due to the risk of confusion, others avoid it or use it only in a restricted sense. Jackson, and later John T. Koch, use \"British\" only for the early phase of the Common Brittonic language.\nBefore Jackson's work, \"Brittonic\" and \"Brythonic\" were often used for all the P-Celtic languages, including not just the varieties in Britain but those Continental Celtic languages that similarly experienced the evolution of the Proto-Celtic language element to . However, subsequent writers have tended to follow Jackson's scheme, rendering this use obsolete.\nThe name \"Britain\" itself comes from , via Old French and Middle English , possibly influenced by Old English , probably also from Latin , ultimately an adaptation of the native word for the island, .\nAn early written reference to the British Isles may derive from the works of the Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia; later Greek writers such as Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo who quote Pytheas' use of variants such as (), \"The Britannic [land, island]\", and (), \"Britannic islands\", with being a Celtic word that might mean 'painted ones' or 'tattooed folk', referring to body decoration.\nEvidence.\nKnowledge of the Brittonic languages comes from a variety of sources. The early language's information is obtained from coins, inscriptions, and comments by classical writers as well as place names and personal names recorded by them. For later languages, there is information from medieval writers and modern native speakers, together with place names. The names recorded in the Roman period are given in Rivet and Smith.\nCharacteristics.\nThe Brittonic branch is also referred to as \"P-Celtic\" because linguistic reconstruction of the Brittonic reflex of the Proto-Indo-European phoneme is \"p\" as opposed to Goidelic \"k\". Such nomenclature usually implies acceptance of the P-Celtic and Q-Celtic hypothesis rather than the Insular Celtic hypothesis because the term includes certain Continental Celtic languages as well.\nOther major characteristics include:\nLenition.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nClassification.\nThe family tree of the Brittonic languages is as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBrittonic languages in use today are Welsh, Cornish and Breton. Welsh and Breton have been spoken continuously since they formed. For all practical purposes Cornish died out during the 18th or 19th century, but a revival movement has more recently created small numbers of new speakers. Also notable are the extinct language Cumbric, and possibly the extinct Pictish. One view, advanced in the 1950s and based on apparently unintelligible ogham inscriptions, was that the Picts may have also used a non-Indo-European language. This view, while attracting broad popular appeal, has virtually no following in contemporary linguistic scholarship.\nHistory and origins.\nThe modern Brittonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed \"Brittonic\", \"British\", \"Common Brittonic\", \"Old Brittonic\" or \"Proto-Brittonic\", which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic or early Insular Celtic by the 6th century BC.\nA major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the middle to late Bronze Age, during the 500-year period 1,300\u2013800 BC. The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul. During 1,000\u2013875 BC, their genetic markers swiftly spread through southern Britain, but not northern Britain. The authors describe this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\". There was much less inward migration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then. Barry Cunliffe suggests that a Goidelic branch of Celtic may already have been spoken in Britain, but that this middle Bronze Age migration would have introduced the Brittonic branch.\nBrittonic languages were probably spoken before the Roman invasion throughout most of Great Britain. It might have been spoken on the Isle of Man, although by the early Middle Ages it had a Goidelic language, Manx. During the period of the Roman occupation of what is now England and Wales (AD 43 to c.\u2009410), Common Brittonic borrowed a large stock of Latin words, both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of Celtic Britain such as urbanization and new tactics of warfare, as well as for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms (most notably, the word for 'fish' in all the Brittonic languages derives from the Latin rather than the native \u2013 which may survive, however, in the Welsh name of the River Usk, ). Approximately 800 of these Latin loan-words have survived in the three modern Brittonic languages. Pictish may have resisted Latin influence to a greater extent than the other Brittonic languages.\nIt is probable that at the start of the Post-Roman period, Common Brittonic was differentiated into at least two major dialect groups \u2013 Southwestern and Western. (Additional dialects have also been posited, but have left little or no evidence, such as an Eastern Brittonic spoken in what is now the East of England.) Between the end of the Roman occupation and the mid-6th century, the two dialects began to diverge into recognizably separate varieties, the Western into Cumbric and Welsh, and the Southwestern into Cornish and its closely related sister language Breton, which was carried to continental Armorica. Jackson showed that a few of the dialect distinctions between West and Southwest Brittonic go back a long way. New divergencies began around AD 500 but other changes that were shared occurred in the 6th century. Other common changes occurred in the 7th century onward and are possibly due to inherent tendencies. Thus the concept of a Common Brittonic language ends by AD 600. Substantial numbers of Britons certainly remained in the expanding area controlled by Anglo-Saxons, but over the fifth and sixth centuries they mostly adopted the Old English language and culture.\nDecline.\nThe Brittonic languages spoken in what are now Scotland and England began to be displaced in the 5th century through the settlement of Irish-speaking Gaels and Germanic peoples. Henry of Huntingdon wrote c.\u20091129 that Pictish was \"no longer spoken\".\nThe displacement of the languages of Brittonic descent was probably complete in all of Britain except Cornwall, Wales, and the English counties bordering these areas such as Devon, by the 11th century. Western Herefordshire continued to speak Welsh until the late nineteenth century, and isolated pockets of Shropshire speak Welsh today.\nSound changes.\nThe large array of Brittonic sound changes has been documented by Schrijver (1995), building upon Jackson (1953).\nChanges to long vowels and diphthongs.\nBrittonic has undergone an extensive remodeling of Proto-Celtic diphthongs and long vowels. All original Proto-Celtic diphthongs turned into monophthongs, albeit a number of these re-diphthongized at later stages.\nChanges to short vowels.\nThe distribution of Proto-Celtic short vowels were reshuffled by various processes in Brittonic, such as the two i-affections, a-affection, raisings, and contact with lenited consonants like \"*g\" &gt; and \"*s\" &gt; \"*h\".\nThe default outcomes of stressed short vowels in Brittonic are as follows:\nRaisings of \"*e\" and \"*o\".\nWelsh exhibits raisings of \"*e\" to \"*i\" &gt; ' &gt; ' \u27e8y\u27e9 and \"*o\" &gt; \u27e8w\u27e9 before a nasal followed by a stop.\nIt is difficult to determine whether the raising from \"*o\" to \"*u\" also affected Cornish and Breton, since both of those languages generally merge \"*o\" with \"*u\".\nThe raising of \"*e\" to \"*i\" occurred in all three major Brittonic languages:\nOther raising environments identified by Schrijver include:\nThis raising preceded a-affection, since a-affection reverses this raising whenever it applied.\nAll these raisings not only affected native vocabulary, but also affected Latin loanwords.\nInteractions of vowels followed by \"*g\".\nMultiple special interactions of vowels occurred when followed by \"*g\". \nAssimilation of \"*oRa\" to \"*aRa\".\nClosely paralleling the common Celtic change of \"*eRa\" &gt; \"*aRa\" (Joseph's rule) is the change of \"*oRa\" to \"*aRa\" in Brittonic, with \"R\" standing for any lone sonorant. Unlike Joseph's rule, \"*oRa\" to \"*aRa\" did not occur in Goidelic. Schrijver demonstrates this rule with the following examples:\nAssuming that Welsh \"manach\" (borrowed from Latin \"monachus\" \"monk\") also underwent this assimilation, Schrijver concludes that this change must predate the raising of vowels in \"*mVn-\" sequences, which in turn predates a-affection (an early fifth-century process).\n/je/ &gt; /ja/.\nIn Brittonic, Celtic \"*ye\" generally became /ja/. Some examples cited by Schrijver include:\n\"*wo\".\nThe sequence \"*wo\" was quite volatile in Brittonic. It originally manifested as \"*wo\" in unlenited position and \"*wa\" in lenited position. Word-initially, this allomorphy was gone in medieval times, leveled out in various ways. Whichever of \"*o\" or \"*a\" to be generalized in the reflexes of a word in a given Brittonic language is completely unpredictable, and occasionally both \"o\" and \"a\" reflexes have been attested within the same language. Southwest Brittonic languages like Breton and Cornish usually generalize the same variant of \"*wo\" in a given word while Welsh tends to have its own distribution of variants.\nThe distribution of \"*wo/wa\" is also complicated by an Old Breton development where \"*wo\" that had not turned to \"*gwa\" would split into \"go(u)-\" (Old Breton \"gu-\") in penultimate post-apocope syllables and \"go-\" in monosyllables.\nDevelopments of \"*ub\".\nThe sequence \"*ub\" &gt; \"*u\u03b2\" remained as such when followed by a consonant, for instance in Proto-Celtic \"*dubros\" \"water\" &gt; \"*du\u03b2r\" &gt; Welsh \"dwfr\", \"d\u0175r\" and Breton \"dour\".\nHowever, if no consonant exists after a \"*ub\" sequence, the \"*u\" merges with whatever Proto-Celtic \"*ou\" and \"*oi\" became, the result of which is written \u27e8u\u27e9 in the Brittonic languages. The lenited \"*b\" &gt; \"*\u03b2\" is lost word-finally after this happens.\nSchrijver dates this development between the 6th to 8th centuries, with subsequent loss of \"*\u03b2\" datable to the 9th century.\na-affection.\nIn Brittonic, final a-affection was triggered by final-syllable \"*\u0101\" or \"*a\", which was later apocopated. This process lowered \"*i\" and \"*u\" in the preceding syllable to \"*e\" and \"*o\", respectively.\nA-affection, by affecting feminine forms of adjectives and not their masculine counterparts, created root vowel alternations by gender such as \"*windos\", feminine \"*wind\u0101\" &gt; \"*gw\u026ann\", feminine \"*gwenn\" &gt; Welsh \"gwyn\", feminine \"gwen\".\ni-affection.\nThere were two separate processes of i-affection in Brittonic, both causing fronting of vowels: final i-affection and internal i-affection.\nFinal i-affection occurred when the penultimate short vowels \"*a\", \"*e\", \"*o\", \"*u\" were followed by Proto-Celtic \"*i\", \"*\u012b\", and \"*\u016b\" in the very last syllable. The results are slightly different in three languages. \nSimplified summary of consonantal outcomes.\nThe regular consonantal sound changes from Proto-Celtic to Welsh, Cornish, and Breton are summarised in the following table. Where the graphemes have a different value from the corresponding IPA symbols, the IPA equivalent is indicated between slashes. V represents a vowel; C represents a consonant.\nRemnants in England and Scotland.\nPlace names and river names.\nThe principal legacy left behind in those territories from which the Brittonic languages were displaced is that of toponyms (place names) and hydronyms (names of rivers and other bodies of water). There are many Brittonic place names in lowland Scotland and in the parts of England where it is agreed that substantial Brittonic speakers remained (Brittonic names, apart from those of the former Romano-British towns, are scarce over most of England). Names derived (sometimes indirectly) from Brittonic include London, Penicuik, Perth, Aberdeen, York, Dorchester, Dover, and Colchester. Brittonic elements found in England include and for 'hill', while some such as \"co[o]mb[e]\" (from ) for 'small deep valley' and \"tor\" for 'hill, rocky headland' are examples of Brittonic words that were borrowed into English. Others reflect the presence of Britons such as Dumbarton \u2013 from the Scottish Gaelic meaning 'Fort of the Britons', and Walton meaning (in Anglo-Saxon) a 'settlement' where the 'Britons' still lived.\nThe number of Celtic river names in England generally increases from east to west, a map showing these being given by Jackson. These include Avon, Chew, Frome, Axe, Brue and Exe, but also river names containing the elements \"der-/dar-/dur-\" and \"-went\" e.g. Derwent, Darwen, Deer, Adur, Dour, Darent, and Went. These names exhibit multiple different Celtic roots. One is * 'water' (Breton , Cumbric , Welsh ), also found in the place-name Dover (attested in the Roman period as ); this is the source of rivers named Dour. Another is 'oak' or 'true' (Bret. , Cumb. , W. ), coupled with two agent suffixes, and ; this is the origin of Derwent, Darent, and Darwen (attested in the Roman period as ). The final root to be examined is . In Roman Britain, there were three tribal capitals named (modern Winchester, Caerwent, and Caistor St Edmunds), whose meaning was 'place, town'.\nBrittonicisms in English.\nSome, including J. R. R. Tolkien, have argued that Celtic has acted as a substrate to English for both the lexicon and syntax. It is generally accepted that Brittonic effects on English are lexically few, aside from toponyms, consisting of a small number of domestic and geographical words, which \"may\" include \"bin\", \"brock\", \"carr\", \"comb\", \"crag\" and \"tor\". Another legacy may be the sheep-counting system \"yan tan tethera\" in the north, in the traditionally Celtic areas of England such as Cumbria. Several words of Cornish origin are still in use in English as mining-related terms, including costean, gunnies, and vug.\nThose who argue against the theory of a more significant Brittonic influence than is widely accepted point out that many toponyms have no semantic continuation from the Brittonic language. A notable example is \"Avon\" which comes from the Celtic term for river or the Welsh term for river, , but was used by the English as a personal name. Likewise the River Ouse, Yorkshire, contains the Celtic word which merely means 'water' and the name of the river Trent simply comes from the Welsh word for a 'trespasser' (figuratively suggesting 'overflowing river').\nScholars supporting a Brittonic substrate in English argue that the use of periphrastic constructions (using auxiliary verbs such as \"do\" and \"be\" in the continuous/progressive) of the English verb, which is more widespread than in the other Germanic languages, is traceable to Brittonic influence. Others, however, find this unlikely since many of these forms are only attested in the later Middle English period; these scholars claim a native English development rather than Celtic influence. Ian G. Roberts postulates Northern Germanic influence, despite such constructions not existing in Norse. Literary Welsh has the simple present = 'I love' and the present stative (al. continuous/progressive) = 'I am loving', where the Brittonic syntax is partly mirrored in English. (However, English \"I am loving\" comes from older \"I am a-loving\", from still older 'I am in the process of loving'). In the Germanic sister languages of English, there is only one form, for example in German, though in \"colloquial\" usage in some German dialects, a progressive aspect form has evolved which is formally similar to those found in Celtic languages, and somewhat less similar to the Modern English form, e.g. 'I am working' is , literally: 'I am on the working'. The same structure is also found in modern Dutch (), alongside other structures (e.g. , lit. 'I sit to working'). These parallel developments suggest that the English progressive is not necessarily due to Celtic influence; moreover, the native English development of the structure can be traced over 1000 years and more of English literature.\nSome researchers (Filppula, et al., 2001) argue that other elements of English syntax reflect Brittonic influences. For instance, in English tag questions, the form of the tag depends on the verb form in the main statement (\"aren't I?\", \"isn't he?\", \"won't we?\", etc.). The German and the French , by contrast, are fixed forms which can be used with almost any main statement. It has been claimed that the English system has been borrowed from Brittonic, since Welsh tag questions vary in almost exactly the same way.\nBrittonic effect on the Goidelic languages.\nFar more notable, but less well known, are Brittonic influences on Scottish Gaelic, though Scottish and Irish Gaelic, with their wider range of preposition-based periphrastic constructions, suggest that such constructions descend from their common Celtic heritage. Scottish Gaelic contains several P-Celtic loanwords, but, as there is a far greater overlap in terms of Celtic vocabulary than with English, it is not always possible to disentangle P- and Q-Celtic words. However, some common words such as = Welsh , Cumbric are particularly evident.\nThe Brittonic influence on Scots Gaelic is often indicated by considering Irish language usage, which is not likely to have been influenced so much by Brittonic. In particular, the word (anglicised as \"strath\") is a native Goidelic word, but its usage appears to have been modified by the Welsh cognate whose meaning is slightly different.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The initial lineup, which recorded the majority of their hits, consisted of Scottish musicians Jimmy Somerville (vocals) and Steve Bronski (keyboards, percussion) and English musician Larry Steinbachek (keyboards, percussion). Simon Davolls contributed backing vocals to many songs. Throughout the band's career, Bronski was the only member to appear in every lineup. \nBronski Beat achieved success in the mid-1980s, particularly with the 1984 single \"Smalltown Boy\", from their debut album, \"The Age of Consent\". \"Smalltown Boy\" was their only US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 single. All members of the band were openly gay and their songs reflected this, often containing political commentary on gay issues. Somerville left Bronski Beat in 1985 and went on to have success as lead singer of the Communards and as a solo artist. He was replaced by vocalist John Foster, with whom the band continued to have hits in the UK and Europe through 1986. Foster left Bronski Beat after their second album, and the band were joined by Jonathan Hellyer before dissolving in 1995.\nSteve Bronski revived the band in 2016, recording new material with 1990s member Ian Donaldson. Steinbachek died later that year; Bronski died in 2021. As of 2025, Somerville is the last surviving member of the band's original lineup and one of six surviving members of the band. \nHistory.\n1983\u20131985: early years and \"The Age of Consent\".\nBronski Beat formed in 1983 when Jimmy Somerville, Steve Bronski (both from Glasgow) and Larry Steinbachek (from Southend, Essex) shared a three-bedroom flat at Lancaster House in Brixton, London. Steinbachek had heard Somerville singing during the making of \"\" and suggested they make some music. They first performed publicly at an arts festival, \"September in the Pink\". The trio were unhappy with the inoffensive nature of contemporary gay performers and sought to be more outspoken and political.\nBronski Beat signed a recording contract with London Records in 1984 after doing only nine live gigs. The band's debut single, \"Smalltown Boy\", about a gay teenager leaving his family and fleeing his home town, was a hit, peaking at No 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and topping charts in Belgium and the Netherlands. The single was accompanied by a promotional video directed by Bernard Rose, showing Somerville trying to befriend an attractive diver at a swimming pool, then being attacked by the diver's homophobic associates, being returned to his family by the police and having to leave home. (The police officer was played by Colin Bell, then the marketing manager of London Records.) \"Smalltown Boy\" reached 48 in the U.S. chart and peaked at 8 in Australia.\nThe follow-up single, \"Why?\", adopted a hi-NRG sound and was more lyrically focused on anti-gay prejudice. It also achieved Top 10 status in the UK, reaching 6, and was another Top 10 hit for the band in Australia, Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands.\nAt the end of 1984, the trio released an album titled \"The Age of Consent\". The inner sleeve listed the varying ages of consent for consensual gay sex in different nations around the world. At the time, the age of consent for sexual acts between men in the UK was 21 compared with 16 for heterosexual acts, with several other countries having more liberal laws on gay sex. The album peaked at 4 in the UK Albums Chart, 36 in the U.S., and 12 in Australia.\nAround the same time, the band headlined \"Pits and Perverts\", a concert at the Electric Ballroom in London to raise funds for the Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners campaign. This event is featured in the film \"Pride\".\nThe third single, released before Christmas 1984, was a revival of \"It Ain't Necessarily So\", the George and Ira Gershwin classic (from \"Porgy and Bess\"). The song questions the accuracy of biblical tales. It also reached the UK Top 20.\nIn 1985, the trio joined up with Marc Almond to record a version of Donna Summer's \"I Feel Love\". The full version was actually a medley that also incorporated snippets of Summer's \"Love to Love You Baby\" and John Leyton's \"Johnny Remember Me\". It was a big success, reaching 3 in the UK and equalling the chart achievement of \"Smalltown Boy\". Although the original had been one of Marc Almond's all-time favourite songs, he had never read the lyrics and thus incorrectly sang \"What\u2019ll it be, what\u2019ll it be, you and me\" instead of \"Falling free, falling free, falling free\" on the finished record.\nThe band and their producer Mike Thorne had gone back into the studio in early 1985 to record a new single, \"Run from Love\", and PolyGram (London Records' parent company at that time) had pressed a number of promo singles and 12\" versions of the song and sent them to radio and record stores in the UK. However, the single was shelved as tensions in the band, both personal and political, resulted in Somerville leaving Bronski Beat in the summer of that year.\n\"Run from Love\" was subsequently released in remix form on the Bronski Beat album \"Hundreds &amp; Thousands\", a collection of mostly remixes (LP) and B-sides (as bonus tracks on the CD version) as well as the hit \"I Feel Love\". Somerville went on to form the Communards with Richard Coles while the remaining members of Bronski Beat searched for a new vocalist.\n1985\u20131995: Somerville's departure, John Foster and Jonathan Hellyer eras.\nBronski Beat recruited John Foster as Somerville's replacement (Foster is credited as \"Jon Jon\"). A single, \"Hit That Perfect Beat\", was released in November 1985, reaching 3 in the UK. It repeated this success on the Australian chart and was also featured in the film \"Letter to Brezhnev\". A second single, \"C'mon C'mon\", also charted in the UK Top 20 and an album, \"Truthdare Doubledare\", released in May 1986, peaked at 18. The film \"Parting Glances\" (1986) included Bronski Beat songs \"Love and Money\", \"Smalltown Boy\" and \"Why?\" During this period, the band teamed up with producer Mark Cunningham on the first-ever BBC Children In Need single, a cover of David Bowie's \"Heroes\", released in 1986 under the name of The County Line.\nFoster left the band in 1987. Following Foster's departure, Bronski Beat began work on their next album, \"Out and About\". The tracks were recorded at Berry Street studios in London with engineer Brian Pugsley. Some of the song titles were \"The Final Spin\" and \"Peace and Love\". The latter track featured Strawberry Switchblade vocalist Rose McDowall and appeared on several internet sites in 2006. One of the other songs from the project called \"European Boy\" was recorded in 1987 by disco group Splash. The lead singer of Splash was former Tight Fit singer Steve Grant. Steinbachek and Bronski toured extensively with the new material with positive reviews, however the project was abandoned as the group was dropped by London Records. Also in 1987, Bronski Beat and Somerville performed at a reunion concert for \"International AIDS Day\", supported by New Order, at the Brixton Academy, London.\nIn 1989, Jonathan Hellyer became lead singer, and the band extensively toured the U.S. and Europe with back-up vocalist Annie Conway. They achieved one minor hit with the song \"Cha Cha Heels\", a one-off collaboration sung by American actress and singer Eartha Kitt, which peaked at 32 in the UK. The song was originally written for movie and recording star Divine, who was unable to record the song before his death in 1988. 1990\u201391 saw Bronski Beat release three further singles on the Zomba record label, \"I'm Gonna Run Away\", \"One More Chance\" and \"What More Can I Say\". The singles were produced by Mike Thorne.\nFoster and Bronski Beat teamed up again in 1994, and released a techno \"Tell Me Why '94\" and an acoustic \"Smalltown Boy '94\" on the German record label, ZYX Music. The album \"Rainbow Nation\" was released the following year with Hellyer returning as lead vocalist, as Foster had dropped out of the project and Ian Donaldson was brought on board to do keyboards and programming. After a few years of touring, Bronski Beat then dissolved, with Steve Bronski going on to become a producer for other artists and Ian Donaldson becoming a successful DJ (Sordid Soundz). Larry Steinbachek became the musical director for Michael Laub's theatre company, 'Remote Control Productions'.\n2007\u20132016: Bronski solo activities and resurrection of Bronski Beat.\nIn 2007, Steve Bronski remixed the song \"Stranger to None\" by the UK alternative rock band, All Living Fear. Four different mixes were made, with one appearing on their retrospective album, \"Fifteen Years After\". Bronski also remixed the track \"Flowers in the Morning\" by Northern Irish electronic band Electrobronze in 2007, changing the style of the song from classical to Hi-NRG disco.\nIn 2015, Steve Bronski teamed up as a one-off with Jessica James (aka Barbara Bush) and said that she reminded him of Divine, because of her look and Eartha Kitt-like sound. The one-off project was to cover the track he made in 1989.\nIn 2016, Steve Bronski again teamed up with Ian Donaldson, with the aim of bringing Bronski Beat back, enlisting a new singer, Stephen Granville. In 2017, the new Bronski Beat released a reworked version of \"Age of Consent\" entitled \"Age of Reason\". \"Out &amp; About\", the unreleased Bronski Beat album from 1987, was released digitally via Steve Bronski's website. The album features the original tracks plus remixes by Bronski.\n2017\u2013present: deaths of Steinbachek and Bronski.\nOn 12 January 2017, it was revealed that Steinbachek had died the previous month after a short battle with cancer, with his family and friends at his bedside. He was 56. Bronski died on 7 December 2021, at the age of 61, in a Central London flat fire.\nAwards and nominations.\n! Year !! Awards !! Work !! Category !! Result !!

{"id": "4077", "revid": "160367", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4077", "title": "Binary prefix", "text": "Prefix indicating a power of two\nA binary prefix is a unit prefix that indicates a multiple of a unit of measurement by an integer power of two. The most commonly used binary prefixes are kibi (symbol Ki, meaning 210 = 1024), mebi (Mi, 220 =), and gibi (Gi, 230 =). They are most often used in information technology as multipliers of bit and byte, when expressing the capacity of storage devices or the size of computer files.\nThe binary prefixes \"kibi\", \"mebi\", etc. were defined in 1999 by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), in the IEC 60027-2 standard (Amendment 2). They were meant to replace the metric (SI) decimal power prefixes, such as \"kilo\" (k, 103 = 1000), \"mega\" (M, 106 =) and \"giga\" (G, 109 =), that were commonly used in the computer industry to indicate the nearest powers of two. For example, a memory module whose capacity was specified by the manufacturer as \"2\u00a0megabytes\" or \"2\u00a0MB\" would hold 2 \u00d7 220 = bytes, instead of 2 \u00d7 106 = .\nOn the other hand, a hard disk whose capacity is specified by the manufacturer as \"10 gigabytes\" or \"10\u00a0GB\", holds 10 \u00d7 109 = bytes, or a little more than that, but less than 10 \u00d7 230 = and a file whose size is listed as \"2.3\u00a0GB\" may have a size closer to 2.3 \u00d7 230 \u2248 or to 2.3 \u00d7 109 = , depending on the program or operating system providing that measurement. This kind of ambiguity is often confusing to computer system users and has resulted in lawsuits. The IEC 60027-2 binary prefixes have been incorporated in the standard and are supported by other standards bodies, including the BIPM, which defines the SI system, the US NIST, and the European Union.\nPrior to the 1999 IEC standard, some industry organizations, such as the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC), noted the common use of the terms \"kilobyte\", \"megabyte\", and \"gigabyte\", and the corresponding symbols \"KB\", \"MB\", and \"GB\" in the binary sense, for use in storage capacity measurements. However, other computer industry sectors (such as magnetic storage) continued using those same terms and symbols with the decimal meaning. Since then, the major standards organizations have expressly disapproved the use of SI prefixes to denote binary multiples, and recommended or mandated the use of the IEC prefixes for that purpose, but the use of SI prefixes in this sense has persisted in some fields.\nDefinitions.\nIn 2022, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) adopted the decimal prefixes \"ronna\" for 10009 and \"quetta\" for 100010. In 2025, the prefixes \"robi\" (Ri, 10249) and \"quebi\" (Qi, 102410) were adopted by the IEC.\nComparison of binary and decimal prefixes.\nThe relative difference between the values in the binary and decimal interpretations increases, when using the SI prefixes as the base, from 2.4% for kibi vs. kilo to nearly 27% for the quebi vs. quetta.\nHistory.\nEarly prefixes.\nThere are several numeral prefixes in the English language that are binary prefixes, such as \"semi-\", \"hemi-\", \"di-\", \"tetra-\" and \"octo-\".\nThe original metric system adopted by France in 1795 included two binary prefixes named \"double-\" (2\u00d7) and \"demi-\" (\u00d7). However, these were not retained when the SI prefixes were internationally adopted by the 11th CGPM conference in 1960.\nStorage capacity.\nMain memory.\nEarly computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base 2) or decimal (base 10). For example, the IBM 701 (1952) used a binary methods and could address 2048 words of 36 bits each, while the IBM 702 (1953) used a decimal system, and could address ten thousand 7-bit words.\nBy the mid-1960s, binary addressing had become the standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two. This is the most natural configuration for memory, as all combinations of states of their address lines map to a valid address, allowing easy aggregation into a larger block of memory with contiguous addresses.\nWhile early documentation specified those memory sizes as exact numbers such as 4096, 8192, or units (usually words, bytes, or bits), computer professionals also started using the long-established metric system prefixes \"kilo\", \"mega\", \"giga\", etc., defined to be powers of 10, to mean instead the nearest powers of two; namely, 210 = 1024, 220 = 10242, 230 = 10243, etc. The corresponding metric prefix symbols (\"k\", \"M\", \"G\", etc.) were used with the same binary meanings. The symbol for 210 = 1024 could be written either in lower case (\"k\") or in uppercase (\"K\"). The latter was often used intentionally to indicate the binary rather than decimal meaning. This convention, which could not be extended to higher powers, was widely used in the documentation of the IBM\u00a0360 (1964) and of the IBM System/370 (1972), of the CDC\u00a07600, of the DEC PDP-11/70 (1975) and of the DEC VAX-11/780 (1977).\nIn other documents, however, the metric prefixes and their symbols were used to denote powers of 10, but usually with the understanding that the values given were approximate, often truncated down. Thus, for example, a 1967 document by Control Data Corporation (CDC) abbreviated \"216 = 64 \u00d7 1024 = words\" as \"65K words\" (rather than \"64K\" or \"66K\"), while the documentation of the HP 21MX real-time computer (1974) denoted 3 \u00d7 216 = 192 \u00d7 1024 = as \"196K\" and 220 = as \"1M\".\nThese three possible meanings of \"k\" and \"K\" (\"1024\", \"1000\", or \"approximately 1000\") were used loosely around the same time, sometimes by the same company. The HP 3000 business computer (1973) could have \"64K\", \"96K\", or \"128K\" bytes of memory. The use of SI prefixes, and the use of \"K\" instead of \"k\" remained popular in computer-related publications well into the 21st century, although the ambiguity persisted. The correct meaning was often clear from the context; for instance, in a binary-addressed computer, the true memory size had to be either a power of 2, or a small integer multiple thereof. Thus a \"512 megabyte\" RAM module was generally understood to have 512 \u00d7 10242 = bytes, rather than .\nHard disks.\nIn specifying disk drive capacities, manufacturers have always used conventional decimal SI prefixes representing powers of 10. Storage in a rotating disk drive is organized in platters and tracks whose sizes and counts are determined by mechanical engineering constraints so that the capacity of a disk drive has hardly ever been a simple multiple of a power of 2. For example, the first commercially sold disk drive, the IBM 350 (1956), had 50 physical disk platters containing a total of sectors of 100 characters each, for a total quoted capacity of 5 million characters.\nMoreover, since the 1960s, many disk drives used IBM's disk format, where each track was divided into blocks of user-specified size; and the block sizes were recorded on the disk, subtracting from the usable capacity. For example, the IBM 3336 disk pack was quoted to have a 200-megabyte capacity, achieved only with a single -byte block in each of its 808 \u00d7 19 tracks.\nDecimal megabytes were used for disk capacity by the CDC in 1974. The Seagate ST-412, one of several types installed in the IBM PC/XT, had a capacity of when formatted as 306 \u00d7 4 tracks and 32 256-byte sectors per track, which was quoted as \"10\u00a0MB\". Similarly, a \"300\u00a0GB\" hard drive can be expected to offer only slightly more than = , bytes, not 300 \u00d7 230 (which would be about bytes or \"322\u00a0GB\"). The first terabyte (SI prefix, bytes) hard disk drive was introduced in 2007. Decimal prefixes were generally used by information processing publications when comparing hard disk capacities.\nSome programs and operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, still use \"MB\" and \"GB\" to denote binary prefixes even when displaying disk drive capacities and file sizes, as did Classic Mac OS. Thus, for example, the capacity of a \"10 MB\" (decimal \"M\") disk drive could be reported as \"9.56 MB\", and that of a \"300\u00a0GB\" drive as \"279.4\u00a0GB\". Some operating systems, such as Mac OS X, Ubuntu, and Debian, have been updated to use \"MB\" and \"GB\" to denote decimal prefixes when displaying disk drive capacities and file sizes. Some manufacturers, such as Seagate Technology, have released recommendations stating that properly-written software and documentation should specify clearly whether prefixes such as \"K\", \"M\", or \"G\" mean binary or decimal multipliers.\nFloppy disks.\nFloppy disks used a variety of formats, and their capacities were usually specified with SI-like prefixes \"K\" and \"M\" with either decimal or binary meaning. The capacity of the disks was often specified without accounting for the internal formatting overhead, leading to more irregularities.\nThe early 8-inch diskette formats could contain less than a megabyte with the capacities of those devices specified in kilobytes, kilobits or megabits.\nThe 5.25-inch diskette sold with the IBM PC AT could hold 1200 \u00d7 1024 = bytes, and thus was marketed as \"1200\u00a0KB\" with the binary sense of \"KB\". However, the capacity was also quoted \"1.2\u00a0MB\", which was a hybrid decimal and binary notation, since the \"M\" meant 1000 \u00d7 1024. The precise value was (decimal) or (binary).\nThe 5.25-inch Apple Disk II had 256 bytes per sector, 13 sectors per track, 35 tracks per side, or a total capacity of bytes. It was later upgraded to 16 sectors per track, giving a total of 140 \u00d7 210 = bytes, which was described as \"140KB\" using the binary sense of \"K\".\nThe most recent version of the physical hardware, the \"3.5-inch diskette\" cartridge, had 720 512-byte blocks (single-sided). Since two blocks comprised 1024 bytes, the capacity was quoted \"360\u00a0KB\", with the binary sense of \"K\". On the other hand, the quoted capacity of \"1.44\u00a0MB\" of the High Density (\"HD\") version was again a hybrid decimal and binary notation, since it meant 1440 pairs of 512-byte sectors, or 1440 \u00d7 210 = . Some operating systems displayed the capacity of those disks using the binary sense of \"MB\", as \"1.4\u00a0MB\" (which would be 1.4 \u00d7 220 \u2248 ). User complaints forced both Apple and Microsoft to issue support bulletins explaining the discrepancy.\nOptical disks.\nWhen specifying the capacities of optical compact discs, \"megabyte\" and \"MB\" usually meant 10242\u00a0bytes. Thus a \"700-MB\" (or \"80-minute\") CD has a nominal capacity of about , which is approximately (decimal).\nOn the other hand, capacities of other optical disc storage media like DVD, Blu-ray Disc, HD DVD and magneto-optical (MO) have been generally specified in decimal gigabytes (\"GB\"), that is, 10003 bytes. In particular, a typical \"\" DVD has a nominal capacity of about , which is about .\nTape drives and media.\nTape drive and media manufacturers have generally used SI decimal prefixes to specify the maximum capacity, although the actual capacity would depend on the block size used when recording.\nData and clock rates.\nComputer clock frequencies are always quoted using SI prefixes in their decimal sense. For example, the internal clock frequency of the original IBM PC was , that is .\nSimilarly, digital information transfer rates are quoted using decimal prefixes. The Parallel ATA \" disk interface can transfer bytes per second, and a \" modem transmits bits per second. Seagate specified the sustained transfer rate of some hard disk drive models with both decimal and IEC binary prefixes. \nThe standard sampling rate of music compact disks, quoted as , is indeed samples per second. A \"\" Ethernet interface can receive or transmit up to 109 bits per second, or bytes per second within each packet. A \"56k\" modem can encode or decode up to bits per second.\nDecimal SI prefixes are also generally used for processor-memory data transfer speeds. A PCI-X bus with clock and 64 bits wide can transfer 64-bit words per second, or = , which is usually quoted as . A PC3200 memory on a double data rate bus, transferring 8 bytes per cycle with a clock speed of has a bandwidth of \u00d7 8 \u00d7 2 = , which would be quoted as .\nAmbiguous standards.\nThe ambiguous usage of the prefixes \"kilo (\"K\" or \"k\"), \"mega\" (\"M\"), and \"giga\" (\"G\"), as meaning both powers of 1000 or (in computer contexts) of 1024, has been recorded in popular dictionaries, and even in some obsolete standards, such as ANSI/IEEE\u00a01084-1986 and ANSI/IEEE\u00a01212-1991, IEEE\u00a0610.10-1994, and IEEE\u00a0100-2000. Some of these standards specifically limited the binary meaning to multiples of \"byte\" (\"B\") or \"bit\" (\"b\").\nEarly binary prefix proposals.\nBefore the IEC standard, several alternative proposals existed for unique binary prefixes, starting in the late 1960s. In 1996, Markus Kuhn proposed the extra prefix \"di\" and the symbol suffix or subscript \"2\" to mean \"binary\"; so that, for example, \"one dikilobyte\" would mean \"1024 bytes\", denoted \"K2B\" or \"K2B\".\nIn 1968, Donald Morrison proposed to use the Greek letter kappa (\u03ba) to denote 1024, \u03ba2 to denote 10242, and so on. (At the time, memory size was small, and only K was in widespread use.) In the same year, Wallace Givens responded with a suggestion to use bK as an abbreviation for 1024 and bK2 or bK2 for 10242, though he noted that neither the Greek letter nor lowercase letter b would be easy to reproduce on computer printers of the day. Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory proposed that, instead of prefixes, binary powers of two were indicated by the letter B followed by the exponent, similar to E in decimal scientific notation. Thus one would write 3B20 for 3 \u00d7 220. This convention is still used on some calculators to present binary floating point-numbers today.\nIn 1969, Donald Knuth, who uses decimal notation like 1\u00a0MB = 1000\u00a0kB, proposed that the powers of 1024 be designated as \"large kilobytes\" and \"large megabytes\", with abbreviations KKB and MMB.\nConsumer confusion.\nThe ambiguous meanings of \"kilo\", \"mega\", \"giga\", etc., has caused significant consumer confusion, especially in the personal computer era. A common source of confusion was the discrepancy between the capacities of hard drives specified by manufacturers, using those prefixes in the decimal sense, and the numbers reported by operating systems and other software, that used them in the binary sense, such as the Apple Macintosh in 1984. For example, a hard drive marketed as \"1\u00a0TB\" could be reported as having only \"931\u00a0GB\". The confusion was compounded by fact that RAM manufacturers used the binary sense too.\nLegal disputes.\nThe different interpretations of disk size prefixes led to class action lawsuits against digital storage manufacturers. These cases involved both flash memory and hard disk drives.\nEarly cases.\nEarly cases (2004\u20132007) were settled prior to any court ruling with the manufacturers admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to clarify the storage capacity of their products on the consumer packaging. Accordingly, many flash memory and hard disk manufacturers have disclosures on their packaging and web sites clarifying the formatted capacity of the devices or defining MB as 1\u00a0million bytes and 1\u00a0GB as 1\u00a0billion bytes.\n\"Willem Vroegh v. Eastman Kodak Company\".\nOn 20 February 2004, Willem Vroegh filed a lawsuit against Lexar Media, Dane\u2013Elec Memory, Fuji Photo Film USA, Eastman Kodak Company, Kingston Technology Company, Inc., Memorex Products, Inc.; PNY Technologies Inc., SanDisk Corporation, Verbatim Corporation, and Viking Interworks alleging that their descriptions of the capacity of their flash memory cards were false and misleading.\nVroegh claimed that a 256\u00a0MB Flash Memory Device had only 244\u00a0MB of accessible memory. \"Plaintiffs allege that Defendants marketed the memory capacity of their products by assuming that one megabyte equals one million bytes and one gigabyte equals one billion bytes.\" The plaintiffs wanted the defendants to use the customary values of 10242 for megabyte and 10243 for gigabyte. The plaintiffs acknowledged that the IEC and IEEE standards define a MB as one million bytes but stated that the industry has largely ignored the IEC standards.\nThe parties agreed that manufacturers could continue to use the decimal definition so long as the definition was added to the packaging and web sites. The consumers could apply for \"a discount of ten percent off a future online purchase from Defendants' Online Stores Flash Memory Device\".\n\"Orin Safier v. Western Digital Corporation\".\nOn 7 July 2005, an action entitled \"Orin Safier v. Western Digital Corporation, et al.\" was filed in the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco, Case No. CGC-05-442812. The case was subsequently moved to the Northern District of California, Case No. 05-03353 BZ.\nAlthough Western Digital maintained that their usage of units is consistent with \"the indisputably correct industry standard for measuring and describing storage capacity\", and that they \"cannot be expected to reform the software industry\", they agreed to settle in March 2006 with 14 June 2006 as the Final Approval hearing date.\nWestern Digital offered to compensate customers with a gratis download of backup and recovery software that they valued at US$30. They also paid in fees and expenses to San Francisco lawyers Adam Gutride and Seth Safier, who filed the suit. The settlement called for Western Digital to add a disclaimer to their later packaging and advertising.\nWestern Digital had this footnote in their settlement. \"Apparently, Plaintiff believes that he could sue an egg company for fraud for labeling a carton of 12 eggs a 'dozen', because some bakers would view a 'dozen' as including 13 items.\"\n\"Cho v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc.\".\nA lawsuit (\"Cho v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc.\", San Francisco Superior Court, Case No. CGC-06-453195) was filed against Seagate Technology, alleging that Seagate overrepresented the amount of usable storage by 7% on hard drives sold between 22 March 2001 and 26 September 2007. The case was settled without Seagate admitting wrongdoing, but agreeing to supply those purchasers with gratis backup software or a 5% refund on the cost of the drives.\n\"Dinan et al. v. SanDisk LLC\".\nOn 22 January 2020, the district court of the Northern District of California ruled in favor of the defendant, SanDisk, upholding its use of \"GB\" to mean . The Ninth Circuit affirmed in February 2021.\nIEC 1999 Standard.\nIn 1995, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry's (IUPAC) Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IDCNS) proposed the prefixes \"kibi\" (short for \"kilobinary\"), \"mebi\" (\"megabinary\"), \"gibi\" (\"gigabinary\") and \"tebi\" (\"terabinary\"), with respective symbols \"kb\", \"Mb\", \"Gb\" and \"Tb\", for binary multipliers. The proposal suggested that the SI prefixes should be used only for powers of 10; so that a disk drive capacity of \"500 gigabytes\", \"0.5 terabytes\", \"500\u00a0GB\", or \"0.5\u00a0TB\" should all mean , exactly or approximately, rather than 500 \u00d7 230 (=\u00a0) or 0.5 \u00d7 240 (=\u00a0).\nThe proposal was not accepted by IUPAC at the time, but was taken up in 1996 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in collaboration with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The prefixes \"kibi\", \"mebi\", \"gibi\" and \"tebi\" were retained, but with the symbols \"Ki\" (with capital \"K\"), \"Mi\", \"Gi\" and \"Ti\" respectively.\nIn January 1999, the IEC published this proposal, with additional prefixes \"pebi\" (\"Pi\") and \"exbi\" (\"Ei\"), as an international standard (IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2) The standard reaffirmed the BIPM's position that the SI prefixes should always denote powers of 10. The third edition of the standard, published in 2005, added prefixes \"zebi\" and \"yobi\", thus matching all then-defined SI prefixes with binary counterparts.\nThe harmonized ISO/IEC IEC 80000-13:2025 standard cancels and replaces subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005 (those defining prefixes for binary multiples). The only significant change is the addition of explicit definitions for some quantities. In 2009, the prefixes kibi-, mebi-, etc. were defined by ISO 80000-1 in their own right, independently of the kibibyte, mebibyte, and so on.\nThe BIPM standard JCGM 200:2012 \"International vocabulary of metrology \u2013 Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM), 3rd edition\" lists the IEC binary prefixes and states \"SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10, and should not be used for powers of 2. For example, 1 kilobit should not be used to represent bits (210\u00a0bits), which is 1 kibibit.\"\nThe IEC 60027-2 standard recommended operating systems and other software were updated to use binary or decimal prefixes consistently, but incorrect usage of SI prefixes for binary multiples is still common. At the time, the IEEE decided that their standards would use the prefixes \"kilo\", etc. with their metric definitions, but allowed the binary definitions to be used in an interim period as long as such usage was explicitly pointed out on a case-by-case basis.\nOther standards bodies and organizations.\nThe IEC standard binary prefixes are supported by other standardization bodies and technical organizations.\nThe United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) supports the ISO/IEC standards for\n\"Prefixes for binary multiples\" and has a web page documenting them, describing and justifying their use. NIST suggests that in English, the first syllable of the name of the binary-multiple prefix should be pronounced in the same way as the first syllable of the name of the corresponding SI prefix, and that the second syllable should be pronounced as \"bee\". NIST has stated the SI prefixes \"refer strictly to powers of 10\" and that the binary definitions \"should not be used\" for them.\nAs of 2014, the microelectronics industry standards body JEDEC describes the IEC prefixes in its online dictionary, but acknowledges that the SI prefixes and the symbols \"K\", \"M\" and \"G\" are still commonly used with the binary sense for memory sizes.\nOn 19 March 2005, the IEEE standard IEEE 1541-2002 (\"Prefixes for Binary Multiples\") was elevated to a full-use standard by the IEEE Standards Association after a two-year trial period. as of \u00a02008[ [update]], the IEEE Publications division does not require the use of IEC prefixes in its major magazines such as \"Spectrum\" or \"Computer\". \nThe International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM), which maintains the International System of Units (SI), expressly prohibits the use of SI prefixes to denote binary multiples, and recommends the use of the IEC prefixes as an alternative since units of information are not included in the SI.\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) prohibits the use of SI prefixes with anything but a power-of-1000 meaning, but does not cite the IEC binary prefixes.\nThe European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) adopted the IEC-recommended binary prefixes via the harmonization document HD\u00a060027-2:2003-03. The European Union (EU) has required the use of the IEC binary prefixes since 2007.\nCurrent practice.\nSome computer industry participants, such as Hewlett-Packard (HP), and IBM have adopted or recommended IEC binary prefixes as part of their general documentation policies.\nAs of 2023, the use of SI prefixes with the binary meanings is still prevalent for specifying the capacity of the main memory of computers, of RAM, ROM, EPROM, and EEPROM chips and memory modules, and of the cache of computer processors. For example, a \"512-megabyte\" or \"512\u00a0MB\" memory module holds 512\u00a0MiB; that is, 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0220 bytes, not 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 bytes.\nJEDEC continues to include the customary binary definitions of \"kilo\", \"mega\", and \"giga\" in the document \"Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols\", and, as of 2010[ [update]], still used those definitions in their memory standards.\nOn the other hand, the SI prefixes with powers of ten meanings are generally used for the capacity of external storage units, such as disk drives, solid state drives, and USB flash drives, except for some flash memory chips intended to be used as EEPROMs. However, some disk manufacturers have used the IEC prefixes to avoid confusion. The decimal meaning of SI prefixes is usually also intended in measurements of data transfer rates, and clock speeds.\nSome operating systems and other software use either the IEC binary multiplier symbols (\"Ki\", \"Mi\", etc.) or the SI multiplier symbols (\"k\", \"M\", \"G\", etc.) with decimal meaning. Some programs, such as the GNU ls command, let the user choose between binary or decimal multipliers. However, some continue to use the SI symbols with the binary meanings, even when reporting disk or file sizes. Some programs may also use \"K\" instead of \"k\", with either meaning.\nOther uses.\nWhile the binary prefixes are predominantly used with units of data, bits and bytes, they may be used with other unit of measure. For example, in signal processing it may be convenient to use a binary prefix with the unit of frequency, hertz (Hz), to produce a unit such as the kibihertz (KiHz), which is equal to , or mebihertz (MiHz), equal to ."}

It serves as the central collection and gathering space for the history of baseball in the United States displaying baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, honoring those who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is \"Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations\". Cooperstown is often used as shorthand (or a metonym) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The museum also established and manages the process for honorees into the Hall of Fame.\nThe Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by Stephen Carlton Clark, heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune. Clark sought to bring tourists to the village hurt by the Great Depression, which reduced the local tourist trade, and Prohibition, which devastated the local hops industry. Clark constructed the Hall of Fame's building, which was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (His granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the board of directors.) The mythology that future Civil War hero Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown in the 1830s was instrumental in the placement and early marketing of the Hall.\nAn expanded library and research facility opened in 1994. Dale Petroskey became the organization's president in 1999. In 2002, the Hall launched \"Baseball as America\", a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\nInductees.\nAmong baseball fans, \"Hall of Fame\" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, managers, umpires, executives, and pioneers who have been inducted into the Hall. The first five men elected were Ty Cobb, Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson, chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. As of \u00a02025[ [update]], 351 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 278 former professional players, 23 managers, 10 umpires, and 40 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 119 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 39 members primarily recognized for their contributions to Negro league baseball, 31 were inducted posthumously, including all 26 selected since the 1990s. The Hall of Fame includes one woman, baseball executive Effa Manley.\nThe newest members of the Hall of Fame as of January 21, 2025, are Dick Allen, Dave Parker, CC Sabathia, Ichiro Suzuki, and Billy Wagner.\nIn 2019, former Yankees closer Mariano Rivera became the first player to be elected unanimously on the writers' ballot. Derek Jeter, Marvin Miller, Ted Simmons, and Larry Walker were to be inducted in 2020, but their induction ceremony was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic until September 8, 2021. The ceremony was open to the public, as COVID restrictions had been lifted.\nSelection process.\nPlayers are currently inducted into the Hall of Fame through election by either the Baseball Writers' Association of America (or BBWAA), or the Veterans Committee, which now consists of four subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election). From a final ballot typically including 25\u201340 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee. Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).\nUnder special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. Addie Joss was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. Roberto Clemente set the precedent: the writers put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972, and he was inducted in 1973.\nThe five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; Joe DiMaggio received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although those who had already been eligible under the old rule were grandfathered into the ballot, thus permitting Joe DiMaggio to be elected within four years of his retirement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Lineup for Yesterday\"\n\"Z is for Zenith\"\"The summit of fame.\"\"These men are up there.\"\"These men are the game.\"\n \u2014 Ogden Nash, \"Sport\" magazine (January 1949) \nContrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for Lou Gehrig (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was terminally ill, making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.\nIf a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his eligibility for election, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, the Veterans Committee is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot \u2014 both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). From 2011 to 2016, each candidate could be considered once every three years; now, the frequency depends on the era in which an individual made his greatest contributions. A more complete discussion of the new process is available below.\nFrom 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:\nPlayers of the Negro leagues have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005, the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871\u20131946 era, called the \"Pre-Integration Era\" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the \"Early Baseball\" era (1871\u20131949).\nPredictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, Bill James' 1994 book \"Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?\" goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.\nNon-induction of banned players.\nThe selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's \"permanently ineligible\" list. Until they were removed from the list in 2025 the most prominent former players to be affected were Pete Rose and \"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson\u2014many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose. Jackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on games involving their own teams.\nJackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to intentionally lose the 1919 World Series, and for accepting payment for losing, although his actual level of culpability is fiercely debated. The ensuing Black Sox Scandal led directly to baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, which mandates permanent banishment from MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player, manager or umpire is directly involved.\nRose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the Cincinnati Reds when he was their manager in the 1980s. No credible evidence has ever emerged to support allegations that Rose bet against his team and/or that his betting influenced his managerial decisions, nevertheless, the betting constituted a clear violation of the aforementioned Rule 21. After years of denial, Rose admitted that he bet on the Reds in his 2004 autobiography \"My Prison Without Bars\".\nBefore the ban was lifted in 2025, baseball fans were deeply split on the issue of whether Rose and/or Jackson (both deceased) should remain banned or have their punishments posthumously revoked. Writer Bill James, though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to \"those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer\".\nChanges to Veterans Committee process.\nThe actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.\nIn 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees. The revamped Committee held three elections, in 2003 and 2007, for both players and non-players, and in 2005 for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt noted, \"The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors.\" In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.\nIn the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the 2008 election process. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the 2009 election process; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre\u2013World War II players elected Joe Gordon in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.\nFurther changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall in July 2010, July 2016, and April 2022.\nCurrent structure.\nPer the latest changes, announced on April 22, 2022, the multiple eras previously utilized were collapsed to three, to be voted on in an annual rotation (one per year):\nA one-year waiting period beyond potential BBWAA eligibility (which had been abolished in 2016) was reintroduced, thus restricting the committee to considering players retired for at least 16 seasons.\nEligibility.\nThe eligibility criteria for Era Committee consideration differ between players, managers, and executives.\nPlayers and managers with multiple teams.\nWhile the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a \"primary team\", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo \"based on where that player makes his most indelible mark.\"\nAlthough the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:\nIn all of the above cases, the \"primary team\" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.\nIn 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though Wade Boggs denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.) The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:\nA further update to the cap policy was introduced in 2018 that stated that the Hall of Fame would no longer make plaques for former Cleveland Indians players with them wearing the Chief Wahoo logo. This came after former Indians player Jim Thome specifically requested not to have Chief Wahoo on his plaque. Existing exhibits and plaques with the logo would remain in place.\nThe museum.\nSam Crane (who had played a decade in 19th century baseball before becoming a manager and sportswriter) had first approached the idea of making a memorial to the great players of the past in what was believed to have been the birthplace of baseball: Cooperstown, New York, but the idea did not muster much momentum until after his death in 1925. In 1934, the idea for establishing a Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum was devised by several individuals, such as Ford C. Frick (president of the National League) and Alexander Cleland, a Scottish immigrant who decided to serve as the first executive secretary for the Museum for the next seven years that worked with the interests of the Village and Major League Baseball. Stephen Carlton Clark (a Cooperstown native) paid for the construction of the museum, which was planned to open in 1939 to mark the \"Centennial of Baseball\", which included renovations to Doubleday Field. William Beattie served as the first curator of the museum.\nAccording to the Hall of Fame, approximately 260,000 visitors enter the museum each year, and the running total has surpassed 17\u00a0million. These visitors see only a fraction of its 40,000 artifacts, 3\u00a0million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 140,000 baseball cards.\nThe Hall has seen a noticeable decrease in attendance since the mid-2010s. A 2013 story on ESPN.com about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about away in the town of Hartwick. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,\nPrior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the recession and high gas prices among them), the Hall's attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened. The Hall drew 383,000 visitors in 1999. It drew 262,000 last year.\nNotable events.\n1982 unauthorized sales.\nA controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the Baseball Commissioner's office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of Joe Reichler, an assistant to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.\n2014 commemorative coins.\nIn 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the United States Mint to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall. The bill, , was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Richard Hanna, a Republican from New York, and passed the House on October 26, 2011. The coins, which depict baseball gloves and balls, are the first concave designs produced by the Mint. The mintage included 50,000 gold coins, 400,000 silver coins, and 750,000 clad (nickel-copper) coins. The Mint released them on March 27, 2014, and the gold and silver editions quickly sold out. The Hall receives money from surcharges included in the sale price: a total of $9.5\u00a0million if all the coins are sold.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

BPP also contains P, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with a deterministic machine, since a deterministic algorithm is a special case of a probabilistic algorithm.\nInformally, a problem is in BPP if there is an algorithm for it that has the following properties:\nDefinition.\nA language \"L\" is in BPP if and only if there exists a probabilistic Turing machine \"M\", such that\nUnlike the complexity class ZPP, the machine \"M\" is required to run for polynomial time on all inputs, regardless of the outcome of the random coin flips.\nAlternatively, BPP can be defined using only deterministic Turing machines. A language \"L\" is in BPP if and only if there exists a polynomial \"p\" and deterministic Turing machine \"M\", such that\nIn this definition, the string \"y\" corresponds to the output of the random coin flips that the probabilistic Turing machine would have made. For some applications this definition is preferable since it does not mention probabilistic Turing machines.\nIn practice, an error probability of 1/3 might not be acceptable; however, the choice of 1/3 in the definition is arbitrary. Modifying the definition to use any constant between 0 and 1/2 (exclusive) in place of 1/3 would not change the resulting set BPP. For example, if one defined the class with the restriction that the algorithm can be wrong with probability at most 1/2100, this would result in the same class of problems. The error probability does not even have to be constant: the same class of problems is defined by allowing error as high as 1/2 \u2212 \"n\"\u2212\"c\" on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2\u2212\"nc\" on the other hand, where \"c\" is any positive constant, and \"n\" is the length of input. This flexibility in the choice of error probability is based on the idea of running an error-prone algorithm many times, and using the majority result of the runs to obtain a more accurate algorithm. The chance that the majority of the runs are wrong drops off exponentially as a consequence of the Chernoff bound.\nProblems.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in computer science\nMore unsolved problems in computer science\nAll problems in P are obviously also in BPP. However, many problems have been known to be in BPP but not known to be in P. The number of such problems is decreasing, and it is conjectured that P = BPP.\nFor a long time, one of the most famous problems known to be in BPP but not known to be in P was the problem of determining whether a given number is prime. However, in the 2002 paper \"PRIMES is in P\", Manindra Agrawal and his students Neeraj Kayal and Nitin Saxena found a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, thus showing that it is in P.\nAn important example of a problem in BPP (in fact in co-RP) still not known to be in P is polynomial identity testing, the problem of determining whether a polynomial is identically equal to the zero polynomial, when you have access to the value of the polynomial for any given input, but not to the coefficients. In other words, is there an assignment of values to the variables such that when a nonzero polynomial is evaluated on these values, the result is nonzero? It suffices to choose each variable's value uniformly at random from a finite subset of at least \"d\" values to achieve bounded error probability, where \"d\" is the total degree of the polynomial.\nRelated classes.\nIf the access to randomness is removed from the definition of BPP, we get the complexity class P. In the definition of the class, if we replace the ordinary Turing machine with a quantum computer, we get the class BQP.\nAdding postselection to BPP, or allowing computation paths to have different lengths, gives the class BPPpath. BPPpath is known to contain NP, and it is contained in its quantum counterpart PostBQP.\nA Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm which is likely to be correct. Problems in the class BPP have Monte Carlo algorithms with polynomial bounded running time. This is compared to a Las Vegas algorithm which is a randomized algorithm which either outputs the correct answer, or outputs \"fail\" with low probability. Las Vegas algorithms with polynomial bound running times are used to define the class ZPP. Alternatively, ZPP contains probabilistic algorithms that are always correct and have expected polynomial running time. This is weaker than saying it is a polynomial time algorithm, since it may run for super-polynomial time, but with very low probability.\nComplexity-theoretic properties.\nIt is known that BPP is closed under complement; that is, BPP = co-BPP. BPP is low for itself, meaning that a BPP machine with the power to solve BPP problems instantly (a BPP oracle machine) is not any more powerful than the machine without this extra power. In symbols, BPPBPP = BPP.\nThe relationship between BPP and NP is unknown: it is not known whether BPP is a subset of NP, NP is a subset of BPP or neither. If NP is contained in BPP, which is considered unlikely since it would imply practical solutions for NP-complete problems, then NP = RP and PH \u2286 BPP.\nIt is known that RP is a subset of BPP, and BPP is a subset of PP. It is not known whether those two are strict subsets, since we don't even know if P is a strict subset of PSPACE. BPP is contained in the second level of the polynomial hierarchy and therefore it is contained in PH. More precisely, the Sipser\u2013Lautemann theorem states that formula_1. As a result, P = NP leads to P = BPP since PH collapses to P in this case. Thus either P = BPP or P \u2260 NP or both.\nAdleman's theorem states that membership in any language in BPP can be determined by a family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits, which means BPP is contained in P/poly. Indeed, as a consequence of the proof of this fact, every BPP algorithm operating on inputs of bounded length can be derandomized into a deterministic algorithm using a fixed string of random bits. Finding this string may be expensive, however. Some weak separation results for Monte Carlo time classes were proven by , see also .\nClosure properties.\nThe class BPP is closed under complementation, union, intersection, and concatenation.\nRelativization.\nRelative to oracles, we know that there exist oracles A and B, such that PA = BPPA and PB \u2260 BPPB. Moreover, relative to a random oracle with probability 1, P = BPP and BPP is strictly contained in NP and co-NP.\nThere is even an oracle in which &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; (and hence &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;), which can be iteratively constructed as follows. For a fixed ENP (relativized) complete problem, the oracle will give correct answers with high probability if queried with the problem instance followed by a random string of length \"kn\" (\"n\" is instance length; \"k\" is an appropriate small constant). Start with \"n\"=1. For every instance of the problem of length \"n\" fix oracle answers (see lemma below) to fix the instance output. Next, provide the instance outputs for queries consisting of the instance followed by \"kn\"-length string, and then treat output for queries of length \u2264(\"k\"+1)\"n\" as fixed, and proceed with instances of length \"n\"+1.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\nThe machine is simulated, and the oracle answers (that are not already fixed) are fixed step-by-step. There is at most one oracle query per deterministic computation step. For the relativized NP oracle, if possible fix the output to be yes by choosing a computation path and fixing the answers of the base oracle; otherwise no fixing is necessary, and either way there is at most 1 answer of the base oracle per step. Since there are 2\"O\"(\"n\") steps, the lemma follows.\nThe lemma ensures that (for a large enough \"k\"), it is possible to do the construction while leaving enough strings for the relativized answers. Also, we can ensure that for the relativized , linear time suffices, even for function problems (if given a function oracle and linear output size) and with exponentially small (with linear exponent) error probability. Also, this construction is effective in that given an arbitrary oracle A we can arrange the oracle B to have and EXPNPA=EXPNPB=BPPB. Also, for a oracle (and hence ), one would fix the answers in the relativized E computation to a special nonanswer, thus ensuring that no fake answers are given.\nDerandomization.\nThe existence of certain strong pseudorandom number generators is conjectured by most experts of the field. Such generators could replace true random numbers in any polynomial-time randomized algorithm, producing indistinguishable results. The conjecture that these generators exist implies that randomness does not give additional computational power to polynomial time computation, that is, P = RP = BPP. More strongly, the assumption that P = BPP is in some sense equivalent to the existence of strong pseudorandom number generators.\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai, Lance Fortnow, Noam Nisan, and Avi Wigderson showed that unless EXPTIME collapses to MA, BPP is contained in \nformula_2 \nThe class i.o.-SUBEXP, which stands for infinitely often SUBEXP, contains problems which have sub-exponential time algorithms for infinitely many input sizes. They also showed that P = BPP if the exponential-time hierarchy, which is defined in terms of the polynomial hierarchy and E as EPH, collapses to E; however, note that the exponential-time hierarchy is usually conjectured \"not\" to collapse.\nRussell Impagliazzo and Avi Wigderson showed that if any problem in E, where \nformula_3 \nhas circuit complexity 2\u03a9(\"n\") then P = BPP.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the quantum analogue to the complexity class BPP.\nA decision problem is a member of BQP if there exists a quantum algorithm (an algorithm that runs on a quantum computer) that solves the decision problem with high probability and is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. A run of the algorithm will correctly solve the decision problem with a probability of at least 2/3.\nDefinition.\nBQP can be viewed as the languages associated with certain bounded-error uniform families of quantum circuits. A language \"L\" is in BQP if and only if there exists a polynomial-time uniform family of quantum circuits formula_1, such that\nAlternatively, one can define BQP in terms of quantum Turing machines. A language \"L\" is in BQP if and only if there exists a polynomial quantum Turing machine that accepts \"L\" with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances.\nSimilarly to other \"bounded error\" probabilistic classes, the choice of 1/3 in the definition is arbitrary. We can run the algorithm a constant number of times and take a majority vote to achieve any desired probability of correctness less than 1, using the Chernoff bound. The complexity class is unchanged by allowing error as high as 1/2 \u2212 \"n\"\u2212\"c\" on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2\u2212\"nc\" on the other hand, where \"c\" is any positive constant, and \"n\" is the length of input.\nRelationship to other complexity classes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in computer science\nWhat is the relationship between formula_5 and formula_6?\nMore unsolved problems in computer science\nBQP is defined for quantum computers; the corresponding complexity class for classical computers (or more formally for probabilistic Turing machines) is BPP. Just like P and BPP, BQP is low for itself, which means . Informally, this is true because polynomial time algorithms are closed under composition. If a polynomial time algorithm calls polynomial time algorithms as subroutines, the resulting algorithm is still polynomial time.\nBQP contains P and BPP and is contained in AWPP, PP and PSPACE.\nIn fact, BQP is low for PP, meaning that a PP machine achieves no benefit from being able to solve BQP problems instantly, an indication of the possible difference in power between these similar classes. The known relationships with classic complexity classes are:\nformula_7\nAs the problem of &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; has not yet been solved, the proof of inequality between BQP and classes mentioned above is supposed to be difficult. The relation between BQP and NP is not known. In May 2018, computer scientists Ran Raz of Princeton University and Avishay Tal of Stanford University published a paper which showed that, relative to an oracle, BQP was not contained in PH. It can be proven that there exists an oracle A such that formula_8. In an extremely informal sense, this can be thought of as giving PH and BQP an identical, but additional, capability and verifying that BQP with the oracle (BQPA) can do things PHA cannot. While an oracle separation has been proven, the fact that BQP is not contained in PH has not been proven. An oracle separation does not prove whether or not complexity classes are the same. The oracle separation gives intuition that BQP may not be contained in PH.\nIt has been suspected for many years that Fourier Sampling is a problem that exists within BQP, but not within the polynomial hierarchy. Recent conjectures have provided evidence that a similar problem, Fourier Checking, also exists in the class BQP without being contained in the polynomial hierarchy. This conjecture is especially notable because it suggests that problems existing in BQP could be classified as harder than NP-Complete problems. Paired with the fact that many practical BQP problems are suspected to exist outside of P (it is suspected and not verified because there is no proof that P \u2260 NP), this illustrates the potential power of quantum computing in relation to classical computing.\nAdding postselection to BQP results in the complexity class PostBQP which is equal to PP.\nA complete problem for Promise-BQP.\nPromise-BQP is the class of promise problems that can be solved by a uniform family of quantum circuits (i.e., within BQP). Completeness proofs focus on this version of BQP. Similar to the notion of NP-completeness and other complete problems, we can define a complete problem as a problem that is in Promise-BQP and that every other problem in Promise-BQP reduces to it in polynomial time. \nAPPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB.\nThe APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB problem is complete for efficient quantum computation, and the version presented below is complete for the Promise-BQP complexity class (and not for the total BQP complexity class, for which no complete problems are known). APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB's completeness makes it useful for proofs showing the relationships between other complexity classes and BQP.\nGiven a description of a quantum circuit C acting on n qubits with m gates, where m is a polynomial in n and each gate acts on one or two qubits, and two numbers formula_9, distinguish between the following two cases:\nHere, there is a promise on the inputs as the problem does not specify the behavior if an instance is not covered by these two cases.\nClaim. Any BQP problem reduces to APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB. \nProof. \nSuppose we have an algorithm A that solves APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB, i.e., given a quantum circuit C acting on n qubits, and two numbers formula_9, A distinguishes between the above two cases. We can solve any problem in BQP with this oracle, by setting formula_17.\nFor any formula_18, there exists family of quantum circuits formula_1 such that for all formula_2, a state formula_21 of formula_22 qubits, if formula_23; else if formula_24. Fix an input formula_21 of n qubits, and the corresponding quantum circuit formula_26. We can first construct a circuit formula_27 such that formula_28. This can be done easily by hardwiring formula_21 and apply a sequence of CNOT gates to flip the qubits. Then we can combine two circuits to get formula_30, and now formula_31. And finally, necessarily the results of formula_26 is obtained by measuring several qubits and apply some (classical) logic gates to them. We can always defer the measurement and reroute the circuits so that by measuring the first qubit of formula_31, we get the output. This will be our circuit C, and we decide the membership of formula_34 by running formula_35 with formula_17. By definition of BQP, we will either fall into the first case (acceptance), or the second case (rejection), so formula_18 reduces to APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB.\nBQP and EXP.\nWe begin with an easier containment. To show that formula_38, it suffices to show that APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB is in EXP since APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB is BQP-complete.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nClaim\u2014formula_39\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Proof\n0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}&lt;/math&gt; and formula_40 space to store the vectors and the matrices. We will show in the following section that we can improve upon the space complexity.\nBQP and PSPACE.\nSum of histories is a technique introduced by physicist Richard Feynman for path integral formulation. APPROX-QCIRCUIT-PROB can be formulated in the sum of histories technique to show that formula_41.\nConsider a quantum circuit C, which consists of t gates, formula_42, where each formula_43 comes from a universal gate set and acts on at most two qubits.\nTo understand what the sum of histories is, we visualize the evolution of a quantum state given a quantum circuit as a tree. The root is the input formula_44, and each node in the tree has formula_45 children, each representing a state in formula_46. The weight on a tree edge from a node in j-th level representing a state formula_47 to a node in formula_48-th level representing a state formula_49 is formula_50, the amplitude of formula_49 after applying formula_52 on formula_47. The transition amplitude of a root-to-leaf path is the product of all the weights on the edges along the path. To get the probability of the final state being formula_54, we sum up the amplitudes of all root-to-leave paths that ends at a node representing formula_54.\nMore formally, for the quantum circuit C, its sum over histories tree is a tree of depth m, with one level for each gate formula_56 in addition to the root, and with branching factor formula_45.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDefine\u2014A history is a path in the sum of histories tree.

In fact it takes formula_66 time to calculate a single amplitude!\nBQP and PP.\nA similar sum-over-histories argument can be used to show that formula_67. \nP and BQP.\nWe know formula_68, since every classical circuit can be simulated by a quantum circuit. \nIt is conjectured that BQP solves hard problems outside of P, specifically, problems in NP.

{"id": "4086", "revid": "49574977", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4086", "title": "Brainfuck", "text": "Esoteric, minimalist programming language\nBrainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Swiss student Urban M\u00fcller. Designed to be extremely minimalistic, the language consists of only eight simple commands, a data pointer, and an instruction pointer.\nBrainfuck is an example of a so-called Turing tarpit: it can be used to write any program, but it is not practical to do so because it provides so little abstraction that the programs get very long or complicated. While Brainfuck is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck requires one to break down commands into small and simple instructions.\nThe language takes its name from the slang term \"brainfuck\", which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding, as it was not meant or made for designing actual software but to challenge the boundaries of computer programming.\nBecause the language's name contains profanity, many substitutes are used, such as brainfsck, branflakes, brainoof, brainfrick, BrainF, and BF.\nHistory.\nM\u00fcller designed Brainfuck with the goal of implementing the smallest possible compiler, inspired by the 1024-byte compiler for the FALSE programming language. M\u00fcller's original compiler was implemented in Motorola 68000 assembly on the Amiga and compiled to a binary with a size of 296 bytes. He uploaded the first Brainfuck compiler to Aminet in 1993. The program came with a \"Readme\" file, which briefly described the language, and challenged the reader \"Who can program anything useful with it? :)\". M\u00fcller also included an interpreter and some examples. A second version of the compiler used only 240 bytes.\nLanguage design.\nThe language consists of eight commands. A Brainfuck program is a sequence of these commands. The commands are executed sequentially, with some exceptions: an instruction pointer begins at the first command, and each command it points to is executed, after which it normally moves forward to the next command. The program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command.\nBrainfuck uses a simple machine model consisting of the program and instruction pointer, as well as a one-dimensional array of at least 30,000 byte cells initialized to zero; a movable data pointer (initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and output (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the ASCII character encoding).\nThe eight language commands each consist of a single character:\ncodice_1 and codice_2 match as parentheses usually do: each codice_1 matches exactly one codice_2 and vice versa, the codice_1 comes first, and there can be no unmatched codice_1 or codice_2 between the two.\nBrainfuck programs are usually difficult to comprehend. This is partly because any mildly complex task requires a long sequence of commands and partly because the program's text gives no direct indications of the program's state. These, as well as Brainfuck's inefficiency and its limited input/output capabilities, are some of the reasons it is not used for serious programming. Nonetheless, like any Turing-complete language, Brainfuck is theoretically capable of computing any computable function or simulating any other computational model if given access to an unlimited amount of memory and time. A variety of Brainfuck programs have been written. Although Brainfuck programs, especially complicated ones, are difficult to write, it is quite trivial to write an interpreter for Brainfuck in a more typical language such as C due to its simplicity. Brainfuck interpreters written in the Brainfuck language itself also exist.\nExamples.\nAdding two values.\nAs a first, simple example, the following code snippet will add the current cell's value to the next cell: Each time the loop is executed, the current cell is decremented, the data pointer moves to the right, that next cell is incremented, and the data pointer moves left again. This sequence is repeated until the starting cell is 0.\n[-&gt;+&lt;]\nThis can be incorporated into a simple addition program as follows:\n Cell c0 =.\n&gt; +++++ Cell c1 = 5\n[ Start your loops with your cell pointer on the loop counter (c1 in our case)\n&lt; + Add 1 to c0\n&gt; - Subtract 1 from c1\n] End your loops with the cell pointer on the loop counter\nAt this point our program has added 5 to 2 leaving 7 in c0 and 0 in c1\nbut we cannot output this value to the terminal since it is not ASCII encoded\nTo display the ASCII character \"7\" we must add 48 to the value 7\nWe use a loop to compute 48 = 6 * 8\n++ ++++ c1 = 8 and this will be our loop counter aga.\n&lt; +++ +++ Add 6 to c0\n&gt; - Subtract 1 from c1\n&lt; . Print out c0 which has the value 55 which translates to \"7\"!\nHello World!\nThe following program prints \"Hello World!\" and a newline to the screen. Note that brainfuck uses ASCII for letters.\n[ This program prints \"Hello World!\" and a newline to the screen; its\n length is 106 active command characters. [It is not the shortest.]\n This loop is an \"initial comment loop\", a simple way of adding a comment\n to a BF program such that you don't have to worry about any command\n characters. Any \".\", \",\", \"+\", \"-\", \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\" characters are simply\n ignored, the \"[\" and \"]\" characters just have to be balanced. This\n loop and the commands it contains are ignored because the current cell\n defaults to a value of 0; the 0 value causes this loop to be skipped.\n++++++ Set Cell #0 to.\n &gt;++++ Add 4 to Cell #1; this will always set Cell #1 to 4\n [ as the cell will be cleared by the loop\n &gt;++ Add 2 to Cell #2\n &gt;+++ Add 3 to Cell #3\n &gt;+++ Add 3 to Cell #4\n &gt;+ Add 1 to Cell #5\n \u00ab\u00ab- Decrement the loop counter in Cell #1\n ] Loop until Cell #1 is zero; number of iterations is 4\n &gt;+ Add 1 to Cell #2\n &gt;+ Add 1 to Cell #3\n &gt;- Subtract 1 from Cell #4\n \u00bb+ Add 1 to Cell #6\n [&lt;] Move back to the first zero cell you find; this will\n be Cell #1 which was cleared by the previous loop\n &lt;- Decrement the loop Counter in Cell #0\n] Loop until Cell #0 is zero; number of iterations is 8\nThe result of this is:\nCell no : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nContents: 0 0 72 104 88 32 8\nPointer : ^\n\u00bb.

Add 1 to Cell #5 gives us an exclamation point\n&gt;++. And finally a newline from Cell #6\nFor readability, this code has been spread across many lines, and blanks and comments have been added. Brainfuck ignores all characters except the eight commands codice_8 so no special syntax for comments is needed (as long as the comments do not contain the command characters). The code could just as well have been written as:\n++++++[&gt;++++[&gt;++&gt;+++&gt;+++&gt;+\u00ab\u00ab-]&gt;+&gt;+&gt;-\u00bb+[&lt;]&lt;-]\u00bb.&gt;---.+++++++..+++.\u00bb.&lt;-.&lt;.+++.------.--------.\u00bb+.&gt;++.Another example of 'Hello World' code is presented here. This version highlights the complexity of the language. For example, after printing 'e', it is necessary to increment cell #3 to switch to the letter 'l'. Displaying the second 'l' requires no further modifications, as cell 3 already contains 'l.\nROT13.\nThis program enciphers its input with the ROT13 cipher. To do this, it must map characters A-M (ASCII 65\u201377) to N-Z (78\u201390), and vice versa. Also it must map a-m (97\u2013109) to n-z (110\u2013122) and vice versa. It must map all other characters to themselves; it reads characters one at a time and outputs their enciphered equivalents until it reads an EOF (here assumed to be represented as either -1 or \"no change\"), at which point the program terminates.\n-,+[ Read first character and start outer character reading loop\n -[ Skip forward if character is 0\n \u00bb++++[&gt;++++++++&lt;-] Set up divisor (32) for division loop\n (MEMORY LAYOUT: dividend copy remainder divisor quotient zero zero)\n &lt;+&lt;-[ Set up dividend (x minus 1) and enter division loop\n &gt;+&gt;+&gt;-[\u00bb&gt;] Increase copy and remainder / reduce divisor / Normal case: skip forward\n &lt;]&lt;[ Zero that flag unless quotient was 2 or 3; zero quotient; check flag\n ++++++++++++&lt;[ If flag then set up divisor (13) for second division loop\n (MEMORY LAYOUT: zero copy dividend divisor remainder quotient zero zero)\n &gt;-[&gt;+\u00bb] Reduce divisor; Normal case: increase remainder\n &gt;[+[&lt;+&gt;-]&gt;+\u00bb] Special case: increase remainder / move it back to divisor / increase quotient\n \u00ab\u00ab&lt;- Decrease dividend\n ] End division loop\n \u00bb[&lt;+&gt;-] Add remainder back to divisor to get a useful 13\n &gt;[ Skip forward if quotient was 0\n -[ Decrement quotient and skip forward if quotient was 1\n -\u00ab[-]\u00bb Zero quotient and divisor if quotient was 2\n ]\u00ab[\u00ab-\u00bb-]\u00bb Zero divisor and subtract 13 from copy if quotient was 1\n ]\u00ab[\u00ab+\u00bb-] Zero divisor and add 13 to copy if quotient was 0\n ] End outer skip loop (jump to here if ((character minus 1)/32) was not 2 or 3)\n &lt;[-] Clear remainder from first division if second division was skipped\n &lt;.[-] Output ROT13ed character from copy and clear it\n &lt;-,+ Read next character\n] End character reading loop\nSimulation of abiogenesis.\nIn 2024, a Google research project used a slightly modified 10-command version of Brainfuck as the basis of an artificial digital environment.

He studied under Baccio Bandinelli and Jacopo Sansovino (assisting on the design of the Library of St. Mark's, the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice) and closely imitated the style of Michelangelo.\nHe was more distinguished in architecture than in sculpture. He worked in Rome in collaboration with Vignola and Vasari), including designs for the Villa Giulia, but also for works at Lucca. He labored during 1558\u20131570, in the refurbishment and enlargement of Pitti Palace, creating the courtyard consisting of three wings with rusticated facades, and one lower portico leading to the amphitheatre in the Boboli Gardens. His design mirrored the appearance of the main external fa\u00e7ade of Pitti. He was also named \"Consul\" of Accademia delle Arti del Disegno of Florence, which had been founded by the Duke Cosimo I in 1563.\nIn 1569, Ammannati was commissioned to build the Ponte Santa Trinita, a bridge over the Arno River. The three arches are elliptic, and though very light and elegant, has survived, when floods had damaged other Arno bridges at different times. Santa Trinita was destroyed in 1944, during World War II, and rebuilt in 1957.\nAmmannati designed what is considered a prototypic Mannerist sculptural ensemble in the Fountain of Neptune (\"Fontana del Nettuno\"), prominently located in the Piazza della Signoria in the center of Florence. The assignment was originally given to the aged Bartolommeo Bandinelli; however when Bandinelli died, Ammannati's design, bested the submissions of Benvenuto Cellini and Vincenzo Danti, to gain the commission. From 1563 and 1565, Ammannati and his assistants, among them Giambologna, sculpted the block of marble that had been chosen by Bandinelli. He took Grand Duke Cosimo I as model for Neptune's face. The statue was meant to highlight Cosimo's goal of establishing a Florentine Naval force. The ungainly sea god was placed at the corner of the Palazzo Vecchio within sight of Michelangelo's David statue, and the then 87-year-old sculptor is said to have scoffed at Ammannati\u2014 saying that he had ruined a beautiful piece of marble\u2014 with the ditty: \"Ammannati, Ammanato, che bel marmo hai rovinato!\" Ammannati continued work on this fountain for a decade, adding around the perimeter a cornucopia of demigod figures: bronze reclining river gods, laughing satyrs and marble sea horses emerging from the water.\nIn 1550 Ammannati married Laura Battiferri, an elegant poet and an accomplished woman. Later in his life he had a religious crisis, influenced by Counter-Reformation piety, which resulted in condemning his own works depicting nudity, and he left all his possessions to the Jesuits.\nHe died in Florence in 1592."}

In Christianity, bishops are normally responsible for the governance and administration of dioceses. The role or office of the bishop is called episcopacy or the episcopate. Organisationally, several Christian denominations utilise ecclesiastical structures that call for the position of bishops, while other denominations have dispensed with this office, seeing it as a symbol of power. Bishops have also exercised political authority within their dioceses.\nTraditionally, bishops claim apostolic succession and the historic episcopacy, a direct historical lineage dating back to the original Twelve Apostles or Saint Paul. The bishops are by doctrine understood as those who possess the full priesthood given by Jesus Christ, and therefore may ordain other clergy, including other bishops. A person ordained as a deacon, priest (i.e. presbyter), and then bishop is understood to hold the fullness of the ministerial priesthood, given responsibility by Christ to govern, teach and sanctify the Body of Christ (the Christian Church). Priests, deacons and lay ministers co-operate and assist their bishops in pastoral ministry. \nSome Pentecostal and other Protestant denominations have bishops who oversee congregations, though they do not necessarily claim apostolic succession, with exception to those Pentecostals and Charismatics affiliated to churches founded by J. Delano Ellis and Paul S. Morton.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe English word \"bishop\" derives, via Latin , Old English , and Middle English , from the Greek word , meaning \"overseer\" or \"supervisor\". Greek was the language of the early Christian church, but the term did not originate in Christianity: it had been used in Greek for several centuries before the advent of Christianity.\nThe English words \"priest\" and \"presbyter\" both derive, via Latin, from the Greek word , meaning \"elder\" or \"senior\", and not originally referring to priesthood.\nIn the early Christian era the two terms were not always clearly distinguished, but is used in the sense of the order or office of bishop, distinct from that of , in the writings attributed to Ignatius of Antioch in the second century.\nChristian episcopal development.\nThe earliest organization of the Church in Jerusalem was, according to most scholars, similar to that of Jewish synagogues, but it had a council or college of ordained presbyters (). In Acts 11:30 and Acts 15:22, a collegiate system of government in Jerusalem is chaired by James the Just, according to tradition the first bishop of the city. In Acts 14:23, the Apostle Paul ordains presbyters in churches in Anatolia. The word \"presbyter\" was not yet distinguished from \"overseer\" (, later used exclusively to mean \"bishop\"), as in Acts 20:17, Titus 1:5\u20137 and 1 Peter 5:1. The earliest writings of the Apostolic Fathers, the Didache and the First Epistle of Clement, for example, show the church used two terms for local church offices\u2014presbyters (seen by many as an interchangeable term with or overseer) and deacon.\nIn the First Epistle to Timothy and Epistle to Titus in the New Testament a more clearly defined episcopate can be seen. Both letters state that Paul had left Timothy in Ephesus and Titus in Crete to oversee the local church. Paul commands Titus to ordain presbyters/bishops and to exercise general oversight. John Zizioulas argues that \"The task of the Bishop was from the beginning principally liturgical, consisting in the offering of the Divine Eucharist.\" The authorship of both those letters is questioned by many scholars in the field and the question whether they reflect a first or second century structure of church hierarchy is among the arguments used in the debate as to their authenticity.\nEarly sources are unclear but various groups of Christian communities may have had the bishop surrounded by a group or college functioning as leaders of the local churches. Eventually the head or \"monarchic\" bishop came to rule more clearly, and all local churches would eventually follow the example of the other churches and structure themselves after the model of the others with the one bishop in clearer charge, though the role of the body of presbyters remained important.\nApostolic Fathers.\nAround the end of the 1st century, the early church's organization became clearer in historical documents. In the works of the Apostolic Fathers, and Ignatius of Antioch in particular, the role of the episkopos, or bishop, became more important or, rather, already was very important and being clearly defined. While Ignatius of Antioch offers the earliest clear description of monarchial bishops (a single bishop over all house churches in a city) he is an advocate of monoepiscopal structure rather than describing an accepted reality. To the bishops and house churches to which he writes, he offers strategies on how to pressure house churches who do not recognize the bishop into compliance. Other contemporary Christian writers do not describe monarchial bishops, either continuing to equate them with the presbyters or speaking of (bishops, plural) in a city.\nClement of Alexandria (end of the 2nd century) writes about the ordination of a certain Zach\u00e6us as bishop by the imposition of Simon Peter Bar-Jonah's hands. The words bishop and ordination are used in their technical meaning by the same Clement of Alexandria. The bishops in the 2nd century are defined also as the only clergy to whom the ordination to priesthood (presbyterate) and diaconate is entrusted: \"a priest (presbyter) lays on hands, but does not ordain.\" ().\nAt the beginning of the 3rd century, Hippolytus of Rome describes another feature of the ministry of a bishop, which is that of the : the primate of sacrificial priesthood and the power to forgive sins.\nCanonical age.\nAs the bishop's role further developed into the 4th century, the First Council of Nicaea decreed that bishops should be ordained by at least three others. Age requirements for episcopal ordination or consecration were neither universal nor fixed in early Christian churches. It was, however, universally required that a bishop be male.\nLacking a definitive ecumenical age requirement for holy orders\u2014between the early ecumenical councils of the Great and imperial Roman churches, and after schism into the Latin and Greek churches\u2014young men had been ordained, appointed, and/or enthroned as bishops, some as young as 5.\nNotable younger Latin and Greek bishops have included: Hugh Vermandois (5); Luis Antonio Jaime de Borb\u00f3n y Farnesio (8); Guido Ascanio Sforza di Santa Fiora (9); Benedict IX (11-20); Karol Ferdynand Vasa (11); Alexander Stewart (11); Niccol\u00f2 Caetani (13); Bruno von Bayern (14); Odo of Bayeux (14); Alessandro Farnese (14); Cesare Borgia (15); Clemens August (15); Ranuccio Farnese (16); Alfonso Carafa (16); James II of Cyprus (16) Theophylact (16); Ippolito de' Medici (17); Diomede Carafa (19); Stephen I (19); Luis de Mil\u00e0 y de Borja (21); Nicolas de Besse (21); Clemente Grosso della Rovere (21); Niccol\u00f2 Gaddi (22); Juan de Borja Lanzol de Roman\u00ed, \"el menor\" (24); Gabriele Condulmer (later Eugene IV, aged 24) of Rome; Ludovico Ludovisi (25); Giovanni Michiel (25); Charles Borromeo (25); Pietro Riario (26); Mark Sittich von Hohenems Altemps (26); Jo\u0161t Ro\u017emberk (26); Giuliano della Rovere (later Julius II, aged 27); Bonifazio Bevilacqua Aldobrandini (27); Philipp Ludwig von Sinzendorf (27); Pedro Luis de Borja Lanzol de Roman\u00ed (27); and Gerhard II Lippe (29). Throughout the Church of the East, other notable younger bishops have included: Shimun XXIII Eshai (12); Shimun XIX Benyamin (16); Yohannan VIII Hormizd (16); Sargis Yosip (17); Shimun XVII Abraham (20); and Yosip Khnaninsho (22).\nDuring the Catholic Church's Council of Trent, the Holy See dogmatically mandated a minimum canonical age of 30 for the episcopacy. The Eastern Orthodox Church would also impose a minimum age of 30 for the priesthood. The Coptic Orthodox have adopted a minimum canonical age of at least 28 for the priesthood, including its specialized ministries leading to the chorepiscopacy. For the office of bishop, the Eastern Orthodox Church imposed a minimum canonical age of 35. Overall, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Assyrian Church of the East and Protestantism have not established a universal, canonical age.\nDuring the 20th century, the Holiness-Pentecostal Church of God in Christ elevated Clarence Leslie Morton Jr. (born 1942) into the episcopacy at the age of 20 in 1962. J. Delano Ellis (born 1944), co-founder of the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops, was also elevated as bishop at the age of 26 in 1970.\nChristian bishops and civil government.\nThe efficient organization of the Roman Empire became the template for the organisation of the Great Church in the 4th century, particularly after Constantine's Edict of Milan. As the church moved from the shadows of privacy into the public forum it acquired land for churches, burials and clergy. In 391, Theodosius I decreed that any land that had been confiscated from the church by Roman authorities be returned.\nThe most usual term for the geographic area of a bishop's authority and ministry, the diocese, began as part of the structure of the Roman Empire under Diocletian. As Roman authority began to fail in the western portion of the empire, the church took over much of the civil administration. This can be clearly seen in the ministry of two popes: Pope Leo I in the 5th century, and Pope Gregory I in the 6th century. Both of these men were statesmen and public administrators in addition to their role as Christian pastors, teachers and leaders. In the Eastern churches, latifundia entailed to a bishop's see were much less common, the state power did not collapse the way it did in the West, and thus the tendency of bishops acquiring civil power was much weaker than in the West. However, the role of Western bishops as civil authorities, often called prince bishops, continued throughout much of the Middle Ages.\nBishops holding political office.\nAs well as being archchancellors of the Holy Roman Empire after the 9th century, bishops generally served as chancellors to medieval monarchs, acting as head of the \"justiciary\" and chief chaplain. The Lord Chancellor of England was almost always a bishop up until the dismissal of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey by Henry VIII. Similarly, the position of Kanclerz in the Polish kingdom was always held by a bishop until the 16th century.\nIn modern times, the principality of Andorra is headed by Co-Princes of Andorra, one of whom is the Bishop of Urgell and the other, the sitting President of France, an arrangement that began with the Par\u00e9age of Andorra (1278), and was ratified in the 1993 constitution of Andorra.\nThe office of the Papacy is inherently held by the sitting Roman Catholic Bishop of Rome. Though not originally intended to hold temporal authority, since the Middle Ages the power of the Roman papacy gradually expanded deep into the secular realm and for centuries the sitting Bishop of Rome was the most powerful governmental office in Central Italy. In modern times, the Pope of Rome is also the sovereign Prince of Vatican City, an internationally recognized micro-state located entirely within the city of Rome.\nIn France, prior to the Revolution, representatives of the clergy\u2014in practice, bishops and abbots of the largest monasteries\u2014comprised the First Estate of the Estates-General. This role was abolished after separation of church and state was implemented during the French Revolution.\nIn the 21st century, the more senior bishops of the Church of England continue to sit in the House of Lords of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, as representatives of the established church, and are known as Lords Spiritual. The Bishop of Sodor and Man, whose diocese lies outside the United Kingdom, is an \"ex officio\" member of the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man. In the past, the Bishop of Durham had extensive vice-regal powers within his northern diocese, which was a county palatine, the County Palatine of Durham, (previously, Liberty of Durham) of which he was \"ex officio\" the earl. In the 19th century, a gradual process of reform was enacted, with the majority of the bishop's historic powers vested in The Crown by 1858.\nEastern Orthodox bishops, along with all other members of the clergy, are canonically forbidden to hold political office. Occasional exceptions to this rule are tolerated when the alternative is political chaos. In the Ottoman Empire, the Patriarch of Constantinople, for example, had de facto administrative, cultural and legal jurisdiction, as well as spiritual authority, over all Eastern Orthodox Christians of the empire, as part of the Ottoman millet system. An Eastern Orthodox bishop headed the Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro from 1516 to 1852, assisted by a secular \"guvernadur\". More recently, Archbishop Makarios III of Cyprus, served as President of the Cyprus from 1960 to 1977, an extremely turbulent time period on the island.\nIn 2001, Peter Hollingworth, AC, OBE\u2014then the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane\u2014was controversially appointed Governor-General of Australia. Although Hollingworth gave up his episcopal position to accept the appointment, it still attracted considerable opposition in a country which maintains a formal separation between Church and State.\nEpiscopacy during the English Civil War.\nDuring the period of the English Civil War, the role of bishops as wielders of political power and as upholders of the established church became a matter of heated political controversy. Presbyterianism was the polity of most Reformed Christianity in Europe, and had been favored by many in England since the English Reformation. Since in the primitive Church the offices of \"presbyter\" and were not clearly distinguished, many Puritans held that this was the only form of government the church should have. The Anglican divine, Richard Hooker, objected to this claim in his famous work \"Of the Laws of Ecclesiastic Polity\" while, at the same time, defending Presbyterian ordination as valid (in particular Calvin's ordination of Beza). This was the official stance of the English Church until the Commonwealth, during which time, the views of Presbyterians and Independents (Congregationalists) were more freely expressed and practiced.\nChristian churches.\nCatholic, Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican churches.\nBishops exercise leadership roles in the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Churches, certain Lutheran churches, the Anglican Communion, the Independent Catholic churches, the Independent Anglican churches, and certain other, smaller, denominations.\nThe traditional role of a bishop is as pastor of a diocese (also called a bishopric, synod, eparchy or see), and so to serve as a \"diocesan bishop\", or \"eparch\" as it is called in many Eastern Christian churches. Dioceses vary considerably in size, geographically and population-wise. Some dioceses around the Mediterranean Sea which were Christianised early are rather compact, whereas dioceses in areas of rapid modern growth in Christian commitment, as in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and the Far East, are much larger and more populous.\nAs well as traditional diocesan bishops, many churches have a well-developed structure of church leadership that involves a number of layers of authority and responsibility:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Glossary/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDuties.\nIn Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, High Church Lutheranism, and Anglicanism, only a bishop can ordain other bishops, priests, and deacons.\nThe bishop is the ordinary minister of the sacrament of confirmation in the Latin Church, and in the Old Catholic communion only a bishop may administer this sacrament. In the Lutheran and Anglican churches, the bishop normatively administers the rite of confirmation, although in those denominations that do not have an episcopal polity, confirmation is administered by the priest. However, in the Byzantine and other Eastern rites, whether Eastern or Oriental Orthodox or Eastern Catholic, chrismation is done immediately after baptism, and thus the priest is the one who confirms, using chrism blessed by a bishop.\nOrdination of bishops.\nBishops in all of these communions are ordained or consecrated by other bishops through the laying on of hands. Ordination of a bishop, and thus continuation of apostolic succession, takes place through a ritual centred on the imposition of hands and prayer.\nIn Scandinavia and the Baltic region, Lutheran churches participating in the Porvoo Communion (those of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Lithuania), as well as many non-Porvoo membership Lutheran churches (including those of Kenya, Latvia, and Russia), as well as the confessional Communion of Nordic Lutheran Dioceses, believe that they ordain their bishops in the apostolic succession in lines stemming from the original apostles. \"The New Westminster Dictionary of Church History\" states that \"In Sweden the apostolic succession was preserved because the Catholic bishops were allowed to stay in office, but they had to approve changes in the ceremonies.\"\nWhile traditional teaching maintains that any bishop with apostolic succession can validly perform the ordination of another bishop, some churches require two or three bishops participate, either to ensure sacramental validity or to conform with church law. \nPeculiar to the Catholic Church.\nCatholic doctrine holds that one bishop can validly ordain another (priest) as a bishop. Although a minimum of three bishops participating is desirable (there are usually several more) in order to demonstrate collegiality, canonically only one bishop is necessary. The Second Vatican Council's \"Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy\" stated that \"when a bishop is consecrated, the laying of hands may be done by all the bishops present\".\nApart from the ordination, which is always done by other bishops, there are different methods as to the actual selection of a candidate for ordination as bishop. The Dicastery for Bishops generally oversees the selection of new bishops, with recommendations sent for the approval of the pope. The papal nuncio usually solicits names from the bishops of a country, consults with priests and leading members of a laity, and then selects three to be forwarded to the Holy See. In Europe, some cathedral chapters have duties to elect bishops. The Eastern Catholic churches generally elect their own bishops. Most Eastern Orthodox churches allow varying amounts of formalised laity or lower clergy influence on the choice of bishops. This also applies in those Eastern churches which are in union with the pope, though it is required that he give assent.\nThe pope, in addition to being the Bishop of Rome and spiritual head of the Catholic Church, is also the Patriarch of the Latin Church. Each bishop within the Latin Church is answerable directly to the Pope and not any other bishop except to metropolitans in certain oversight instances. In this instante, the pope uses the title \"Patriarch of the West\", although this title was dropped from use between 2006 and 2024, when Pope Francis reinstituted it.\nRecognition of other churches' ordinations.\nThe Catholic Church does recognise as valid (though illicit) ordinations done by breakaway Catholic, Old Catholic or Oriental bishops, and groups descended from them; it also regards as both valid and licit those ordinations done by bishops of the Eastern churches, so long as those receiving the ordination conform to other canonical requirements (for example, is an adult male) and an eastern orthodox rite of episcopal ordination, expressing the proper functions and sacramental status of a bishop, is used; this has given rise to the phenomenon of (for example, clergy of the Independent Catholic groups which claim apostolic succession, though this claim is rejected by both Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy). With respect to Lutheranism, \"the Catholic Church has never officially expressed its judgement on the validity of orders as they have been handed down by episcopal succession in these two national Lutheran churches\" (the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland) though it does \"question how the ecclesiastical break in the 16th century has affected the apostolicity of the churches of the Reformation and thus the apostolicity of their ministry\". \nSince Pope Leo XIII issued the bull in 1896, the Catholic Church has insisted that Anglican orders are invalid because of the Reformed changes in the Anglican ordination rites of the 16th century and divergence in understanding of the theology of priesthood, episcopacy and Eucharist. However, since the 1930s, Utrecht Old Catholic bishops (recognised by the Holy See as validly ordained) have sometimes taken part in the ordination of Anglican bishops. According to the writer Timothy Dufort, by 1969, all Church of England bishops had acquired Old Catholic lines of apostolic succession recognised by the Holy See. This development has been used to argue that the strain of apostolic succession has been re-introduced into Anglicanism, at least within the Church of England. However, other issues, such as the Anglican ordination of women, is at variance with Catholic understanding of Christian teaching, and have contributed to the reaffirmation of Catholic rejection of Anglican ordinations.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church does not accept the validity of any ordinations performed by the Independent Catholic or Independent Orthodox groups, as Eastern Orthodoxy considers to be spurious any consecration outside the church as a whole. Eastern Orthodoxy considers apostolic succession to exist only within themselves as the one true church, and not through any authority held by individual bishops; thus, if a bishop ordains someone to serve outside the (Eastern Orthodox) Church, the ceremony is ineffectual, and no ordination has taken place regardless of the ritual used or the ordaining prelate's position within the Eastern Orthodox Church.\nThe position of the Catholic Church is slightly different. Whilst it does recognise the validity of the orders of certain groups which separated from communion with Holy See (for instance, the ordinations of the Old Catholics in communion with Utrecht, as well as the Polish National Catholic Church, which received its orders directly from Utrecht, and was until recently part of that communion), Catholicism does not recognise the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with what they consider the core tenets of Christianity; this is the case even though the clergy of the Independent Catholic groups may use the proper ordination ritual. There are also other reasons why the Holy See does not recognise the validity of the orders of the independent clergy:\nWhilst members of the Independent Catholic movement take seriously the issue of valid orders, it is highly significant that the relevant Vatican Congregations tend not to respond to petitions from Independent Catholic bishops and clergy who seek to be received into communion with the Holy See, hoping to continue in some sacramental role. In those instances where the pope does grant reconciliation, those deemed to be clerics within the Independent Old Catholic movement are invariably admitted as laity and not priests or bishops.\nThere is a mutual recognition of the validity of orders amongst Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Old Catholic, Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Church of the East churches.\nSome provinces of the Anglican Communion have begun ordaining women as bishops in recent decades\u2014for example, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Cuba. The first woman to be consecrated a bishop within Anglicanism was Barbara Harris, who was ordained in the United States in 1989. In 2006, Katharine Jefferts Schori, the Episcopal Bishop of Nevada, became the first woman to become the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.\nIn the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC), the largest Lutheran church bodies in the United States and Canada, respectively, and roughly based on the Nordic Lutheran national churches (similar to that of the Church of England), bishops are elected by Synod Assemblies, consisting of both lay members and clergy, for a term of six years, which can be renewed, depending upon the local synod's \"constitution\" (which is mirrored on either the ELCA or ELCIC's national constitution). Since the implementation of concordats between the ELCA and the Episcopal Church of the United States and the ELCIC and the Anglican Church of Canada, all bishops, including the presiding bishop (ELCA) or the national bishop (ELCIC), have been consecrated using the historic succession in line with bishops from the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Sweden, with at least one Anglican bishop serving as co-consecrator.\nAlthough ELCA agreed with the Episcopal Church to limit ordination to the bishop \"ordinarily\", ELCA pastor-\"ordinators\" are given permission to perform the rites in \"extraordinary\" circumstance. In practice, \"extraordinary\" circumstance have included disagreeing with Episcopalian views of the episcopate, and as a result, ELCA pastors ordained by other pastors are not permitted to be deployed to Episcopal Churches (they can, however, serve in Presbyterian Church USA, United Methodist Church, Reformed Church in America, and Moravian Church congregations, as the ELCA is in full communion with these denominations). The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), the second and third largest Lutheran bodies in the United States and the two largest Confessional Lutheran bodies in North America, do not follow an episcopal form of governance, settling instead on a form of quasi-congregationalism patterned off what they believe to be the practice of the early church. The second largest of the three predecessor bodies of the ELCA, the American Lutheran Church, was a congregationalist body, with national and synod presidents before they were re-titled as bishops (borrowing from the Lutheran churches in Germany) in the 1980s. With regard to ecclesial discipline and oversight, national and synod presidents typically function similarly to bishops in episcopal bodies.\nMethodism.\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church.\nIn the African Methodist Episcopal Church, \"Bishops are the Chief Officers of the Connectional Organization. They are elected for life by a majority vote of the General Conference which meets every four years.\"\nChristian Methodist Episcopal Church.\nIn the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States, bishops are administrative superintendents of the church; they are elected by \"delegate\" votes for as many years deemed until the age of 74, then the bishop must retire. Among their duties, are responsibility for appointing clergy to serve local churches as pastor, for performing ordinations, and for safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the church. The General Conference, a meeting every four years, has an equal number of clergy and lay delegates. In each Annual Conference, CME bishops serve for four-year terms. In 2010, Teresa E. Jefferson-Snorton was elected as a bishop, becoming the first woman to hold that position. As of 2024, she remains the only female bishop in CME.\nUnited Methodist Church.\nIn the United Methodist Church (the largest branch of Methodism in the world) bishops serve as administrative and pastoral superintendents of the church. They are elected for life from among the ordained elders (presbyters) by vote of the delegates in regional (called jurisdictional) conferences, and are consecrated by the other bishops present at the conference through the laying on of hands. In the United Methodist Church bishops remain members of the \"Order of Elders\" while being consecrated to the \"Office of the Episcopacy\". Within the United Methodist Church only bishops are empowered to consecrate bishops and ordain clergy. Among their most critical duties is the ordination and appointment of clergy to serve local churches as pastor, presiding at sessions of the Annual, Jurisdictional, and General Conferences, providing pastoral ministry for the clergy under their charge, and safeguarding the doctrine and discipline of the church. Furthermore, individual bishops, or the Council of Bishops as a whole, often serve a prophetic role, making statements on important social issues and setting forth a vision for the denomination, though they have no legislative authority of their own. In all of these areas, bishops of the United Methodist Church function very much in the historic meaning of the term. According to the \"Book of Discipline of the United Methodist Church\", a bishop's responsibilities are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Leadership.\u2014Spiritual and Temporal\"\u2014\n\"Presidential Duties.\"\u20141. To preside in the General, Jurisdictional, Central, and Annual Conferences. 2. To form the districts after consultation with the district superintendents and after the number of the same has been determined by vote of the Annual Conference. 3. To appoint the district superintendents annually (\u00b6\u00b6 517\u2013518). 4. To consecrate bishops, to ordain elders and deacons, to consecrate diaconal ministers, to commission deaconesses and home missionaries, and to see that the names of the persons commissioned and consecrated are entered on the journals of the conference and that proper credentials are furnished to these persons.\n\"Working with Ministers.\"\u20141. To make and fix the appointments in the Annual Conferences, Provisional Annual Conferences, and Missions as the Discipline may direct (\u00b6\u00b6 529\u2013533).\n2. To divide or to unite a circuit(s), stations(s), or mission(s) as judged necessary for missionary strategy and then to make appropriate appointments. 3. To read the appointments of deaconesses, diaconal ministers, lay persons in service under the World Division of the General Board of Global Ministries, and home missionaries. 4. To fix the Charge Conference membership of all ordained ministers appointed to ministries other than the local church in keeping with \u00b6443.3. 5. To transfer, upon the request of the receiving bishop, ministerial member(s) of one Annual Conference to another, \"provided\" said member(s) agrees to transfer; and to send immediately to the secretaries of both conferences involved, to the conference Boards of Ordained Ministry, and to the clearing house of the General Board of Pensions written notices of the transfer of members and of their standing in the course of study if they are undergraduates. \nIn each Annual Conference, United Methodist bishops serve for four-year terms, and may serve up to three terms before either retirement or appointment to a new Conference. United Methodist bishops may be male or female, with Marjorie Matthews being the first woman to be consecrated a bishop in 1980.\nThe collegial expression of episcopal leadership in the United Methodist Church is known as the Council of Bishops. The Council of Bishops speaks to the church and through the church into the world and gives leadership in the quest for Christian unity and interreligious relationships. The Conference of Methodist Bishops includes the United Methodist \"Council of Bishops\" plus bishops from affiliated autonomous Methodist or United churches.\nJohn Wesley consecrated Thomas Coke a \"General Superintendent\", and directed that Francis Asbury also be consecrated for the United States of America in 1784, where the Methodist Episcopal Church first became a separate denomination apart from the Church of England. Coke soon returned to England, but Asbury was the primary builder of the new church. At first he did not call himself bishop, but eventually submitted to the usage by the denomination.\nNotable bishops in United Methodist history include Coke, Asbury, Richard Whatcoat, Philip William Otterbein, Martin Boehm, Jacob Albright, John Seybert, Matthew Simpson, John S. Stamm, William Ragsdale Cannon, Marjorie Matthews, Leontine T. Kelly, William B. Oden, Ntambo Nkulu Ntanda, Joseph Sprague, William Henry Willimon, and Thomas Bickerton.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nIn The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the bishop is the leader of a local congregation, called a ward. As with most LDS priesthood holders, the bishop is a part-time lay minister and earns a living through other employment. As such, it is his duty to preside, call local leaders, and judge the worthiness of members for certain activities. The bishop does not deliver sermons at every service (generally asking members to do so), but is expected to be a spiritual guide for his congregation. It is therefore believed that he has both the right and ability to receive divine inspiration (through the Holy Spirit) for the ward under his direction. Because it is a part-time position, all able members are expected to assist in the management of the ward by holding delegated lay positions (for example, women's and youth leaders, teachers) referred to as callings. The bishop is especially responsible for leading the youth, in connection with the fact that a bishop is the president of the Aaronic priesthood in his ward (and is thus a form of Mormon Kohen). Although members are asked to confess serious sins to him, unlike the Catholic Church, he is not the instrument of divine forgiveness, but merely a guide through the repentance process (and a judge in case transgressions warrant excommunication or other official discipline). The bishop is also responsible for the physical welfare of the ward, and thus collects tithing and fast offerings and distributes financial assistance where needed.\nA literal descendant of Aaron has \"legal right\" to act as a bishop after being found worthy and ordained by the First Presidency. In the absence of a literal descendant of Aaron, a high priest in the Melchizedek priesthood is called to be a bishop. Each bishop is selected from resident members of the ward by the stake presidency with approval of the First Presidency, and chooses two \"counselors\" to form a \"bishopric\". An priesthood holder called as bishop must be ordained a high priest if he is not already one, unlike the similar function of branch president. In special circumstances (such as a ward consisting entirely of young university students), a bishop may be chosen from outside the ward. Traditionally, bishops are married, though this is not always the case. A bishop is typically released after about five years and a new bishop is called to the position. Although the former bishop is released from his duties, he continues to hold the Aaronic priesthood office of bishop. Church members frequently refer to a former bishop as \"Bishop\" as a sign of respect and affection.\nLatter-day Saint bishops do not wear any special clothing or insignia the way clergy in many other churches do, but are expected to dress and groom themselves neatly and conservatively per their local culture, especially when performing official duties. Bishops (as well as other members of the priesthood) can trace their line of authority back to Joseph Smith, who, according to church doctrine, was ordained to lead the church in modern times by the ancient apostles Peter, James, and John, who were ordained to lead the Church by Jesus Christ.\nAt the global level, the presiding bishop oversees the temporal affairs (buildings, properties, commercial corporations, and so on) of the worldwide church, including the church's massive global humanitarian aid and social welfare programs. The presiding bishop has two counselors; the three together form the presiding bishopric. As opposed to ward bishoprics, where the counselors do not hold the office of bishop, all three men in the presiding bishopric hold the office of bishop, and thus the counselors, as with the presiding bishop, are formally referred to as \"Bishop\".\nIrvingism.\nNew Apostolic Church.\nThe New Apostolic Church (NAC) teaches three classes of ministries: deacons, priests and apostles. The apostles, who are all included in the apostolate with the Chief Apostle as head, are the highest ministries. Of the several kinds of priestly ministries, the bishop is the highest. Nearly all bishops are set in line directly from the chief apostle. They support and help their superior apostle.\nPentecostalism.\nChurch of God in Christ.\nIn the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), the ecclesiastical structure is composed of large dioceses that are called \"jurisdictions\" within COGIC, each under the authority of a bishop, sometimes called \"state bishops\". They can either be made up of large geographical regions of churches or churches that are grouped and organized together as their own separate jurisdictions because of similar affiliations, regardless of geographical location or dispersion. Each state in the U.S. has at least one jurisdiction while others may have several more, and each jurisdiction is usually composed of between 30 and 100 churches. Each jurisdiction is then broken down into several districts, which are smaller groups of churches (either grouped by geographical situation or by similar affiliations) which are each under the authority of District Superintendents who answer to the authority of their jurisdictional/state bishop. There are currently over 170 jurisdictions in the United States, and over 30 jurisdictions in other countries. The bishops of each jurisdiction, according to the COGIC Manual, are considered to be the modern day equivalent in the church of the early apostles and overseers of the New Testament church, and as the highest ranking clergymen in the COGIC, they are tasked with the responsibilities of being the head overseers of all religious, civil, and economic ministries and protocol for the church denomination. They also have the authority to appoint and ordain local pastors, elders, ministers, and reverends within the denomination. The bishops of the COGIC denomination are all collectively called \"The Board of Bishops\". From the Board of Bishops, and the General Assembly of the COGIC, the body of the church composed of clergy and lay delegates that are responsible for making and enforcing the bylaws of the denomination, every four years, twelve bishops from the COGIC are elected as \"The General Board\" of the church, who work alongside the delegates of the General Assembly and Board of Bishops to provide administration over the denomination as the church's head executive leaders. One of twelve bishops of the General Board is also elected the \"presiding bishop\" of the church, and two others are appointed by the presiding bishop himself, as his first and second assistant presiding bishops.\nBishops in the Church of God in Christ usually wear black clergy suits which consist of a black suit blazer, black pants, a purple or scarlet clergy shirt and a white clerical collar, which is usually referred to as \"Class B Civic attire\". Bishops in COGIC also typically wear the Anglican Choir Dress style vestments of a long purple or scarlet chimere, cuffs, and tippet worn over a long white rochet, and a gold pectoral cross worn around the neck with the tippet. This is usually referred to as \"Class A Ceremonial attire\". The bishops of COGIC alternate between Class A Ceremonial attire and Class B Civic attire depending on the protocol of the religious services and other events they have to attend.\nChurch of God (Cleveland, Tennessee).\nIn the polity of the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), the international leader is the presiding bishop, and the members of the executive committee are executive bishops. Collectively, they supervise and appoint national and state leaders across the world. Leaders of individual states and regions are administrative bishops, who have jurisdiction over local churches in their respective states and are vested with appointment authority for local pastorates. All ministers are credentialed at one of three levels of licensure, the most senior of which is the rank of ordained bishop. To be eligible to serve in state, national, or international positions of authority, a minister must hold the rank of ordained bishop.\nSeventh-day Adventists.\nAccording to the Seventh-day Adventist understanding of the doctrine of the church:\n\"The \"elders\" (Greek, ) or \"bishops\" () were the most important officers of the church. The term elder means older one, implying dignity and respect. His position was similar to that of the one who had supervision of the synagogue. The term bishop means \"overseer\". Paul used these terms interchangeably, equating elders with overseers or bishops (Acts 20:17, ; Titus 1:5, 7).\n\"Those who held this position supervised the newly formed churches. Elder referred to the status or rank of the office, while bishop denoted the duty or responsibility of the office\u2014\"overseer\". Since the apostles also called themselves elders (1 Peter 5:1; 2 John 1; 3 John 1), it is apparent that there were both local elders and itinerant elders, or elders at large. But both kinds of elder functioned as shepherds of the congregations.\"\nThe above understanding is part of the basis of Adventist organizational structure. The world wide Seventh-day Adventist church is organized into local districts, conferences or missions, union conferences or union missions, divisions, and finally at the top is the general conference. At each level (with exception to the local districts), there is an elder who is elected president and a group of elders who serve on the executive committee with the elected president. Those who have been elected president would in effect be the \"bishop\" while never actually carrying the title or ordained as such because the term is usually associated with the episcopal style of church governance most often found in Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and some Pentecostal/Charismatic circles.\nOthers.\nSome Baptists also have begun taking on the title of \"bishop\". In some smaller Protestant denominations and independent churches, the term \"bishop\" is used in the same way as \"pastor\", to refer to the leader of the local congregation, and may be male or female. This usage is especially common in African-American churches, particularly through the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship.\nIn the Church of Scotland, which has a Presbyterian church structure, the word \"bishop\" refers to an ordained person, usually a normal parish minister, who has temporary oversight of a trainee minister. In the Presbyterian Church (USA), the term bishop is an expressive name for a Minister of Word and Sacrament who serves a congregation and exercises \"the oversight of the flock of Christ.\" The term is traceable to the 1789 Form of Government of the PC (USA) and the Presbyterian understanding of the pastoral office. Reformed churches on the whole do not tend to have bishops, although there are exceptions.\nWhile not considered orthodox Christian, the Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica uses roles and titles derived from Christianity for its clerical hierarchy, including bishops who have much the same authority and responsibilities as in Catholicism.\nThe Salvation Army does not have bishops but has appointed leaders of geographical areas, known as Divisional Commanders. Larger geographical areas, called territories, are led by a territorial commander, who is the highest-ranking officer in that territory.\nJehovah's Witnesses do not use the title 'bishop' within their organizational structure, but appoint elders to be overseers (to fulfill the role of oversight) within their congregations.\nThe Batak Christian Protestant Church of Indonesia, the most prominent Protestant denomination in Indonesia, uses the term \"Ephorus\" instead of \"bishop\".\nIn the Vietnamese syncretist religion of Caodaism, bishops () comprise the fifth of nine hierarchical levels, and are responsible for spiritual and temporal education as well as record-keeping and ceremonies in their parishes. At any one time there are seventy-two bishops. Their authority is described in Section I of the text (revealed through seances in December 1926). Caodai bishops wear robes and headgear of embroidered silk depicting the Divine Eye and the Eight Trigrams. (The color varies according to branch.) This is the full ceremonial dress; the simple version consists of a seven-layered turban.\nDress and insignia in Christianity.\nTraditionally, a number of items are associated with the office of a bishop, most notably the mitre and the crosier. Other vestments and insignia vary between Eastern and Western Christianity.\nIn the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, the choir dress of a bishop includes the purple cassock with amaranth trim, rochet, purple zucchetto (skull cap), purple biretta, and pectoral cross. The cappa magna may be worn, but only within the bishop's own diocese and on especially solemn occasions. The mitre, zucchetto, and stole are generally worn by bishops when presiding over liturgical functions. For liturgical functions other than the Mass the bishop typically wears the cope. Within his own diocese and when celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local ordinary, he also uses the crosier. When celebrating Mass, a bishop, like a priest, wears the chasuble. The \"Caeremoniale Episcoporum\" recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations a bishop should also wear a dalmatic, which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of holy orders, blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar. The \"Caeremoniale Episcoporum\" no longer makes mention of episcopal gloves, episcopal sandals, liturgical stockings (also known as buskins), or the accoutrements that it once prescribed for the bishop's horse. The coat of arms of a Latin Church Catholic bishop usually displays a galero with a cross and crosier behind the escutcheon; the specifics differ by location and ecclesiastical rank (see Ecclesiastical heraldry).\nAnglican bishops generally make use of the mitre, crosier, ecclesiastical ring, purple cassock, purple zucchetto, and pectoral cross. However, the traditional choir dress of Anglican bishops retains its late mediaeval form, and looks quite different from that of their Catholic counterparts; it consists of a long rochet which is worn with a chimere.\nIn the Eastern churches (Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Rite Catholic) a bishop will wear the mandyas, panagia (and perhaps an enkolpion), sakkos, omophorion and an Eastern-style mitre. Eastern bishops do not normally wear an episcopal ring; the faithful kiss (or, alternatively, touch their forehead to) the bishop's hand. To seal official documents, he will usually use an inked stamp. An Eastern bishop's coat of arms will normally display an Eastern-style mitre, cross, Eastern-style crosier and a red and white (or red and gold) mantle. The arms of Oriental Orthodox bishops will display the episcopal insignia (mitre or turban) specific to their own liturgical traditions. Variations occur based upon jurisdiction and national customs.\nCathedra.\nIn Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican cathedrals there is a special chair set aside for the exclusive use of the bishop. This is the bishop's \"cathedra\" and is often called the throne. In some Christian denominations, for example, the Anglican Communion, parish churches may maintain a chair for the use of the bishop when he visits; this is to signify the parish's union with the bishop.\nIn non-Christian religions.\nBuddhism.\nThe leader of the Buddhist Churches of America (BCA) is their bishop, The Japanese title for the bishop of the BCA is , although the English title is favored over the Japanese. When it comes to many other Buddhist terms, the BCA chose to keep them in their original language (terms such as and ), but with some words (including ), they changed/translated these terms into English words.\nBetween 1899 and 1944, the BCA held the name Buddhist Mission of North America. The leader of the Buddhist Mission of North America was called (superintendent/director) between 1899 and 1918. In 1918 the was promoted to bishop (). However, according to George J. Tanabe, the title \"bishop\" was in practice already used by Hawaiian Shin Buddhists (in Honpa Hongwanji Mission of Hawaii) even when the official title was \"kantoku\".\nBishops are also present in other Japanese Buddhist organizations. Higashi Hongan-ji's North American District, Honpa Honganji Mission of Hawaii, Jodo Shinshu Buddhist Temples of Canada, a Jodo Shu temple in Los Angeles, the Shingon temple Koyasan Buddhist Temple, S\u014dt\u014d Mission in Hawai\u2018i (a Soto Zen Buddhist institution), and the S\u014dt\u014d Zen Buddhist Community of South America () all have or have had leaders with the title bishop. As for the S\u014dt\u014d Zen Buddhist Community of South America, the Japanese title is , but the leader is in practice referred to as \"bishop\".\nTenrikyo.\nTenrikyo is a Japanese New Religion with influences from both Shinto and Buddhism. The leader of the Tenrikyo North American Mission has the title of bishop.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A port city, it is the capital of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, as well as the prefecture of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called \"\"Bordelais\"\" (masculine) or \"\"Bordelaises\"\" (feminine). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\nThe city of Bordeaux proper had a population of 259,809 in 2020 within its small municipal territory of , but together with its suburbs and exurbs the Bordeaux metropolitan area had a population of 1,376,375 that same year (Jan. 2020 census), the sixth-most populated in France after Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille, and Toulouse.\nBordeaux and 27 suburban municipalities form the Bordeaux Metropolis, an indirectly elected metropolitan authority now in charge of wider metropolitan issues. The Bordeaux Metropolis, with a population of 819,604 at the January 2020 census, is the fifth most populated metropolitan council in France after those of Paris, Marseille, Lyon and Lille.\nBordeaux is a world capital of wine: many ch\u00e2teaux and vineyards stand on the hillsides of the Gironde, and the city is home to the world's main wine fair, Vinexpo. Bordeaux is also one of the centers of gastronomy and business tourism for the organization of international congresses. It is a central and strategic hub for the aeronautics, military and space sector, home to major companies such as Dassault Aviation, ArianeGroup, Safran and Thales. The link with aviation dates back to 1910, the year the first airplane flew over the city. A crossroads of knowledge through university research, it is home to one of the only two megajoule lasers in the world, as well as a university population of more than 130,000 students within the Bordeaux Metropolis.\nBordeaux is an international tourist destination for its architectural and cultural heritage with more than 362 historic , making it, after Paris, the city with the most listed or registered monuments in France. The \"Pearl of Aquitaine\" has been voted European Destination of the year in a 2015 online poll. The metropolis has also received awards and rankings by international organizations such as in 1957, Bordeaux was awarded the Europe Prize for its efforts in transmitting the European ideal. \nIn June 2007, the Port of the Moon in historic Bordeaux was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, for its outstanding architecture and urban ensemble and in recognition of Bordeaux's international importance over the last 2000 years. Bordeaux is also ranked as a Sufficiency city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.\nHistory.\n5th century BC to 11th century AD.\nAround 300 BC, the region was the settlement of a Celtic tribe, the Bituriges Vivisci, who named the town Burdigala, probably of Aquitanian origin.\nIn 107 BC, the Battle of Burdigala was fought by the Romans who were defending the Allobroges, a Gallic tribe allied to Rome, and the Tigurini led by Divico. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the consul Lucius Cassius Longinus, was killed in battle.\nThe city came under Roman rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for tin and lead. During this period were built the amphitheatre and the monument \"Les Piliers de Tutelle\".\nIn 276 AD, it was sacked by the Vandals. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the Visigoths in 414, and the Franks in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\nIn the late 6th century AD the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish Duchy of Vasconia. Around 585 Gallactorius was made Count of Bordeaux and fought the Basques.\nIn 732, the city was plundered by the troops of Abd er Rahman who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. Duke Eudes mustered a force to engage the Umayyads, eventually engaging them in the Battle of the River Garonne somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the Battle of Poitiers and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\nIn 737, following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian duke Hunald led a rebellion to which Charles responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux. However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son Waifer replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\nDuring the last stage of the war against Aquitaine (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King Pepin the Short. Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (\"Frontiacus\", \"Franciacus\") near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (\"Wascones\"), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\nIn 778, Seguin (or Sihimin) was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke Lupo, and possibly leading to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. In 814, Seguin was made Duke of Vasconia, but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the Carolingians, sometimes the Counts of Bordeaux held the title concomitantly with that of Duke of Vasconia. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the Vikings when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845, the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count Seguin II marched on them but was captured and executed.\nAlthough the port of Bordeaux was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was threatened by Viking and Norman incursions and political instability. The restoration of the Ramnulfid Dukes of Aquitaine under William IV and his successors (known as the House of Poitiers) brought continuity of government.\n12th century to 15th century, the English era.\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux flourished once more following the marriage of El\u00e9onore, Duchess of Aquitaine and the last of the House of Poitiers, to Henry II Plantagen\u00eat, Count of Anjou and the grandson of Henry I of England, who succeeded to the English crown months after their wedding, bringing into being the vast Angevin Empire, which stretched from the Pyrenees to Ireland. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, Henry was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income, and the city benefited from imports of cloth and wheat. The belfry (Grosse Cloche) and city cathedral St-Andr\u00e9 were built, the latter in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul. Under the terms of the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny it became briefly the capital of an independent state (1362\u20131372) under Edward, the Black Prince, but after the Battle of Castillon (1453) it was annexed by France.\n15th century to 17th century.\nIn 1462, Bordeaux created a local parliament.\nBordeaux adhered to the Fronde, being effectively annexed to the Kingdom of France only in 1653, when the army of Louis XIV entered the city.\n18th century, the golden era.\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux. The Port of the Moon supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period.\nBordeaux was also a major trading centre for slaves. In total, the Bordeaux shipowners deported 150,000 Africans in some 500 expeditions.\nFrench Revolution: political disruption and loss of the most profitable colony.\nAt the beginning of the French Revolution (1789), many local revolutionaries were members of the Girondists. This Party represented the provincial bourgeoisie, favorable towards abolishing aristocratic privileges, but opposed to the Revolution's social dimension. The Gironde valley's economic value and significance was satiated by the city's commercial power which was in dire contrast to the emerging widespread poverty affecting its inhabitants. Trade and commerce were the driving factors in the region's economic prosperity, still this resulted in a significant number of locals struggling to survive on a daily basis due to lack of food and resources. This socioeconomic disparity served as fertile ground for discontent, sparking frequent episodes of mass unrest well before the tumultuous events of 1783.\nIn 1793, the Montagnards led by Robespierre and Marat came to power. Fearing a bourgeois misappropriation of the Revolution, they executed a great number of Girondists. During the purge, the local Montagnard Section renamed the city of Bordeaux \"Commune-Franklin\" (Franklin-municipality) in homage to Benjamin Franklin.\nAt the same time, in 1791, a slave revolt broke out at Saint-Domingue (current Haiti), the most profitable of the French colonies. In the lively era of the 18th century, Bordeaux emerged as a center of economic activity, particularly known at first for its successful wine trade. The city's placement along the Gironde River was very strategic, helping to facilitate the transportation of produce to markets both internationally and domestically, which led to an increase in exports and Bordeaux's economic prosperity. There was a significant transformation to the economic landscape of Bordeaux in 1785, which was spurred by the attraction of large profits, traders and merchants in Bordeaux began to turn their attention to the slave trade. This was a very important moment in the city's economic history seeing as it diversified its commercial expansion, at a serious moral cost. This introduced a new layer of difficulty to Bordeaux's economic activities. Even though it brought along significant wealth to certain segments of society, it complicated the socio-economic inconsistencies within the region. The entry into the slave trade brought even more tension within Bordeaux society. The trade exacerbated the divide between an elite with growing wealth and those living in poverty. This economic divide laid out the foundation for the mass unrest that would break out in the French Revolution.\nThree years later, the Montagnard Convention abolished slavery. In 1802, Napoleon revoked the manumission law but lost the war against the army of former slaves. In 1804, Haiti became independent. The loss of this \"Pearl\" of the West Indies generated the collapse of Bordeaux's port economy, which was dependent on the colonial trade and trade in slaves.\nTowards the end of the Peninsular War of 1814, the Duke of Wellington sent William Beresford with two divisions and seized Bordeaux, encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-Bonapartist and the majority supported the Bourbons. The British troops were treated as liberators. Distinguished historian of the French revolution Suzanne Desan explains that \"examining intricate local dynamics\" is essential to studying the Revolution by region.\n19th century, rebirth of the economy.\nFrom the Bourbon Restoration, the economy of Bordeaux was rebuilt by traders and shipowners. They engaged to construct the first bridge of Bordeaux, and customs warehouses. The shipping traffic grew through the new African colonies.\nGeorges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann, a longtime prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor Napoleon III to transform the quasi-medieval Paris into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud. Victor Hugo found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take Versailles, add Antwerp, and you have Bordeaux\".\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian war against Prussia, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. That recurred during World War I and again very briefly during World War II, when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n20th century.\nDuring World War II, Bordeaux fell under German occupation.\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, Aristides de Sousa Mendes, who granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German occupation.\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the Italian Royal Navy established BETASOM, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic from that base, which was also a major base for German U-boats as headquarters of 12th U-boat Flotilla. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n21st century, listed as World heritage.\nIn 2007, 40% of the city surface area, located around the Port of the Moon, was listed as World Heritage Site. UNESCO inscribed Bordeaux as \"an inhabited historic city, an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble, created in the age of the Enlightenment, whose values continued up to the first half of the 20th century, with more protected buildings than any other French city except Paris\".\nGeography.\nBordeaux is located close to the European Atlantic coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river Garonne, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to ocean liners through the Gironde estuary. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\nClimate.\nBordeaux's climate can be classified as oceanic (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfb\"), bordering on a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\"). However, the Trewartha climate classification system classifies the city as solely humid subtropical, due to a recent rise in temperatures related \u2013 to some degree or another \u2013 to climate change and the city's urban heat island.\nThe city enjoys cool to mild, wet winters, due to its relatively southerly latitude, and the prevalence of mild, westerly winds from the Atlantic. Its summers are warm and somewhat drier, although wet enough to avoid a Mediterranean classification. Frosts occur annually, but snowfall is quite infrequent, occurring for no more than 3\u20134 days a year. The summer of 2003 set a record with an average temperature of , while February 1956 was the coldest month on record with an average temperature of \u22122.00\u00a0\u00b0C at Bordeaux M\u00e9rignac-Airport.\nEconomy.\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\nWine.\nThe vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.\nBordeaux wine growing area has about of vineyards, 57 appellations, 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960\u00a0million bottles, the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five \"premier cru\" (First Growth) red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855:\nBoth red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.\nWhite Bordeaux is made from Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon, and Muscadelle. Sauternes is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nBecause of a wine glut (wine lake) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\nThe Cit\u00e9 du Vin, a museum as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and academic seminars on the theme of wine opened its doors in June 2016.\nOthers.\nThe Laser M\u00e9gajoule is one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing fundamental research and development of laser and plasma technologies.\nSome 15,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including Dassault, EADS Sogerma, Snecma, Thales, SNPE, and others. The Dassault Falcon private jets are built there as well as the military aircraft Rafale and Mirage 2000, the Airbus A380 cockpit, the boosters of Ariane 5, and the M51 SLBM missile.\nTourism, especially wine tourism, is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015. Gourmet Touring is a tourism company operating in the Bordeaux wine region.\nAccess to the port from the Atlantic is via the Gironde estuary. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\nMajor companies.\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\nPopulation.\nIn January 2020, there were 259,809 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux. The commune (including Caud\u00e9ran which was annexed by Bordeaux in 1965) had its largest population of 284,494 at the 1954 census. The majority of the population is French, but there are sizable groups of Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Turks, Germans.\nThe built-up area has grown for more than a century beyond the municipal borders of Bordeaux due to the small size of the commune () and urban sprawl. By January 2020 there were 1,376,375 people living in the overall metropolitan area (\"aire d'attraction\") of Bordeaux, only a fifth of whom lived in the city proper.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPolitics.\nMunicipal administration.\nThe Mayor of the city is the environmentalist Pierre Hurmic.\nBordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the Gironde and Aquitaine.\nThe town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux M\u00e9riadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.\nThe number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 250,000 and less than 299,999 so the number of municipal councilors is 65. They are divided according to the following composition:\nMayors of Bordeaux.\nSince the Liberation (1944), there have been six mayors of Bordeaux:\nElections.\nPresidential elections of 2007.\nAt the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the UMP. Then came Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 22.01%, followed by Jean-Marie Le Pen who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected President of the Republic with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\nParliamentary elections of 2007.\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. After the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate B\u00e9atrice Desaigues. In the second round, it was Chantal Bourragu\u00e9 who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea Alain Jupp\u00e9 confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\nMunicipal elections of 2008.\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist Alain Rousset. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and Mich\u00e8le Delaunay in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62 percent, far ahead of Alain Rousset who garnered 34.14 percent of the vote. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\nEuropean elections of 2009.\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n2017 elections.\nBordeaux voted for Emmanuel Macron in the presidential election. In the 2017 parliamentary election, La R\u00e9publique En Marche! won most of the constituencies in Bordeaux.\n2019 European elections.\nBordeaux voted in the 2019 European Parliament election in France.\nMunicipal elections of 2020.\nAfter 73 years of right-of-centre rule, the ecologist Pierre Hurmic (EELV) came in ahead of Nicolas Florian (LR/LaREM).\nParliamentary representation.\nThe city area is represented by the following constituencies: Gironde's 1st, Gironde's 2nd, Gironde's 3rd, Gironde's 4th, Gironde's 5th, Gironde's 6th, Gironde's 7th.\nEducation.\nUniversity.\nDuring Antiquity, a first university had been created by the Romans in 286. The city was an important administrative centre and the new university had to train administrators. Only rhetoric and grammar were taught. Ausonius and Sulpicius Severus were two of the teachers.\nIn 1441, when Bordeaux was an English town, the Pope Eugene IV created a university by demand of the archbishop Pey Berland. In 1793, during the French Revolution, the National Convention abolished the university, and replace them with the \u00c9cole centrale in 1796. In Bordeaux, this one was located in the former buildings of the college of Guyenne. In 1808, the university reappeared with Napoleon. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235\u00a0ha).\nSchools.\nBordeaux has numerous public and private schools offering undergraduate and postgraduate programs.\nEngineering schools:\nBusiness and management schools:\nOther:\nWeekend education.\nThe , a part-time Japanese supplementary school, is held in the \"Salle de L'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e Municipal\" in Bordeaux.\nAttractions and tourism.\nIn October 2021, Bordeaux was shortlisted for the European Commission's 2022 European Capital of Smart Tourism award along with Copenhagen, Dublin, Florence, Ljubljana, Palma de Mallorca, and Valencia.\nHeritage and architecture.\nBordeaux is classified \"City of Art and History\". The city is home to 362 \"monuments historiques\" (national heritage sites), with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux's Port of the Moon has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as \"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\".\nBordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after Nancy, to have entered an era of urbanism and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King Louis XV, under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first Nicolas-Fran\u00e7ois Dupr\u00e9 de Saint-Maur then the Marquis de Tourny.\nSaint-Andr\u00e9 Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France. The organ in Saint-Louis-des-Chartrons is registered on the French monuments historiques.\nNotable historic buildings include:\nContemporary buildings in contemporary architectural style include:\nSlavery memorials.\nSlavery was part of a growing drive for the city. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important slave port, which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners. Secondly, even though the \"Triangular trade\" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa). And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from Aquitaine. They prospered with plantations incomes, until the first slave revolts which concluded in 1848 in the final abolition of slavery in France.\nA statue of Modeste Testas, an Ethiopian woman who was enslaved by the Bordeaux-based Testas brothers was unveiled in 2019. She was trafficked by them from West Africa, to Philadelphia (where one of the brothers coerced her to have two children by him) and was ultimately freed and lived in Haiti. The bronze sculpture was created by the Haitian artists Woodly Caymitte.\nA number of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the Museum of Aquitaine opened the spaces dedicated to \"Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery\". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.\nThe region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent abolitionists, as Montesquieu, Laffon de Lad\u00e9bat and Elis\u00e9e Reclus. Others were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks as the revolutionaries Boyer-Fonfr\u00e8de, Gensonn\u00e9, Guadet and Ducos.\nPont Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nEurope's longest and tallest vertical-lift bridge, the Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is , weighs 4,600 tons and can be lifted vertically up to to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160\u00a0million bridge was inaugurated by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who was a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Bordeaux.\nShopping.\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is Rue Sainte-Catherine. This pedestrianised street has of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. Rue Sainte-Catherine starts at Place de la Victoire and ends at Place de la Com\u00e9die by the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards Place de la Com\u00e9die and the nearby Cours de l'Intendance is where there are the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\nCulture.\nBordeaux is the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, \"Arc en r\u00eave\". \nThe city has a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year. \nThe Bordeaux International Festival of Women in Cinema (Festival international du cin\u00e9ma au f\u00e9minin de Bordeaux) took place in Bordeaux from 2002 until 2005. The Festival international du film ind\u00e9pendant de Bordeaux (Fifib or FIFIB), or Bordeaux International Independent Film Festival, was established in 2012. \nTransport.\nRoad.\nBordeaux is an important road and motorway junction. The city is connected to Paris by the A10 motorway, with Lyon by the A89, with Toulouse by the A62, and with Spain by the A63. There is a ring road called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the Garonne, the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the Pont d'Aquitaine, a suspension bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring-road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas, was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a vertical-lift bridge with a height in closed position comparable to that of Pont de pierre, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine when open. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well. Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. Cycle lanes and bus lanes that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid bicycle-sharing system with automated stations was established in 2010.\nRail.\nThe main railway station, Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean, near the center of the city, has 12\u00a0million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (SNCF) railway's high speed train, the TGV, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam, Cologne, Geneva and London. The TGV also serves Toulouse and Irun (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to Nantes, Nice, Marseille and Lyon. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (TER) operated by the SNCF to Arcachon, Limoges, Agen, P\u00e9rigueux, Langon, Pau, Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and Bayonne.\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by Gustave Eiffel, to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at . During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\nThe LGV Sud Europe Atlantique became fully operational in July 2017, shortening the journey time from Bordeaux city to Paris to 2hrs 4mins.\nAir.\nBordeaux is served by Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport, located from the city centre in the suburban city of M\u00e9rignac.\nTrams, buses and boats.\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\nThis network is operated from 5\u00a0am to 2\u00a0am.\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the Tramway de Bordeaux system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses Alstom APS a form of ground-level power supply technology developed by French company Alstom and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with limited access for cars.\nThe Bordeaux Tramway system reached the M\u00e9rignac airport on April 29th 2023 with the opening of a 5-km extension of Line A.\nTaxis.\nThere are more than 400 taxicabs in Bordeaux.\nPublic transportation statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 13 min, while 15.5% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 8% travel for over in a single direction.\nSport.\nThe 41,458-capacity Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the Stade Chaban-Delmas, which was a venue for the FIFA World Cup in 1938 and 1998, as well as the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In the 1938 FIFA World Cup, it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the Battle of Bordeaux. The ground was formerly known as the \"Stade du Parc Lescure\" until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, Jacques Chaban-Delmas.\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, Girondins de Bordeaux is the football team who, following administrative relegation, currently play in Championnat National 2, the fourth tier of French football. They are one of the most successful clubs in France, with six Division 1/Ligue 1 titles. Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles is a rugby team in the Top 14 in the Ligue Nationale de Rugby. Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\nOther sports clubs include top flight ice hockey team Boxers de Bordeaux and third-tier basketball team JSA Bordeaux Basket\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest cricket teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\nThere is a wooden velodrome, V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of UCI Track Cycling World Cup events.\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in tenth place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in second.\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Jean Behra and Maurice Trintignant.\nNotable people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nInternational relationships.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nBordeaux is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPartnerships.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4098", "revid": "51058057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4098", "title": "Puzzle Bobble", "text": "1994 video game\n formerly known internationally as Bust-A-Move, is a 1994 tile-matching puzzle video game developed and published by Taito for arcades. It is based on the 1986 arcade game \"Bubble Bobble\", featuring characters and themes from that game. Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home systems.\nGameplay.\nAt the start of each round, the rectangular playing arena contains a prearranged pattern of colored \"bubbles\". At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a \"pointer\", which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The color of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen.\nThe objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line. Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear. The arcade version of the game consists of 30 levels. The fired bubbles travel in straight lines (possibly bouncing off the sidewalls of the arena), stopping when they touch other bubbles or reach the top of the arena. If a bubble touches identically colored bubbles, forming a group of three or more, those bubbles\u2014as well as any bubbles hanging from them\u2014are removed from the field of play, and points are awarded. After every few shots, the \"ceiling\" of the playing arena drops downwards slightly, along with all the bubbles stuck to it. The number of shots between each drop of the ceiling is influenced by the number of bubble colors remaining. The closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the game is over.\nRelease.\nTwo different versions of the original game were released. \"Puzzle Bobble\" was originally released in Japan in June 1994 by Taito, running on Taito B System hardware (with the preliminary title \"Bubble Buster\"). On December 21, 1994, it was released on SNK's Neo Geo MVS arcade system in Japan and North America; this version is almost identical aside from being in stereo and having some different sound effects and translated text.\nReception.\nIn Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed the Neo Geo version of \"Puzzle Bobble\" as the second most popular arcade game of February 1995. It went on to become Japan's second highest-grossing arcade printed circuit board (PCB) software of 1995, below \"Virtua Fighter 2\". In North America, \"RePlay\" reported the Neo Geo version of \"Puzzle Bobble\" to be the fourth most popular arcade game of February 1995.\nReviewing the Super NES version, Mike Weigand of \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" called it \"a thoroughly enjoyable and incredibly addicting puzzle game\". He considered the two player mode the highlight, but also said that the one player mode provides a solid challenge. \"GamePro\" gave it a generally negative review, saying it starts out fun but that ultimately lacks intricacy and longevity. They elaborated that in one player mode all the levels feel the same, and that two player matches are over too quickly to build up any excitement. They also criticized the lack of any 3D effects in the graphics. \"Next Generation\" reviewed the SNES version of the game and called it \"addictive as hell\".\nA reviewer for \"Next Generation\", while questioning the continued viability of the action puzzle genre, admitted that the game is \"very simple and \"very\" addictive\". He remarked that though the 3DO version makes no significant additions, none are called for by a game with such simple enjoyment. \"GamePro\"'s brief review of the 3DO version commented that the game's controls are responsive, and they also praised visuals and music. \"Edge\" magazine ranked the game 73rd on their 100 Best Video Games in 2007. \"IGN\" rated the SNES version 54th in its Top 100 SNES Games.\nLegacy.\nThe simplicity of the concept has led to many clones, both commercial and otherwise. 1996's \"Snood\" replaced the bubbles with small creatures and has been successful in its own right. \"Worms Blast\" was Team 17's take on the concept. On September 24, 2000, British game publisher Empire Interactive released a similar game, \"Spin Jam\", for the original PlayStation console. Mobile clones include \"Bubble Witch Saga\" and \"Bubble Shooter\". \"Frozen Bubble\" is a free software clone. For \"Bubble Bobble\"'s 35th anniversary, Taito launched \"Puzzle Bobble VR: Vacation Odyssey\" on the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2, later coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 as \"Puzzle Bobble 3D: Vacation Odyssey\" in 2021.\"\n\"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!\".\n\"Puzzle Bobble Everybubble!\" was released on May 23, 2023, for Nintendo Switch. The game also comes with an extra mode called \"\"Puzzle Bobble\" vs. \"Space Invaders\"\", where up to four players can work together to erase bubble-encased invaders before they reach the player while only being able to aim straight up.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4099", "revid": "51052450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4099", "title": "Bone", "text": "Rigid organs of the skeleton of vertebrates\nA bone is a rigid organ that constitutes part of the skeleton in most vertebrate animals. Bones protect the organs of the body, produce red and white blood cells, store minerals, help regulate acid-base homeostasis, provide structure and support for the body, and enable mobility and hearing. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have complex internal and external structures.\nBone tissue (also known as osseous tissue or bone in the uncountable) is a form of hard tissue, specialised connective tissue that is mineralized and has an intercellular honeycomb-like matrix, which helps to give the bone rigidity. Bone tissue is made up of different types of bone cells: osteoblasts and osteocytes (bone formation and mineralisation); osteoclasts (bone resorption); modified or flattened osteoblasts (lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface). The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly ossein, a form of collagen, and an inorganic component of bone mineral, made up of various salts. Bone tissue comprises cortical bone and cancellous bone, although bones may also contain other kinds of tissue including bone marrow, endosteum, periosteum, nerves, blood vessels, and cartilage.\nIn the human body at birth, approximately 300 bones are present. Many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small sesamoid bones. The largest bone in the body is the femur or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the \"stapes\" in the middle ear.\nThe Ancient Greek word for bone is \u1f40\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd (\"osteon\"). In anatomical terminology, including in the \"Terminologia Anatomica\", the word for a bone is \"os\" (for example, \"os breve\", \"os longum\", \"os sesamoideum\").\nGross anatomy.\nFive types of bones are found in the human body: long, short, flat, irregular, and sesamoid.\nTerminology.\nAnatomists use a number of anatomical terms to describe the appearance, shape and function of bones. Like other anatomical terms, many of these derive from Latin and Greek. Some anatomists still use Latin to refer to bones. The term \"osseous\", and the prefix \"osteo-\", referring to things related to bone, are still used commonly today.\nSome examples of terms used to describe bones include the term \"foramen\" to describe a hole through which something passes, and a \"canal\" or \"meatus\" to describe a tunnel-like structure. A protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms, including a \"condyle\", \"crest\", \"spine\", \"eminence\", \"tubercle\" or \"tuberosity\", depending on the protrusion's shape and location. In general, long bones are said to have a \"head\", \"neck\", and \"body\".\nWhen two bones join, they are said to \"articulate\". If the two bones have a fibrous connection and are relatively immobile, then the joint is called a \"suture\".\nFunctions.\nMechanical.\nBones serve a variety of mechanical functions. Together the bones in the body form the skeleton. They provide a frame to keep the body supported, and an attachment point for skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints, which function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space (the interaction between bone and muscle is studied in biomechanics).\nBones protect internal organs, such as the skull protecting the brain or the ribs protecting the heart and lungs. Because of the way that bone is formed, bone has a high compressive strength of about , poor tensile strength of 104\u2013121 MPa, and a very low shear stress strength (51.6 MPa). This means that bone resists pushing (compressional) stress well, resist pulling (tensional) stress less well, but only poorly resists shear stress (such as due to torsional loads). While bone is essentially brittle, bone does have a significant degree of elasticity, contributed chiefly by collagen.\nMechanically, bones also have a special role in hearing. The ossicles are three small bones in the middle ear which are involved in sound transduction.\nSynthetic.\nThe cancellous part of bones contain bone marrow. Bone marrow produces blood cells in a process called hematopoiesis. Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. Progenitor cells such as the hematopoietic stem cell divide in a process called mitosis to produce precursor cells. These include precursors which eventually give rise to white blood cells, and erythroblasts which give rise to red blood cells. Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called megakaryocytes. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the circulation. Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50\u2013100 billion granulocytes are produced in this way.\nAs well as creating cells, bone marrow is also one of the major sites where defective or aged red blood cells are destroyed.\nMetabolic.\nDetermined by the species, age, and the type of bone, bone cells make up to 15 percent of the bone. Growth factor storage\u2014mineralized bone matrix stores important growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors, transforming growth factor, bone morphogenetic proteins and others.\nTissue.\nBone is not uniformly solid, but consists of a flexible matrix (about 30%) and bound minerals (about 70%), which are intricately woven and continuously remodeled by a group of specialized bone cells. Their unique composition and design allows bones to be relatively hard and strong, while remaining lightweight. Bone matrix is 90 to 95% composed of elastic collagen fibers, also known as ossein, and the remainder is ground substance. The elasticity of collagen improves fracture resistance. The matrix is hardened by the binding of inorganic mineral salt, calcium phosphate, in a chemical arrangement known as bone mineral, a form of calcium apatite. It is the mineralisation that gives bones rigidity.\nWithin any single bone, the tissue is woven into two main patterns: cortical and cancellous bone, each with distinct appearances and characteristics. Bone is actively constructed and remodeled throughout life by specialized bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteoclasts. \nCortex.\nThe hard outer layer of bones is composed of cortical bone, which is also called compact bone as it is much denser than cancellous bone. It forms the hard exterior (cortex) of bones. The cortical bone gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human skeleton. It facilitates bone's main functions\u2014to support the whole body, to protect organs, to provide levers for movement, and to store and release chemical elements, mainly calcium. It consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an osteon or Haversian system. Each column is multiple layers of osteoblasts and osteocytes around a central canal called the osteonic canal. Volkmann's canals at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a periosteum on its outer surface, and an endosteum on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cortical bone is the osteon.\nTrabeculae.\nCancellous bone or spongy bone, also known as trabecular bone, is the internal tissue of the skeletal bone and is an open cell porous network that follows the material properties of biofoams. Cancellous bone has a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio than cortical bone and it is less dense. This makes it weaker and more flexible. The greater surface area also makes it suitable for metabolic activities such as the exchange of calcium ions. Cancellous bone is typically found at the ends of long bones, near joints, and in the interior of vertebrae. Cancellous bone is highly vascular and often contains red bone marrow where hematopoiesis, the production of blood cells, occurs. The primary anatomical and functional unit of cancellous bone is the trabecula. The trabeculae are aligned towards the mechanical load distribution that a bone experiences within long bones such as the femur. As far as short bones are concerned, trabecular alignment has been studied in the vertebral pedicle. Thin formations of osteoblasts covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces, known as trabeculae. Within these spaces are bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells that give rise to platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. Trabecular marrow is composed of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow. Trabecular bone accounts for the remaining 20% of total bone mass but has nearly ten times the surface area of compact bone.\nThe words \"cancellous\" and \"trabecular\" refer to the tiny lattice-shaped units (trabeculae) that form the tissue. It was first illustrated accurately in the engravings of Cris\u00f3stomo Martinez.\nMarrow.\nBone marrow, also known as myeloid tissue in red bone marrow, can be found in almost any bone that holds cancellous tissue. In newborns, all such bones are filled exclusively with red marrow or hematopoietic marrow, but as the child ages the hematopoietic fraction decreases in quantity and the fatty/ yellow fraction called marrow adipose tissue (MAT) increases in quantity. In adults, red marrow is mostly found in the bone marrow of the femur, the ribs, the vertebrae and pelvic bones.\nVascular supply.\nBone receives about 10% of cardiac output. Blood enters the endosteum, flows through the marrow, and exits through small vessels in the cortex. In humans, blood oxygen tension in bone marrow is about 6.6%, compared to about 12% in arterial blood, and 5% in venous and capillary blood.\nHistology and physiology.\nBone is metabolically active tissue composed of several types of cells. These cells include osteoblasts, which are involved in the creation and mineralization of bone tissue, osteocytes, and osteoclasts, which are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are derived from osteoprogenitor cells, but osteoclasts are derived from the same cells that differentiate to form macrophages and monocytes. Within the marrow of the bone there are also hematopoietic stem cells. These cells give rise to other cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.\nOsteoblast.\nOsteoblasts are mononucleate bone-forming cells. They are located on the surface of osteon seams and make a protein mixture known as osteoid, which mineralizes to become bone. The osteoid seam is a narrow region of a newly formed organic matrix, not yet mineralized, located on the surface of a bone. Osteoid is primarily composed of Type I collagen. Osteoblasts also manufacture hormones, such as prostaglandins, to act on the bone itself. The osteoblast creates and repairs new bone by actually building around itself. First, the osteoblast puts up collagen fibers. These collagen fibers are used as a framework for the osteoblasts' work. The osteoblast then deposits calcium phosphate which is hardened by hydroxide and bicarbonate ions. The brand-new bone created by the osteoblast is called osteoid. Once the osteoblast is finished working it is actually trapped inside the bone once it hardens. When the osteoblast becomes trapped, it becomes known as an osteocyte. Other osteoblasts remain on the top of the new bone and are used to protect the underlying bone, these become known as bone lining cells.\nOsteocyte.\nOsteocytes are cells of mesenchymal origin and originate from osteoblasts that have migrated into and become trapped and surrounded by a bone matrix that they themselves produced. The spaces the cell body of osteocytes occupy within the mineralized collagen type I matrix are known as lacunae, while the osteocyte cell processes occupy channels called canaliculi. The many processes of osteocytes reach out to meet osteoblasts, osteoclasts, bone lining cells, and other osteocytes probably for the purposes of communication. Osteocytes remain in contact with other osteocytes in the bone through gap junctions\u2014coupled cell processes which pass through the canalicular channels.\nOsteoclast.\nOsteoclasts are very large multinucleate cells that are responsible for the breakdown of bones by the process of bone resorption. New bone is then formed by the osteoblasts. Bone is constantly remodeled by the resorption of osteoclasts and created by osteoblasts. Osteoclasts are large cells with multiple nuclei located on bone surfaces in what are called \"Howship's lacunae\" (or \"resorption pits\"). These lacunae are the result of surrounding bone tissue that has been reabsorbed. Because the osteoclasts are derived from a monocyte stem-cell lineage, they are equipped with phagocytic-like mechanisms similar to circulating macrophages. Osteoclasts mature and/or migrate to discrete bone surfaces. Upon arrival, active enzymes, such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, are secreted against the mineral substrate. The reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts also plays a role in calcium homeostasis.\nComposition.\nBones consist of living cells (osteoblasts and osteocytes) embedded in a mineralized organic matrix. The primary inorganic component of human bone is hydroxyapatite, the dominant bone mineral, having the nominal composition of Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The organic components of this matrix consist mainly of type I collagen\u2014\"organic\" referring to materials produced as a result of the human body\u2014and inorganic components, which alongside the dominant hydroxyapatite phase, include other compounds of calcium and phosphate including salts. Approximately 30% of the acellular component of bone consists of organic matter, while roughly 70% by mass is attributed to the inorganic phase. The collagen fibers give bone its tensile strength, and the interspersed crystals of hydroxyapatite give bone its compressive strength. These effects are synergistic. The exact composition of the matrix may be subject to change over time due to nutrition and biomineralization, with the ratio of calcium to phosphate varying between 1.3 and 2.0 (per weight), and trace minerals such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and carbonate also be found.\nType I collagen composes 90\u201395% of the organic matrix, with the remainder of the matrix being a homogenous liquid called ground substance consisting of proteoglycans such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, as well as non-collagenous proteins such as osteocalcin, osteopontin or bone sialoprotein. Collagen consists of strands of repeating units, which give bone tensile strength, and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents shear stress. The function of ground substance is not fully known. Two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen: woven and lamellar.\nWoven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which occurs initially in all fetal bones, but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone. In adults, woven bone is created after fractures or in Paget's disease. Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed \"woven\". It is soon replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in concentric sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar bone, which makes its first appearance in humans in the fetus during the third trimester, is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons). In cross-section, the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like in plywood, assisting in the bone's ability to resist torsion forces. After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as \"bony substitution\". Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2\u00a0\u03bcm per day. Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers.\nDeposition.\nThe extracellular matrix of bone is laid down by osteoblasts, which secrete both collagen and ground substance. These cells synthesise collagen alpha polypeptide chains and then secrete collagen molecules. The collagen molecules associate with their neighbors and crosslink via lysyl oxidase to form collagen fibrils. At this stage, they are not yet mineralized, and this zone of unmineralized collagen fibrils is called \"osteoid\". Around and inside collagen fibrils calcium and phosphate eventually precipitate within days to weeks becoming then fully mineralized bone with an overall carbonate substituted hydroxyapatite inorganic phase.\nIn order to mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete alkaline phosphatase, some of which is carried by vesicles. This cleaves the inhibitory pyrophosphate and simultaneously generates free phosphate ions for mineralization, acting as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition. Vesicles may initiate some of the early mineralization events by rupturing and acting as a centre for crystals to grow on. Bone mineral may be formed from globular and plate structures, and via initially amorphous phases.\nDevelopment.\nThe formation of bone is called ossification. During the fetal stage of development this occurs by two processes: intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone from connective tissue whereas endochondral ossification involves the formation of bone from cartilage.\nIntramembranous ossification mainly occurs during formation of the flat bones of the skull but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as mesenchyme tissue rather than from cartilage. The process includes: the development of the ossification center, calcification, trabeculae formation and the development of the periosteum.\nEndochondral ossification occurs in long bones and most other bones in the body; it involves the development of bone from cartilage. This process includes the development of a cartilage model, its growth and development, development of the primary and secondary ossification centers, and the formation of articular cartilage and the epiphyseal plates.\nEndochondral ossification begins with points in the cartilage called \"primary ossification centers\". They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after birth. They are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. Secondary ossification occurs after birth and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the epiphyseal plate). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion are still cartilaginous.\nThe following steps are followed in the conversion of cartilage to bone:\nBone development in youth is extremely important in preventing future complications of the skeletal system. Regular exercise during childhood and adolescence can help improve bone architecture, making bones more resilient and less prone to fractures in adulthood. Physical activity, specifically resistance training, stimulates growth of bones by increasing both bone density and strength. Studies have shown a positive correlation between the adaptations of resistance training and bone density. While nutritional and pharmacological approaches may also improve bone health, the strength and balance adaptations from resistance training are a substantial added benefit. Weight-bearing exercise may assist in osteoblast (bone-forming cells) formation and help to increase bone mineral content. High-impact sports, which involve quick changes in direction, jumping, and running, are particularly effective with stimulating bone growth in the youth. Sports such as soccer, basketball, and tennis have shown to have positive effects on bone mineral density as well as bone mineral content in teenagers. Engaging in physical activity during childhood years, particularly in these high-impact osteogenic sports, can help to positively influence bone mineral density in adulthood. Children and adolescents who participate in regular physical activity will place the groundwork for bone health later in life, reducing the risk of bone-related conditions such as osteoporosis.\nRemodeling.\nBone is constantly being created and replaced in a process known as remodeling. This ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape. This is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Cells are stimulated by a variety of signals, and together referred to as a remodeling unit. Approximately 10% of the skeletal mass of an adult is remodelled each year. The purpose of remodeling is to regulate calcium homeostasis, repair microdamaged bones from everyday stress, and to shape the skeleton during growth. Repeated stress, such as weight-bearing exercise or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress (Wolff's law). It has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone's piezoelectric properties, which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress.\nThe action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are controlled by a number of chemical enzymes that either promote or inhibit the activity of the bone remodeling cells, controlling the rate at which bone is made, destroyed, or changed in shape. The cells also use paracrine signalling to control the activity of each other. For example, the rate at which osteoclasts resorb bone is inhibited by calcitonin and osteoprotegerin. Calcitonin is produced by parafollicular cells in the thyroid gland, and can bind to receptors on osteoclasts to directly inhibit osteoclast activity. Osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind RANK-L, inhibiting osteoclast stimulation.\nOsteoblasts can also be stimulated to increase bone mass through increased secretion of osteoid and by inhibiting the ability of osteoclasts to break down osseous tissue. Increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of growth hormone by the pituitary, thyroid hormone and the sex hormones (estrogens and androgens). These hormones also promote increased secretion of osteoprotegerin. Osteoblasts can also be induced to secrete a number of cytokines that promote reabsorption of bone by stimulating osteoclast activity and differentiation from progenitor cells. Vitamin D, parathyroid hormone and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of RANK-ligand and interleukin 6, which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts. These same compounds also increase secretion of macrophage colony-stimulating factor by osteoblasts, which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and decrease secretion of osteoprotegerin.\nVolume.\nBone volume is determined by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption. Certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity. Numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures. These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Evidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the bone matrix. The release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors. Essentially, bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation. Cancellous bone volume in postmenopausal osteoporosis may be determined by the relationship between the total bone forming surface and the percent of surface resorption.\nClinical significance.\nA number of diseases can affect bone, including arthritis, fractures, infections, osteoporosis and tumors. Conditions relating to bone can be managed by a variety of doctors, including rheumatologists for joints, and orthopedic surgeons, who may conduct surgery to fix broken bones. Other doctors, such as rehabilitation specialists may be involved in recovery, radiologists in interpreting the findings on imaging, and pathologists in investigating the cause of the disease, and family doctors may play a role in preventing complications of bone disease such as osteoporosis.\nWhen a doctor sees a patient, a history and exam will be taken. Bones are then often imaged, called radiography. This might include ultrasound X-ray, CT scan, MRI scan and other imaging such as a Bone scan, which may be used to investigate cancer. Other tests such as a blood test for autoimmune markers may be taken, or a synovial fluid aspirate may be taken.\nFractures.\nIn normal bone, fractures occur when there is significant force applied or repetitive trauma over a long time. Fractures can also occur when a bone is weakened, such as with osteoporosis, or when there is a structural problem, such as when the bone remodels excessively (such as Paget's disease) or is the site of the growth of cancer. Common fractures include wrist fractures and hip fractures, associated with osteoporosis, vertebral fractures associated with high-energy trauma and cancer, and fractures of long-bones. Not all fractures are painful. When serious, depending on the fractures type and location, complications may include flail chest, compartment syndromes or fat embolism.\nCompound fractures involve the bone's penetration through the skin. Some complex fractures can be treated by the use of bone grafting procedures that replace missing bone portions.\nFractures and their underlying causes can be investigated by X-rays, CT scans and MRIs. Fractures are described by their location and shape, and several classification systems exist, depending on the location of the fracture. A common long bone fracture in children is a Salter\u2013Harris fracture. When fractures are managed, pain relief is often given, and the fractured area is often immobilised. This is to promote bone healing. In addition, surgical measures such as internal fixation may be used. Because of the immobilisation, people with fractures are often advised to undergo rehabilitation.\nTumors.\nTumor that can affect bone in several ways. Examples of benign bone tumors include osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteochondroma, osteoblastoma, enchondroma, giant-cell tumor of bone, and aneurysmal bone cyst.\nCancer.\nCancer can arise in bone tissue, and bones are also a common site for other cancers to spread (metastasise) to. Cancers that arise in bone are called \"primary\" cancers, although such cancers are rare. Metastases within bone are \"secondary\" cancers, with the most common being breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and kidney cancer. Secondary cancers that affect bone can either destroy bone (called a \"lytic\" cancer) or create bone (a \"sclerotic\" cancer). Cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue, examples including leukemia and multiple myeloma. Bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body. Cancers in other parts of the body may release parathyroid hormone or parathyroid hormone-related peptide. This increases bone reabsorption, and can lead to bone fractures.\nBone tissue that is destroyed or altered as a result of cancers is distorted, weakened, and more prone to fracture. This may lead to compression of the spinal cord, destruction of the marrow resulting in bruising, bleeding and immunosuppression, and is one cause of bone pain. If the cancer is metastatic, then there might be other symptoms depending on the site of the original cancer. Some bone cancers can also be felt.\nCancers of the bone are managed according to their type, their stage, prognosis, and what symptoms they cause. Many primary cancers of bone are treated with radiotherapy. Cancers of bone marrow may be treated with chemotherapy, and other forms of targeted therapy such as immunotherapy may be used. Palliative care, which focuses on maximising a person's quality of life, may play a role in management, particularly if the likelihood of survival within five years is poor.\nDiabetes.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the insulin-producing pancreas cells causing the body to not make enough insulin. In contrast type 2 diabetes in which the body creates enough Insulin, but becomes resistant to it over time.\nChildren makeup approximately 85% of Type 1 Diabetes cases and in America there was an average 22% rise in cases over the first 24 months of the COVID-19 Pandemic. With the increase of developing some form of diabetes across all ranges continually growing the health impacts on bone development and bone health in these populations are still being researched. Most evidence suggests that diabetes, either Type 1 and Type 2, inhibits osteoblastic activity and causes both lower BMD and BMC in both adults and children. The weakening of these developmental aspects is thought to lead to an increased risk of developing many diseases such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, osteopenia and fractures. Development of any of these diseases is thought to be correlated with a decrease in ability to perform in athletic environments and activities of daily living.\nFocusing on therapies that target molecules like osteocalcin or AGEs could provide new ways to improve bone health and help manage the complications of diabetes more effectively.\nOsteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced bone mineral density, increasing the likelihood of fractures. Osteoporosis is defined in women by the World Health Organization as a bone mineral density of 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass, relative to the age and sex-matched average. This density is measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), with the term \"established osteoporosis\" including the presence of a fragility fracture. Osteoporosis is most common in women after menopause, when it is called \"postmenopausal osteoporosis\", but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other chronic diseases or as a result of smoking and medications, specifically glucocorticoids. Osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs. For this reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed osteoporosis and are at risk of fracture.\nOne of the most important risk factors for osteoporosis is advanced age. Accumulation of oxidative DNA damage in osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells appears to be a key factor in age-related osteoporosis.\nOsteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking, decrease alcohol consumption, exercise regularly, and have a healthy diet. Calcium and trace mineral supplements may also be advised, as may Vitamin D. When medication is used, it may include bisphosphonates, Strontium ranelate, and hormone replacement therapy.\nBone health.\nWithout strong healthy bones, humans are more at risk for different chronic diseases and fractures, with day-to-day function being more difficult with poor bone health. It is estimated that diet and exercise during childhood can impact peak bone mass as an adult nearly 20\u201340%. One study done on children with developmental coordination disorder found an increase in bone mass up to 4% and 5% in the cortical areas of the tibia alone from a 13-week training period. Peak bone mass occurs between the second and third decade of most people's lives. Studies have shown that increasing calcium stores in childhood via food intake result in significant improvements in bone-mass density and overall health, even into adulthood.\nOsteology.\nThe study of bones and teeth is referred to as osteology. It is frequently used in anthropology, archeology and forensic science for a variety of tasks. This can include determining the nutritional, health, age or injury status of the individual the bones were taken from. Preparing fleshed bones for these types of studies can involve the process of maceration.\nTypically anthropologists and archeologists study bone tools made by \"Homo sapiens\" and \"Homo neanderthalensis\". Bones can serve a number of uses such as projectile points or artistic pigments, and can also be made from external bones such as antlers.\nOther animals.\nBird skeletons are very lightweight. Their bones are smaller and thinner than those of mammals, to aid flight. Among mammals, bats come closest to birds in terms of bone density, suggesting that small dense bones are a flight adaptation. Many bird bones have little marrow due to them being hollow. A bird's beak is primarily made of bone as projections of the mandibles which are covered in keratin.\nSome bones, primarily formed separately in subcutaneous tissues, include headgears (such as bony core of horns, antlers, ossicones), osteoderm, and os penis/os clitoris. A deer's antlers are composed of bone which is an unusual example of bone being outside the skin of the animal once the velvet is shed.\nThe extinct predatory fish \"Dunkleosteus\" had sharp edges of hard exposed bone along its jaws.\nThe proportion of cortical bone that is 80% in the human skeleton may be much lower in other animals, especially in marine mammals and marine turtles, or in various Mesozoic marine reptiles, such as ichthyosaurs, among others. This proportion can vary quickly in evolution; it often increases in early stages of returns to an aquatic lifestyle, as seen in early whales and pinnipeds, among others. It subsequently decreases in pelagic taxa, which typically acquire spongy bone, but aquatic taxa that live in shallow water can retain very thick, pachyostotic, osteosclerotic, or pachyosteosclerotic bones, especially if they move slowly, like sea cows. In some cases, even marine taxa that had acquired spongy bone can revert to thicker, compact bones if they become adapted to live in shallow water, or in hypersaline (denser) water.\nMany animals, particularly herbivores, practice osteophagy\u2014the eating of bones. This is presumably carried out in order to replenish lacking phosphate.\nMany bone diseases that affect humans also affect other vertebrates\u2014an example of one disorder is skeletal fluorosis.\nSociety and culture.\nBones from slaughtered animals have a number of uses:\nTo point the bone at someone is considered bad luck in some cultures, such as Australian aborigines, such as by the Kurdaitcha.\nVarious cultures throughout history have adopted the custom of shaping an infant's head by the practice of artificial cranial deformation. A widely practised custom in China was that of foot binding to limit the normal growth of the foot.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is only recorded in the late 9th-century \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" entry for the year 829. It is given to some of the rulers of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms from the 5th century onwards who had achieved overlordship of some or all of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.\nThe rulers of Mercia were generally the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kings from the mid 7th century to the early 9th century but are not accorded the title of \"bretwalda\" by the \"Chronicle\", which had an anti-Mercian bias. The \"Annals of Wales\" continued to recognise the kings of Northumbria as \"Kings of the Saxons\" until the death of Osred I of Northumbria in 716.\nBretwaldas.\nThe \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" for 827 (corrected by historians to 829), records the conquest of Mercia by Ecgberht, King of Wessex, making him king of all England south of the Humber. Ecgberht is described as the eighth \"bretwalda\", ruler of Britain, and the eight are listed with descriptions:\nThe list is taken from Bede's list in his \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\", completed in 731, of seven kings who ruled over the southern kingdoms, with the addition of Ecgberht's name.\nEtymology.\nThe first syllable of the term \"bretwalda\" may be related to \"Briton\" or \"Britain\". The second element is taken to mean 'ruler' or 'sovereign'. Thus, one interpretation might be 'sovereign of Britain'. Otherwise, the word may be a compound containing the Old English adjective \"brytten\" ('broad', from the verb \"breotan\" meaning 'to break' or 'to disperse'), an element also found in the terms \"bryten rice\" ('kingdom'), \"bryten-grund\" ('the wide expanse of the earth') and \"bryten cyning\" ('king whose authority was widely extended').\nThe latter etymology was first suggested by John Mitchell Kemble who alluded that \"of six manuscripts in which this passage occurs, one only reads \"Bretwalda\": of the remaining five, four have \"Bryten-walda\" or \"-wealda\", and one \"Breten-anweald\", which Kemble translates as 'ruler of all these islands'; and that \"bryten-\" is a common prefix to words meaning 'wide or general dispersion' and that the similarity to the word \"bretwealh\" ('Briton') is \"merely accidental\".\nContemporary use.\nThe only contemporary use of the term \"Bretwalda\" is in manuscript A of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" for 829. Manuscript A is a recension of the original \"common stock\" of the 890s, and in the view of the historian Sarah Foot \"Bretwalda\" is unlikely to have been the original spelling. Other manuscripts of the \"Chronicle\" used similar terms such as \"Brytenwuldu\" and \"Bretenanwealda\" in the entry for 829. The term is also used in some spurious documents. \nThe historian Simon Keynes comments: \nBede's list is best understood as the product of personal reflection on his part. It is likely, in the same way, that the chronicler's use of the term \"bretwalda\" did not represent Ecgberht's succession to a recognised office, with powers and responsibilities particular to itself, but rather a flight of fancy, important to the chronicler but of no real importance in the unfolding course of political development.\nFoot argues that \"where Bede had envisaged a wide-ranging power, the chronicler appears to have conceived of an office, or wide rulership.\"\nModern interpretation by historians.\nFor some time, the existence of the word \"bretwalda\" in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", which was based in part on the list given by Bede in his \"Historia Ecclesiastica\", led historians to think that there was perhaps a \"title\" held by Anglo-Saxon overlords. This was particularly attractive as it would lay the foundations for the establishment of an English monarchy. The 20th-century historian Frank Stenton said of the Anglo-Saxon chronicler that \"his inaccuracy is more than compensated by his preservation of the English title applied to these outstanding kings\". He argued that the term \"bretwalda\" \"falls into line with the other evidence which points to the Germanic origin of the earliest English institutions\".\nOver the later 20th century, this assumption was increasingly challenged. Patrick Wormald interpreted it as \"less an objectively realized office than a subjectively perceived status\" and emphasised the partiality of its usage in favour of Southumbrian rulers. In 1991, Steven Fanning argued that \"it is unlikely that the term ever existed as a title or was in common usage in Anglo-Saxon England\". The fact that Bede never mentioned a special title for the kings in his list implies that he was unaware of one. In 1995, Simon Keynes observed that \"if Bede's concept of the Southumbrian overlord, and the chronicler's concept of the 'Bretwalda', are to be regarded as artificial constructs, which have no validity outside the context of the literary works in which they appear, we are released from the assumptions about political development which they seem to involve... we might ask whether kings in the eighth and ninth centuries were quite so obsessed with the establishment of a pan-Southumbrian state\".\nModern interpretations view the concept of \"bretwalda\" overlordship as complex and an important indicator of how a 9th-century chronicler interpreted history and attempted to insert the increasingly powerful Saxon kings into that history.\nOverlordship.\nA complex array of dominance and subservience existed during the Anglo-Saxon period. A king who used charters to grant land in another kingdom indicated such a relationship. If the other kingdom were fairly large, as when the Mercians dominated the East Anglians, the relationship would have been more equal than in the case of the Mercian dominance of the Hwicce, which was a comparatively small kingdom. Mercia was arguably the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom for much of the late 7th though 8th centuries, though Mercian kings are missing from the two main \"lists\". For Bede, Mercia was a traditional enemy of his native Northumbria and he regarded powerful kings such as the pagan Penda as standing in the way of the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. Bede omits them from his list, even though it is evident that Penda held a considerable degree of power. Similarly powerful Mercia kings such as Offa are missed out of the West Saxon \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", which sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their kings to rule over other Anglo-Saxon peoples.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

E. J. (Bertus) Brouwer. It states that for any continuous function formula_1 mapping a nonempty compact convex set to itself, there is a point formula_2 such that formula_3. The simplest forms of Brouwer's theorem are for continuous functions formula_1 from a closed interval formula_5 in the real numbers to itself or from a closed disk formula_6 to itself. A more general form than the latter is for continuous functions from a nonempty convex compact subset formula_7 of Euclidean space to itself.\nAmong hundreds of fixed-point theorems, Brouwer's is particularly well known, due in part to its use across numerous fields of mathematics. In its original field, this result is one of the key theorems characterizing the topology of Euclidean spaces, along with the Jordan curve theorem, the hairy ball theorem, the invariance of dimension and the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem. This gives it a place among the fundamental theorems of topology. The theorem is also used for proving deep results about differential equations and is covered in most introductory courses on differential geometry. It appears in unlikely fields such as game theory. In economics, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem and its extension, the Kakutani fixed-point theorem, play a central role in the proof of existence of general equilibrium in market economies as developed in the 1950s by economics Nobel prize winners Kenneth Arrow and G\u00e9rard Debreu.\nThe theorem was first studied in view of work on differential equations by the French mathematicians around Henri Poincar\u00e9 and Charles \u00c9mile Picard. Proving results such as the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem requires the use of topological methods. This work at the end of the 19th century opened into several successive versions of the theorem. The case of differentiable mappings of the \"n\"-dimensional closed ball was first proved in 1910 by Jacques Hadamard and the general case for continuous mappings by Brouwer in 1911.\nStatement.\nThe theorem has several formulations, depending on the context in which it is used and its degree of generalization. The simplest is sometimes given as follows:\n;In the plane: Every continuous function from a closed disk to itself has at least one fixed point.\nThis can be generalized to an arbitrary finite dimension:\n;In Euclidean space:Every continuous function from a closed ball of a Euclidean space into itself has a fixed point.\nA slightly more general version is as follows:\n;Convex compact set:Every continuous function from a nonempty convex compact subset \"K\" of a Euclidean space to \"K\" itself has a fixed point.\nAn even more general form is better known under a different name:\n;Schauder fixed point theorem:Every continuous function from a nonempty convex compact subset \"K\" of a Banach space to \"K\" itself has a fixed point.\nImportance of the pre-conditions.\nThe theorem holds only for functions that are \"endomorphisms\" (functions that have the same set as the domain and codomain) and for nonempty sets that are \"compact\" (thus, in particular, bounded and closed) and \"convex\" (or homeomorphic to convex). The following examples show why the pre-conditions are important.\nThe function \"f\" as an endomorphism.\nConsider the function\nformula_8\nwith domain [-1,1]. The range of the function is [0,2]. Thus, f is not an endomorphism.\nBoundedness.\nConsider the function\nformula_9\nwhich is a continuous function from formula_10 to itself. As it shifts every point to the right, it cannot have a fixed point. The space formula_10 is convex and closed, but not bounded.\nClosedness.\nConsider the function\nformula_12\nwhich is a continuous function from the open interval formula_13 to itself. Since the point formula_14 is not part of the interval, there is no point in the domain such that formula_15. The set formula_13 is convex and bounded, but not closed. On the other hand, the function formula_1 does have a fixed point in the \"closed\" interval formula_18, namely formula_14. The closed interval formula_18 is compact, the open interval formula_13 is not.\nConvexity.\nConvexity is not strictly necessary for Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. Because the properties involved (continuity, being a fixed point) are invariant under homeomorphisms, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem is equivalent to forms in which the domain is required to be a closed unit ball formula_22. For the same reason it holds for every set that is homeomorphic to a closed ball (and therefore also closed, bounded, connected, without holes, etc.).\nThe following example shows that Brouwer's fixed-point theorem does not work for domains with holes. Consider the function formula_23, which is a continuous function from the unit circle to itself. Since \"-x\u2260x\" holds for any point of the unit circle, \"f\" has no fixed point. The analogous example works for the \"n\"-dimensional sphere (or any symmetric domain that does not contain the origin). The unit circle is closed and bounded, but it has a hole (and so it is not convex) . The function \"f\" does have a fixed point for the unit disc, since it takes the origin to itself.\nA formal generalization of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem for \"hole-free\" domains can be derived from the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem.\nNotes.\nThe continuous function in this theorem is not required to be bijective or surjective.\nIllustrations.\nThe theorem has several \"real world\" illustrations. Here are some examples.\nIntuitive approach.\nExplanations attributed to Brouwer.\nThe theorem is supposed to have originated from Brouwer's observation of a cup of gourmet coffee.\nIf one stirs to dissolve a lump of sugar, it appears there is always a point without motion.\nHe drew the conclusion that at any moment, there is a point on the surface that is not moving.\nThe fixed point is not necessarily the point that seems to be motionless, since the centre of the turbulence moves a little bit.\nThe result is not intuitive, since the original fixed point may become mobile when another fixed point appears.\nBrouwer is said to have added: \"I can formulate this splendid result different, I take a horizontal sheet, and another identical one which I crumple, flatten and place on the other. Then a point of the crumpled sheet is in the same place as on the other sheet.\"\nBrouwer \"flattens\" his sheet as with a flat iron, without removing the folds and wrinkles. Unlike the coffee cup example, the crumpled paper example also demonstrates that more than one fixed point may exist. This distinguishes Brouwer's result from other fixed-point theorems, such as Stefan Banach's, that guarantee uniqueness.\nOne-dimensional case.\nIn one dimension, the result is intuitive and easy to prove. The continuous function \"f\" is defined on a closed interval [\"a\",\u00a0\"b\"] and takes values in the same interval. Saying that this function has a fixed point amounts to saying that its graph (dark green in the figure on the right) intersects that of the function defined on the same interval [\"a\",\u00a0\"b\"] which maps \"x\" to \"x\" (light green).\nIntuitively, any continuous line from the left edge of the square to the right edge must necessarily intersect the green diagonal. To prove this, consider the function \"g\" which maps \"x\" to \"f\"(\"x\")\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\"x\". It is \u2265\u00a00 on \"a\" and \u2264\u00a00 on\u00a0\"b\". By the intermediate value theorem, \"g\" has a zero in [\"a\",\u00a0\"b\"]; this zero is a fixed point.\nBrouwer is said to have expressed this as follows: \"Instead of examining a surface, we will prove the theorem about a piece of string. Let us begin with the string in an unfolded state, then refold it. Let us flatten the refolded string. Again a point of the string has not changed its position with respect to its original position on the unfolded string.\"\nHistory.\nThe Brouwer fixed point theorem was one of the early achievements of algebraic topology, and is the basis of more general fixed point theorems which are important in functional analysis. The case \"n\" = 3 first was proved by Piers Bohl in 1904 (published in \"Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik\"). It was later proved by L. E. J. Brouwer in 1909. Jacques Hadamard proved the general case in 1910, and Brouwer found a different proof in the same year. Since these early proofs were all non-constructive indirect proofs, they ran contrary to Brouwer's intuitionist ideals. Although the existence of a fixed point is not constructive in the sense of constructivism in mathematics, methods to approximate fixed points guaranteed by Brouwer's theorem are now known.\nBefore discovery.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the old problem of the stability of the solar system returned into the focus of the mathematical community.\nIts solution required new methods. As noted by Henri Poincar\u00e9, who worked on the three-body problem, there is no hope to find an exact solution: \"Nothing is more proper to give us an idea of the hardness of the three-body problem, and generally of all problems of Dynamics where there is no uniform integral and the Bohlin series diverge.\"\nHe also noted that the search for an approximate solution is no more efficient: \"the more we seek to obtain precise approximations, the more the result will diverge towards an increasing imprecision\".\nHe studied a question analogous to that of the surface movement in a cup of coffee. What can we say, in general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant flow? Poincar\u00e9 discovered that the answer can be found in what we now call the topological properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is compact, i.e. both closed and bounded, then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a limit cycle. Poincar\u00e9 went further; if the area is of the same kind as a disk, as is the case for the cup of coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time interval\u00a0\"t\". If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed, then this is not necessarily the case.\nTo understand differential equations better, a new branch of mathematics was born. Poincar\u00e9 called it \"analysis situs\". The French Encyclop\u00e6dia Universalis defines it as the branch which \"treats the properties of an object that are invariant if it is deformed in any continuous way, without tearing\". In 1886, Poincar\u00e9 proved a result that is equivalent to Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, although the connection with the subject of this article was not yet apparent. A little later, he developed one of the fundamental tools for better understanding the analysis situs, now known as the fundamental group or sometimes the Poincar\u00e9 group. This method can be used for a very compact proof of the theorem under discussion.\nPoincar\u00e9's method was analogous to that of \u00c9mile Picard, a contemporary mathematician who generalized the Cauchy\u2013Lipschitz theorem. Picard's approach is based on a result that would later be formalised by another fixed-point theorem, named after Banach. Instead of the topological properties of the domain, this theorem uses the fact that the function in question is a contraction.\nFirst proofs.\nAt the dawn of the 20th century, the interest in analysis situs did not stay unnoticed. However, the necessity of a theorem equivalent to the one discussed in this article was not yet evident. Piers Bohl, a Latvian mathematician, applied topological methods to the study of differential equations. In 1904 he proved the three-dimensional case of our theorem, but his publication was not noticed.\nIt was Brouwer, finally, who gave the theorem its first patent of nobility. His goals were different from those of Poincar\u00e9. This mathematician was inspired by the foundations of mathematics, especially mathematical logic and topology. His initial interest lay in an attempt to solve Hilbert's fifth problem. In 1909, during a voyage to Paris, he met Henri Poincar\u00e9, Jacques Hadamard, and \u00c9mile Borel. The ensuing discussions convinced Brouwer of the importance of a better understanding of Euclidean spaces, and were the origin of a fruitful exchange of letters with Hadamard. For the next four years, he concentrated on the proof of certain great theorems on this question. In 1912 he proved the hairy ball theorem for the two-dimensional sphere, as well as the fact that every continuous map from the two-dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point. These two results in themselves were not really new. As Hadamard observed, Poincar\u00e9 had shown a theorem equivalent to the hairy ball theorem. The revolutionary aspect of Brouwer's approach was his systematic use of recently developed tools such as homotopy, the underlying concept of the Poincar\u00e9 group. In the following year, Hadamard generalised the theorem under discussion to an arbitrary finite dimension, but he employed different methods. Hans Freudenthal comments on the respective roles as follows: \"Compared to Brouwer's revolutionary methods, those of Hadamard were very traditional, but Hadamard's participation in the birth of Brouwer's ideas resembles that of a midwife more than that of a mere spectator.\"\nBrouwer's approach yielded its fruits, and in 1910 he also found a proof that was valid for any finite dimension, as well as other key theorems such as the invariance of dimension. In the context of this work, Brouwer also generalized the Jordan curve theorem to arbitrary dimension and established the properties connected with the degree of a continuous mapping. This branch of mathematics, originally envisioned by Poincar\u00e9 and developed by Brouwer, changed its name. In the 1930s, analysis situs became algebraic topology.\nReception.\nThe theorem proved its worth in more than one way. During the 20th century numerous fixed-point theorems were developed, and even a branch of mathematics called fixed-point theory.\nBrouwer's theorem is probably the most important. It is also among the foundational theorems on the topology of topological manifolds and is often used to prove other important results such as the Jordan curve theorem.\nBesides the fixed-point theorems for more or less contracting functions, there are many that have emerged directly or indirectly from the result under discussion. A continuous map from a closed ball of Euclidean space to its boundary cannot be the identity on the boundary. Similarly, the Borsuk\u2013Ulam theorem says that a continuous map from the \"n\"-dimensional sphere to Rn has a pair of antipodal points that are mapped to the same point. In the finite-dimensional case, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem provided from 1926 a method for counting fixed points. In 1930, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem was generalized to Banach spaces. This generalization is known as Schauder's fixed-point theorem, a result generalized further by S. Kakutani to set-valued functions. One also meets the theorem and its variants outside topology. It can be used to prove the Hartman-Grobman theorem, which describes the qualitative behaviour of certain differential equations near certain equilibria. Similarly, Brouwer's theorem is used for the proof of the Central Limit Theorem. The theorem can also be found in existence proofs for the solutions of certain partial differential equations.\nOther areas are also touched. In game theory, John Nash used the theorem to prove that in the game of Hex there is a winning strategy for white. In economics, P. Bich explains that certain generalizations of the theorem show that its use is helpful for certain classical problems in game theory and generally for equilibria (Hotelling's law), financial equilibria and incomplete markets.\nBrouwer's celebrity is not exclusively due to his topological work. The proofs of his great topological theorems are not constructive, and Brouwer's dissatisfaction with this is partly what led him to articulate the idea of constructivity. He became the originator and zealous defender of a way of formalising mathematics that is known as intuitionism, which at the time made a stand against set theory. Brouwer disavowed his original proof of the fixed-point theorem. \nProof outlines.\nA proof using degree.\nBrouwer's original 1911 proof relied on the notion of the degree of a continuous mapping, stemming from ideas in differential topology. Several modern accounts of the proof can be found in the literature, notably .\nLet formula_24 denote the closed unit ball in formula_25 centered at the origin. Suppose for simplicity that formula_26 is continuously differentiable. A regular value of formula_1 is a point formula_28 such that the Jacobian of formula_1 is non-singular at every point of the preimage of formula_30. In particular, by the inverse function theorem, every point of the preimage of formula_1 lies in formula_32 (the interior of formula_33). The degree of formula_1 at a regular value formula_28 is defined as the sum of the signs of the Jacobian determinant of formula_1 over the preimages of formula_30 under formula_1:\nformula_39\nThe degree is, roughly speaking, the number of \"sheets\" of the preimage \"f\" lying over a small open set around \"p\", with sheets counted oppositely if they are oppositely oriented. This is thus a generalization of winding number to higher dimensions.\nThe degree satisfies the property of \"homotopy invariance\": let formula_1 and formula_41 be two continuously differentiable functions, and formula_42 for formula_43. Suppose that the point formula_30 is a regular value of formula_45 for all \"t\". Then formula_46.\nIf there is no fixed point of the boundary of formula_33, then the function \nformula_48\nis well-defined, and\nformula_49\ndefines a homotopy from the identity function to it. The identity function has degree one at every point. In particular, the identity function has degree one at the origin, so formula_41 also has degree one at the origin. As a consequence, the preimage formula_51 is not empty. The elements of formula_51 are precisely the fixed points of the original function \"f\".\nThis requires some work to make fully general. The definition of degree must be extended to singular values of \"f\", and then to continuous functions. The more modern advent of homology theory simplifies the construction of the degree, and so has become a standard proof in the literature.\nA proof using the hairy ball theorem.\nThe hairy ball theorem states that on the unit sphere \"S\" in an odd-dimensional Euclidean space, there is no nowhere-vanishing continuous tangent vector field w on \"S\". (The tangency condition means that w(x) \u22c5 x = 0 for every unit vector x.) Sometimes the theorem is expressed by the statement that \"there is always a place on the globe with no wind\". An elementary proof of the hairy ball theorem can be found in . \nIn fact, suppose first that w is \"continuously differentiable\". By scaling, it can be assumed that w is a continuously differentiable unit tangent vector on S. It can be extended radially to a small spherical shell \"A\" of \"S\". For \"t\" sufficiently small, a routine computation shows that the mapping f\"t\"(x) = x + \"t\" w(x) is a contraction mapping on \"A\" and that the volume of its image is a polynomial in \"t\". On the other hand, as a contraction mapping, f\"t\" must restrict to a homeomorphism of \"S\" onto (1 + \"t\"2) \"S\" and \"A\" onto (1 + \"t\"2) \"A\". This gives a contradiction, because, if the dimension \"n\" of the Euclidean space is odd, (1 + \"t\"2)\"n\"/2 is not a polynomial. \nIf w is only a \"continuous\" unit tangent vector on \"S\", by the Weierstrass approximation theorem, it can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial map u of \"A\" into Euclidean space. The orthogonal projection on to the tangent space is given by v(x) = u(x) - u(x) \u22c5 x. Thus v is polynomial and nowhere vanishing on \"A\"; by construction v/||v|| is a smooth unit tangent vector field on \"S\", a contradiction. \nThe continuous version of the hairy ball theorem can now be used to prove the Brouwer fixed point theorem. First suppose that \"n\" is even. If there were a fixed-point-free continuous self-mapping f of the closed unit ball \"B\" of the \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space \"V\", set\nformula_53\nSince f has no fixed points, it follows that, for x in the interior of \"B\", the vector w(x) is non-zero; and for x in \"S\", the scalar product x \u22c5 w(x) = 1 \u2013 x \u22c5 f(x) is strictly positive. From the original \"n\"-dimensional space Euclidean space \"V\", construct a new auxiliary (\"n\" + 1)-dimensional space \"W\" = \"V\" x R, with coordinates \"y\" = (x, \"t\"). Set\nformula_54\nBy construction X is a continuous vector field on the unit sphere of \"W\", satisfying the tangency condition y \u22c5 X(y)\u00a0=\u00a00. Moreover, X(y) is nowhere vanishing (because, if x has norm 1, then x \u22c5 w(\"x\") is non-zero; while if x has norm strictly less than 1, then \"t\" and w(x) are both non-zero). This contradiction proves the fixed point theorem when \"n\" is even. For \"n\" odd, one can apply the fixed point theorem to the closed unit ball \"B\" in n + 1 dimensions and the mapping F(x,\"y\") = (f(x),0).\nThe advantage of this proof is that it uses only elementary techniques; more general results like the Borsuk-Ulam theorem require tools from algebraic topology.\nA proof using homology or cohomology.\nThe proof uses the observation that the boundary of the \"n\"-disk \"D\"\"n\" is \"S\"\"n\"\u22121, the (\"n\" \u2212 1)-sphere.\nSuppose, for contradiction, that a continuous function \"f\" : \"D\"\"n\" \u2192 \"D\"\"n\" has \"no\" fixed point. This means that, for every point x in \"D\"\"n\", the points \"x\" and \"f\"(\"x\") are distinct. Because they are distinct, for every point x in \"D\"\"n\", we can construct a unique ray from \"f\"(\"x\") to \"x\" and follow the ray until it intersects the boundary \"S\"\"n\"\u22121 (see illustration). By calling this intersection point \"F\"(\"x\"), we define a function \"F\"\u00a0:\u00a0\"D\"\"n\"\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\"S\"\"n\"\u22121 sending each point in the disk to its corresponding intersection point on the boundary. As a special case, whenever \"x\" itself is on the boundary, then the intersection point \"F\"(\"x\") must be \"x\".\nConsequently, \"F\" is a special type of continuous function known as a retraction: every point of the codomain (in this case \"S\"\"n\"\u22121) is a fixed point of \"F\".\nIntuitively it seems unlikely that there could be a retraction of \"D\"\"n\" onto \"S\"\"n\"\u22121, and in the case \"n\" = 1, the impossibility is more basic, because \"S\"0 (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval \"D\"1) is not even connected. The case \"n\" = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the fundamental groups of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce a surjective group homomorphism from the fundamental group of \"D\"2 to that of \"S\"1, but the latter group is isomorphic to Z while the first group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case \"n\" = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing vector fields.\nFor \"n\" &gt; 2, however, proving the impossibility of the retraction is more difficult. One way is to make use of homology groups: the homology \"H\"\"n\"\u22121(\"D\"\"n\") is trivial, while \"H\"\"n\"\u22121(\"S\"\"n\"\u22121) is infinite cyclic. This shows that the retraction is impossible, because again the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the latter to the former group.\nThe impossibility of a retraction can also be shown using the de Rham cohomology of open subsets of Euclidean space \"E\"\"n\". For \"n\" \u2265 2, the de Rham cohomology of \"U\" = \"E\"\"n\" \u2013 (0) is one-dimensional in degree 0 and \"n\" \u2013 1, and vanishes otherwise. If a retraction existed, then \"U\" would have to be contractible and its de Rham cohomology in degree \"n\" \u2013 1 would have to vanish, a contradiction.\nA proof using Stokes' theorem.\nAs in the proof of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem for continuous maps using homology, it is reduced to proving that there is no continuous retraction \"F\" from the ball \"B\" onto its boundary \u2202\"B\". In that case it can be assumed that \"F\" is smooth, since it can be approximated using the Weierstrass approximation theorem or by convolving with non-negative smooth bump functions of sufficiently small support and integral one (i.e. mollifying). If \u03c9 is a volume form on the boundary then by Stokes' theorem,\nformula_55\ngiving a contradiction.\nMore generally, this shows that there is no smooth retraction from any non-empty smooth oriented compact manifold \"M\" onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes' theorem is closely related to the proof using homology, because the form \u03c9 generates the de Rham cohomology group \"H\"\"n\"-1(\u2202\"M\") which is isomorphic to the homology group \"H\"\"n\"-1(\u2202\"M\") by de Rham's theorem.\nA combinatorial proof.\nThe BFPT was proved by Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz using Sperner's lemma. We now give an outline of the proof for the special case in which \"f\" is a function from the standard \"n\"-simplex, formula_56 to itself, where\nformula_57\nFor every point formula_58 also formula_59 Hence the sum of their coordinates is equal:\nformula_60\nHence, by the pigeonhole principle, for every formula_58 there must be an index formula_62 such that the formula_63th coordinate of formula_64 is greater than or equal to the formula_63th coordinate of its image under \"f\":\nformula_66\nMoreover, if formula_64 lies on a \"k\"-dimensional sub-face of formula_56 then by the same argument, the index formula_63 can be selected from among the \"k\" + 1 coordinates which are not zero on this sub-face.\nWe now use this fact to construct a Sperner coloring. For every triangulation of formula_56 the color of every vertex formula_64 is an index formula_63 such that formula_73\nBy construction, this is a Sperner coloring. Hence, by Sperner's lemma, there is an \"n\"-dimensional simplex whose vertices are colored with the entire set of \"n\" + 1 available colors.\nBecause \"f\" is continuous, this simplex can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an arbitrarily fine triangulation. Hence, there must be a point formula_64 which satisfies the labeling condition in all coordinates: formula_75 for all formula_76\nBecause the sum of the coordinates of formula_64 and formula_78 must be equal, all these inequalities must actually be equalities. But this means that:\nformula_79\nThat is, formula_64 is a fixed point of formula_81\nA proof by Hirsch.\nThere is also a quick proof, by Morris Hirsch, based on the impossibility of a differentiable retraction. Let \"f\" denote a continuous map from the unit ball Dn in n-dimensional Euclidean space to itself and assume that \"f\" fixes no point. By continuity and the fact that Dn is compact, it follows that for some \u03b5 &gt; 0, \u2225x - \"f\"(x)\u2225 &gt; \u03b5 for all x in Dn. Then the map \"f\" can be approximated by a smooth map retaining the property of not fixing a point; this can be done by using the Weierstrass approximation theorem or by convolving with smooth bump functions. One then defines a retraction as above by sending each x to the point of \u2202Dn where the unique ray from x through \"f\"(x) intersects \u2202Dn, and this must now be a differentiable mapping. Such a retraction must have a non-singular value p \u2208 \u2202Dn, by Sard's theorem, which is also non-singular for the restriction to the boundary (which is just the identity). Thus the inverse image \"f\" -1(p) would be a compact 1-manifold with boundary. Such a boundary would have to contain at least two endpoints, and these would have to lie on the boundary of the original ball. This would mean that the inverse image of one point on \u2202Dn contains a different point on \u2202Dn, contradicting the definition of a retraction Dn \u2192 \u2202Dn.\nR. Bruce Kellogg, Tien-Yien Li, and James A. Yorke turned Hirsch's proof into a computable proof by observing that the retract is in fact defined everywhere except at the fixed points. For almost any point \"q\" on the boundary \u2014 assuming it is not a fixed point \u2014 the 1-manifold with boundary mentioned above does exist and the only possibility is that it leads from \"q\" to a fixed point. It is an easy numerical task to follow such a path from \"q\" to the fixed point so the method is essentially computable. gave a conceptually similar path-following version of the homotopy proof which extends to a wide variety of related problems.\nA proof using oriented area.\nA variation of the preceding proof does not employ the Sard's theorem, and goes as follows. If formula_82 is a smooth retraction, one considers the smooth deformation formula_83 and the smooth function\nformula_84\nDifferentiating under the sign of integral it is not difficult to check that \"\u03c6\u2032\"(\"t\") = 0 for all \"t\", so \"\u03c6\" is a constant function, which is a contradiction because \"\u03c6\"(0) is the \"n\"-dimensional volume of the ball, while \"\u03c6\"(1) is zero. The geometric idea is that \"\u03c6\"(\"t\") is the oriented area of \"g\"\"t\"(\"B\") (that is, the Lebesgue measure of the image of the ball via \"g\"\"t\", taking into account multiplicity and orientation), and should remain constant (as it is very clear in the one-dimensional case). On the other hand, as the parameter \"t\" passes from 0 to 1 the map \"g\"\"t\" transforms continuously from the identity map of the ball, to the retraction \"r\", which is a contradiction since the oriented area of the identity coincides with the volume of the ball, while the oriented area of \"r\" is necessarily 0, as its image is the boundary of the ball, a set of null measure.\nA proof using the game Hex.\nA quite different proof given by David Gale is based on the game of Hex. The basic theorem regarding Hex, first proven by John Nash, is that no game of Hex can end in a draw; the first player always has a winning strategy (although this theorem is nonconstructive, and explicit strategies have not been fully developed for board sizes of dimensions 10 x 10 or greater). This turns out to be equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem for dimension 2. By considering \"n\"-dimensional versions of Hex, one can prove in general that Brouwer's theorem is equivalent to the determinacy theorem for Hex.\nA proof using the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem.\nThe Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says that if a continuous map \"f\" from a finite simplicial complex \"B\" to itself has only isolated fixed points, then the number of fixed points counted with multiplicities (which may be negative) is equal to the Lefschetz number\nformula_85\nand in particular if the Lefschetz number is nonzero then \"f\" must have a fixed point. If \"B\" is a ball (or more generally is contractible) then the Lefschetz number is one because the only non-zero simplicial homology group is: formula_86 and \"f\" acts as the identity on this group, so \"f\" has a fixed point.\nA proof in a weak logical system.\nIn reverse mathematics, Brouwer's theorem can be proved in the system WKL0, and conversely over the base system RCA0 Brouwer's theorem for a square implies the weak K\u0151nig's lemma, so this gives a precise description of the strength of Brouwer's theorem.\nGeneralizations.\nThe Brouwer fixed-point theorem forms the starting point of a number of more general fixed-point theorems.\nThe straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions, i.e. using the unit ball of an arbitrary Hilbert space instead of Euclidean space, is not true. The main problem here is that the unit balls of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not compact. For example, in the Hilbert space \u21132 of square-summable real (or complex) sequences, consider the map \"f\" : \u21132 \u2192 \u21132 which sends a sequence (\"x\"\"n\") from the closed unit ball of \u21132 to the sequence (\"y\"\"n\") defined by\nformula_87\nIt is not difficult to check that this map is continuous, has its image in the unit sphere of \u21132, but does not have a fixed point.\nThe generalizations of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to infinite dimensional spaces therefore all include a compactness assumption of some sort, and also often an assumption of convexity. See fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces for a discussion of these theorems.\nThere is also finite-dimensional generalization to a larger class of spaces: If formula_88 is a product of finitely many chainable continua, then every continuous function formula_89 has a fixed point, where a chainable continuum is a (usually but in this case not necessarily metric) compact Hausdorff space of which every open cover has a finite open refinement formula_90, such that formula_91 if and only if formula_92. Examples of chainable continua include compact connected linearly ordered spaces and in particular closed intervals of real numbers.\nThe Kakutani fixed point theorem generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem in a different direction: it stays in R\"n\", but considers upper hemi-continuous set-valued functions (functions that assign to each point of the set a subset of the set). It also requires compactness and convexity of the set.\nThe Lefschetz fixed-point theorem applies to (almost) arbitrary compact topological spaces, and gives a condition in terms of singular homology that guarantees the existence of fixed points; this condition is trivially satisfied for any map in the case of \"D\"\"n\".\nEquivalent results.\nThere are several fixed-point theorems which come in three equivalent variants: an algebraic topology variant, a combinatorial variant and a set-covering variant. Each variant can be proved separately using totally different arguments, but each variant can also be reduced to the other variants in its row.

The benzoyl group is often abbreviated \"Bz\" (not to be confused with \"Bn,\" which is used for benzyl), thus benzoic acid is also denoted as BzOH, since the benzoyl group has the formula \u2013. It is the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid. The name is derived from gum benzoin, which was for a long time its only source. \nBenzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants and serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites. Salts of benzoic acid are used as food preservatives. Benzoic acid is an important precursor for the industrial synthesis of many other organic substances. The salts and esters of benzoic acid are known as benzoates ().\nHistory.\nBenzoic acid was discovered in the sixteenth century. The dry distillation of gum benzoin was first described by Nostradamus (1556), and then by Alexius Pedemontanus (1560) and Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re (1596).\nJustus von Liebig and Friedrich W\u00f6hler determined the composition of benzoic acid. These latter also investigated how hippuric acid is related to benzoic acid.\nIn 1875 Salkowski discovered the antifungal properties of benzoic acid, which explains the preservation of benzoate-containing cloudberry fruits.\nProduction.\nIndustrial preparations.\nBenzoic acid is produced commercially by partial oxidation of toluene with oxygen. The process is catalyzed by cobalt or manganese naphthenates. The process uses abundant materials, and proceeds in high yield.\nThe first industrial process involved the reaction of benzotrichloride (trichloromethyl benzene) with calcium hydroxide in water, using iron or iron salts as catalyst. The resulting calcium benzoate is converted to benzoic acid with hydrochloric acid. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum benzoin. Food-grade benzoic acid is now produced synthetically.\nLaboratory synthesis.\nBenzoic acid is cheap and readily available, so the laboratory synthesis of benzoic acid is mainly practiced for its pedagogical value. It is a common undergraduate preparation.\nBenzoic acid can be purified by recrystallization from water because of its high solubility in hot water and poor solubility in cold water. The avoidance of organic solvents for the recrystallization makes this experiment particularly safe. This process usually gives a yield of around 65%.\nBy hydrolysis.\nLike other nitriles and amides, benzonitrile and benzamide can be hydrolyzed to benzoic acid or its conjugate base in acid or basic conditions.\nFrom Grignard reagent.\nBromobenzene can be converted to benzoic acid by \"carboxylation\" of the intermediate phenylmagnesium bromide. This synthesis offers a convenient exercise for students to carry out a Grignard reaction, an important class of carbon\u2013carbon bond forming reaction in organic chemistry.\nOxidation of benzyl compounds.\nBenzyl alcohol and benzyl chloride and virtually all benzyl derivatives are readily oxidized to benzoic acid.\nUses.\nBenzoic acid is mainly consumed in the production of phenol by oxidative decarboxylation at 300\u2212400\u00a0\u00b0C:\nThe temperature required can be lowered to 200\u00a0\u00b0C by the addition of catalytic amounts of copper(II) salts. The phenol can be converted to cyclohexanol, which is a starting material for nylon synthesis.\nPrecursor to plasticizers.\nBenzoate plasticizers, such as the glycol-, diethyleneglycol-, and triethyleneglycol esters, are obtained by transesterification of methyl benzoate with the corresponding diol. These plasticizers, which are used similarly to those derived from terephthalic acid ester, represent alternatives to phthalates.\nPrecursor to sodium benzoate and related preservatives.\nBenzoic acid and its salts are used as food preservatives, represented by the E numbers E210, E211, E212, and E213. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its sodium, potassium, or calcium salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Benzoic acid, benzoates \nand their derivatives are used as preservatives for acidic foods and beverages such as citrus fruit juices (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbon dioxide), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), pickles (vinegar) and other acidified foods.\nTypical concentrations of benzoic acid as a preservative in food are between 0.05 and 0.1%. Foods in which benzoic acid may be used and maximum levels for its application are controlled by local food laws.\nConcern has been expressed that benzoic acid and its salts may react with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in some soft drinks, forming small quantities of carcinogenic benzene.\nMedicinal.\nBenzoic acid is a constituent of Whitfield's ointment which is used for the treatment of fungal skin diseases such as ringworm and athlete's foot. As the principal component of gum benzoin, benzoic acid is also a major ingredient in both tincture of benzoin and Friar's balsam. Such products have a long history of use as topical antiseptics and inhalant decongestants.\nBenzoic acid was used as an expectorant, analgesic, and antiseptic in the early 20th century.\nNiche and laboratory uses.\nIn teaching laboratories, benzoic acid is a common standard for calibrating a bomb calorimeter.\nBiology and health effects.\nBenzoic acid occurs naturally as do its esters in many plant and animal species. Appreciable amounts are found in most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several \"Vaccinium\" species (e.g., cranberry, \"V. vitis macrocarpon\"; bilberry, \"V. myrtillus\") contain as much as 0.03\u20130.13% free benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is also formed in apples after infection with the fungus \"Nectria galligena\". Among animals, benzoic acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the rock ptarmigan (\"Lagopus muta\") as well as in gland secretions of male muskoxen (\"Ovibos moschatus\") or Asian bull elephants (\"Elephas maximus\"). Gum benzoin contains up to 20% of benzoic acid and 40% benzoic acid esters.\nIn terms of its biosynthesis, benzoate is produced in plants from cinnamic acid. A pathway has been identified from phenol via 4-hydroxybenzoate.\nReactions.\nReactions of benzoic acid can occur at either the aromatic ring or at the carboxyl group.\nAromatic ring.\nElectrophilic aromatic substitution reaction will take place mainly in 3-position due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic group; i.e. benzoic acid is \"meta\" directing.\nCarboxyl group.\nReactions typical for carboxylic acids apply also to benzoic acid.\nSafety and mammalian metabolism.\nIt is excreted as hippuric acid. Benzoic acid is metabolized by butyrate-CoA ligase into an intermediate product, benzoyl-CoA, which is then metabolized by glycine \"N\"-acyltransferase into hippuric acid. Humans metabolize toluene which is also excreted as hippuric acid.\nFor humans, the World Health Organization's International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) suggests a provisional tolerable intake would be 5\u00a0mg/kg body weight per day. Cats have a significantly lower tolerance against benzoic acid and its salts than rats and mice. Lethal dose for cats can be as low as 300\u00a0mg/kg body weight. The oral LD50 for rats is 3040\u00a0mg/kg, for mice it is 1940\u20132263\u00a0mg/kg.\nIn Taipei, Taiwan, a city health survey in 2010 found that 30% of dried and pickled food products had benzoic acid.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4107", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4107", "title": "Boltzmann distribution", "text": "Probability distribution of energy states of a system\nIn statistical mechanics and mathematics, a Boltzmann distribution (also called Gibbs distribution) is a probability distribution or probability measure that gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state's energy and the temperature of the system. The distribution is expressed in the form:\nformula_1\nwhere pi is the probability of the system being in state i, exp is the exponential function, \u03b5i is the energy of that state, and a constant \"k\"B\"T\" of the distribution is the product of the Boltzmann constant k and thermodynamic temperature T. The symbol formula_2 denotes proportionality (see for the proportionality constant).\nThe term \"system\" here has a wide meaning; it can range from a collection of 'sufficient number' of atoms or a single atom to a macroscopic system such as a natural gas storage tank. Therefore, the Boltzmann distribution can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. The distribution shows that states with lower energy will always have a higher probability of being occupied.\nThe \"ratio\" of probabilities of two states is known as the Boltzmann factor and characteristically only depends on the states' energy difference:\nformula_3\nThe Boltzmann distribution is named after Ludwig Boltzmann who first formulated it in 1868 during his studies of the statistical mechanics of gases in thermal equilibrium. Boltzmann's statistical work is borne out in his paper \u201cOn the Relationship between the Second Fundamental Theorem of the Mechanical Theory of Heat and Probability Calculations Regarding the Conditions for Thermal Equilibrium\"\nThe distribution was later investigated extensively, in its modern generic form, by Josiah Willard Gibbs in 1902.\nThe Boltzmann distribution should not be confused with the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution or Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics. The Boltzmann distribution gives the probability that a system will be in a certain \"state\" as a function of that state's energy, while the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distributions give the probabilities of particle \"speeds\" or \"energies\" in ideal gases. The distribution of energies in a one-dimensional gas however, does follow the Boltzmann distribution.\nThe distribution.\nThe Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that gives the probability of a certain state as a function of that state's energy and temperature of the system to which the distribution is applied. It is given as\nformula_4\nwhere:\nUsing Lagrange multipliers, one can prove that the Boltzmann distribution is the distribution that maximizes the entropy\nformula_6\nsubject to the normalization constraint that formula_7 and the constraint that formula_8 equals a particular mean energy value, except for two special cases. (These special cases occur when the mean value is either the minimum or maximum of the energies \u03b5i. In these cases, the entropy maximizing distribution is a limit of Boltzmann distributions where T approaches zero from above or below, respectively.)\nThe partition function can be calculated if we know the energies of the states accessible to the system of interest. For atoms the partition function values can be found in the NIST Atomic Spectra Database.\nThe distribution shows that states with lower energy will always have a higher probability of being occupied than the states with higher energy. It also gives the quantitative relationship between the probabilities of the two states being occupied. The ratio of probabilities for states i and j is given as\nformula_9\nwhere:\nThe corresponding ratio of populations of energy levels must also take their degeneracies into account.\nThe Boltzmann distribution is often used to describe the distribution of particles, such as atoms or molecules, over bound states accessible to them. If we have a system consisting of many particles, the probability of a particle being in state i is practically the probability that, if we pick a random particle from that system and check what state it is in, we will find it is in state i. This probability is equal to the number of particles in state i divided by the total number of particles in the system, that is the fraction of particles that occupy state i.\nformula_10\nwhere Ni is the number of particles in state i and N is the total number of particles in the system. We may use the Boltzmann distribution to find this probability that is, as we have seen, equal to the fraction of particles that are in state \"i\". So the equation that gives the fraction of particles in state i as a function of the energy of that state is \nformula_11\nThis equation is of great importance to spectroscopy. In spectroscopy we observe a spectral line of atoms or molecules undergoing transitions from one state to another. In order for this to be possible, there must be some particles in the first state to undergo the transition. We may find that this condition is fulfilled by finding the fraction of particles in the first state. If it is negligible, the transition is very likely not observed at the temperature for which the calculation was done. In general, a larger fraction of molecules in the first state means a higher number of transitions to the second state. This gives a stronger spectral line. However, there are other factors that influence the intensity of a spectral line, such as whether it is caused by an allowed or a forbidden transition.\nThe softmax function commonly used in machine learning is related to the Boltzmann distribution:\nformula_12\nGeneralized Boltzmann distribution.\nA distribution of the form\nformula_13\nis called generalized Boltzmann distribution by some authors.\nThe Boltzmann distribution is a special case of the generalized Boltzmann distribution. The generalized Boltzmann distribution is used in statistical mechanics to describe canonical ensemble, grand canonical ensemble and isothermal\u2013isobaric ensemble. The generalized Boltzmann distribution is usually derived from the principle of maximum entropy, but there are other derivations.\nThe generalized Boltzmann distribution has the following properties:\nIn statistical mechanics.\nThe Boltzmann distribution appears in statistical mechanics when considering closed systems of fixed composition that are in thermal equilibrium (equilibrium with respect to energy exchange). The most general case is the probability distribution for the canonical ensemble. Some special cases (derivable from the canonical ensemble) show the Boltzmann distribution in different aspects:\n The canonical ensemble gives the probabilities of the various possible states of a closed system of fixed volume, in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath. The canonical ensemble has a state probability distribution with the Boltzmann form.\n When the system of interest is a collection of many non-interacting copies of a smaller subsystem, it is sometimes useful to find the statistical frequency of a given subsystem state, among the collection. The canonical ensemble has the property of separability when applied to such a collection: as long as the non-interacting subsystems have fixed composition, then each subsystem's state is independent of the others and is also characterized by a canonical ensemble. As a result, the expected statistical frequency distribution of subsystem states has the Boltzmann form.\n In particle systems, many particles share the same space and regularly change places with each other; the single-particle state space they occupy is a shared space. Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics give the expected number of particles found in a given single-particle state, in a classical gas of non-interacting particles at equilibrium. This expected number distribution has the Boltzmann form.\nAlthough these cases have strong similarities, it is helpful to distinguish them as they generalize in different ways when the crucial assumptions are changed:\nIn economics.\nThe Boltzmann distribution can be introduced to allocate permits in emissions trading. \nA new allocation method, known as the Boltzmann Fair Division, uses the Boltzmann distribution to describe the most probable, natural, and unbiased distribution of emission permits among multiple countries. \nThis framework has been further extended to address general problems of distributive justice, including cake-cutting and resource allocation, by allowing flexibility in how factors such as contribution, need, or preference are weighted. The Boltzmann fair division is recognized for providing a simple yet powerful probabilistic model that can be adapted to various social, political, and economic contexts.\nThe Boltzmann distribution has the same form as the multinomial logit model. As a discrete choice model, this is very well known in economics since Daniel McFadden made the connection to random utility maximization.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"leg theory\" is somewhat archaic, but the basic tactic remains a play in modern cricket.\nSimply put, leg theory involves concentrating the bowling attack at or near the line of leg stump. This may or may not be accompanied by a concentration of fielders on the leg side. The line of attack aims to cramp the batsman, making him play the ball with the bat close to the body. This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the off side. Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders on that side of the field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.\nStifling the batsman in this manner can lead to impatience and frustration, resulting in rash play by the batsman which in turn can lead to a quick dismissal. Concentrating attack on the leg stump is considered by many cricket fans and commentators to lead to boring play, as it stifles run scoring and encourages batsmen to play conservatively.\nLeg theory can be a moderately successful tactic when used with both fast bowling and spin bowling, particularly leg spin to right-handed batsmen or off spin to left-handed batsmen. However, because it relies on lack of concentration or discipline by the batsman, it can be risky against patient and skilled players, especially batsmen who are strong on the leg side. The English opening bowlers Sydney Barnes and Frank Foster used leg theory with some success in Australia in 1911\u201312. In England, at around the same time, Fred Root was one of the main proponents of the same tactic.\nFast leg theory.\nIn 1930, England captain Douglas Jardine, together with Nottinghamshire's captain Arthur Carr and his bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, developed a variant of leg theory in which the bowlers bowled fast, short-pitched balls that would rise into the batsman's body, together with a heavily stacked ring of close fielders on the leg side. The idea was that when the batsman defended against the ball, he would be likely to deflect the ball into the air for a catch.\nJardine called this modified form of the tactic \"fast leg theory\". On the 1932\u201333 English tour of Australia, Larwood and Voce bowled fast leg theory at the Australian batsmen. It turned out to be extremely dangerous, and most Australian players sustained injuries from being hit by the ball. Wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield's skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had first glanced off the bat and Larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the Australian crowd.\nThe Australian press dubbed the tactic \"Bodyline\", and claimed it was a deliberate attempt by the English team to intimidate and injure the Australian players. Reports of the controversy reaching England at the time described the bowling as \"fast leg theory\", which sounded to many people to be a harmless and well-established tactic. This led to a serious misunderstanding amongst the English public and the Marylebone Cricket Club \u2013 the administrators of English cricket \u2013 of the dangers posed by Bodyline. The English press and cricket authorities declared the Australian protests to be a case of sore losing and \"squealing\".\nIt was only with the return of the English team and the subsequent use of Bodyline against English players in England by the touring West Indian cricket team in 1933 that demonstrated to the country the dangers it posed. The MCC subsequently revised the Laws of Cricket to prevent the use of \"fast leg theory\" tactics in future, also limiting the traditional tactic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bioleaching is one of several applications within biohydrometallurgy and several methods are used to treat ores or concentrates containing copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, gold, silver, and cobalt.\nBioleaching falls into two broad categories. The first, is the use of microorganisms to oxidize refractory minerals to release valuable metals such and gold and silver. Most commonly the minerals that are the target of oxidization are pyrite and arsenopyrite.\nThe second category is leaching of sulphide minerals to release the associated metal, for example, leaching of pentlandite to release nickel, or the leaching of chalcocite, covellite or chalcopyrite to release copper.\nRelative to pyrometallurgy it is a slow but low cost method.\nThe method was inadvertly used in R\u00edo Tinto in the 18th century.\nProcess.\nBioleaching can involve numerous ferrous iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria, including \"Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans\" (formerly known as \"Thiobacillus ferrooxidans\") and \"Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans \" (formerly known as \"Thiobacillus thiooxidans\"). As a general principle, in one proposed method of bacterial leaching known as Indirect Leaching, Fe3+ ions are used to oxidize the ore. This step is entirely independent of microbes. The role of the bacteria is further oxidation of the ore, but also the regeneration of the chemical oxidant Fe3+ from Fe2+. For example, bacteria catalyse the breakdown of the mineral pyrite (FeS2) by oxidising the sulfur and metal (in this case ferrous iron, (Fe2+)) using oxygen. This yields soluble products that can be further purified and refined to yield the desired metal.\nPyrite leaching (FeS2):\nIn the first step, disulfide is spontaneously oxidized to thiosulfate by ferric ion (Fe3+), which in turn is reduced to give ferrous ion (Fe2+):\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0 formula_1 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0spontaneous\nThe ferrous ion is then oxidized by bacteria using oxygen:\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0 formula_2 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iron oxidizers)\nThiosulfate is also oxidized by bacteria to give sulfate:\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0 formula_3 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(sulfur oxidizers)\nThe ferric ion produced in reaction (2) oxidized more sulfide as in reaction (1), closing the cycle and given the net reaction:\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0formula_4\nThe net products of the reaction are soluble ferrous sulfate and sulfuric acid.\nThe microbial oxidation process occurs at the cell membrane of the bacteria. The electrons pass into the cells and are used in biochemical processes to produce energy for the bacteria while reducing oxygen to water. The critical reaction is the oxidation of sulfide by ferric iron. The main role of the bacterial step is the regeneration of this reactant.\nThe process for copper is very similar, but the efficiency and kinetics depend on the copper mineralogy. The most efficient minerals are supergene minerals such as chalcocite, Cu2S and covellite, CuS. The main copper mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) is not leached very efficiently, which is why the dominant copper-producing technology remains flotation, followed by smelting and refining. The leaching of CuFeS2 follows the two stages of being dissolved and then further oxidised, with Cu2+ ions being left in solution.\nChalcopyrite leaching:\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0 formula_5 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0spontaneous\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0 formula_6 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(iron oxidizers)\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0 formula_7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(sulfur oxidizers)\nnet reaction:\n(4)\u00a0\u00a0formula_8\nIn general, sulfides are first oxidized to elemental sulfur, whereas disulfides are oxidized to give thiosulfate, and the processes above can be applied to other sulfidic ores. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores such as pitchblende also uses ferric iron as an oxidant (e.g., UO2 + 2 Fe3+ ==&gt; UO22+ + 2 Fe2+). In this case, the sole purpose of the bacterial step is the regeneration of Fe3+. Sulfidic iron ores can be added to speed up the process and provide a source of iron. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores by layering of waste sulfides and elemental sulfur, colonized by \"Acidithiobacillus\" spp., has been accomplished, which provides a strategy for accelerated leaching of materials that do not contain sulfide minerals.\nFurther processing.\nThe dissolved copper (Cu2+) ions are removed from the solution by ligand exchange solvent extraction, which leaves other ions in the solution. The copper is removed by bonding to a ligand, which is a large molecule consisting of a number of smaller groups, each possessing a lone electron pair. The ligand-copper complex is extracted from the solution using an organic solvent such as kerosene:\nCu2+(aq) + 2LH(organic) \u2192 CuL2(organic) + 2H+(aq)\nThe ligand donates electrons to the copper, producing a complex - a central metal atom (copper) bonded to the ligand. Because this complex has no charge, it is no longer attracted to polar water molecules and dissolves in the kerosene, which is then easily separated from the solution. Because the initial reaction is reversible, it is determined by pH. Adding concentrated acid reverses the equation, and the copper ions go back into an aqueous solution.\nThen the copper is passed through an electro-winning process to increase its purity: An electric current is passed through the resulting solution of copper ions. Because copper ions have a 2+ charge, they are attracted to the negative cathodes and collect there.\nThe copper can also be concentrated and separated by displacing the copper with Fe from scrap iron:\nCu2+(aq) + Fe(s) \u2192 Cu(s) + Fe2+(aq)\nThe electrons lost by the iron are taken up by the copper. Copper is the oxidising agent (it accepts electrons), and iron is the reducing agent (it loses electrons).\nTraces of precious metals such as gold may be left in the original solution. Treating the mixture with sodium cyanide in the presence of free oxygen dissolves the gold. The gold is removed from the solution by adsorbing (taking it up on the surface) to charcoal.\nWith fungi.\nSeveral species of fungi can be used for bioleaching. Fungi can be grown on many different substrates, such as electronic scrap, catalytic converters, and fly ash from municipal waste incineration. Experiments have shown that two fungal strains (\"Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum\") were able to mobilize Cu and Sn by 65%, and Al, Ni, Pb, and Zn by more than 95%. \"Aspergillus niger\" can produce some organic acids such as citric acid. This form of leaching does not rely on microbial oxidation of metal but rather uses microbial metabolism as source of acids that directly dissolve the metal.\nFeasibility.\nEconomic feasibility.\nBioleaching is in general simpler and, therefore, cheaper to operate and maintain than traditional processes, since fewer specialists are needed to operate complex chemical plants. And low concentrations are not a problem for bacteria because they simply ignore the waste that surrounds the metals, attaining extraction yields of over 90% in some cases. These microorganisms actually gain energy by breaking down minerals into their constituent elements. The company simply collects the ions out of the solution after the bacteria have finished.\nBioleaching can be used to extract metals from low concentration ores such as gold that are too poor for other technologies. It can be used to partially replace the extensive crushing and grinding that translates to prohibitive cost and energy consumption in a conventional process. Because the lower cost of bacterial leaching outweighs the time it takes to extract the metal.\nHigh concentration ores, such as copper, are more economical to smelt rather bioleach due to the slow speed of the bacterial leaching process compared to smelting. The slow speed of bioleaching introduces a significant delay in cash flow for new mines. Nonetheless, at the largest copper mine of the world, Escondida in Chile the process seems to be favorable.\nEconomically it is also very expensive and many companies once started can not keep up with the demand and end up in debt.\nIn space.\nIn 2020 scientists showed, with an experiment with different gravity environments on the ISS, that microorganisms could be employed to mine useful elements from basaltic rocks via bioleaching in space.\nEnvironmental impact.\nThe process is more environmentally friendly than traditional extraction methods. For the company this can translate into profit, since the necessary limiting of sulfur dioxide emissions during smelting is expensive. Less landscape damage occurs, since the bacteria involved grow naturally, and the mine and surrounding area can be left relatively untouched. As the bacteria breed in the conditions of the mine, they are easily cultivated and recycled.\nToxic chemicals are sometimes produced in the process. Sulfuric acid and H+ ions that have been formed can leak into the ground and surface water turning it acidic, causing environmental damage. Heavy ions such as iron, zinc, and arsenic leak during acid mine drainage. When the pH of this solution rises, as a result of dilution by fresh water, these ions precipitate, forming \"Yellow Boy\" pollution. For these reasons, a setup of bioleaching must be carefully planned, since the process can lead to a biosafety failure. Unlike other methods, once started, bioheap leaching cannot be quickly stopped, because leaching would still continue with rainwater and natural bacteria. Projects like Finnish Talvivaara proved to be environmentally and economically disastrous.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4113", "revid": "50803978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4113", "title": "Bouldering", "text": "Form of rock climbing\nBouldering, less commonly spelled bowldering, is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses. While bouldering can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than tall. Traverses, which are a form of boulder problem, require the climber to climb horizontally from one end to another. Artificial climbing walls allow boulderers to climb indoors in areas without natural boulders. Bouldering competitions take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.\nThe sport was originally a method of training for roped climbs and mountaineering, so climbers could practice specific moves at a safe distance from the ground. Additionally, the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength. During the 20th century, bouldering evolved into a separate discipline. Individual problems are assigned ratings based on difficulty. Although there have been various rating systems used throughout the history of bouldering, modern problems usually use either the V-scale or the Fontainebleau scale.\nOutdoor bouldering.\nThe characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed. For example, granite often features long cracks and slabs while sandstone rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. Limestone and volcanic rock are also used for bouldering.\nThere are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States, including Hueco Tanks in Texas, Mount Blue Sky in Colorado, The Appalachian Mountains in The Eastern United States, and The Buttermilks in Bishop, California. Squamish, British Columbia is one of the most popular bouldering areas in Canada. Europe is also home to a number of bouldering sites, such as Fontainebleau in France, Meschia in Italy, Albarrac\u00edn in Spain, and various mountains throughout Switzerland.\nIndoor bouldering.\nArtificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at climbing gyms. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, polymer cement panels, concrete shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of plastic, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. Some problems use steep overhanging surfaces which force the climber to support much of their weight using their upper body strength.\nClimbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall. Historically, the most common method route-setters used to designate the intended problem was by placing colored tape next to each hold. For example, red tape would indicate one bouldering problem while green tape would be used to set a different problem in the same area. Indoor bouldering requires very little in terms of equipment: at minimum, climbing shoes; at maximum, a chalk bag, chalk, a brush, and climbing shoes.\nGrading.\nBouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by route-setters and climbers. The two most widely used rating systems are the V-scale and the Fontainebleau system.\nThe V-scale, which originated in the United States, is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher degree of difficulty. The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2024, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.\nThe Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system, with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\". For example, Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6, while Fontainebleau 7C+ is equivalent to V10. In both systems, grades are further differentiated by appending \"+\" to indicate a small increase in difficulty. Despite this level of specificity, ratings of individual problems are often controversial, as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem may be for a particular climber. Height, arm length, flexibility, and other body characteristics can also affect difficulty.\nHighball bouldering.\nHighball bouldering is \"a sub-discipline of bouldering in which climbers seek out tall, imposing lines to climb ropeless above crash pads.\" It may have begun in 1961 when John Gill, without top-rope rehearsal or bouldering pads (which did not exist), bouldered a steep face on an granite spire called \"The Thimble\". In 2002 Jason Kehl completed the first highball at double-digit V-difficulty, called Evilution, a boulder in the Buttermilks of California, earning the grade of V12.\nImportant milestone ascents in this style include:\nCompetition bouldering.\nThe International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format (although competitions can also take place in an outdoor setting) that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets of four to six boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems with ties settled by the total number of attempts taken to solve the problems.\nSome competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in between. In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed amount of time to complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.\nIn 2012, the IFSC submitted a proposal to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to include lead climbing in the 2020 Summer Olympics. The proposal was later revised to an \"overall\" competition, which would feature bouldering, lead climbing, and speed climbing. In 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially approved climbing, along with four other sports, as an Olympic sport, based on their \"impact on gender equality, the youth appeal of the sports and the legacy value of adding them to the Tokyo Games\".\nHistory.\nModern bouldering.\nModern recreational climbing began in the late 19th century in England, southeastern Germany, northern Italy, and France. Bouldering on the rocks of Fontainbleau outside of Paris began in the late 1800s, with the first guidebook written by Maurice Martin in 1945. Bouldering as training or a recreational past-time began also in the late 1800s in England and perhaps elsewhere. Oscar Eckenstein was an early proponent. \nIn the late 1950s, John Gill, who is frequently called \"the father of modern bouldering\", combined gymnastics with rock climbing, and felt that the best place to do that was on boulders or small outcrops. He developed a rating system that was closed-ended: B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems had been completed once. He also introduced chalk as a method of keeping the climber's hands dry, promoted a dynamic climbing style, and emphasized the importance of strength training to complement skill. His 1969 article in the Journal of the American Alpine Club entitled \"The Art of Bouldering\" defines modern bouldering. As Gill improved in ability and influence, his ideas became the norm.\nIn the 1980s, two important training tools emerged. One important training tool was bouldering mats, also referred to as \"crash pads\", which protected against injuries from falling and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous otherwise. The second important tool was indoor climbing walls, which helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing and allowed serious climbers to train year-round. As the sport grew in popularity, new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States, and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions. The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s, as YouTube videos and climbing blogs helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques, find hard problems, and announce newly completed projects.\nNotable ascents.\nNotable boulder climbs are chronicled by the climbing media to track progress in boulder climbing standards and levels of technical difficulty; in contrast, the hardest traditional climbing routes tend to be of lower technical difficulty due to the additional burden of having to place protection during the course of the climb, and due to the lack of any possibility of using natural protection on the most extreme climbs.\nAs of November 2022, the world's hardest bouldering routes are \"Burden of Dreams\" by Nalle Hukkataival and \"Return of the Sleepwalker\" by Daniel Woods, both at proposed grades of 9A\u00a0(V17). There are a number of routes with a confirmed climbing grade of 8C+\u00a0(V16), the first of which was \"Gioia\" by Christian Core in 2008 (and confirmed by Adam Ondra in 2011). As of December 2021, female climbers Josune Bereziartu, Ashima Shiraishi, and Kaddi Lehmann have repeated boulder problems at the 8C\u00a0(V15) boulder grade. On 28 July 2023, Katie Lamb became the first female climber to climb an 8C+\u00a0(V16)-rated boulder by repeating \"Box Therapy\" at Rocky Mountain National Park. However, after Brooke Raboutou repeated the climb In October 2023, the boulder was ultimately downgraded to 8C\u00a0(V15).\nEquipment.\nUnlike other climbing sports, bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment, an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing, but opinions differ. While bouldering pioneer John Sherman asserted that \"The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders,\" others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag \u2013 a small pouch where ground-up chalk is kept \u2013 as the bare minimum, and more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of climbing shoes, chalk, brushes, crash pads, and a skincare kit.\nClimbing shoes have the most direct impact on performance. Besides protecting the climber's feet from rough surfaces, climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure footholds. Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork. They are manufactured in a variety of different styles to perform in different situations. Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges, whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity. The front of the shoe, called the \"toe box\", can be asymmetric, which performs well on overhanging rocks, or symmetric, which is better suited for vertical problems and slabs.\nTo absorb sweat, most boulderers use gymnastics chalk on their hands, stored in a chalk bag, which can be tied around the waist (also called sport climbing chalk bags), allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. There are also versions of floor chalk bags (also called bouldering chalk bags), which are usually bigger than sport climbing chalk bags and are meant to be kept on the floor while climbing; this is because boulders do not usually have so many movements as to require chalking up more than once. Different sizes of brushes are used to remove excess chalk and debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached to the end of a long straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as bouldering mats, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from injury after falling.\nBoulder problems are generally shorter than from ground to top. This makes the sport significantly safer than free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, but with no upper limit on the height of the climb. However, minor injuries are common in bouldering, particularly sprained ankles and wrists. To prevent injuries, boulderers position crash pads near the boulder to provide a softer landing, as well as one or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.\nTechniques.\nAlthough every type of rock climbing requires a high level of strength and technique, bouldering is the most dynamic form of the sport, requiring the highest level of power and placing considerable strain on the body. Training routines that strengthen fingers and forearms are useful in preventing injuries such as tendonitis and ruptured ligaments. However, as with other forms of climbing, bouldering technique begins with proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms to maintain balance and body positioning as much as possible, relying on their legs to push them up the rock. Boulderers also keep their arms straight with their shoulders engaged whenever feasible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.\nBouldering movements are described as either \"static\" or \"dynamic\". Static movements are those that are performed slowly, with the climber's position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs. Dynamic movements use the climber's momentum to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically, with an increased risk of falling if the movement is not performed accurately.\nEnvironmental impact.\nBouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks, such as moss and lichens. This can occur as a result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer in case of a fall. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A liquid in a partial vacuum, i.e., under a lower pressure, has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. Because of this, water boils at 100\u00b0C (or with scientific precision: ) under standard pressure at sea level, but at at altitude. For a given pressure, different liquids will boil at different temperatures.\nThe normal boiling point (also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point) of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, one atmosphere. At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid. The standard boiling point has been defined by IUPAC since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of one bar.\nThe heat of vaporization is the energy required to transform a given quantity (a mol, kg, pound, etc.) of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure (often atmospheric pressure).\nLiquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of evaporation. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as vapor. On the other hand, boiling is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.\nSaturation temperature and pressure.\nA \"saturated liquid\" contains as much thermal energy as it can without boiling (or conversely a \"saturated vapor\" contains as little thermal energy as it can without condensing).\nSaturation temperature means \"boiling point\". The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.\nIf the pressure in a system remains constant (isobaric), a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy (heat) is removed. Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and pressure will boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.\nThe boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the boiling point is dependent on the pressure. Boiling points may be published with respect to the NIST, USA standard pressure of 101.325\u00a0kPa (1\u00a0atm), or the IUPAC standard pressure of 100.000\u00a0kPa (1\u00a0bar). At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the boiling point is also lower. The boiling point increases with increased pressure up to the critical point, where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The boiling point cannot be increased beyond the critical point. Likewise, the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure until the triple point is reached. The boiling point cannot be reduced below the triple point.\nIf the heat of vaporization and the vapor pressure of a liquid at a certain temperature are known, the boiling point can be calculated by using the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron equation, thus:\nformula_1\nwhere:\nformula_2 is the boiling point at the pressure of interest,\nformula_3 is the ideal gas constant,\nformula_4 is the vapor pressure of the liquid,\nformula_5 is some pressure where the corresponding formula_6 is known (usually data available at 1\u00a0atm or 100\u00a0kPa (1\u00a0bar)),\nformula_7 is the heat of vaporization of the liquid,\nformula_6 is the boiling temperature,\nformula_9 is the natural logarithm.\nSaturation pressure is the pressure for a corresponding saturation temperature at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. Saturation pressure and saturation temperature have a direct relationship: as saturation pressure is increased, so is saturation temperature.\nIf the temperature in a system remains constant (an \"isothermal\" system), vapor at saturation pressure and temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as the system pressure is increased. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to flash into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased.\nThere are two conventions regarding the \"standard boiling point of water\": The \"normal boiling point\" is commonly given as (actually following the thermodynamic definition of the Celsius scale based on the kelvin) at a pressure of 1\u00a0atm (101.325\u00a0kPa). The IUPAC-recommended \"standard boiling point of water\" at a standard pressure of 100\u00a0kPa (1\u00a0bar) is . For comparison, on top of Mount Everest, at elevation, the pressure is about and the boiling point of water is . The Celsius temperature scale was defined until 1954 by two points: 0\u00a0\u00b0C being defined by the water freezing point and 100\u00a0\u00b0C being defined by the water boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure.\nRelation between the normal boiling point and the vapor pressure of liquids.\nThe higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point (i.e., the boiling point at atmospheric pressure) of the liquid.\nThe vapor pressure chart to the right has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids. As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.\nFor example, at any given temperature, methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (\u221224.2\u00a0\u00b0C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere (atm) of absolute vapor pressure.\nThe critical point of a liquid is the highest temperature (and pressure) it will actually boil at.\nSee also Vapour pressure of water.\nBoiling point of chemical elements.\nThe element with the lowest boiling point is helium. Both the boiling points of rhenium and tungsten exceed 5000 K at standard pressure; because it is difficult to measure extreme temperatures precisely without bias, both have been cited in the literature as having the higher boiling point.\nBoiling point as a reference property of a pure compound.\nAs can be seen from the above plot of the logarithm of the vapor pressure vs. the temperature for any given pure chemical compound, its normal boiling point can serve as an indication of that compound's overall volatility. A given pure compound has only one normal boiling point, if any, and a compound's normal boiling point and melting point can serve as characteristic physical properties for that compound, listed in reference books. The higher a compound's normal boiling point, the less volatile that compound is overall, and conversely, the lower a compound's normal boiling point, the more volatile that compound is overall. Some compounds decompose at higher temperatures before reaching their normal boiling point, or sometimes even their melting point. For a stable compound, the boiling point ranges from its triple point to its critical point, depending on the external pressure. Beyond its triple point, a compound's normal boiling point, if any, is higher than its melting point. Beyond the critical point, a compound's liquid and vapor phases merge into one phase, which may be called a superheated gas. At any given temperature, if a compound's normal boiling point is lower, then that compound will generally exist as a gas at atmospheric external pressure. If the compound's normal boiling point is higher, then that compound can exist as a liquid or solid at that given temperature at atmospheric external pressure, and will so exist in equilibrium with its vapor (if volatile) if its vapors are contained. If a compound's vapors are not contained, then some volatile compounds can eventually evaporate away in spite of their higher boiling points.\nIn general, compounds with ionic bonds have high normal boiling points, if they do not decompose before reaching such high temperatures. Many metals have high boiling points, but not all. Very generally\u2014with other factors being equal\u2014in compounds with covalently bonded molecules, as the size of the molecule (or molecular mass) increases, the normal boiling point increases. When the molecular size becomes that of a macromolecule, polymer, or otherwise very large, the compound often decomposes at high temperature before the boiling point is reached. Another factor that affects the normal boiling point of a compound is the polarity of its molecules. As the polarity of a compound's molecules increases, its normal boiling point increases, other factors being equal. Closely related is the ability of a molecule to form hydrogen bonds (in the liquid state), which makes it harder for molecules to leave the liquid state and thus increases the normal boiling point of the compound. Simple carboxylic acids dimerize by forming hydrogen bonds between molecules. A minor factor affecting boiling points is the shape of a molecule. Making the shape of a molecule more compact tends to lower the normal boiling point slightly compared to an equivalent molecule with more surface area.\nMost volatile compounds (anywhere near ambient temperatures) go through an intermediate liquid phase while warming up from a solid phase to eventually transform to a vapor phase. By comparison to boiling, a sublimation is a physical transformation in which a solid turns directly into vapor, which happens in a few select cases such as with carbon dioxide at atmospheric pressure. For such compounds, a sublimation point is a temperature at which a solid turning directly into vapor has a vapor pressure equal to the external pressure.\nImpurities and mixtures.\nIn the preceding section, boiling points of pure compounds were covered. Vapor pressures and boiling points of substances can be affected by the presence of dissolved impurities (solutes) or other miscible compounds, the degree of effect depending on the concentration of the impurities or other compounds. The presence of non-volatile impurities such as salts or compounds of a volatility far lower than the main component compound decreases its mole fraction and the solution's volatility, and thus raises the normal boiling point in proportion to the concentration of the solutes. This effect is called boiling point elevation. As a common example, salt water boils at a higher temperature than pure water.\nIn other mixtures of miscible compounds (components), there may be two or more components of varying volatility, each having its own pure component boiling point at any given pressure. The presence of other volatile components in a mixture affects the vapor pressures and thus boiling points and dew points of all the components in the mixture. The dew point is a temperature at which a vapor condenses into a liquid. Furthermore, at any given temperature, the composition of the vapor is different from the composition of the liquid in most such cases. In order to illustrate these effects between the volatile components in a mixture, a boiling point diagram is commonly used. Distillation is a process of boiling and [usually] condensation which takes advantage of these differences in composition between liquid and vapor phases.\nBoiling point of water with elevation.\nFollowing is a table of the change in the boiling point of water with elevation, at intervals of 500 meters over the range of human habitation [the Dead Sea at to La Rinconada, Peru at ], then of 1,000 meters over the additional range of uninhabited surface elevation [up to Mount Everest at ], along with a similar range in Imperial.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4116", "revid": "389239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4116", "title": "Big Bang", "text": "Physical theory\n \nThe Big Bang is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. Various cosmological models based on the Big Bang concept explain a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The uniformity of the universe, known as the horizon and flatness problems, is explained through cosmic inflation: a phase of accelerated expansion during the earliest stages. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the initial singularity at an estimated \u00a0billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang event, which is now widely accepted.\nExtrapolating this cosmic expansion backward in time using the known laws of physics, the models describe an extraordinarily hot and dense primordial universe. Physics lacks a widely accepted theory that can model the earliest conditions of the Big Bang. As the universe expanded, it cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. These primordial elements\u2014mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium\u2014then coalesced under the force of gravity aided by dark matter, forming early stars and galaxies. Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to a concept called dark energy.\nThe concept of an expanding universe was introduced by the physicist Alexander Friedmann in 1922 with the mathematical derivation of the Friedmann equations. The earliest empirical observation of an expanding universe is known as Hubble's law, published in work by physicist Edwin Hubble in 1929, which discerned that galaxies are moving away from Earth at a rate that accelerates proportionally with distance. Independent of Friedmann's work, and independent of Hubble's observations, in 1931 physicist Georges Lema\u00eetre proposed that the universe emerged from a \"primeval atom\", introducing the modern notion of the Big Bang. In 1964, the CMB was discovered. Over the next few years measurements showed this radiation to be uniform over directions in the sky and the shape of the energy versus intensity curve, both consistent with the Big Bang models of high temperatures and densities in the distant past. By the late 1960s most cosmologists were convinced that competing steady-state model of cosmic evolution was incorrect.\nThere remain aspects of the observed universe that are not yet adequately explained by the Big Bang models. These include the unequal abundances of matter and antimatter known as baryon asymmetry, the detailed nature of dark matter surrounding galaxies, and the origin of dark energy.\nFeatures of the models.\nAssumptions.\nBig Bang cosmology models depend on three major assumptions: the universality of physical laws, the cosmological principle, and that the matter content can be modeled as a perfect fluid. The universality of physical laws is one of the underlying principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic\u2014appearing the same in all directions regardless of location. A perfect fluid has no viscosity; the pressure of a perfect fluid is proportional to its density.\nThese ideas were initially taken as postulates, but later efforts were made to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that the largest possible deviation of the fine-structure constant over much of the age of the universe is of order 10\u22125. The key physical law behind these models, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.\nThe cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10\u22125 via observations of the temperature of the CMB. At the scale of the CMB horizon, the universe has been measured to be homogeneous with an upper bound on the order of 10% inhomogeneity, as of 1995.\nExpansion prediction.\nThe cosmological principle dramatically simplifies the equations of general relativity, giving the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric to describe the geometry of the universe and, with the assumption of a perfect fluid, the Friedmann equations giving the time dependence of that geometry. The only parameter at this level of description is the mass-energy density: the geometry of the universe and its expansion is a direct consequence of its density.73 All of the major features of Big Bang cosmology are related to these results.\nMass-energy density.\nIn Big Bang cosmology, the mass\u2013energy density controls the shape and evolution of the universe. By combining astronomical observations with known laws of thermodynamics and particle physics, cosmologists have worked out the components of the density over the lifespan of the universe. In the current universe, luminous matter, the stars, planets, and so on makes up less than 5% of the density. Dark matter accounts for 27% and dark energy the remaining 68%.\nHorizons.\nAn important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of particle horizons. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not yet had time to reach earth. This places a limit or a \"past horizon\" on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never \"catch up\" to very distant objects. This defines a \"future horizon\", which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker (FLRW) metric that describes the expansion of the universe.\nOur understanding of the universe back to very early times suggests that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a future horizon as well.\nThermalization.\nSome processes in the early universe occurred too slowly, compared to the expansion rate of the universe, to reach approximate thermodynamic equilibrium. Others were fast enough to reach thermalization. The parameter usually used to find out whether a process in the very early universe has reached thermal equilibrium is the ratio between the rate of the process (usually rate of collisions between particles) and the Hubble parameter. The larger the ratio, the more time particles had to thermalize before they were too far away from each other.\nTimeline.\nAccording to the Big Bang models, the universe at the beginning was very hot and very compact, and since then it has been expanding and cooling.\nSingularity.\nExisting theories of physics cannot tell us about the moment of the Big Bang.\nExtrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using only classical general relativity yields a gravitational singularity with infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past. However this classical gravitational theory is expected to be inadequate to describe physics under these conditions. \nThus the meaning of this singularity in the context of the Big Bang is unclear. \nThe earliest time that general relativity can be applied is called the Planck time. Earlier, during the Planck epoch, when the temperature of the universe was close to the Planck scale (around 1032 K or 1028 eV) quantum gravity effects are expected to be dominant. To date there is no accepted theory of quantum gravity; above the Planck energy scale, undiscovered physics could influence the expansion history of the universe.\nInflation and baryogenesis.\nThe earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation, given the lack of available data. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures, and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. The period up to 10\u221243 seconds into the expansion, the Planck epoch, was a phase in which the four fundamental forces\u2014the electromagnetic force, the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, and the gravitational force\u2014were unified as one. In this stage, the characteristic scale length of the universe was the Planck length, , and consequently had a temperature of approximately 1032 degrees Celsius. Even the very concept of a particle breaks down in these conditions. A proper understanding of this period awaits the development of a theory of quantum gravity. The Planck epoch was succeeded by the grand unification epoch beginning at 10\u221243 seconds, where gravitation separated from the other forces as the universe's temperature fell.\nAt approximately 10\u221237 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially, unconstrained by the light speed invariance, and temperatures dropped by a factor of 100,000. This concept is motivated by the flatness problem, where the density of matter and energy is very close to the critical density needed to produce a flat universe. That is, the shape of the universe has no overall geometric curvature due to gravitational influence. Microscopic quantum fluctuations that occurred because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle were \"frozen in\" by inflation, becoming amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. At a time around 10\u221236 seconds, the electroweak epoch begins when the strong nuclear force separates from the other forces, with only the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force remaining unified.\nAll of the mass-energy in all of the galaxies currently visible started in a sphere with a radius around 4 x 10-29\u00a0m then grew to a sphere with a radius around 0.9\u00a0m by the end of inflation. Reheating followed as the inflaton field decayed, until the universe obtained the temperatures required for the production of a quark\u2013gluon plasma as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle\u2013antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons\u2014of the order of one part in 30\u00a0million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.\nCooling.\nThe universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. Symmetry-breaking phase transitions put the fundamental forces of physics and the parameters of elementary particles into their present form, with the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force separating at about 10\u221212 seconds.\nAfter about 10\u221211 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in particle accelerators. At about 10\u22126 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form baryons such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was no longer high enough to create either new proton\u2013antiproton or neutron\u2013antineutron pairs. A mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 108 of the original matter particles and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by photons (with a minor contribution from neutrinos).\nA few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion kelvin and the density of matter in the universe was comparable to the current density of Earth's atmosphere, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.\nAs the universe cooled, the rest energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate over that of the photon and neutrino radiation at a time of about 50,000 years. At a time of about 380,000 years, the universe cooled enough that electrons and nuclei combined into neutral atoms (mostly hydrogen) in an event called recombination. This process made the previously opaque universe transparent, and the photons that last scattered during this epoch comprise the cosmic microwave background.\nStructure formation.\nAfter the recombination epoch, the slightly denser regions of the uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe. The four possible types of matter are known as cold dark matter (CDM), warm dark matter, hot dark matter, and baryonic matter. The best measurements available, from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold. This CDM is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%.\nCosmic acceleration.\nIndependent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which appears to homogeneously permeate all of space. Observations suggest that 73% of the total energy density of the present day universe is in this form. When the universe was very young it was likely infused with dark energy, but with everything closer together, gravity predominated, braking the expansion. Eventually, after billions of years of expansion, the declining density of matter relative to the density of dark energy allowed the expansion of the universe to begin to accelerate.\nDark energy in its simplest formulation is modeled by a cosmological constant term in Einstein field equations of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown. More generally, the details of its equation of state and relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theory.\nAll of this cosmic evolution after the inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the lambda-CDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and general relativity. There are no easily testable models that would describe the situation prior to approximately 10\u221215 seconds. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.\nConcept history.\nEtymology.\nEnglish astronomer Fred Hoyle is credited with coining the term \"Big Bang\" during a talk for a March 1949 BBC Radio broadcast, saying: \"These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.\" However, it did not catch on until the 1970s.\nIt is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative \"steady-state\" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models. Helge Kragh writes that the evidence for the claim that it was meant as a pejorative is \"unconvincing\", and mentions a number of indications that it was not a pejorative.\nA primordial singularity is sometimes called \"the Big Bang\", but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase. The term itself has been argued to be a misnomer because it evokes an explosion. The argument is that whereas an explosion suggests expansion into a surrounding space, the Big Bang only describes the intrinsic expansion of the contents of the universe. Another issue pointed out by Santhosh Mathew is that bang implies sound, which is not an important feature of the model. However, an attempt to find a more suitable alternative was not successful. According to Timothy Ferris:\nThe term 'big bang' was coined with derisive intent by Fred Hoyle, and its endurance testifies to Sir Fred's creativity and wit. Indeed, the term survived an international competition in which three judges \u2014 the television science reporter Hugh Downs, the astronomer Carl Sagan, and myself \u2014 sifted through 13,099 entries from 41 countries and concluded that none was apt enough to replace it. No winner was declared, and like it or not, we are stuck with 'big bang'.\nBefore the name.\nEarly cosmological models developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912, Vesto Slipher measured the first Doppler shift of a \"spiral nebula\" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was highly controversial whether or not these nebulae were \"island universes\" outside our Milky Way. Ten years later, Alexander Friedmann, a Russian cosmologist and mathematician, derived the Friedmann equations from the Einstein field equations, showing that the universe might be expanding in contrast to the static universe model advocated by Albert Einstein at that time.\nIn 1924, American astronomer Edwin Hubble's measurement of the great distance to the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other galaxies. Starting that same year, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the cosmic distance ladder, using the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929, Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recessional velocity\u2014now known as Hubble's law.\nIndependently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, Georges Lema\u00eetre, a Belgian physicist and Roman Catholic priest, proposed that the recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe. He inferred the relation that Hubble would later observe, given the cosmological principle. In 1931, Lema\u00eetre went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a \"primeval atom\" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal steady-state universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by an expanding universe imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady-state theory. This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the expanding universe concept, Lema\u00eetre, was a Roman Catholic priest. Arthur Eddington agreed with Aristotle that the universe did not have a beginning in time, \"viz\"., that matter is eternal. A beginning in time was \"repugnant\" to him. Lema\u00eetre, however, disagreed:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If the world has begun with a single quantum, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time.\nDuring the 1930s, other ideas were proposed as non-standard cosmologies to explain Hubble's observations, including the Milne model, the oscillatory universe (originally suggested by Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and Richard C. Tolman) and Fritz Zwicky's tired light hypothesis.\nAfter World War II, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle's steady-state model, whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lema\u00eetre's expanding universe theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow, who used it to develop a theory for the abundance of chemical elements in the universe. and whose associates, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, predicted the cosmic background radiation.\nAs a named model.\nIronically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lema\u00eetre's theory, referring to it as \"this \"big bang\" idea\" during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio source counts, began to favor Big Bang over steady state. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe.\nIn 1968 and 1970, Roger Penrose, Stephen Hawking, and George F. R. Ellis published papers where they showed that mathematical singularities were an inevitable initial condition of relativistic models of the Big Bang. Then, from the 1970s to the 1990s, cosmologists worked on characterizing the features of the Big Bang universe and resolving outstanding problems. In 1981, Alan Guth made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical problems in the Big Bang models with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called \"inflation\". Meanwhile, during these decades, two questions in observational cosmology that generated much discussion and disagreement were over the precise values of the Hubble Constant and the matter-density of the universe (before the discovery of dark energy, thought to be the key predictor for the eventual fate of the universe).\nSignificant progress in Big Bang cosmology has been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in telescope technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), the Hubble Space Telescope and WMAP. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating.\nObservational evidence.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"[The] big bang picture is too firmly grounded in data from every area to be proved invalid in its general features.\"\n\u2014 Lawrence Krauss\nThe Big Bang models offer a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundances of the light elements, the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure, and Hubble's law.\nThe earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to Hubble's law (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the cosmic microwave background and the relative abundances of light elements produced by Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). More recent evidence includes observations of galaxy formation and evolution, and the distribution of large-scale cosmic structures. These are sometimes called the \"four pillars\" of the Big Bang models.\nPrecise modern models of the Big Bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics. Of these features, dark matter is currently the subject of most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. Inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are unsolved problems in physics.\nHubble's law and the expansion of the universe.\nObservations of distant galaxies and quasars show that these objects are redshifted: the light emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a frequency spectrum of an object and matching the spectroscopic pattern of emission or absorption lines corresponding to atoms of the chemical elements interacting with the light. These redshifts are uniformly isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional velocity of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the cosmic distance ladder. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:\nformula_1\nwhere\nHubble's law implies that the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere. This cosmic expansion was predicted from general relativity by Friedmann in 1922 and Lema\u00eetre in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang model as developed by Friedmann, Lema\u00eetre, Robertson, and Walker.\nThe theory requires the relation formula_5 to hold at all times, where formula_3 is the proper distance, formula_2 is the recessional velocity, and formula_2, formula_9, and formula_3 vary as the universe expands (hence we write formula_4 to denote the present-day Hubble \"constant\"). For distances much smaller than the size of the observable universe, the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity formula_2. For distances comparable to the size of the observable universe, the attribution of the cosmological redshift becomes more ambiguous, although its interpretation as a kinematic Doppler shift remains the most natural one.\nAn unexplained discrepancy with the determination of the Hubble constant is known as Hubble tension. Techniques based on observation of the CMB suggest a lower value of this constant compared to the quantity derived from measurements based on the cosmic distance ladder.\nCosmic microwave background radiation.\nIn 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the microwave band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s, the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a blackbody spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725\u00a0K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics.\nThe \"surface of last scattering\" corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after \"recombination\", the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly scattered from free charged particles. Peaking at around , the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent.\nIn 1989, NASA launched COBE, which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the CMB frequency spectrum is an almost perfect blackbody with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 104, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726\u00a0K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255\u00a0K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 105. John C. Mather and George Smoot were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.\nDuring the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000\u20132001, several experiments, most notably BOOMERanG, found the shape of the universe to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.\nIn early 2003, the first results of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific cosmic inflation models, but are consistent with the inflation theory in general. The \"Planck\" space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon-based cosmic microwave background experiments are ongoing.\nAbundance of primordial elements.\nUsing Big Bang models, it is possible to calculate the expected concentration of the isotopes helium-4 (4He), helium-3 (3He), deuterium (2H), and lithium-7 (7Li) in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen. The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of photons to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of CMB fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by abundance) are about 0.25 for 4He:H, about 10\u22123 for 2H:H, about 10\u22124 for 3He:H, and about 10\u22129 for 7Li:H.\nThe measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for 4He, and off by a factor of two for 7Li (this anomaly is known as the cosmological lithium problem); in the latter two cases, there are substantial systematic uncertainties. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by BBN is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to \"tune\" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20\u201330% helium. Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of stellar nucleosynthesis products, should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than 3He, and in constant ratios, too.\nGalactic evolution and distribution.\nDetailed observations of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are in agreement with the current Big Bang models. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed within a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.\nPopulations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.\nPrimordial gas clouds.\nIn 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. Despite being sensitive to carbon, oxygen, and silicon, these three elements were not detected in these two clouds. Since the clouds of gas have no detectable levels of heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during BBN.\nOther lines of evidence.\nThe age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the CMB is now in agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of stellar evolution to globular clusters and through radiometric dating of individual Population II stars. It is also in agreement with age estimates based on measurements of the expansion using Type Ia supernovae and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. The agreement of independent measurements of this age supports the Lambda-CDM (\u039bCDM) model, since the model is used to relate some of the measurements to an age estimate, and all estimates turn agree. Still, some observations of objects from the relatively early universe (in particular quasar APM 08279+5255) raise concern as to whether these objects had enough time to form so early in the \u039bCDM model.\nThe prediction that the CMB temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on redshift. Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.\nFuture observations.\nFuture gravitational-wave observatories might be able to detect primordial gravitational waves, relics of the early universe, up to less than a second after the Big Bang.\nProblems and related issues in physics.\nAs with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang models. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflation theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang concept still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.\nBaryon asymmetry.\nIt is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. Both matter and antimatter were much more abundant than today, with a tiny asymmetry of only one part in 10 billion. The matter and antimatter collided and annihilated, leaving only the residual amount of matter. Today observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of normal matter with very little antimatter. \nIf matter and antimatter were in complete symmetry, then annihilation would result in only photons and virtually no matter at all, which is obviously not what is observed. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.\nDark energy.\nMeasurements of the redshift\u2013magnitude relation for type Ia supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe has been accelerating since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, cosmological models require that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large negative pressure, dubbed \"dark energy\".\nDark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the critical density of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density. Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the \"missing\" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of gravitational lenses, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the large-scale structure--baryon acoustic oscillations--as a cosmic ruler.\nNegative pressure is believed to be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.\nThe dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's cosmological constant but also extending to more exotic forms of quintessence or other modified gravity schemes. A cosmological constant problem, sometimes called the \"most embarrassing problem in physics\", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from Planck units.\nDark matter.\nDuring the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, the galaxy rotation problem, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.\nIndirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many particle physics candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.\nAdditionally, there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored cold dark matter model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem. Alternative theories have been proposed that do not require a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold dark matter proposal in explaining all extant observations.\nHorizon problem.\nThe horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel faster than light. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit\u2014the particle horizon\u2014on the separation of any two regions of space that are in causal contact. The observed isotropy of the CMB is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.\nA resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by inflation theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be quantum thermal fluctuations, which would be magnified to a cosmic scale. These fluctuations served as the seeds for all the current structures in the universe. Inflation predicts that the primordial fluctuations are nearly scale invariant and Gaussian, which has been confirmed by measurements of the CMB.\nA related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.\nMagnetic monopoles.\nThe magnetic monopole objection was raised in the late 1970s. Grand unified theories (GUTs) predicted topological defects in space that would manifest as magnetic monopoles. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is resolved by cosmic inflation, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.\nFlatness problem.\nThe flatness problem (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a FLRW. The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial curvature depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the critical density; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be \"flat\". Observations indicate the universe is consistent with being flat.\nThe problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10\u221243 seconds, the fact that the universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.\nMisconceptions.\nIn addition to confusion about the nature of cosmic expansion, the Big Bang model itself is sometimes misunderstood. \nOne of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is that it fully explains the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not describe how energy, time, and space were caused, but rather it describes the emergence of the present universe from an ultra-dense and high-temperature initial state.\nAnother common misconception relates to the recession speeds associated with Hubble's law. These are not velocities in a relativistic sense (for example, they are not related to the spatial components of 4-velocities). Therefore, it is not remarkable that according to Hubble's law, galaxies farther than the Hubble distance recede faster than the speed of light. Such recession speeds do not correspond to faster-than-light travel.\nImplications.\nGiven current understanding, scientific extrapolations about the future of the universe are only possible for finite durations, albeit for much longer periods than the current age of the universe. Anything beyond that becomes increasingly speculative. Likewise, at present, a proper understanding of the origin of the universe can only be subject to conjecture.\nPre\u2013Big Bang cosmology.\nThe Big Bang explains the evolution of the universe from a starting density and temperature that is well beyond humanity's capability to replicate, so extrapolations to the most extreme conditions and earliest times are necessarily more speculative. Lema\u00eetre called this initial state the \"\"primeval atom\" while Gamow called the material \"ylem\"\". How the initial state of the universe originated is still an open question, but the Big Bang model does constrain some of its characteristics. For example, if specific laws of nature were to come to existence in a random way, inflation models show, some combinations of these are far more probable, partly explaining why our Universe is rather stable. Another possible explanation for the stability of the Universe could be a hypothetical multiverse, which assumes every possible universe to exist, and thinking species could only emerge in those stable enough. A flat universe implies a balance between gravitational potential energy and other energy forms, requiring no additional energy to be created.\nThe Big Bang theory is built upon the equations of classical general relativity, which are not expected to be valid at the origin of cosmic time, as the temperature of the universe approaches the Planck scale. Correcting this will require the development of a correct treatment of quantum gravity. Certain quantum gravity treatments, such as the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation, imply that time itself could be an emergent property. As such, physics may conclude that time did not exist before the Big Bang.\nWhile it is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, or even whether such questions are sensible, speculation abounds on the subject of \"cosmogony\".\nSome speculative proposals in this regard, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:\nProposals in the last two categories see the Big Bang as an event in either a much larger and older universe or in a multiverse.\nUltimate fate of the universe.\nBefore observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started\u2014a Big Crunch.\nAlternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would very gradually asymptotically approach absolute zero\u2014a Big Freeze. Moreover, if protons are unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.\nModern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The Lambda-CDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom dark energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.\nReligious and philosophical interpretations.\nAs a description of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it has become one of the liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Due to their Bavarian accent, citizens of Munich pronounced \"Einbeck\" as \"ein Bock\" (\"a billy goat\"), and thus the beer became known as \"Bock\". A goat often appears on bottle labels. An 1882 article in \"The Baltimore Sun\" described it thus: \"The word bock signifies goat, and its prefix to beer indicates that bock beer is so potent and exhilarating that the drinker soon becomes as frisky in his gambols as the goat.\"\nBock is historically associated with special occasions, often festivals such as Christmas, Easter, or Lent (\"\"). Bock has a long history of being brewed and consumed by Bavarian monks as a source of nutrition during times of fasting.\nStyles.\nSubstyles of Bock include:\nTraditionally Bock is a sweet, relatively strong (6.3\u20137.6% by volume), lightly hopped lager registering between 20 and 30 International Bitterness Units (IBUs). The beer should be clear, with colour ranging from light copper to brown, and a bountiful, persistent off-white head. The aroma should be malty and toasty, possibly with hints of alcohol, but no detectable hops or fruitiness. The mouthfeel is smooth, with low to moderate carbonation and no astringency. The taste is rich and toasty, sometimes with a bit of caramel. The low-to-undetectable presence of hops provides just enough bitterness so that the sweetness is not cloying and the aftertaste is muted.\nMaibock.\nThe Maibock style \u2013 also known as Heller Bock or Lente Bock in the Netherlands\u00a0\u2013 is a strong pale lager, lighter in colour and with more hop presence.\nColour can range from deep gold to light amber with a large, creamy, persistent white head, and moderate to moderately high carbonation, while alcohol content ranges from 6.3% to 8.1% by volume. The flavour is typically less malty than a traditional Bock, and may be drier, hoppier, and more bitter, but still with a relatively low hop flavour, with a mild spicy or peppery quality from the hops, increased carbonation and alcohol content.\nDoppelbock.\n\"Doppelbock\" or \"Double Bock\" is a stronger version of traditional Bock that was first brewed in Munich by the Paulaner Friars, a Franciscan order founded by St. Francis of Paula.\nHistorically, Doppelbock was high in alcohol and sweetness. The story is told that it served as \"liquid bread\" for the Friars during times of fasting when solid food was not permitted. Mark Dredge, in his book \"A Brief History of Lager\", claims that this story is a fable and that the monks produced Doppelbock to supplement their order's vegetarian diet all year. However, earlier in 2011, journalist J. Wilson proved this was at least \"possible\" by consuming only doppelbock and water for the 46 days of Lent.\nToday, Doppelbock is still strong\u00a0\u2013 ranging from 7% to 12% or more by volume. It is clear, with colour ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for a darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although head retention may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavour is very rich and malty, with noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16\u201326 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish.\nThe monks who originally brewed Doppelbock named their beer \"Sankt-vater-bier\" (\"Blessed Father beer\"). This was eventually shortened to \"Salvator\" (literally \"Savior\"), which today is trademarked by Paulaner.\nBrewers of modern Doppelbock often add \"-ator\" to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 \"-ator\" Doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.\nThe following are representative examples of the style: Paulaner Salvator, Ayinger Celebrator, Weihenstephaner Korbinian, Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel, Spaten Optimator, Augustiner Brau Maximator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, Capital Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, Eggenberg Urbock 23\u00ba, Bell's Consecrator, Moretti La Rossa, Samuel Adams Double Bock, Tr\u00f6egs Tr\u00f6egenator Double Bock, Wasatch Brewery Devastator, Great Lakes Doppelrock, Abita Andygator, Wolverine State Brewing Company Predator, Burly Brewing's Burlynator, Monteith's Doppel Bock, and Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock.\nEisbock.\nEisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the Kulmbach district of Bavaria, made by partially freezing a Doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 8.6% to 14.3% by volume.\nIt is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, head retention is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although this should not be hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence.\nThe following are representative examples of the style: Colorado Team Brew \"Warning Sign\", Kulmbacher Reichelbr\u00e4u Eisbock, Eggenberg, Schneider Aventinus Eisbock, Urbock Dunkel Eisbock, Franconia Brewing Company Ice Bock 17%.\nThe strongest ice beer, Strength in Numbers, was a one-time collaboration in 2020 between Schorschbrau of Germany and BrewDog of Scotland, who had competed with each other in the early years of the 21st century to produce the world's strongest beer. \"Strength in Numbers\" was created using traditional ice distillation, reaching a final strength of 57.8% ABV.\nWeizenbock.\nWeizenbock is a style that replaces some of the barley in the grain bill with 40\u201360% wheat. It was first produced in Bavaria in 1907 by G.\u00a0Schneider &amp; Sohn and was named \"Aventinus\" after 16th-century Bavarian historian Johannes Aventinus. The style combines darker Munich malts and top-fermenting wheat beer yeast, brewed at the strength of a Doppelbock.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "4124", "revid": "40286053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4124", "title": "Bantu languages", "text": "Large language family spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa\nThe Bantu languages (English: , Proto-Bantu: *bant\u028a\u0300) are a language family of about 600 languages that are spoken by the Bantu peoples of Central, Southern, Eastern and Southeast Africa. They form the largest branch of the Southern Bantoid languages.\nThe total number of Bantu languages is estimated at between 440 and 680 distinct languages, depending on the definition of \"language\" versus \"dialect\". Many Bantu languages borrow words from each other, and some are mutually intelligible. Some of the languages are spoken by a very small number of people, for example the Kabwa language was estimated in 2007 to be spoken by only 8,500 people but was assessed to be a distinct language.\nThe total number of Bantu speakers is estimated to be around 350 million in 2015 (roughly 30% of the population of Africa or 5% of the world population). Bantu languages are largely spoken southeast of Cameroon, and throughout Central, Southern, Eastern, and Southeast Africa. About one-sixth of Bantu speakers, and one-third of Bantu languages, are found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThe most widely spoken Bantu language by number of speakers is Swahili, with 16 million native speakers and 80 million L2 speakers (2015). Most native speakers of Swahili live in Tanzania, where it is a national language, while as a second language, it is taught as a mandatory subject in many schools in East Africa, and is a lingua franca of the East African Community.\nOther major Bantu languages include Lingala with more than 20 million speakers (Congo, DRC), followed by Zulu with 13.56 million speakers (South Africa), Xhosa, with 8.2 million speakers (South Africa and Zimbabwe), and Shona with less than 10 million speakers (if Manyika and Ndau are included), while Sotho-Tswana languages (Sotho, Tswana and Pedi) have more than 15 million speakers (across Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Zambia). Zimbabwe has Kalanga, Matebele, Nambya, and Xhosa speakers. \"Ethnologue\" separates the largely mutually intelligible Kinyarwanda and Kirundi, which together have 20 million speakers.\nName.\nThe similarity among dispersed Bantu languages had been observed as early as the 17th century. The term \"Bantu\" as a name for the group was not coined but \"noticed\" or \"identified\" (as \"B\u00e2-ntu\") by Wilhelm Bleek as the first European in 1857 or 1858, and popularized in his \"Comparative Grammar\" of 1862. He noticed the term to represent the word for \"people\" in loosely reconstructed Proto-Bantu, from the plural noun class prefix \"*ba-\" categorizing \"people\", and the root \"*nt\u028a\u0300-\" \"some (entity), any\" (e.g. Xhosa \"umntu\" \"person\", \"abantu\" \"people\"; Zulu \"umuntu\" \"person\", \"abantu\" \"people\").\nThere is no native term for the people who speak Bantu languages because they are not an ethnic group. People speaking Bantu languages refer to their languages by ethnic endonyms, which did not have an indigenous concept prior to European contact for the larger ethnolinguistic phylum named by 19th-century European linguists. Bleek's identification was inspired by the anthropological observation of groups frequently self-identifying as \"people\" or \"the true people\" (as is the case, for example, with the term \"Khoikhoi\", but this is a \"kare\" \"praise address\" and not an ethnic name).\nThe term \"narrow Bantu\", excluding those languages classified as Bantoid by Malcolm Guthrie (1948), was introduced in the 1960s.\nThe prefix \"ba-\" specifically refers to people. Endonymically, the term for cultural objects, including language, is formed with the \"ki-\" noun class (Nguni \"\u00edsi-\"), as in KiSwahili (Swahili language and culture), IsiZulu (Zulu language and culture) and KiGanda (Ganda religion and culture).\nIn the 1980s, South African linguists suggested referring to these languages as \"KiNtu.\" The word \"kintu\" exists in some places, but it means \"thing\", with no relation to the concept of \"language\". In addition, delegates at the African Languages Association of Southern Africa conference in 1984 reported that, in some places, the term \"Kintu\" has a derogatory significance. This is because \"kintu\" refers to \"things\" and is used as a dehumanizing term for people who have lost their dignity.\nIn addition, \"Kintu\" is a figure in some mythologies.\nIn the 1990s, the term \"Kintu\" was still occasionally used by South African linguists. But in contemporary decolonial South African linguistics, the term \"Ntu languages\" is used.\nWithin the fierce debate among linguists about the word \"Bantu\", Seidensticker (2024) indicates that there has been a \"profound conceptual trend in which a \"purely technical [term] without any non-linguistic connotations was transformed into a designation referring indiscriminately to language, culture, society, and race\".\"\nOrigin.\nThe Bantu languages descend from a common Proto-Bantu language, which is believed to have been spoken in what is now Cameroon in Central Africa. An estimated 2,500\u20133,000 years ago (1000 BC to 500 BC), speakers of the Proto-Bantu language began a series of migrations eastward and southward, carrying agriculture with them. This Bantu expansion came to dominate Sub-Saharan Africa east of Cameroon, an area where Bantu peoples now constitute nearly the entire population. Some other sources estimate the Bantu Expansion started closer to 3000 BC.\nThe technical term Bantu, meaning \"human beings\" or simply \"people\", was first used by Wilhelm Bleek (1827\u20131875), as the concept is reflected in many of the languages of this group. A common characteristic of Bantu languages is that they use words such as \"muntu\" or \"mutu\" for \"human being\" or in simplistic terms \"person\", and the plural prefix for human nouns starting with \"mu-\" (class 1) in most languages is \"ba-\" (class 2), thus giving \"bantu\" for \"people\". Bleek, and later Carl Meinhof, pursued extensive studies comparing the grammatical structures of Bantu languages.\nClassification.\nThe most widely used classification is an alphanumeric coding system developed by Malcolm Guthrie in his 1948 classification of the Bantu languages. It is mainly geographic. The term \"narrow Bantu\" was coined by the \"Benue\u2013Congo Working Group\" to distinguish Bantu as recognized by Guthrie, from the Bantoid languages not recognized as Bantu by Guthrie.\nIn recent times, the distinctiveness of Narrow Bantu as opposed to the other Southern Bantoid languages has been called into doubt, but the term is still widely used.\nThere is no true genealogical classification of the (Narrow) Bantu languages. Until recently most attempted classifications only considered languages that happen to fall within traditional Narrow Bantu, but there seems to be a continuum with the related languages of South Bantoid.\nAt a broader level, the family is commonly split in two depending on the reflexes of proto-Bantu tone patterns: many Bantuists group together parts of zones A through D (the extent depending on the author) as \"Northwest Bantu\" or \"Forest Bantu\", and the remainder as \"Central Bantu\" or \"Savanna Bantu\". The two groups have been described as having mirror-image tone systems: where Northwest Bantu has a high tone in a cognate, Central Bantu languages generally have a low tone, and vice versa.\nNorthwest Bantu is more divergent internally than Central Bantu, and perhaps less conservative due to contact with non-Bantu Niger\u2013Congo languages; Central Bantu is likely the innovative line cladistically. Northwest Bantu is not a coherent family, but even for Central Bantu the evidence is lexical, with little evidence that it is a historically valid group.\nAnother attempt at a detailed genetic classification to replace the Guthrie system is the 1999 \"Tervuren\" proposal of Bastin, Coupez, and Mann. However, it relies on lexicostatistics, which, because of its reliance on overall similarity rather than shared innovations, may predict spurious groups of conservative languages that are not closely related. Meanwhile, \"Ethnologue\" has added languages to the Guthrie classification which Guthrie overlooked, while removing the Mbam languages (much of zone A), and shifting some languages between groups (much of zones D and E to a new zone J, for example, and part of zone L to K, and part of M to F) in an apparent effort at a semi-genetic, or at least semi-areal, classification. This has been criticized for sowing confusion in one of the few unambiguous ways to distinguish Bantu languages. Nurse &amp; Philippson (2006) evaluate many proposals for low-level groups of Bantu languages, but the result is not a complete portrayal of the family. \"Glottolog\" has incorporated many of these into their classification.\nThe languages that share Dahl's law may also form a valid group, Northeast Bantu. The infobox at right lists these together with various low-level groups that are fairly uncontroversial, though they continue to be revised. The development of a rigorous genealogical classification of many branches of Niger\u2013Congo, not just Bantu, is hampered by insufficient data.\nComputational phylogenetic classifications.\nSimplified phylogeny of northwestern branches of Bantu by Grollemund (2012):\nOther computational phylogenetic analyses of Bantu include Currie et al. (2013), Grollemund et al. (2015), Rexova et al. 2006, Holden et al., 2016, and Whiteley et al. 2018.\nGlottolog classification.\nGlottolog (2021) does not consider the older geographic classification by Guthrie relevant for its ongoing classification based on more recent linguistic studies, and divides Bantu into four main branches: Bantu A-B10-B20-B30, Central-Western Bantu, East Bantu and Mbam-Bube-Jarawan.\nLanguage structure.\nGuthrie reconstructed both the phonemic inventory and the vocabulary of Proto-Bantu.\nThe most prominent grammatical characteristic of Bantu languages is the extensive use of affixes (see Sotho grammar and Ganda noun classes for detailed discussions of these affixes). Each noun belongs to a class, and each language may have several numbered classes, somewhat like grammatical gender in European languages. The class is indicated by a prefix that is part of the noun, as well as agreement markers on verb and qualificative roots connected with the noun. Plurality is indicated by a change of class, with a resulting change of prefix. All Bantu languages are agglutinative.\nThe verb has a number of prefixes, though in the western languages these are often treated as independent words. In Swahili, for example, \"Kitoto kidogo kimekisoma\" (for comparison, \"Kamwana kadoko karikuverenga\" in Shona language) means 'The small child has read it [a book]'. \"kitoto\" 'child' governs the adjective prefix \"ki-\" (representing the diminutive form of the word) and the verb subject prefix \"a-\". Then comes perfect tense \"-me-\" and an object marker \"-ki-\" agreeing with implicit \"kitabu\" 'book' (from Arabic \"kitab\"). Pluralizing to 'children' gives \"Vitoto vidogo vimekisoma\" (\"Vana vadoko varikuverenga\" in Shona), and pluralizing to 'books' (\"vitabu\") gives \"vitoto vidogo vimevisoma\".\nBantu words are typically made up of open syllables of the type CV (consonant-vowel) with most languages having syllables exclusively of this type. The Bushong language recorded by Vansina, however, has final consonants, while slurring of the final syllable (though written) is reported as common among the Tonga of Malawi. The morphological shape of Bantu words is typically CV, VCV, CVCV, VCVCV, etc.; that is, any combination of CV (with possibly a V- syllable at the start). In other words, a strong claim for this language family is that almost all words end in a vowel, precisely because closed syllables (CVC) are not permissible in most of the documented languages, as far as is understood.\nThis tendency to avoid consonant clusters in some positions is important when words are imported from English or other non-Bantu languages. An example from Chewa: the word \"school\", borrowed from English, and then transformed to fit the sound patterns of this language, is \"sukulu\". That is, \"sk-\" has been broken up by inserting an epenthetic \"-u-\"; \"-u\" has also been added at the end of the word. Another example is \"buledi\" for \"bread\". Similar effects are seen in loanwords for other non-African CV languages like Japanese. However, a clustering of sounds at the beginning of a syllable can be readily observed in such languages as Shona, and the Makua languages.\nWith few exceptions, such as Kiswahili and Rutooro, Bantu languages are tonal and have two to four register tones.\nReduplication.\nReduplication is a common morphological phenomenon in Bantu languages and is usually used to indicate frequency or intensity of the action signalled by the (unreduplicated) verb stem.\nWell-known words and names that have reduplication include:\nRepetition emphasizes the repeated word in the context that it is used. For instance, \"Mwenda pole hajikwai,\" means \"He who goes slowly doesn't trip,\" while, \"Pole pole ndio mwendo,\" means \"A slow but steady pace wins the race.\" The latter repeats \"pole\" to emphasize the consistency of slowness of the pace.\nAs another example, \"Haraka haraka\" would mean \"hurrying just for the sake of hurrying\" (reckless hurry), as in \"Njoo! Haraka haraka\" [come here! Hurry, hurry].\nIn contrast, there are some words in some of the languages in which reduplication has the opposite meaning. It usually denotes short durations, or lower intensity of the action, and also means a few repetitions or a little bit more.\nNoun class.\nThe following is a list of nominal classes in Bantu languages:\nSyntax.\nVirtually all Bantu languages have a subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order, with some exceptions, such as \nthe Nen language, which has a subject\u2013object\u2013verb word order.\nBy country.\nFollowing is an incomplete list of the principal Bantu languages of each country. Included are those languages that constitute at least 1% of the population and have at least 10% the number of speakers of the largest Bantu language in the country.\nMost languages are referred to in English without the class prefix (\"Swahili\", \"Tswana\", \"Ndebele\"), but are sometimes seen with the (language-specific) prefix (\"Kiswahili\", \"Setswana\", \"Sindebele\"). In a few cases prefixes are used to distinguish languages with the same root in their name, such as Tshilub\u00e0 and Kiluba (both \"Luba\"), Umbundu and Kimbundu (both \"Mbundu\"). The prefixless form typically does not occur in the language itself, but is the basis for other words based on the ethnicity. So, in the country of Botswana the people are the \"Batswana\", one person is a \"Motswana\", and the language is \"Setswana\"; and in Uganda, centred on the kingdom of \"Buganda\", the dominant ethnicity are the \"Baganda\" (singular \"Muganda\"), whose language is \"Luganda\".\n\"Swahili is a recognized national language\"\n\"Swahili is a recognized national language\"\n\"Swahili is the national language. English and Swahili are official languages.\"\n\"Swahili is a recognized national language\"\n\"Swahili, Kinyarwanda, English, and French are official languages\"\nSouth Africa.\nAccording to the South African National Census of 2011:\n\"Swahili is the national language\"\n\"Swahili and English are official languages\"\nGeographic areas.\nMap 1 shows Bantu languages in Africa and map 2 a magnification of the Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon area, as of July 2017.\nBantu words popularised in western cultures.\nA case has been made out for borrowings of many place-names and even misremembered rhymes \u2013 chiefly from one of the Luba varieties \u2013 in the USA.\nSome words from various Bantu languages have been borrowed into western languages. These include: \nWriting systems.\nAlong with the Latin script and Arabic script orthographies, there are also some modern indigenous writing systems used for Bantu languages:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition to being the first operational long-range SAM and the first operational pulse doppler aviation radar, it was the only SAM deployed by the United States Air Force.\nStored horizontally in a launcher shelter with a movable roof, the missile was erected, fired vertically using rocket boosters to high altitude, and then tipped over into a horizontal Mach 2.5 cruise powered by ramjet engines. This lofted trajectory allowed the missile to operate at a maximum range as great as . Controlled from the ground for most of its flight, when it reached the target area it was commanded to begin a dive, activating an onboard active radar homing seeker for terminal guidance. A radar proximity fuse detonated the warhead, either a large conventional explosive or the W40 nuclear warhead.\nThe Air Force originally planned for a total of 52 sites covering most of the major cities and industrial regions in the US. The United States Army was deploying their own systems at the same time, and the two services fought constantly both in political circles and in the press. Development dragged on, and by the time it was ready for deployment in the late 1950s, the nuclear threat had moved from manned bombers to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). By this time the Army had successfully deployed the much shorter range Nike Hercules that they claimed filled any possible need through the 1960s, in spite of Air Force claims to the contrary.\nAs testing continued, the Air Force reduced its plans to sixteen sites, and then again to eight with an additional two sites in Canada. The first US site was declared operational in 1959, but with only a single working missile. Bringing the rest of the missiles into service took years, by which time the system was obsolete. Deactivations began in 1969 and by 1972 all Bomarc sites had been shut down. A small number were used as target drones, and only a few remain on display today.\nDesign and development.\nInitial studies.\nDuring World War II, the US Army Air Force (USAAF) concluded that existing anti-aircraft guns, only marginally effective against existing generations of propeller-driven aircraft, would not be effective at all against the emerging jet-powered designs. Like the Germans and British before them, they concluded the only successful defence would be to use guided weapons.\nAs early as 1944 the United States Army started exploring anti-aircraft missiles, examining a variety of concepts. At the time, two basic concepts appeared possible; one would use a short-range rocket that flew directly at the target from below following a course close to the line-of-sight, and the other would fly up to the target's altitude and then tip over and fly horizontally towards the target like a fighter aircraft. As both concepts seemed promising, the Army Air Force was given the task of developing the airplane-like design, while the Army Ordnance Department was given the more ballistic collision-course concept. Official requirements were published in 1945.\nOfficial requirements were published in 1945; Bell Laboratories won the Ordnance contract for a short-range line-of-sight weapon under Project Nike, while a team of players led by Boeing won the contract for a long-range design known as Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft, or GAPA. GAPA moved to the United States Air Force when that branch was formed in 1947. In 1946, the USAAF also started two early research projects into anti-missile systems in Project Thumper (MX-795) and Project Wizard (MX-794).\nBomarc A.\nFormally organized in 1946 under USAAF project MX-606, by 1950 Boeing had launched more than 100 test rockets in various configurations, all under the designator XSAM-A-1 GAPA. The tests were very promising, and Boeing received a USAF contract in 1949 to develop a production design under project MX-1599.\nThe MX-1599 missile was to be a ramjet-powered, nuclear-armed long-range surface-to-air missile to defend the Continental United States from high-flying bombers. The Michigan Aerospace Research Center (MARC) was added to the project soon afterward, and this gave the new missile its name Bomarc (for Boeing and MARC). In 1951, the USAF decided to emphasize its point of view that missiles were nothing else than pilotless aircraft by assigning aircraft designators to its missile projects, and anti-aircraft missiles received F-for-Fighter designations. The Bomarc became the F-99.\nBy this time, the Army's Nike project was progressing well and would enter operational service in 1953. This led the Air Force to begin a lengthy series of attacks on the Army in the press, a common occurrence at the time known as \"policy by press release\". When the Army released its first official information on Ajax to the press, the Air Force responded by leaking information on BOMARC to \"Aviation Week\", and continued to denigrate Nike in the press over the next few years, in one case showing a graphic of Washington being destroyed by nuclear bombs that Ajax failed to stop.\nTests of the XF-99 test vehicles began in September 1952 and continued through early 1955. The XF-99 tested only the liquid-fueled booster rocket, which would accelerate the missile to ramjet ignition speed. In February 1955, tests of the XF-99A propulsion test vehicles began. These included live ramjets, but still had no guidance system or warhead. The designation YF-99A had been reserved for the operational test vehicles. In August 1955, the USAF discontinued the use of aircraft-like type designators for missiles, and the XF-99A and YF-99A became XIM-99A and YIM-99A, respectively. Originally the USAF had allocated the designation IM-69, but this was changed (possibly at Boeing's request to keep number 99) to IM-99 in October 1955.\nBy this time, Ajax was widely deployed around the United States and some overseas locations, and the Army was beginning to develop its much more powerful successor, Nike Hercules. Hercules was an existential threat to BOMARC, as its much greater range and nuclear warhead filled many of the roles that BOMARC was designed for. A new round of fighting in the press broke out, capped by an article in \"The New York Times\" entitled \"Air Force Calls Army Nike Unfit To Guard Nation\".\nIn October 1957, the first YIM-99A production-representative prototype flew with full guidance, and succeeded in passing the target within the intended warhead's destructive radius. In late 1957, Boeing received the production contract for the IM-99A Bomarc A, and in September 1959, the first IM-99A squadron became operational.\nThe IM-99A had an operational radius of and was designed to fly at Mach\u00a02.5\u20132.8 at a cruising altitude of . It was long and weighed . Its armament was either a conventional warhead or a W40 nuclear warhead (7\u201310 kiloton yield). A liquid-fuel rocket engine boosted the Bomarc to Mach 2, when its Marquardt RJ43-MA-3 ramjet engines, fueled by 80-octane gasoline, would take over for the remainder of the flight. This was the same model of engine used to power the Lockheed X-7, the Lockheed AQM-60 Kingfisher drone used to test air defenses, and the Lockheed D-21 launched from the back of an M-21, although the Bomarc and Kingfisher engines used different materials due to the longer duration of their flights.\nOperational units.\nThe operational IM-99A missiles were based horizontally in semi-hardened shelters, nicknamed \"coffins\". After the launch order, the shelter's roof would slide open, and the missile raised to the vertical. After the missile was supplied with fuel for the booster rocket, it would be launched by the Aerojet General LR59-AJ-13 booster. After sufficient speed was reached, the Marquardt RJ43-MA-3 ramjets would ignite and propel the missile to its cruise speed of Mach\u00a02.8 at an altitude of .\nWhen the Bomarc was within of the target, its own Westinghouse AN/DPN-34 radar guided the missile to the interception point. The maximum range of the IM-99A was , and it was fitted with either a conventional high-explosive or a 10\u00a0kiloton W-40 nuclear fission warhead.\nThe Bomarc relied on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE), an automated control system used by NORAD for detecting, tracking and intercepting enemy bomber aircraft. SAGE allowed for remote launching of the Bomarc missiles, which were housed in a constant combat-ready basis in individual launch shelters in remote areas. At the height of the program, there were 14 Bomarc sites located in the US and two in Canada.\nBomarc B.\nThe liquid-fuel booster of the Bomarc A had several drawbacks. It took two minutes to fuel before launch, which could be a long time in high-speed intercepts, and its hypergolic propellants (hydrazine and nitric acid) were very dangerous to handle, leading to several serious accidents.\nAs soon as high-thrust solid-fuel rockets became a reality in the mid-1950s, the USAF began to develop a new solid-fueled Bomarc variant, the IM-99B Bomarc\u00a0B. It used a Thiokol XM51 booster, and also had improved Marquardt RJ43-MA-7 (and finally the RJ43-MA-11) ramjets. The first IM-99B was launched in May 1959, but problems with the new propulsion system delayed the first fully successful flight until July 1960, when a supersonic MQM-15A Regulus II drone was intercepted. Because the new booster required less space in the missile, more ramjet fuel could be carried, thus increasing the range to . The terminal homing system was also improved, using the world's first pulse Doppler search radar, the Westinghouse AN/DPN-53. All Bomarc\u00a0Bs were equipped with the W-40 nuclear warhead. In June 1961, the first IM-99B squadron became operational, and Bomarc\u00a0B quickly replaced most Bomarc\u00a0A missiles. On 23 March 1961, a Bomarc\u00a0B successfully intercepted a Regulus\u00a0II cruise missile flying at , thus achieving the highest interception in the world up to that date.\nBoeing built 570 Bomarc missiles between 1957 and 1964, 269 CIM-10A, 301 CIM-10B.\nIn September 1958 Air Research &amp; Development Command decided to transfer the Bomarc program from its testing at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to a new facility on Santa Rosa Island, south of Eglin AFB Hurlburt Field on the Gulf of Mexico. To operate the facility and to provide training and operational evaluation in the missile program, Air Defense Command established the 4751st Air Defense Wing (Missile) (4751st ADW) on 15 January 1958. The first launch from Santa Rosa took place on 15 January 1959.\nOperational history.\nIn 1955, to support a program which called for 40 squadrons of BOMARC (120 missiles to a squadron for a total of 4,800 missiles), ADC reached a decision on the location of these 40 squadrons and suggested operational dates for each. The sequence was as follows: ... l. McGuire 1/60 2. Suffolk 2/60 3. Otis 3/60 4. Dow 4/60 5. Niagara Falls 1/61 6. Plattsburgh 1/61 7. Kinross 2/61 8. K.I. Sawyer 2/61 9. Langley 2/61 10. Truax 3/61 11. Paine 3/61 12. Portland 3/61 ... At the end of 1958, ADC plans called for construction of the following BOMARC bases in the following order: l. McGuire 2. Suffolk 3. Otis 4. Dow 5. Langley 6. Truax 7. Kinross 8. Duluth 9. Ethan Allen 10. Niagara Falls 11. Paine 12. Adair 13. Travis 14. Vandenberg 15. San Diego 16. Malmstrom 17. Grand Forks 18. Minot 19. Youngstown 20. Seymour-Johnson 21. Bunker Hill 22. Sioux Falls 23. Charleston 24. McConnell 25. Holloman 26. McCoy 27. Amarillo 28. Barksdale 29. Williams.\nUnited States.\nThe first USAF operational Bomarc squadron was the 46th Air Defense Missile Squadron (ADMS), organized on 1 January 1959 and activated on 25 March. The 46th ADMS was assigned to the New York Air Defense Sector at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. The training program, under the 4751st Air Defense Wing used technicians acting as instructors and was established for a four-month duration. Training included missile maintenance; SAGE operations and launch procedures, including the launch of an unarmed missile at Eglin. In September 1959 the squadron assembled at their permanent station, the Bomarc site near McGuire AFB, and trained for operational readiness. The first Bomarc-A were used at McGuire on 19 September 1959 with Kincheloe AFB getting the first operational IM-99Bs. While several of the squadrons replicated earlier fighter interceptor unit numbers, they were all new organizations with no previous historical counterpart.\nADC's initial plans called for some 52 Bomarc sites around the United States with 120 missiles each but as defense budgets decreased during the 1950s the number of sites dropped substantially. Ongoing development and reliability problems didn't help, nor did Congressional debate over the missile's usefulness and necessity. In June 1959, the Air Force authorized 16 Bomarc sites with 56 missiles each; the initial five would get the IM-99A with the remainder getting the IM-99B. However, in March 1960, HQ USAF cut deployment to eight sites in the United States and two in Canada.\nBomarc incident.\nWithin a year of operations, a Bomarc\u00a0A with a nuclear warhead caught fire at McGuire AFB on 7 June 1960 after its on-board helium tank exploded. While the missile's explosives did not detonate, the heat melted the warhead and released plutonium, which the fire crews spread. The Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission cleaned up the site and covered it with concrete. This was the only major incident involving the weapon system. The site remained in operation for several years following the fire. Since its closure in 1972, the area has remained off limits, primarily due to low levels of plutonium contamination. Between 2002 and 2004, 21,998 cubic yards of contaminated debris and soils were shipped to what was then known as Envirocare, located in Utah.\nModification and deactivation.\nIn 1962, the US Air Force started using modified A-models as drones; following the October 1962 tri-service redesignation of aircraft and weapons systems they became CQM-10As. Otherwise the air defense missile squadrons maintained alert while making regular trips to Santa Rosa Island for training and firing practice. After the inactivation of the 4751st ADW(M) on 1 July 1962 and transfer of Hurlburt to Tactical Air Command for air commando operations the 4751st Air Defense Squadron (Missile) remained at Hurlburt and Santa Rosa Island for training purposes.\nIn 1964, the liquid-fueled Bomarc-A sites and squadrons began to be deactivated. The sites at Dow and Suffolk County closed first. The remainder continued to be operational for several more years while the government started dismantling the air defense missile network. Niagara Falls was the first BOMARC B installation to close, in December 1969; the others remained on alert through 1972. In April 1972, the last Bomarc B in U.S. Air Force service was retired at McGuire and the 46th ADMS inactivated and the base was deactivated.\nIn the era of the intercontinental ballistic missiles the Bomarc, designed to intercept relatively slow manned bombers, had become a useless asset. The remaining Bomarc missiles were used by all armed services as high-speed target drones for tests of other air-defense missiles. The Bomarc A and Bomarc B targets were designated as CQM-10A and CQM-10B, respectively.\nFollowing the accident, the McGuire complex has never been sold or converted to other uses and remains in Air Force ownership, making it the most intact site of the eight in the US. It has been nominated to the National Register of Historic Sites.\nCanada.\nThe Bomarc Missile Program was highly controversial in Canada. The Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker initially agreed to deploy the missiles, and shortly thereafter controversially scrapped the Avro Arrow, a supersonic manned interceptor aircraft, arguing that the missile program made the Arrow unnecessary.\nInitially, it was unclear whether the missiles would be equipped with nuclear warheads. By 1960 it became known that the missiles were to have a nuclear payload, and a debate ensued about whether Canada should accept nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the Diefenbaker government decided that the Bomarcs should not be equipped with nuclear warheads. The dispute split the Diefenbaker Cabinet, and led to the collapse of the government in 1963. The Official Opposition and Liberal Party leader Lester B. Pearson originally was against nuclear missiles, but reversed his personal position and argued in favour of accepting nuclear warheads. He won the 1963 election, largely on the basis of this issue, and his new Liberal government proceeded to accept nuclear-armed Bomarcs, with the first being deployed on 31 December 1963. When the nuclear warheads were deployed, Pearson's wife, Maryon, resigned her honorary membership in the anti-nuclear weapons group, Voice of Women.\nCanadian operational deployment of the Bomarc involved the formation of two specialized Surface/Air Missile squadrons. The first to begin operations was No. 446 SAM Squadron at RCAF Station North Bay, which was the command and control center for both squadrons. With construction of the compound and related facilities completed in 1961, the squadron received its Bomarcs in 1961, without nuclear warheads. The squadron became fully operational from 31 December 1963, when the nuclear warheads arrived, until disbanding on 31 March 1972. All the warheads were stored separately and under control of Detachment 1 of the USAF 425th Munitions Maintenance Squadron at Stewart Air Force Base. During operational service, the Bomarcs were maintained on stand-by, on a 24-hour basis, but were never fired, although the squadron test-fired the missiles at Eglin AFB, Florida on annual winter retreats.\nNo. 447 SAM Squadron operating out of RCAF Station La Macaza, Quebec, was activated on 15 September 1962 although warheads were not delivered until late 1963. The squadron followed the same operational procedures as No. 446, its sister squadron. With the passage of time the operational capability of the 1950s-era Bomarc system no longer met modern requirements; the Department of National Defence deemed that the Bomarc missile defense was no longer a viable system, and ordered both squadrons to be stood down in 1972. The bunkers and ancillary facilities remain at both former sites.\n 446 SAM Squadron: 28 IM-99B, CFB North Bay, Ontario 1962\u20131972\n Bomarc site located at \n 447 SAM Squadron: 28 IM-99B, La Macaza, Quebec (La Macaza \u2013 Mont Tremblant International Airport) 1962\u20131972\n Bomarc site located at (Approximately)\nOperators.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida\n Launch Complex 4 (LC-4) was used for Bomarc testing and development launches 2 February 1956 \u2013 15 April 1960 (17 Launches). \n Vandenberg Air Force Base, California\n Two launch sites, BOM-1 and BOM-2 were used by the United States Navy for Bomarc launches against aerial targets.

As of December 2006, the suspect missile was stored in a secure compound behind the Armaments Museum.

Its two upper main tributaries are the Uraricoera and the Takutu. The latter almost links its sources with those of the Essequibo; during floods headwaters of the Branco and those of the Essequibo are connected, allowing a level of exchange in the aquatic fauna (such as fish) between the two systems.\nThe Branco flows nearly south, and finds its way into the Negro through several channels and a chain of lagoons similar to those of the latter river.

Period from 1998 to 2022.\nWater chemistry.\nAs suggested by its name, the Branco (literally \"white\" in Portuguese) has whitish water that may appear almost milky due to the inorganic sediments it carries. It is traditionally considered a whitewater river, although the major seasonal fluctuations in its physico-chemical characteristics makes a classification difficult and some consider it clearwater. Especially the river's upper parts at the headwaters are clear and flow through rocky country, leading to the suggestion that sediments mainly originate from the lower parts. Furthermore, its chemistry and color may contradict each other compared to the traditional Amazonian river classifications. The Branco River has pH 6\u20137 and low levels of dissolved organic carbon.\nAlfred Russel Wallace mentioned the coloration in \"On the Rio Negro\", a paper read at the 13 June 1853 meeting of the Royal Geographical Society, in which he said: \"[The Rio Branco] is white to a remarkable degree, its waters being actually milky in appearance\". Alexander von Humboldt attributed the color to the presence of silicates in the water, principally mica and talc. There is a visible contrast with the waters of the Rio Negro at the confluence of the two rivers. The Rio Negro is a blackwater river with dark tea-colored acidic water (pH 3.5\u20134.5) that contains high levels of dissolved organic carbon.\nRiver capture.\nUntil approximately 20,000 years ago the headwaters of the Branco River flowed not into the Amazon, but via the Takutu Graben in the Rupununi area of Guyana towards the Caribbean. Currently in the rainy season much of the Rupununi area floods, with water draining both to the Amazon (via the Branco River) and the Essequibo River.\nCitations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4146", "revid": "3632083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4146", "title": "Bus", "text": "Large road vehicle for transporting people\nA bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a motor vehicle that carries significantly more passengers than an average car or van, but fewer than the average rail transport. It is most commonly used in public transport, but is also in use for charter purposes, or through private ownership. Although the average bus carries between 30 and 100 passengers, some buses have a capacity of up to 300 passengers. The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with double-decker and articulated buses carrying larger loads, and midibuses and minibuses carrying smaller loads. Coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, are free. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving license.\nBuses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles.\nHorse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882. The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895. Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel. As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world.\nName.\nThe word \"bus\" is a shortened form of the Latin adjectival form (\"for all\"), the dative plural of (\"all\"). The theoretical full name is in French (\"vehicle for all\"). The name originates from a mass-transport service started in 1823 by a French corn-mill owner named Stanislas Baudry in Richebourg, a suburb of Nantes. A by-product of his mill was hot water, and thus next to it he established a spa business. In order to encourage customers he started a horse-drawn transport service from the city centre of Nantes to his establishment. The first vehicles stopped in front of the shop of a hatter named Omn\u00e9s, which displayed a large sign inscribed \"Omnes Omnibus\", a pun on his Latin-sounding surname, being the masculine and feminine nominative, vocative and accusative form of the Latin adjective (\"all\"), combined with \"omnibus\", the dative plural form meaning \"for all\", thus giving his shop the name \"Omn\u00e9s for all\", or \"everything for everyone\".\nHis transport scheme was a huge success, although not as he had intended as most of his passengers did not visit his spa. He turned the transport service into his principal lucrative business venture and closed the mill and spa. Nantes citizens soon gave the nickname \"omnibus\" to the vehicle. Having invented the successful concept Baudry moved to Paris and launched the first omnibus service there in April 1828. A similar service was introduced in Manchester in 1824 and in London in 1829.\nHistory.\nSteam buses.\nRegular intercity bus services by steam-powered buses were pioneered in England in the 1830s by Walter Hancock and by associates of Sir Goldsworthy Gurney, among others, running reliable services over road conditions which were too hazardous for horse-drawn transportation.\nThe first mechanically propelled omnibus appeared on the streets of London on 22 April 1833. Steam carriages were much less likely to overturn, they travelled faster than horse-drawn carriages, they were much cheaper to run, and caused much less damage to the road surface due to their wide tyres.\nHowever, the heavy road tolls imposed by the turnpike trusts discouraged steam road vehicles and left the way clear for the horse bus companies, and from 1861 onwards, harsh legislation virtually eliminated mechanically propelled vehicles from the roads of Great Britain for 30 years, the Locomotive Act 1861 imposing restrictive speed limits on \"road locomotives\" of in towns and cities, and in the country.\nTrolleybuses.\nIn parallel to the development of the bus was the invention of the electric trolleybus, typically fed through trolley poles by overhead wires. The Siemens brothers, William in England and Ernst Werner in Germany, collaborated on the development of the trolleybus concept. Sir William first proposed the idea in an article to the \"Journal of the Society of Arts\" in 1881 as an \"...arrangement by which an ordinary omnibus...would have a suspender thrown at intervals from one side of the street to the other, and two wires hanging from these suspenders; allowing contact rollers to run on these two wires, the current could be conveyed to the tram-car, and back again to the dynamo machine at the station, without the necessity of running upon rails at all.\"\nThe first such vehicle, the Electromote, was made by his brother Ernst Werner von Siemens and presented to the public in 1882 in Halensee, Germany. Although this experimental vehicle fulfilled all the technical criteria of a typical trolleybus, it was dismantled in the same year after the demonstration.\nMax Schiemann opened a passenger-carrying trolleybus in 1901 near Dresden, in Germany. Although this system operated only until 1904, Schiemann had developed what is now the standard trolleybus current collection system. In the early days, a few other methods of current collection were used. Leeds and Bradford became the first cities to put trolleybuses into service in Great Britain on 20 June 1911.\nMotor buses.\nIn Siegerland, Germany, two passenger bus lines ran briefly, but unprofitably, in 1895 using a six-passenger motor carriage developed from the 1893 Benz Viktoria. Another commercial bus line using the same model Benz omnibuses ran for a short time in 1898 in the rural area around Llandudno, Wales.\nGermany's Daimler Motors Corporation also produced one of the earliest motor-bus models in 1898, selling a double-decker bus to the Motor Traction Company which was first used on the streets of London on 23 April 1898. The vehicle had a maximum speed of and accommodated up to 20 passengers, in an enclosed area below and on an open-air platform above. With the success and popularity of this bus, DMG expanded production, selling more buses to companies in London and, in 1899, to Stockholm and Speyer. Daimler Motors Corporation also entered into a partnership with the British company Milnes and developed a new double-decker in 1902 that became the market standard.\nThe first mass-produced bus model was the B-type double-decker bus, designed by Frank Searle and operated by the London General Omnibus Company\u2014it entered service in 1910, and almost 3,000 had been built by the end of the decade. Hundreds of them saw military service on the Western Front during the First World War.\nThe Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company, which rapidly became a major manufacturer of buses in the US, was founded in Chicago in 1923 by John D. Hertz. General Motors purchased a majority stake in 1925 and changed its name to the Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. GM purchased the balance of the shares in 1943 to form the GM Truck and Coach Division.\nModels expanded in the 20th century, leading to the widespread introduction of the contemporary recognizable form of full-sized buses from the 1950s. The AEC Routemaster, developed in the 1950s, was a pioneering design and remains an icon of London to this day. The innovative design used lightweight aluminium and techniques developed in aircraft production during World War II. As well as a novel weight-saving integral design, it also introduced for the first time on a bus independent front suspension, power steering, a fully automatic gearbox, and power-hydraulic braking.\nTypes.\nFormats include single-decker bus, double-decker bus (both usually with a rigid chassis) and articulated bus (or 'bendy-bus') the prevalence of which varies from country to country. High-capacity bi-articulated buses are also manufactured, and passenger-carrying trailers\u2014either towed behind a rigid bus (a bus trailer) or hauled as a trailer by a truck (a trailer bus). Smaller midibuses have a lower capacity and open-top buses are typically used for leisure purposes. In many new fleets, particularly in local transit systems, a shift to low-floor buses is occurring, primarily for easier accessibility. Coaches are designed for longer-distance travel and are typically fitted with individual high-backed reclining seats, seat belts, toilets, and audio-visual entertainment systems, and can operate at higher speeds with more capacity for luggage. Coaches may be single- or double-deckers, articulated, and often include a separate luggage compartment under the passenger floor. Guided buses are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or bus lanes.\nBus manufacturing may be by a single company (an integral manufacturer), or by one manufacturer's building a bus body over a chassis produced by another manufacturer.\nDesign.\nAccessibility.\nDuring most of the 20th century, transit buses were almost exclusively high-floor vehicles, and they used wheelchair lifts if they provided accessibility at all. (In the U.S., only in 1993 did accessibility become a requirement in all new buses, under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.) However, they are now increasingly of low-floor design and optionally also 'kneel' air suspension and have ramps to provide access for wheelchair users and people with baby carriages, sometimes as electrically or hydraulically extended under-floor constructs for level access. Prior to more general use of such technology, these wheelchair users could only use specialist para-transit mobility buses.\nAccessible vehicles also have wider entrances and interior gangways and space for wheelchairs. Interior fittings and destination displays may also be designed to be usable by the visually impaired. Coaches generally still use wheelchair lifts instead of low-floor designs. In some countries, vehicles are required to have these features by disability discrimination laws.\nConfiguration.\nBuses were initially configured with an engine in the front and an entrance at the rear. With the transition to one-person operation, many manufacturers moved to mid- or rear-engined designs, with a single door at the front or multiple doors. The move to the low-floor design has all but eliminated the mid-engined design, although some coaches still have mid-mounted engines. Front-engined buses still persist for niche markets such as American school buses, some minibuses, and buses in less developed countries, which may be derived from truck chassis, rather than purpose-built bus designs. Most buses have two axles, while articulated buses have three.\nGuidance.\nGuided buses are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or bus lanes. Guidance can be mechanical, optical, or electromagnetic. Extensions of the guided technology include the Guided Light Transit and Translohr systems, although these are more often termed 'rubber-tyred trams' as they have limited or no mobility away from their guideways.\nLiveries.\nTransit buses are normally painted to identify the operator or a route, function, or to demarcate low-cost or premium service buses. Liveries may be painted onto the vehicle, applied using adhesive vinyl technologies, or using decals. Vehicles often also carry bus advertising or part or all of their visible surfaces (as mobile billboard). Campaign buses may be decorated with key campaign messages; these can be to promote an event or initiative.\nPropulsion.\nThe most common power source since the 1920s has been the diesel engine. Early buses, known as trolleybuses, were powered by electricity supplied from overhead lines. Nowadays, electric buses often carry their own battery, which is sometimes recharged on stops/stations to keep the size of the battery small/lightweight. Currently, interest exists in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, electric buses, and ones powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel. Gyrobuses, which are powered by the momentum stored by a flywheel, were tried in the 1940s.\nDimensions.\nUnited Kingdom and European Union:\n Maximum Length: Single rear axle . Twin rear axle .\n Maximum Width: \nUnited States, Canada and Mexico:\n Maximum Length: None\n Maximum Width: \nManufacture.\nEarly bus manufacturing grew out of carriage coach building, and later out of automobile or truck manufacturers. Early buses were merely a bus body fitted to a truck chassis. This body+chassis approach has continued with modern specialist manufacturers, although there also exist integral designs such as the Leyland National where the two are practically inseparable. Specialist builders also exist and concentrate on building buses for special uses or modifying standard buses into specialised products.\nIntegral designs have the advantages that they have been well-tested for strength and stability, and also are off-the-shelf. However, two incentives cause use of the chassis+body model. First, it allows the buyer and manufacturer both to shop for the best deal for their needs, rather than having to settle on one fixed design\u2014the buyer can choose the body and the chassis separately. Second, over the lifetime of a vehicle (in constant service and heavy traffic), it will likely get minor damage now and again, and being able easily to replace a body panel or window etc. can vastly increase its service life and save the cost and inconvenience of removing it from service.\nAs with the rest of the automotive industry, into the 20th century, bus manufacturing increasingly became globalized, with manufacturers producing buses far from their intended market to exploit labour and material cost advantages. A typical city bus costs almost US$450,000.\nUses.\nPublic transport.\nTransit buses, used on public transport bus services, have utilitarian fittings designed for efficient movement of large numbers of people, and often have multiple doors. Coaches are used for longer-distance routes. High-capacity bus rapid transit services may use the bi-articulated bus or tram-style buses such as the Wright StreetCar and the Irisbus Civis.\nBuses and coach services often operate to a predetermined published public transport timetable defining the route and the timing, but smaller vehicles may be used on more flexible demand responsive transport services.\nTourism.\nBuses play a major part in the tourism industry. Tour buses around the world allow tourists to view local attractions or scenery. These are often open-top buses, but can also be regular buses or coaches.\nIn local sightseeing, City Sightseeing is the largest operator of local tour buses, operating on a franchised basis all over the world. Specialist tour buses are also often owned and operated by safari parks and other theme parks or resorts. Longer-distance tours are also carried out by bus, either on a turn up and go basis or through a tour operator, and usually allow disembarkation from the bus to allow touring of sites of interest on foot. These may be day trips or longer excursions incorporating hotel stays. Tour buses often carry a tour guide, although the driver or a recorded audio commentary may also perform this function. The tour operator may be a subsidiary of a company that operates buses and coaches for other uses or an independent company that charters buses or coaches. Commuter transport operators may also use their coaches to conduct tours within the target city between the morning and evening commuter transport journey.\nBuses and coaches are also a common component of the wider package holiday industry, providing private airport transfers (in addition to general airport buses) and organised tours and day trips for holidaymakers on the package.\nTour buses can also be hired as chartered buses by groups for sightseeing at popular holiday destinations. These private tour buses may offer specific stops, such as all the historical sights, or allow the customers to choose their own itineraries. Tour buses come with professional and informed staff and insurance, and maintain state governed safety standards. Some provide other facilities like entertainment units, luxurious reclining seats, large scenic windows, and even lavatories.\nPublic long-distance coach networks are also often used as a low-cost method of travel by students or young people travelling the world. Some companies such as Topdeck Travel were set up specifically to use buses to drive the hippie trail or travel to places such as North Africa.\nIn many tourist or travel destinations, a bus is part of the tourist attraction, such as the North American tourist trolleys, London's AEC Routemaster heritage routes, or the customised buses of Malta, Asia, and the Americas. Another example of tourist stops is the homes of celebrities, such as tours based near Hollywood. There are several such services between 6000 and 7000 Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles.\nStudent transport.\nIn some countries, particularly the US and Canada, buses used to transport schoolchildren have evolved into a specific design with specified mandatory features. American states have also adopted laws regarding motorist conduct around school buses, including large fines and possibly prison for passing a stopped school bus in the process of loading or offloading children passengers. These school buses may have school bus yellow livery and crossing guards. Other countries may mandate the use of seat belts. As a minimum, many countries require a bus carrying students to display a , and may also adopt yellow liveries. Student transport often uses older buses cascaded from service use, retrofitted with more seats or seatbelts. Student transport may be operated by local authorities or private contractors. \nSchools may also own and operate their own buses for other transport needs, such as class field trips or transport to associated sports, music, or other school events.\nPrivate charter.\nDue to the costs involved in owning, operating, and driving buses and coaches, much bus and coach use comes from the private hire of vehicles from charter bus companies, either for a day or two or on a longer contract basis, where the charter company provides the vehicles and qualified drivers.\nCharter bus operators may be completely independent businesses, or charter hire may be a subsidiary business of a public transport operator that might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual-purpose coach-seated buses. Many private taxicab companies also operate larger minibus vehicles to cater for group fares. Companies, private groups, and social clubs may hire buses or coaches as a cost-effective method of transporting a group to an event or site, such as a group meeting, racing event, or organised recreational activity such as a summer camp. Schools often hire charter bus services on a regular basis for transportation of children to and from their homes. Chartered buses are also used by education institutes for transport to conventions, exhibitions, and field trips. Entertainment or event companies may also hire temporary shuttles buses for transport at events such as festivals or conferences. Party buses are used by companies in a similar manner to limousine hire, for luxury private transport to social events or as a touring experience. Sleeper buses are used by bands or other organisations that tour between entertainment venues and require mobile rest and recreation facilities. Some couples hire preserved buses for their wedding transport, instead of the traditional car. Buses are often hired for parades or processions. Victory parades are often held for triumphant sports teams, who often tour their home town or city in an open-top bus. Sports teams may also contract out their transport to a team bus, for travel to away games, to a competition or to a final event. These buses are often specially decorated in a livery matching the team colours. Private companies often contract out private shuttle bus services, for transport of their customers or patrons, such as hotels, amusement parks, university campuses, or private airport transfer services. This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from parking lots. High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for executive or VIP transport. Charter buses may also be used in tourism and for promotion (See Tourism and Promotion sections).\nPrivate ownership.\nMany organisations, including the police, not for profit, social or charitable groups with a regular need for group transport may find it practical or cost-effective to own and operate a bus for their own needs. These are often minibuses for practical, tax and driver licensing reasons, although they can also be full-size buses. Cadet or scout groups or other youth organizations may also own buses. Companies such as railroads, construction contractors, and agricultural firms may own buses to transport employees to and from remote job sites. Specific charities may exist to fund and operate bus transport, usually using specially modified mobility buses or otherwise accessible buses (See Accessibility section). Some use their contributions to buy vehicles and provide volunteer drivers.\nAirport operators make use of special airside airport buses for crew and passenger transport in the secure airside parts of an airport. Some public authorities, police forces, and military forces make use of armoured buses where there is a special need to provide increased passenger protection. The United States Secret Service acquired two in 2010 for transporting dignitaries needing special protection. Police departments make use of police buses for a variety of reasons, such as prisoner transport, officer transport, temporary detention facilities, and as command and control vehicles. Some fire departments also use a converted bus as a command post while those in cold climates might retain a bus as a heated shelter at fire scenes. Many are drawn from retired school or service buses.\nPromotion.\nBuses are often used for advertising, political campaigning, , public relations, or promotional purposes. These may take the form of temporary charter hire of service buses, or the temporary or permanent conversion and operation of buses, usually of second-hand buses. Extreme examples include converting the bus with displays and decorations or awnings and fittings. Interiors may be fitted out for exhibition or information purposes with special equipment or audio visual devices.\nBus advertising takes many forms, often as interior and exterior adverts and all-over advertising liveries. The practice often extends into the exclusive private hire and use of a bus to promote a brand or product, appearing at large public events, or touring busy streets. The bus is sometimes staffed by promotions personnel, giving out free gifts. Campaign buses are often specially decorated for a political campaign or other social awareness information campaign, designed to bring a specific message to different areas, or used to transport campaign personnel to local areas/meetings. Exhibition buses are often sent to public events such as fairs and festivals for purposes such as recruitment campaigns, for example by private companies or the armed forces. Complex urban planning proposals may be organised into a mobile exhibition bus for the purposes of public consultation.\nGoods transport.\nIn some sparsely populated areas, it is common to use brucks, buses with a cargo area to transport both passengers and cargo at the same time. They are especially common in the Nordic countries.\nAround the world.\nHistorically, the types and features of buses have developed according to local needs. Buses were fitted with technology appropriate to the local climate or passenger needs, such as air conditioning in Asia, or cycle mounts on North American buses. The bus types in use around the world where there was little mass production were often sourced secondhand from other countries, such as the Malta bus, and buses in use in Africa. Other countries such as Cuba required novel solutions to import restrictions, with the creation of the \"camellos\" (camel bus), a specially manufactured trailer bus.\nAfter the Second World War, manufacturers in Europe and the Far East, such as Mercedes-Benz buses and Mitsubishi Fuso expanded into other continents influencing the use of buses previously served by local types. Use of buses around the world has also been influenced by colonial associations or political alliances between countries. Several of the Commonwealth nations followed the British lead and sourced buses from British manufacturers, leading to a prevalence of double-decker buses. Several Eastern Bloc countries adopted trolleybus systems, and their manufacturers such as Trolza exported trolleybuses to other friendly states. In the 1930s, Italy designed the world's only triple decker bus for the busy route between Rome and Tivoli that could carry eighty-eight passengers. It was unique not only in being a triple decker but having a separate smoking compartment on the third level.\nThe buses to be found in countries around the world often reflect the quality of the local road network, with high-floor resilient truck-based designs prevalent in several less developed countries where buses are subject to tough operating conditions. Population density also has a major impact, where dense urbanisation such as in Japan and the far east has led to the adoption of high capacity long multi-axle buses, often double-deckers while South America and China are implementing large numbers of articulated buses for bus rapid transit schemes.\nBus expositions.\nEuro Bus Expo is a trade show, which is held biennially at the UK's National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. As the official show of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, the UK's trade association for the bus, coach and light rail industry, the three-day event offers visitors from Europe and beyond the chance to see and experience the very latest vehicles and product and service innovations right across the industry.\nBusworld Kortrijk in Kortrijk, Belgium, is the leading bus trade fair in Europe. It is also held biennially.\nUse of retired buses.\nMost public or private buses and coaches, once they have reached the end of their service with one or more operators, are sent to the wrecking yard for breaking up for scrap and spare parts. Some buses which are not economical to keep running as service buses are often converted for use other than revenue-earning transport. Much like old cars and trucks, buses often pass through a dealership where they can be bought privately or at auction.\nBus operators often find it economical to convert retired buses to use as permanent training buses for driver training, rather than taking a regular service bus out of use. Some large operators have also converted retired buses into tow bus vehicles, to act as tow trucks. With the outsourcing of maintenance staff and facilities, the increase in company health and safety regulations, and the increasing curb weights of buses, many operators now contract their towing needs to a professional vehicle recovery company.\nSome buses that have reached the end of their service that are still in good condition are sent for export to other countries.\nSome retired buses have been converted to static or mobile caf\u00e9s, often using historic buses as a tourist attraction. There are also catering buses: buses converted into a mobile canteen and break room. These are commonly seen at external filming locations to feed the cast and crew, and at other large events to feed staff. Another use is as an emergency vehicle, such as high-capacity ambulance bus or mobile command centre.\nSome organisations adapt and operate playbuses or learning buses to provide a playground or learning environments to children who might not have access to proper play areas. An ex-London AEC Routemaster bus has been converted to a mobile theatre and catwalk fashion show.\nSome buses meet a destructive end by being entered in banger races or at demolition derbies. A larger number of old retired buses have also been converted into mobile holiday homes and campers.\nBus preservation.\nRather than being scrapped or converted for other uses, sometimes retired buses are saved for preservation. This can be done by individuals, volunteer preservation groups or charitable trusts, museums, or sometimes by the operators themselves as part of a heritage fleet. These buses often need to be restored to their original condition and will have their livery and other details such as internal notices and rollsigns restored to be authentic to a specific time in the bus's history. Some buses that undergo preservation are rescued from a state of great disrepair, but others enter preservation with very little wrong with them. As with other historic vehicles, many preserved buses either in a working or static state form part of the collections of transport museums. Additionally, some buses are preserved so they can appear alongside other period vehicles in television and film. Working buses will often be exhibited at rallies and events, and they are also used as charter buses. While many preserved buses are quite old or even vintage, in some cases relatively new examples of a bus type can enter restoration. In-service examples are still in use by other operators. This often happens when a change in design or operating practice, such as the switch to one person operation or low floor technology, renders some buses redundant while still relatively new.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4147", "revid": "50991394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4147", "title": "Bali", "text": "Province in Lesser Sunda Islands, Indonesia\nBali ( ; ; Balinese: \u1b29\u1b2e\u1b36) is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller offshore islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan to the southeast. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. The Denpasar metropolitan area is the extended metropolitan area around Denpasar. The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's cultural centre. The province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s, and has become the country's area of overtourism. Tourism-related business makes up 80% of the Bali economy.\nBali is the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with 86.40% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism. It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events that have been held in Bali include Miss World 2013, the 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group, and the 2022 G20 summit. In March 2017, Tripadvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveler's Choice award, which it earned once again in January 2021.\nBali is part of the Coral Triangle, an area with high diversity of marine species, especially fish and turtles. In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean. Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom. The royal houses, which originated before Dutch colonisation, are not recognised by the government of Indonesia.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Bali\" is attested in ancient Balinese inscriptions as part of the compound *V\u0101li-dv\u012bpa* (or *W\u0101li-dv\u012bpa*), where Sanskrit **dv\u012bpa** (Sanskrit: \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092a) means \"island\".\nOne of the earliest attestations of *V\u0101li-dv\u012bpa* occurs in the Belanjong (Blanjong) pillar inscription, dated to Saka year 835 / Phalguna month, under King Sri Kesari Warmadewa (c. 914 CE).\nThe precise meaning of the element *V\u0101li* (or *Bali*) in *V\u0101li-dv\u012bpa* is not certain. Some hypothesized interpretations include:\nHistory.\nAncient.\nBali was inhabited around 2000 BC by Austronesian peoples who migrated originally from the island of Taiwan to Southeast Asia and Oceania through Maritime Southeast Asia. Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines, and Oceania. Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.\nIn ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed: the Pasupata, Bhairawa, Siwa Shidanta, Vaishnava, Bodha, Brahma, Resi, Sora, and Ganapatya. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.\nInscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma, a contemporary of the Kesari dynasty in the Kalinga Kingdom of ancient India, is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, being influenced by the Sanskrit and Pali languages, where Buddhism and Shaivism were practiced simultaneously. Mpu Sindok's great-granddaughter, Mahendradatta (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king Udayana Warmadewa (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to Airlangga around 1001. This marriage also brought more Hinduism and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara appear in 1204.\nBalinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly Kalinga Hindu culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name \"Bali dwipa\" (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by Sri Kesari Warmadewa in 914 AD, and mentioning Walidwipa. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system, \"subak,\" to grow rice in wet-field cultivation. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\nThe Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit Empire (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern Java founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of Hayam Wuruk is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386. Mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the Majapahit Empire fell in 1520. Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms, which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906, when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.\nPortuguese contacts.\nThe first known European contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and Francisco Serr\u00e3o sighted its northern shores. It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, which throughout the 16th century, traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition. In 1585, a ship foundered off the Bukit Peninsula and left a few Portuguese in the service of Dewa Agung.\nDutch East Indies.\nIn 1597, the Dutch merchant-explorer Cornelis de Houtman arrived at Bali, and the Dutch East India Company was established in 1602. The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century. Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other. In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms on the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at Buleleng on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his Wallace Line theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and Lombok. It is a boundary between species. In his travel memoir \"The Malay Archipelago,\" Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, which includes a strong mention of the unique Balinese irrigation methods:\nI was astonished and delighted; as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of coconut palms, tamarind and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best-cultivated parts of Europe. \nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground assaults at the Sanur region in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers, who, rather than yield to the superior Dutch force, committed ritual suicide (\"puputan\") to avoid the humiliation of surrender. Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender. In the Dutch intervention in Bali, a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in Klungkung. Afterward, the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia, such as Java and Maluku.\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, artists Miguel Covarrubias and Walter Spies, and musicologist Colin McPhee all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a Western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of aesthetes at peace with themselves and nature\". Soon after, Western tourists began to visit the island. The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the West by a quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary, \"Virgins of Bali\", about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls, who the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene \"bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies.\" Under the looser version of the Hays code that existed up to 1934, nudity involving \"civilised\" (i.e., white) women was banned, but permitted with \"uncivilised\" (i.e., all non-white women), a loophole that was exploited by the producers of \"Virgins of Bali\". The film, which mostly consisted of scenes of topless Balinese women, was a great success in 1932, and was perhaps the main catalyst for the popularity of Bali among tourists. The Dutch also dedicated significant efforts to implement \"Baliseering\" (lit.\u2009'Balinization') politics to maintain traditions on the island, as well as preventing the Islamization of the Islamic sultanates from Java and banning Christian missionaries' activities.\nImperial Japan occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign; however, as the airfields on Borneo were inoperative due to heavy rains, the Imperial Japanese Army decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps \"Prajoda\" (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942, the Japanese forces landed near the town of Sanoer (Sanur) and the island was quickly captured.\nDuring the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, I Gusti Ngurah Rai, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The harsh treatment of the Balinese by the Japanese occupation forces fomented more resentment than the former Dutch colonial rulers.\nIndependence from the Dutch.\nIn 1945, Bali was liberated by the British 5th Infantry Division under the command of Major-General Robert Mansergh, who took the Japanese surrender. Once Japanese forces had been repatriated, the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed State of East Indonesia, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by Sukarno and Hatta. Bali was included in the \"Republic of the United States of Indonesia\" when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949. The first governor of Bali, Anak Agung Bagus Suteja, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.\nContemporary.\nThe 1963 eruption of Mount Agung killed thousands, created economic havoc, and forced many displaced Balinese to be transmigrated to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional caste system and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programmes. A purported coup attempt in Jakarta was averted by forces led by General Suharto.\nThe army became the dominant power as it instigated a violent anti-communist purge backed by Western powers, in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population. With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.\nAs a result of the 1965\u201366 massacres, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno out of the presidency. His \"New Order\" government re-established relations with Western countries. The pre-war Bali, as \"paradise,\" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country.\nA bombing in 2002 by militant Islamists in the tourist area of Kuta killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and another in 2005, severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship on the island.\nOn 9 July 2008, for the first time in Bali's history, the election for governor and vice governor of Bali was democratically elected by the people of Bali directly.\nOn 27 November 2017, Mount Agung erupted five times, causing the evacuation of thousands, disrupting air travel, and causing much environmental damage. Further eruptions also occurred between 2018 and 2019.\nOn 15\u201316 November 2022, with the 2022 G20 Bali summit, the seventeenth meeting of the Group of Twenty (G20) was held in Nusa Dua.\nGeography.\nThe island of Bali lies east of Java, and is approximately 8 degrees south of the equator. Bali and Java are separated by the Bali Strait. East to west, the island is approximately wide and spans approximately north to south; administratively it covers , or excluding offshore Nusa Penida District, which comprises three small islands off the southeast coast of Bali. Its population density was roughly in mid 2024.\nBali's central mountains include several peaks over in elevation and active volcanoes such as Mount Batur. The highest is Mount Agung (), known as the \"mother mountain\", which is an active volcano rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years. In late 2017, Mount Agung started erupting and large numbers of people were evacuated, temporarily closing the island's airport. Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility, and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agricultural sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables, and cattle. The longest river, Ayung River, flows approximately (see List of rivers of Bali).\nThe island is surrounded by coral reefs. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand, while those in the north and west have black sand. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small \"sampan\" boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of Tanah Lot, they are not yet used for significant tourism.\nThe largest city is the provincial capital, Denpasar, near the southern coast. Its population is around 755,600 (in mid 2024). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, Singaraja, which is located on the north coast and whose urban area is home to around 150,000 people in 2024. Other important cities include the beach resort, Kuta, which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and Ubud, situated at the north of Denpasar, which is regarded as the island's cultural centre.\nThree small islands lie to the immediate south-east and all are administratively part of the Klungkung regency of Bali: Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan. These islands are separated from Bali by the Badung Strait.\nTo the east, the Lombok Strait separates Bali from Lombok and marks the biogeographical division between the fauna of the Indomalayan realm and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The transition is known as the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major biomes. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, Bali was connected to Java and Sumatra and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated.\nClimate.\nBeing just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around with a humidity level of about 85%.\nDaytime temperatures at low elevations vary between , but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.\nThe west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. During the rainy season, there are comparatively fewer tourists seen in Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays, the weather is very unpredictable. Outside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.\nFlora and fauna.\nBali lies just to the west of the Wallace Line, and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok. An exception is the yellow-crested cockatoo, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered Bali myna, which is endemic. Others include barn swallow, black-naped oriole, black racket-tailed treepie, crested serpent-eagle, crested treeswift, dollarbird, Java sparrow, lesser adjutant, long-tailed shrike, milky stork, Pacific swallow, red-rumped swallow, sacred kingfisher, sea eagle, woodswallow, savanna nightjar, stork-billed kingfisher, yellow-vented bulbul and great egret.\nUntil the early 20th century, Bali was possibly home to several large mammals: banteng, leopard and the endemic Bali tiger. The banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a tiger on Bali dates from 1937 when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s. Pleistocene and Holocene megafaunas include banteng and giant tapir (based on speculations that they might have reached up to the Wallace Line), and rhinoceros.\nSquirrels are quite commonly encountered, less often is the Asian palm civet, which is also kept in coffee farms to produce kopi luwak. Bats are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of monkey occur. The crab-eating macaque, known locally as \"kera\", is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three \"monkey forest\" temples, such as the popular one in the Ubud area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the Javan langur, locally known as \"lutung\". They occur in a few places apart from the West Bali National Park. They are born an orange colour, though they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration by their first year. In Java, however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen together as a family. Other rarer mammals include the Sunda leopard cat, Sunda pangolin and black giant squirrel. Snakes include the king cobra and reticulated python. The water monitor can grow to at least in length and and can move quickly.\nThe rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as Tulamben, Amed, Menjangan or neighbouring Nusa Penida, host a wide range of marine life, for instance hawksbill turtle, giant sunfish, giant manta ray, giant moray eel, bumphead parrotfish, hammerhead shark, reef shark, barracuda, and sea snakes. Dolphins are commonly encountered on the north coast near Singaraja and Lovina.\nA team of scientists surveyed from 29 April 2011, to 11 May 2011, at 33 sea sites around Bali. They discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at Pemuteran, Gilimanuk, Nusa Dua, Tulamben and Candidasa, and 393 coral species, including two new ones at Padangbai and between Padangbai and Amed. The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in Raja Ampat and Halmahera by 29% or in Fakfak and Kaimana by 25%) with the highest coverage found in Gili Selang and Gili Mimpang in Candidasa, Karangasem Regency. Among the larger trees the most common are: banyan trees, jackfruit, coconuts, bamboo species, acacia trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species. Numerous flowers can be seen: hibiscus, frangipani, bougainvillea, poinsettia, oleander, jasmine, water lily, lotus, roses, begonias, orchids and hydrangeas exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance, around Kintamani, certain species of fern trees, mushrooms and even pine trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: salak, mangosteen, corn, Kintamani orange, coffee and water spinach.\nEnvironment.\nOver-exploitation by the tourist industry has led to 200 out of 400 rivers on the island drying up. Research suggests that the southern part of Bali would face a water shortage. To ease the shortage, the central government plans to build a water catchment and processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 litres capacity of water per second will be channelled to Denpasar, Badung and Gianyar in 2013.\nA 2010 Environment Ministry report on its environmental quality index gave Bali a score of 99.65, which was the highest score of Indonesia's 33 provinces. The score considers the level of total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, and chemical oxygen demand in water.\nErosion at Lebih Beach has seen of land lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to Masceti Beach.\nIn 2017, a year when Bali received nearly 5.7\u00a0million tourists, government officials declared a \"garbage emergency\" in response to the covering of 3.6-mile stretch of coastline in plastic waste brought in by the tide, amid concerns that the pollution could dissuade visitors from returning. Indonesia is one of the world's worst plastic polluters, with some estimates suggesting the country is the source of around 10 per cent of the world's plastic waste.\nGovernment and politics.\nThe governor is the highest officeholder in the Bali provincial government with the vice governor being the second highest officeholder. The Governor of Bali is responsible for the territory of the Province of Bali. The current governor in office in the province of Bali is I Wayan Koster who was first being elected in the 2018 Bali gubernatorial election accompanied by his first running mate at that time Tjokorda Oka Artha Ardana Sukawati (Cok Ace). Koster is the 8th governor of Bali, since the province was formed into the province of Bali in 1958 based on Law Number 64 of 1958. Koster and Cok Ace were inaugurated by the president of the Republic of Indonesia at that time Joko Widodo, at the State Palace, Jakarta on September 5, 2018, for the five years term of office (2018\u20132023). After his term of office ended, was inaugurated as acting governor of Bali on September 5, 2023 with a limited authority in the government. After re-elected in 2024 I Wayan Koster and I Nyoman Giri Prasta was inaugurated on February 20, 2025 at the State Palace by the incumbent President of Indonesia Prabowo Subianto for the five years term of office (2025\u20132030).In the national legislature, Bali is represented by nine members, with a single electoral district covering the whole province. The Bali Regional House of Representatives (DPRD), the provincial legislature, has 55 members. The province's politics has historically been dominated by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which has won by far the most votes in every election in Bali since the first free elections in 1999, it currently forms the ruling government in the province.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe province is divided into eight regencies (\"kabupaten\") and one city (\"kota\") together divided into 57 districts (\"kecamatan\"), in turn sub-divided into 80 urban villages (\"kelurahan\") and 636 rural villages (\"desa\"); all the regencies were originally inaugurated on 9 August 1958, while the city of Denpasar were created from part of Badung Regency on 15 January 1992. They are tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census and the 2020 census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2024 and the Human Development Index for each regency and city.\nThe province forms one of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the Indonesian parliament. The Bali Electoral District consists of all of the 8 regencies in the province, together with the city of Denpasar, and elects 9 members to the People's Representative Council.\nEconomy.\nIn the 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment. Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related. By the end of June 2011, the rate of non-performing loans of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan rates (about 5%). The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the terrorist bombings in 2002 and 2005. The tourism industry has since recovered from these events.\nAgriculture.\nAlthough tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer. Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its artisans who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including batik and ikat cloth and clothing, wooden carvings, stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.\nThe Arabica coffee production region is the highland region of Kintamani near Mount Batur. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes. Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called Subak Abian, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of \"Tri Hita Karana\". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with God, other people, and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of fair trade and organic coffee production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a geographical indication.\nTourism.\nIn 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in Sanur was built by Sukarno and boosted tourism in Bali. Before the Bali Beach Hotel construction, there were only three significant tourist-class hotels on the island. Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased in Bali after the Ngurah Rai International Airport opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\nThe tourism industry is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The prominent tourist locations are the town of Kuta (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of Legian and Seminyak (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of Sanur (once the only tourist hub), Ubud towards the centre of the island, to the south of the Ngurah Rai International Airport, Jimbaran and the newer developments of Nusa Dua and Pecatu.\nThe United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012, because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning. Australia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015, due to new terrorist threats.\nAn offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak, and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the island's south side. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, and investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors with improved value for their currencies.\nBali's tourism economy survived the terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the long-term trend has been a steady increase in visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57\u00a0million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3\u00a0million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels, although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.\nBali received the Best Island award from Travel and Leisure in 2010. Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. The Balinese culture and its religion are also considered the main factor of the award. One of the most prestigious events that symbolize a strong relationship between a god and its followers is Kecak dance. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after Santorini, Greece.\nIn 2006, Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir \"Eat, Pray, Love\" was published, and in August 2010 it was adapted into the film \"Eat Pray Love\". It took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach in Bali. Both the book and the film fuelled a boom in tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist centre that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance and love through traditional spirituality and healing.\nIn January 2016, after musician David Bowie died, it was revealed that in his will, Bowie asked for his ashes to be scattered in Bali, conforming to Buddhist rituals. He had visited and performed in several Southeast Asian cities early in his career, including Bangkok and Singapore.\nSince 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list while India has also emerged as a greater supply of tourists.\nChinese tourists increased by 17% in 2011 from 2010 due to the impact of ACFTA and new direct flights to Bali.\nIn January 2012, Chinese tourists increased by 222.18% compared to January 2011, while Japanese tourists declined by 23.54% year on year. Bali is a very popular tourist destination for Indians.\nBali authorities reported the island had 2.88\u00a0million foreign tourists and 5\u00a0million domestic tourists in 2012, marginally surpassing the expectations of 2.8\u00a0million foreign tourists.\nBased on a Bank Indonesia survey in May 2013, 34.39 per cent of tourists are upper-middle class, spending between $1,286 and $5,592, and are dominated by Australia, India, France, China, Germany and the UK. Some Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 per cent of tourists are middle class, spending between $662 and $1,285. In 2017 it was expected that Chinese tourists would outnumber Australian tourists.\nIn January 2020, 10,000 Chinese tourists cancelled trips to Bali due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic travel restrictions, Bali welcomed 1.07\u00a0million international travelers in 2020, most of them between January and March, which is \u221287% compared to 2019. In the first half of 2021, they welcomed 43 international travelers. The pandemic presented a major blow on Bali's tourism-dependent economy. On 3 February 2022, Bali reopened again for the first foreign tourists after 2 years of being closed due to the pandemic.\nIn 2022 Indonesia's Minister of Health, Budi Sadikin, stated that the tourism industry in Bali will be complemented by the medical industry.\nAt the beginning of 2023, the governor of Bali demanded a ban on the use of motorcycles by tourists. This happened after a series of accidents. Wayan Koster proposed to cancel the violators' visas. The move sparked widespread outrage on social media.\nTransportation.\nThe Ngurah Rai International Airport is located near Jimbaran, on the isthmus at the southernmost part of the island. Lt. Col. Wisnu Airfield is in northwest Bali.\nA coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching 1,750\u00a0m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines. There is a car ferry between Gilimanuk on the west coast of Bali to Ketapang on Java.\nIn December 2010 the Government of Indonesia invited investors to build a new Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal at Karangasem, Bali with a projected worth of $30\u00a0million. On 17 July 2011, the first cruise ship (Sun Princess) anchored about away from the wharf of Tanah Ampo harbour. The current pier is only but will eventually be extended to to accommodate international cruise ships. The harbour is safer than the existing facility at Benoa and has a scenic backdrop of east Bali mountains and green rice fields. The tender for improvement was subject to delays, and as of July 2013 the situation was unclear with cruise line operators complaining and even refusing to use the existing facility at Tanah Ampo.\nA memorandum of understanding was signed by two ministers, Bali's governor and Indonesian Train Company to build of railway along the coast around the island. As of July 2015, no details of these proposed railways have been released. In 2019 it was reported in \"Gapura Bali\" that Wayan Koster, governor of Bali, \"is keen to improve Bali's transportation infrastructure and is considering plans to build an electric rail network across the island\".\nOn 16 March 2011 (Tanjung) Benoa port received the \"Best Port Welcome 2010\" award from London's \"Dream World Cruise Destination\" magazine. Government plans to expand the role of Benoa port as export-import port to boost Bali's trade and industry sector. In 2013, The Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry advised that 306 cruise liners were scheduled to visit Indonesia, an increase of 43 per cent compared to the previous year.\nIn May 2011, an integrated Area Traffic Control System (ATCS) was implemented to reduce traffic jams at four crossing points: Ngurah Rai statue, Dewa Ruci Kuta crossing, Jimbaran crossing and Sanur crossing. ATCS is an integrated system connecting all traffic lights, CCTVs and other traffic signals with a monitoring office at the police headquarters. It has successfully been implemented in other ASEAN countries and will be implemented at other crossings in Bali.\nOn 21 December 2011, construction started on the Nusa Dua-Benoa-Ngurah Rai International Airport toll road, which will also provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of the shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the toll road (totally with access road). The construction is estimated to cost Rp.2.49\u00a0trillion ($273.9\u00a0million). The project goes through of mangrove forest and through of beach, both within area. The elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars that occupied two hectares of mangrove forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road. On 21 December 2011, the Dewa Ruci underpass has also started on the busy Dewa Ruci junction near Bali Kuta Galeria with an estimated cost of Rp136\u00a0billion ($14.9\u00a0million) from the state budget. On 23 September 2013, the Bali Mandara Toll Road was opened, with the Dewa Ruci Junction underpass being opened previously.\nTo solve chronic traffic problems, the province will also build a toll road connecting Serangan with Tohpati, a toll road connecting Kuta, Denpasar, and Tohpati, and a flyover connecting Kuta and Ngurah Rai Airport.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;The population of Bali was 3,890,757 as of the 2010 census, and 4,317,404 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2024 was 4,461,260 (comprising 2,222,440 males and 2,210,820 females). In 2021, the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism estimated that there were 109,801 foreigners living on Bali, with most originating from Russia, United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, India, and the Netherlands.\nEthnic groups.\nEthnic origins.\nA DNA study in 2005 by Karafet et al., found that 11% of Balinese Y-chromosomes are of likely Austroasiatic origin, while 84% are of likely Austronesian 1% of likely Indian origin and 2% of likely Melanesian origin. According to a recent genetic study, the Balinese, together with the Javanese and Sundanese, have a significant admixture of Austroasiatic and Austronesian ancestries.\nEthnicity.\nThe majority of the population inhabiting the province of Bali are the local ethnic, namely the Balinese and indigenous Bali Aga people. The Balinese have a cultural richness that is known worldwide, so that Bali is the main destination for foreign tourists to Indonesia. In addition to the rich beaches, the culture that is of interest in Bali is its dances, such as the Kecak dance, festivals such as Ogoh-ogoh, and others. The largest ethnic group outside the Balinese people is the Javanese people.\nBased on data from the 2010 Indonesian population census, the following is the composition of ethnic groups in the province of Bali:\nCaste system.\nPre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a \"very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence\". The four castes have been classified as Sudra (Shudra), Wesia (Vaishyas), Satria (Kshatriyas) and Brahmana (Brahmin).\nThe 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that the Balinese caste system had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the \"received understandings concerning its Indian origins\". In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelt \"Soedra\") has typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be from the other three castes. In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite \"meweda\" (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAbout 86.40% of Bali's population adheres to Balinese Hinduism, formed as a combination of existing local beliefs and Hindu influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions include Islam (10.16%), Christianity (2.55%) (1.76%: Protestantism; 0.86%: Catholicism), and Buddhism (0.68%) as for 2022.\nThe Balinese people and Bali Aga are generally Hindu with some being Christian and Muslim. While the people of Javanese, Sundanese, Sasak, Malays, are generally Islam and some are also Hindu or Christian. Meanwhile, adherents of Christianity generally come from the population of East Nusa Tenggara, then Papua, the Batak, Chinese and other non-Muslim ethnic in Indonesia, they are generally Christian with small minority are Hindu and Islam. And there is also a village, namely the village of Blimbing Sari in the Melaya district of Jembrana Regency, not far from Gilimanuk Port, a Christian village where the residents are native Balinese, even the church is shaped like a temple.\nThe general beliefs and practices of \"Agama Hindu Dharma\" mix ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of \"Pancasila\". Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray. However, officially, the Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a monotheistic religion with certain officially recognised beliefs that comply with its national ideology. Indonesian school textbooks describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam. Some scholars contest whether these Indonesian government recognised and assigned beliefs to reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.\nBalinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, which arrived through Java. Hindu influences reached the Indonesian Archipelago as early as the first century. Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to 78 AD. Stories from the Mahabharata Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; however, the versions mirror those found in the southeast Indian peninsular region (now Tamil Nadu and southern Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh).\nThe Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.\nApart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist Chinese immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, and Confucianism, and find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's \"odalan\". Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese. Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards. The Roman Catholic community has a diocese, the Diocese of Denpasar that encompasses the province of Bali and West Nusa Tenggara and has its cathedral located in Denpasar.\nLanguages.\nBalinese and Indonesian are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of Balinese people are bilingual or trilingual. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from Java, Lombok, Sumatra, and other parts of Indonesia. The Balinese language is heavily stratified due to the Balinese caste system. Kawi and Sanskrit are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.English and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the tourism industry, as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as Japanese, Korean, French, Russian or German, are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\nCulture.\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. Balinese cuisine is also distinctive, and unlike the rest of Indonesia, pork is commonly found in Balinese dishes such as Babi Guling. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as \"gamelan\", is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the Ramayana but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous Balinese dances include \"pendet\", \"legong\", \"baris\", \"topeng\", \"barong\", \"gong kebyar\", and \"kecak\" (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, and public shows.\nIn 2018 Governor I Wayan Koster issued Bali Governor's Regulation No. 79 of 2018 which mandated that city officials wear traditional Balinese dress, such as that made of \"songket\". This was followed by Circular No. 4 of 2021 which specified the use of Endek fabrics, and was expanded to high-ranking individuals in the private sector and other institutions.\nArchitecture.\n\"Kaja\" and \"kelod\" are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to one's orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (\"kaja\"), and the sea (\"kelod\"). In addition to spatial orientation, \"kaja\" and \"kelod\" have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest \"kaja\". These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance, and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as \"wali\", the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where \"bebali\" ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the temple's walls and are called \"bali-balihan\". This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.\nDances.\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of tourism is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the \"barong\" dance have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances that have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a \"barong\" mask specifically for non-ritual performances and an older mask that is only used for sacred performances.\nFestivals.\nThroughout the year, there are many festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars. The Hindu New Year, \"Nyepi\", is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of \"Ogoh-ogoh\" monsters are paraded and burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese \"pawukon\" calendrical system.\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), cremation or \"odalan\" (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of \"d\u00e9sa kala patra\", which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context. Many ceremonial art forms such as \"wayang kulit\" and \"topeng\" are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation. Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with much activity, and the resulting aesthetic, \"ram\u00e9\", is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more \"gamelan\" ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of \"ram\u00e9\".\nTradition.\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied. Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as customary law sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"kasepekang\", or shunning) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents Bali Arts Festival to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have. It is held once a year, from the second week of June until the end of July. Southeast Asia's biggest annual festival of words and ideas Ubud Writers and Readers Festival is held at Ubud in October, which is participated by the world's most celebrated writers, artists, thinkers, and performers.\nOne unusual tradition is the naming of children in Bali. In general, Balinese people name their children depending on the order they are born, and the names are the same for both males and females.\nBeauty pageant.\nBali was the host of Miss World 2013 (63rd edition of the Miss World pageant). It was the first time Indonesia hosted an international beauty pageant. In 2022, Bali also co-hosted Miss Grand International 2022 along with Jakarta, West Java, and Banten.\nInternational conferences and summits.\nBali has hosted milestone regional and sectoral gatherings, including ASEAN's foundational summits and declarations, namely the 1976 Declaration of ASEAN Concord and Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, the Bali Concord II (2003), and the Bali Concord III (2011) alongside the East Asia Summit's \"Bali Principles\". It also hosted the 2007 UNFCCC COP13 that produced the Bali Road Map, as well as the APEC Leaders' Week and the WTO Ninth Ministerial that adopted the Bali Package on trade facilitation.\nRecurring platforms such as the Bali Process on people smuggling and the Bali Democracy Forum have further anchored Bali's role in regional governance architectures. Sectoral leadership is also evident: the UN's Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction convened in Bali in 2022. Bali has also hosted the Multilateral Naval Exercise Komodo; according to Reuters, the exercise has included participation by the People's Liberation Army Navy and taken place amid South China Sea tensions linked to overlapping claims, including China's \"nine-dash line\", which an arbitral tribunal constituted under UNCLOS found had no legal basis in 2016, while official reports note that the 2025 iteration in Bali involved 38 countries and 19 foreign warships at Tanjung Benoa.\nSports.\nBali is a major world surfing destination with popular breaks dotted across the southern coastline and around the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan.\nAs part of the Coral Triangle, Bali, including Nusa Penida, offers a wide range of dive sites with varying types of reefs, and tropical aquatic life.\nBali was the host of 2008 Asian Beach Games. It was the second time Indonesia hosted an Asia-level multi-sport event, after Jakarta held the 1962 Asian Games.\nIn 2023, Bali was the location for a major eSports event, the Dota 2 Bali Major, the third and final Major of the Dota Pro Circuit season. The event was held at the Ayana Estate and the Champa Garden, and it was the first time that a Dota Pro Circuit Major was held in Indonesia.\nIn football, Bali is home to Bali United football club, which plays in Liga 1.\nThe team was relocated from Samarinda, East Kalimantan to Gianyar, Bali. Harbiansyah Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he changed the name and moved the home base because there was no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia. Another reason was due to local fans in Samarinda preferring to support Pusamania Borneo F.C. rather than Persisam.\nHeritage sites.\nIn June 2012, Subak, the irrigation system for paddy fields in Jatiluwih, central Bali was listed as a Natural UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4149", "revid": "45916690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4149", "title": "Bulgarian language", "text": "South Slavic language\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nBulgarian is an Eastern South Slavic language spoken in Southeast Europe, primarily in Bulgaria. It is the language of the Bulgarians.\nAlong with the closely related Macedonian language (collectively forming the East South Slavic languages), it is a member of the Balkan sprachbund and South Slavic dialect continuum of the Indo-European language family. The two languages have several characteristics that set them apart from all other Slavic languages, including the elimination of case declension, the development of a suffixed definite article, and the lack of a verb infinitive. They retain and have further developed the Proto-Slavic verb system (albeit analytically). One such major development is the innovation of evidential verb forms to encode for the source of information: witnessed, inferred, or reported.\nIt is the official language of Bulgaria, and since 2007 has been among the official languages of the European Union. It is also spoken by the Bulgarian historical communities in Ukraine, North Macedonia, Moldova, Serbia, Romania, Hungary, Albania and Greece.\nHistory.\nOne can divide the development of the Bulgarian language into several periods.\n\"Bulgarian\" was the first Slavic language attested in writing. As Slavic linguistic unity lasted into late antiquity, the oldest manuscripts initially referred to this language as \u0467\u0437\ua651\u043a\u044a \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a, \"the Slavic language\". In the Middle Bulgarian period this name was gradually replaced by the name \u0467\u0437\ua651\u043a\u044a \u0431\u043b\u044a\u0433\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a, the \"Bulgarian language\". In some cases, this name was used not only with regard to the contemporary Middle Bulgarian language of the copyist but also to the period of Old Bulgarian. A most notable example of anachronism is the Service of Saint Cyril from Skopje (\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0439), a 13th-century Middle Bulgarian manuscript from northern Macedonia according to which St. Cyril preached with \"Bulgarian\" books among the Moravian Slavs. The first mention of the language as the \"Bulgarian language\" instead of the \"Slavonic language\" comes in the work of the Greek clergy of the Archbishopric of Ohrid in the 11th century, for example in the Greek hagiography of Clement of Ohrid by Theophylact of Ohrid (late 11th century).\nDuring the Middle Bulgarian period, the language underwent dramatic changes, losing the Slavonic case system, but preserving the rich verb system (while the development was exactly the opposite in other Slavic languages) and developing a definite article. It was influenced by its non-Slavic neighbors in the Balkan language area (mostly grammatically) and later also by Turkish, which was the official language of the Ottoman Empire, in the form of the Ottoman Turkish language, mostly lexically. The damaskin texts mark the transition from Middle Bulgarian to New Bulgarian, which was standardized in the 19th century.\nAs a national revival occurred toward the end of the period of Ottoman rule (mostly during the 19th century), a modern Bulgarian literary language gradually emerged that drew heavily on Church Slavonic/Old Bulgarian (and to some extent on literary Russian, which had preserved many lexical items from Church Slavonic) and later reduced the number of Turkish and other Balkan loans. Today one difference between Bulgarian dialects in the country and literary spoken Bulgarian is the significant presence of Old Bulgarian words and even word forms in the latter. Russian loans are distinguished from Old Bulgarian ones on the basis of the presence of specifically Russian phonetic changes, as in \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442 (turnover, rev), \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043d (incomprehensible), \u044f\u0434\u0440\u043e (nucleus) and others. Many other loans from French, English and the classical languages have subsequently entered the language as well.\nModern Bulgarian was based essentially on the Eastern dialects of the language, but its pronunciation is in many respects a compromise between East and West Bulgarian (see especially the phonetic sections below). Following the efforts of some figures of the National awakening of Bulgaria (most notably Neofit Rilski and Ivan Bogorov), there had been many attempts to codify a standard Bulgarian language; however, there was much argument surrounding the choice of norms. Between 1835 and 1878 more than 25 proposals were put forward and \"linguistic chaos\" ensued. Eventually the eastern dialects prevailed,\nand in 1899 the Bulgarian Ministry of Education officially codified a standard Bulgarian language based on the Drinov-Ivanchev orthography.\nGeographic distribution.\nBulgarian is the official language of Bulgaria, where it is used in all spheres of public life. As of 2011, it is spoken as a first language by about 6million people in the country, or about four out of every five Bulgarian citizens.\nThere is also a significant Bulgarian diaspora abroad. One of the main historically established communities are the Bessarabian Bulgarians, whose settlement in the Bessarabia region of nowadays Moldova and Ukraine dates mostly to the early 19th century. There were Bulgarian speakers in Ukraine at the 2001 census, in Moldova as of the 2014 census (of which were habitual users of the language), and presumably a significant proportion of the 13,200 ethnic Bulgarians residing in neighbouring Transnistria in 2016.\nAnother community abroad are the Banat Bulgarians, who migrated in the 17th century to the Banat region now split between Romania, Serbia and Hungary. They speak the Banat Bulgarian dialect, which has had its own written standard and a historically important literary tradition.\nThere are Bulgarian speakers in neighbouring countries as well. The regional dialects of Bulgarian and Macedonian form a dialect continuum, and there is no well-defined boundary where one language ends and the other begins. Within the limits of the Republic of North Macedonia a strong separate Macedonian identity has emerged since the Second World War, even though there still are a small number of citizens who identify their language as Bulgarian. Beyond the borders of North Macedonia, the situation is more fluid, and the pockets of speakers of the related regional dialects in Albania and in Greece variously identify their language as Macedonian or as Bulgarian. In Serbia, there were 7,939 speakers as per 2022 census, mainly concentrated in the so-called Western Outlands along the border with Bulgaria. Bulgarian is also spoken in Turkey: natively by Pomaks, and as a second language by many Bulgarian Turks who emigrated from Bulgaria, mostly during the \"Big Excursion\" of 1989.\nThe language is also represented among the diaspora in Western Europe and North America, which has been steadily growing since the 1990s. Countries with significant numbers of speakers include Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom ( speakers in England and Wales as of 2011), France, the United States, and Canada ( in 2011).\nDialects.\nThe language is mainly split into two broad dialect areas, based on the different reflexes of the Proto-Slavic yat vowel (\u0462). This split, which occurred at some point during the Middle Ages, led to the development of Bulgaria's:\nThe literary language norm, which is generally based on the Eastern dialects, also has the Eastern alternating reflex of \"yat\". However, it has not incorporated the general Eastern umlaut of \"all\" synchronic or even historic \"ya\" sounds into \"e\" before front vowels \u2013 e.g. \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043d\u0430 (\"polyana\") vs. \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 (\"poleni\") \"meadow \u2013 meadows\" or even \u0436\u0430\u0431\u0430 (\"zhaba\") vs. \u0436\u0435\u0431\u0438 (\"zhebi\") \"frog \u2013 frogs\", even though it co-occurs with the yat alternation in almost all Eastern dialects that have it (except a few dialects along the yat border, e.g. in the Pleven region).\nMore examples of the \"yat\" umlaut in the literary language are:\nUntil 1945, Bulgarian orthography did not reveal this alternation and used the original Old Slavic Cyrillic letter \"yat\" (\u0462), which was commonly called \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e \u0435 (\"dvoyno e\") at the time, to express the historical \"yat\" vowel or at least root vowels displaying the \"ya \u2013 e\" alternation. The letter was used in each occurrence of such a root, regardless of the actual pronunciation of the vowel: thus, both \"mlyako\" and \"mlekar\" were spelled with (\u0462). Among other things, this was seen as a way to \"reconcile\" the Western and the Eastern dialects and maintain language unity at a time when much of Bulgaria's Western dialect area was controlled by Serbia and Greece, but there were still hopes and occasional attempts to recover it. With the 1945 orthographic reform, this letter was abolished and the present spelling was introduced, reflecting the alternation in pronunciation.\nThis had implications for some grammatical constructions:\nSometimes, with the changes, words began to be spelled as other words with different meanings, e.g.:\nIn spite of the literary norm regarding the yat vowel, many people living in Western Bulgaria, including the capital Sofia, will fail to observe its rules. While the norm requires the realizations \"vidyal\" vs. \"videli\" (he has seen; they have seen), some natives of Western Bulgaria will preserve their local dialect pronunciation with \"e\" for all instances of \"yat\" (e.g. \"videl\", \"videli\"). Others, attempting to adhere to the norm, will actually use the \"ya\" sound even in cases where the standard language has \"e\" (e.g. \"vidyal\", \"vidyali\"). The latter hypercorrection is called \u0441\u0432\u0440\u044a\u0445\u044f\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435 (\"svrah-yakane\" \u2248\"over-\"ya\"-ing\").\nShift from to.\nBulgarian is the only Slavic language whose literary standard does not naturally contain the iotated \"e\" (or its variant, \"e\" after a palatalized consonant , except in non-Slavic foreign-loaned words). This sound combination is common in all modern Slavic languages (e.g. Czech \"medv\u011bd\" \"bear\", Polish \"pi\u0119\u0107\" \"five\", Serbo-Croatian jelen\" \"deer\", Ukrainian \"\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0454 \"there is not\", Macedonian \"\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435 \"writing\", etc.), as well as some Western Bulgarian dialectal forms \u2013 e.g. \"\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0300\u043d'\u0435 (standard Bulgarian: \"\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\" , \"ploughing\"), however it is not represented in standard Bulgarian speech or writing. Even where occurs in other Slavic words, in Standard Bulgarian it is usually transcribed and pronounced as pure \u2013 e.g. Boris Yeltsin is \"Eltsin\" (), Yekaterinburg is \"Ekaterinburg\" () and Sarajevo is \"Saraevo\" (), although \u2013 because of the stress and the beginning of the word \u2013 Jelena Jankovi\u0107 is \"Yelena Yankovich\" ().\nRelationship to Macedonian.\nUntil the period immediately following the Second World War, all Bulgarian and the majority of foreign linguists referred to the South Slavic dialect continuum spanning the area of modern Bulgaria, North Macedonia and parts of Northern Greece as a group of Bulgarian dialects. In contrast, Serbian sources tended to label them \"south Serbian\" dialects. Some local naming conventions included \"bolg\u00e1rski\", \"bug\u00e1rski\" and so forth. The codifiers of the standard Bulgarian language, however, did not wish to make any allowances for a pluricentric \"Bulgaro-Macedonian\" compromise. In 1870 Marin Drinov, who played a decisive role in the standardization of the Bulgarian language, rejected the proposal of Parteniy Zografski and Kuzman Shapkarev for a mixed eastern and western Bulgarian/Macedonian foundation of the standard Bulgarian language, stating in his article in the newspaper \"Makedoniya\": \"Such an artificial assembly of written language is something impossible, unattainable and never heard of.\"\nAfter 1944 the People's Republic of Bulgaria and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began a policy of making Macedonia into the connecting link for the establishment of a new Balkan Federative Republic and stimulating here a development of distinct Macedonian consciousness. With the proclamation of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia as part of the Yugoslav federation, the new authorities also started measures that would overcome the pro-Bulgarian feeling among parts of its population and in 1945 a separate Macedonian language was codified. After 1958, when the pressure from Moscow decreased, Sofia reverted to the view that the Macedonian language did not exist as a separate language. Nowadays, Bulgarian and Greek linguists, as well as some linguists from other countries, still consider the various Macedonian dialects as part of the broader Bulgarian pluricentric dialectal continuum. Outside Bulgaria and Greece, Macedonian is generally considered an autonomous language within the South Slavic dialect continuum. Sociolinguists agree that the question whether Macedonian is a dialect of Bulgarian or a language is a political one and cannot be resolved on a purely linguistic basis, because dialect continua do not allow for either/or judgements.\nPhonology.\nBulgarian possesses a phonology similar to that of the rest of the South Slavic languages, notably lacking Serbo-Croatian's phonemic vowel length and tones and alveolo-palatal affricates. There is a general dichotomy between Eastern and Western dialects, with Eastern ones featuring consonant palatalization before front vowels ( and ) and substantial vowel reduction of the low vowels , and in unstressed position, sometimes leading to neutralisation between and , and , and and . Both patterns have partial parallels in Russian, leading to partially similar sounds. In turn, the Western dialects generally do not have any allophonic palatalization and exhibit minor, if any, vowel reduction.\nStandard Bulgarian keeps a middle ground between the macrodialects. It allows palatalizaton only before central and back vowels and only partial reduction of and . Reduction of , consonant palatalisation before front vowels and depalatalization of palatalized consonants before central and back vowels is strongly discouraged and labelled as provincial.\nBulgarian has six vowel phonemes, but at least eight distinct phones can be distinguished when reduced allophones are taken into consideration. There is currently no consensus on the number of Bulgarian consonants, with one school of thought advocating for the existence of only 22 consonant phonemes and another one claiming that there are not fewer than 39 consonant phonemes. The main bone of contention is how to treat palatalized consonants: as separate phonemes or as allophones of their respective plain counterparts.\nThe 22-consonant model is based on a general consensus reached by all major Bulgarian linguists in the 1930s and 1940s. In turn, the 39-consonant model was launched in the beginning of the 1950s under the influence of the ideas of Russian linguist Nikolai Trubetzkoy.\nDespite frequent objections, the support of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences has ensured Trubetzkoy's model virtual monopoly in state-issued phonologies and grammars since the 1960s. However, its reception abroad has been lukewarm, with a number of authors either calling the model into question or outright rejecting it. Thus, the Handbook of the International Phonetic Association only lists 22 consonants in Bulgarian's consonant inventory.\nAlphabet.\nIn 886 AD, the Bulgarian Empire introduced the Glagolitic alphabet which was devised by the Saints Cyril and Methodius in the 850s. The Glagolitic alphabet was gradually superseded in later centuries by the Cyrillic script, developed around the Preslav Literary School, Bulgaria in the late 9th century.\nSeveral Cyrillic alphabets with 28 to 44 letters were used in the beginning and the middle of the 19th century during the efforts on the codification of Modern Bulgarian until an alphabet with 32 letters, proposed by Marin Drinov, gained prominence in the 1870s. The alphabet of Marin Drinov was used until the orthographic reform of 1945, when the letters yat (uppercase \u0462, lowercase \u0463) and big yus (uppercase \u046a, lowercase \u046b) were removed from its alphabet, reducing the number of letters to 30.\nWith the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek scripts.\nGrammar.\nThe parts of speech in Bulgarian are divided in ten types, which are categorized in two broad classes: mutable and immutable. The difference is that mutable parts of speech vary grammatically, whereas the immutable ones do not change, regardless of their use. The five classes of mutables are: \"nouns\", \"adjectives\", \"numerals\", \"pronouns\" and \"verbs\". Syntactically, the first four of these form the group of the noun or the nominal group. The immutables are: \"adverbs\", \"prepositions\", \"conjunctions\", \"particles\" and \"interjections\". Verbs and adverbs form the group of the verb or the verbal group.\nNominal morphology.\nNouns and adjectives have the categories grammatical gender, number, case (only vocative) and definiteness in Bulgarian. Adjectives and adjectival pronouns agree with nouns in number and gender. Pronouns have gender and number and retain (as in nearly all Indo-European languages) a more significant part of the case system.\nNominal inflection.\nGender.\nThere are three grammatical genders in Bulgarian: \"masculine\", \"feminine\" and \"neuter\". The gender of the noun can largely be inferred from its ending: nouns ending in a consonant (\"zero ending\") are generally masculine (for example, 'city', 'son', 'man'; those ending in\u00a0\u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f (-a/-ya) ( 'woman', 'daughter', 'street') are normally feminine; and nouns ending in\u00a0\u2013\u0435,\u00a0\u2013\u043e are almost always neuter ( 'child', 'lake'), as are those rare words (usually loanwords) that end in\u00a0\u2013\u0438,\u00a0\u2013\u0443, and\u00a0\u2013\u044e ( 'tsunami', 'taboo', 'menu'). Perhaps the most significant exception from the above are the relatively numerous nouns that end in a consonant and yet are feminine: these comprise, firstly, a large group of nouns with zero ending expressing quality, degree or an abstraction, including all nouns ending in\u00a0\u2013\u043e\u0441\u0442/\u2013\u0435\u0441\u0442 -{ost/est} ( 'wisdom', 'vileness', 'loveliness', 'sickness', 'love'), and secondly, a much smaller group of irregular nouns with zero ending which define tangible objects or concepts ( 'blood', 'bone', 'evening', 'night'). There are also some commonly used words that end in a vowel and yet are masculine: 'father', 'grandfather', / 'uncle', and others.\nThe plural forms of the nouns do not express their gender as clearly as the singular ones, but may also provide some clues to it: the ending (-i) is more likely to be used with a masculine or feminine noun ( 'facts', 'sicknesses'), while one in belongs more often to a neuter noun ( 'lakes'). Also, the plural ending occurs only in masculine nouns.\nNumber.\nTwo numbers are distinguished in Bulgarian\u2013singular and plural. A variety of plural suffixes is used, and the choice between them is partly determined by their ending in singular and partly influenced by gender; in addition, irregular declension and alternative plural forms are common. Words ending in (which are usually feminine) generally have the plural ending , upon dropping of the singular ending. Of nouns ending in a consonant, the feminine ones also use , whereas the masculine ones usually have for polysyllables and for monosyllables (however, exceptions are especially common in this group). Nouns ending in (most of which are neuter) mostly use the suffixes (both of which require the dropping of the singular endings) and .\nWith cardinal numbers and related words such as ('several'), masculine nouns use a special count form in , which stems from the Proto-Slavonic dual: ('two/three chairs') versus ('these chairs'); cf. feminine ('two/three/these books') and neuter ('two/three/these beds'). However, a recently developed language norm requires that count forms should only be used with masculine nouns that do not denote persons. Thus, ('two/three students') is perceived as more correct than , while the distinction is retained in cases such as ('two/three pencils') versus ('these pencils').\nCase.\nCases exist only in the personal and some other pronouns (as they do in many other modern Indo-European languages), with nominative, accusative, dative and vocative forms. Vestiges are present in a number of phraseological units and sayings. The major exception are vocative forms, which are still in use for masculine (with the endings -\u0435, -\u043e and -\u044e) and feminine nouns (-[\u044c/\u0439]\u043e and -\u0435) in the singular.\nDefiniteness (article).\nIn modern Bulgarian, definiteness is expressed by a definite article which is postfixed to the noun, much like in the Scandinavian languages or Romanian (indefinite: , 'person'; definite: , \"\"the\" person\") or to the first nominal constituent of definite noun phrases (indefinite: , 'a good person'; definite: , \"\"the\" good person\"). There are four singular definite articles. Again, the choice between them is largely determined by the noun's ending in the singular. Nouns that end in a consonant and are masculine use \u2013\u044a\u0442/\u2013\u044f\u0442, when they are grammatical subjects, and \u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f elsewhere. Nouns that end in a consonant and are feminine, as well as nouns that end in \u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f (most of which are feminine, too) use \u2013\u0442\u0430. Nouns that end in \u2013\u0435/\u2013\u043e use \u2013\u0442\u043e.\nThe plural definite article is \u2013\u0442\u0435 for all nouns except for plural forms that end in \u2013\u0430/\u2013\u044f; getting \u2013\u0442\u0430 instead. When postfixed to adjectives the definite articles are \u2013\u044f\u0442/\u2013\u044f for masculine gender (again, with the longer form being reserved for grammatical subjects), \u2013\u0442\u0430 for feminine gender, \u2013\u0442\u043e for neuter gender, and \u2013\u0442\u0435 for plural.\nAdjective and numeral inflection.\nBoth groups agree in gender and number with the noun they are appended to. They may also take the definite article as explained above.\nPronouns.\nPronouns may vary in gender, number, and definiteness, and are the only parts of speech that have retained case inflections. Three cases are exhibited by some groups of pronouns \u2013 nominative, accusative and dative. The distinguishable types of pronouns include the following: personal, relative, reflexive, interrogative, negative, indefinite, summative and possessive.\nVerbal morphology and grammar.\nA Bulgarian verb has many distinct forms, as it varies in person, number, voice, aspect, mood, tense and in some cases gender.\nFinite verbal forms.\nFinite verbal forms are \"simple\" or \"compound\" and agree with subjects in person (first, second and third) and number (singular, plural). In addition to that, past compound forms using participles vary in gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and voice (active and passive) as well as aspect (perfective/aorist and imperfective).\nAspect.\nBulgarian verbs express lexical aspect: perfective verbs signify the completion of the action of the verb and form past perfective (aorist) forms; imperfective ones are neutral with regard to it and form past imperfective forms. Most Bulgarian verbs can be grouped in perfective-imperfective pairs (imperfective/perfective: \"come\", \"arrive\"). Perfective verbs can be usually formed from imperfective ones by suffixation or prefixation, but the resultant verb often deviates in meaning from the original. In the pair examples above, aspect is stem-specific and therefore there is no difference in meaning.\nIn Bulgarian, there is also grammatical aspect. Three grammatical aspects are distinguishable: neutral, perfect and pluperfect. The neutral aspect comprises the three simple tenses and the future tense. The pluperfect is manifest in tenses that use double or triple auxiliary \"be\" participles like the past pluperfect subjunctive. Perfect constructions use a single auxiliary \"be\".\nMood.\nThe traditional interpretation is that in addition to the four moods (\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f ) shared by most other European languages \u2013 indicative (\u0438\u0437\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e, ) imperative (\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u043e ), subjunctive ( ) and conditional (\u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e, ) \u2013 in Bulgarian there is one more to describe a general category of unwitnessed events \u2013 the inferential (\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u0437\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e ) mood. However, most contemporary Bulgarian linguists usually exclude the subjunctive mood and the inferential mood from the list of Bulgarian moods (thus placing the number of Bulgarian moods at a total of 3: indicative, imperative and conditional) and do not consider them to be moods but view them as verbial morphosyntactic constructs or separate gramemes of the verb class. The possible existence of a few other moods has been discussed in the literature. Most Bulgarian school grammars teach the traditional view of 4 Bulgarian moods (as described above, but excluding the subjunctive and including the inferential).\nTense.\nThere are three grammatically distinctive positions in time \u2013 present, past and future \u2013 which combine with aspect and mood to produce a number of formations. Normally, in grammar books these formations are viewed as separate tenses \u2013 i. e. \"past imperfect\" would mean that the verb is in past tense, in the imperfective aspect, and in the indicative mood (since no other mood is shown). There are more than 40 different tenses across Bulgarian's two aspects and five moods.\nIn the indicative mood, there are three simple tenses:\nIn the indicative there are also the following compound tenses:\nThe four perfect constructions above can vary in aspect depending on the aspect of the main-verb participle; they are in fact pairs of imperfective and perfective aspects. Verbs in forms using past participles also vary in voice and gender.\nThere is only one simple tense in the imperative mood, the present, and there are simple forms only for the second-person singular, -\u0438/-\u0439 (-i, -y/i), and plural, -\u0435\u0442\u0435/-\u0439\u0442\u0435 (-ete, -yte), e.g. \u0443\u0447\u0430 ('to study'): , sg., , pl.; 'to play': , . There are compound imperative forms for all persons and numbers in the present compound imperative (, ), the present perfect compound imperative (, ) and the rarely used present pluperfect compound imperative (, ).\nThe conditional mood consists of five compound tenses, most of which are not grammatically distinguishable. The present, future and past conditional use a special past form of the stem \u0431\u0438- (bi \u2013 \"be\") and the past participle (, , 'I would study'). The past future conditional and the past future perfect conditional coincide in form with the respective indicative tenses.\nThe subjunctive mood is rarely documented as a separate verb form in Bulgarian (being, morphologically, a sub-instance of the quasi-infinitive construction with the particle \u0434\u0430 and a normal finite verb form), but nevertheless it is used regularly. The most common form, often mistaken for the present tense, is the present subjunctive ( , 'I had better go'). The difference between the present indicative and the present subjunctive tense is that the subjunctive can be formed by \"both\" perfective and imperfective verbs. It has completely replaced the infinitive and the supine from complex expressions (see below). It is also employed to express opinion about \"possible\" future events. The past perfect subjunctive ( , 'I'd had better be gone') refers to \"possible\" events in the past, which \"did not\" take place, and the present pluperfect subjunctive ( ), which may be used about both past and future events arousing feelings of incontinence, suspicion, etc.\nThe inferential mood has five pure tenses. Two of them are simple \u2013 \"past aorist inferential\" and \"past imperfect inferential\" \u2013 and are formed by the past participles of perfective and imperfective verbs, respectively. There are also three compound tenses \u2013 \"past future inferential\", \"past future perfect inferential\" and \"past perfect inferential\". All these tenses' forms are gender-specific in the singular. There are also conditional and compound-imperative crossovers. The existence of inferential forms has been attributed to Turkic influences by most Bulgarian linguists. Morphologically, they are derived from the perfect.\nNon-finite verbal forms.\nBulgarian has the following participles:\nThe participles are inflected by gender, number, and definiteness, and are coordinated with the subject when forming compound tenses (see tenses above). When used in an attributive role, the inflection attributes are coordinated with the noun that is being attributed.\nReflexive verbs.\nBulgarian uses reflexive verbal forms (i.e. actions which are performed by the agent onto him- or herself) which behave in a similar way as they do in many other Indo-European languages, such as French and Spanish. The reflexive is expressed by the invariable particle se, originally a clitic form of the accusative reflexive pronoun. Thus \u2013\nWhen the action is performed on others, other particles are used, just like in any normal verb, e.g. \u2013\nSometimes, the reflexive verb form has a similar but not necessarily identical meaning to the non-reflexive verb \u2013\nIn other cases, the reflexive verb has a completely different meaning from its non-reflexive counterpart \u2013\nWhen the action is performed on an indirect object, the particles change to si and its derivatives \u2013\nIn some cases, the particle \"si\" is ambiguous between the indirect object and the possessive meaning \u2013\nThe difference between transitive and intransitive verbs can lead to significant differences in meaning with minimal change, e.g. \u2013\nThe particle \"si\" is often used to indicate a more personal relationship to the action, e.g. \u2013\nAdverbs.\nThe most productive way to form adverbs is to derive them from the neuter singular form of the corresponding adjective\u2014e.g. (fast), (hard), (strange)\u2014but adjectives ending in use the masculine singular form (i.e. ending in ), instead\u2014e.g. (heroically), (bravely, like a man), (skillfully). The same pattern is used to form adverbs from the (adjective-like) ordinal numerals, e.g. (firstly), (secondly), (thirdly), and in some cases from (adjective-like) cardinal numerals, e.g. (twice as/double), (three times as), (five times as).\nThe remaining adverbs are formed in ways that are no longer productive in the language. A small number are original (not derived from other words), for example: (here), (there), (inside), (outside), (very/much) etc. The rest are mostly fossilized case forms, such as:\nAdverbs can sometimes be reduplicated to emphasize the qualitative or quantitative properties of actions, moods or relations as performed by the subject of the sentence: \"\" (\"rather slowly\"), \"\" (\"with great difficulty\"), \"\" (\"quite\", \"thoroughly\").\nOther features.\nQuestions.\nQuestions in Bulgarian which do not use a question word (such as who? what? etc.) are formed with the particle after the verb; a subject is not necessary, as the verbal conjugation suggests who is performing the action:\nWhile the particle generally goes after the verb, it can go after a noun or adjective if a contrast is needed:\nA verb is not always necessary, e.g. when presenting a choice:\nRhetorical questions can be formed by adding to a question word, thus forming a \"double interrogative\" \u2013\nThe same construction ('no') is an emphasized positive \u2013\nSignificant verbs.\nBe (\"\u0421\u044a\u043c\").\nThe verb \u2013 'to be' is also used as an auxiliary for forming the perfect, the passive and the conditional:\nTwo alternate forms of exist:\nWill (\"\u0429\u0435\").\nThe impersonal verb (lit.\u2009'it wants') is used to for forming the (positive) future tense:\nThe negative future is formed with the invariable construction (see below):\nThe past tense of this verb \u2013 \u0449\u044f\u0445 is conjugated to form the past conditional ('would have' \u2013 again, with \u0434\u0430, since it is \"irrealis\"):\nHave/Don't have (\"\u0418\u043c\u0430\u043c and \u043d\u044f\u043c\u0430\u043c\").\nThe verbs ('to have') and ('to not have'):\nConjunctions and particles.\nBut.\nIn Bulgarian, there are several conjunctions all translating into English as \"but\", which are all used in distinct situations. They are (), (), (), (), and () (and () \u2013 \"however\", identical in use to ).\nWhile there is some overlapping between their uses, in many cases they are specific. For example, is used for a choice \u2013 \u2013 \"not this one, but that one\" (compare Spanish ), while is often used to provide extra information or an opinion \u2013 \u2013 \"I said it, but I was wrong\". Meanwhile, provides contrast between two situations, and in some sentences can even be translated as \"although\", \"while\" or even \"and\" \u2013 \u2013 \"I'm working, and he's daydreaming\".\nVery often, different words can be used to alter the emphasis of a sentence \u2013 e.g. while and both mean \"I smoke, but I shouldn't\", the first sounds more like a statement of fact (\"...but I mustn't\"), while the second feels more like a \"judgement\" (\"...but I oughtn't\"). Similarly, and both mean \"I don't want to, but he does\", however the first emphasizes the fact that \"he\" wants to, while the second emphasizes the \"wanting\" rather than the person.\n is interesting in that, while it feels archaic, it is often used in poetry and frequently in children's stories, since it has quite a moral/ominous feel to it.\nSome common expressions use these words, and some can be used alone as interjections:\nVocative particles.\nBulgarian has several abstract particles which are used to strengthen a statement. These have no precise translation in English. The particles are strictly informal and can even be considered rude by some people and in some situations. They are mostly used at the end of questions or instructions.\nModal particles.\nThese are \"tagged\" on to the beginning or end of a sentence to express the mood of the speaker in relation to the situation. They are mostly interrogative or slightly imperative in nature. There is no change in the grammatical mood when these are used (although they may be expressed through different grammatical moods in other languages).\nIntentional particles.\nThese express intent or desire, perhaps even pleading. They can be seen as a sort of cohortative side to the language. (Since they can be used by themselves, they could even be considered as verbs in their own right.) They are also highly informal.\nThese particles can be combined with the vocative particles for greater effect, e.g. (let me see), or even exclusively in combinations with them, with no other elements, e.g. (come on!); (I told you not to!).\nPronouns of quality.\nBulgarian has several pronouns of quality which have no direct parallels in English \u2013 (what sort of); (this sort of); (that sort of \u2013 colloq.); (some sort of); (no sort of); (every sort of); and the relative pronoun (the sort of ... that ... ). The adjective (\"the same\") derives from the same radical.\nExample phrases include:\nAn interesting phenomenon is that these can be strung along one after another in quite long constructions, e.g.\nAn extreme, albeit colloquial, example with almost no intrinsic lexical meaning \u2013 yet which is meaningful to the Bulgarian ear \u2013 would be :\nThe subject of the sentence is simply the pronoun \"\" (lit. \"this one here\"; colloq. \"she\").\nAnother interesting phenomenon that is observed in colloquial speech is the use of (neuter of ) not only as a substitute for an adjective, but also as a substitute for a verb. In that case the base form is used as the third person singular in the present indicative and all other forms are formed by analogy to other verbs in the language. Sometimes the \"verb\" may even acquire a derivational prefix that changes its meaning. Examples:\nAnother use of in colloquial speech is the word , which can be used as a substitution for a noun, but also, if the speaker does not remember or is not sure how to say something, they might say and then pause to think about it:\nAs a result of this versatility, the word can readily be used as a euphemism for taboo subjects. It is commonly used to substitute, for example, words relating to reproductive organs or sexual acts:\nSimilar \"meaningless\" expressions are extremely common in spoken Bulgarian, especially when the speaker is finding it difficult to describe or express something.\nSyntax.\nBulgarian employs clitic doubling, mostly for emphatic purposes. For example, the following constructions are common in colloquial Bulgarian:\n(lit. \"I gave \"it\" the present to Maria.\")\n(lit. \"I gave \"her it\" the present to Maria.\")\nThe phenomenon is practically obligatory in the spoken language in the case of inversion signalling information structure (in writing, clitic doubling may be skipped in such instances, with a somewhat bookish effect):\n(lit. \"The present [\"to her\"] \"it\" I-gave to Maria.\")\n(lit. \"To Maria \"to her\" [\"it\"] I-gave the present.\")\nSometimes, the doubling signals syntactic relations, thus:\n(lit. \"Petar and Ivan \"them\" ate the wolves.\")\nTransl.: \"Petar and Ivan were eaten by the wolves\".\nThis is contrasted with:\n(lit.\u2009'Petar and Ivan ate the wolves')\nTransl.: \"Petar and Ivan ate the wolves\".\nIn this case, clitic doubling can be a colloquial alternative of the more formal or bookish passive voice, which would be constructed as follows:\n(lit.\u2009'Petar and Ivan were eaten by the wolves.')\nClitic doubling is also fully obligatory, both in the spoken and in the written norm, in clauses including several special expressions that use the short accusative and dative pronouns such as \"\" (I feel like playing), \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0438 \u0435 (I am cold), and \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u0435 \u0440\u044a\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 (my arm hurts):\n(lit. \"To me \"to me\" it-feels-like-sleeping, and to Ivan \"to him\" it-feels-like-playing\")\nTransl.: \"I feel like sleeping, and Ivan feels like playing.\"\n(lit. \"To us \"to us\" it-is cold, and to you-plur. \"to you-plur.\" it-is warm\")\nTransl.: \"We are cold, and you are warm.\"\n(lit. Ivan \"him\" aches the throat, and me \"me\" aches the head)\nTransl.: Ivan has sore throat, and I have a headache.\nExcept the above examples, clitic doubling is considered inappropriate in a formal context.\nVocabulary.\nMost of the vocabulary of modern Bulgarian consists of terms inherited from Proto-Slavic and local Bulgarian innovations and formations of those through the mediation of Old and Middle Bulgarian. The native terms in Bulgarian account for 70% to 80% of the lexicon.\nThe remaining 20% to 30% are loanwords from a number of languages, as well as derivations of such words. Bulgarian adopted also a few words of Thracian and Bulgar origin. The languages which have contributed most to Bulgarian as a way of foreign vocabulary borrowings are:\nThe classical languages Latin and Greek are the source of many words, used mostly in international terminology. Many Latin terms entered Bulgarian during the time when present-day Bulgaria was part of the Roman Empire and also in the later centuries through Romanian, Aromanian, and Megleno-Romanian during Bulgarian Empires. The loanwords of Greek origin in Bulgarian are a product of the influence of the liturgical language of the Orthodox Church. Many of the numerous loanwords from another Turkic language, Ottoman Turkish and, via Ottoman Turkish, from Arabic were adopted into Bulgarian during the long period of Ottoman rule, but have been replaced with native Bulgarian terms. Furthermore, after the independence of Bulgaria from the Ottoman Empire in 1878, Bulgarian intellectuals imported many French language vocabulary. In addition, both specialized (usually coming from the field of science) and commonplace English words (notably abstract, commodity/service-related or technical terms) have also penetrated Bulgarian since the second half of the 20th century, especially since 1989. A noteworthy portion of this English-derived terminology has attained some unique features in the process of its introduction to native speakers, and this has resulted in peculiar derivations that set the newly formed loanwords apart from the original words (mainly in pronunciation), although many loanwords are completely identical to the source words. A growing number of international neologisms are also being widely adopted, causing controversy between younger generations who, in general, are raised in the era of digital globalization, and the older, more conservative educated purists.\nSample text.\nArticle 1 of the \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" in Bulgarian:\nThe romanization of the text into Latin alphabet:\nBulgarian pronunciation transliterated in broad IPA:\n['fsit\u0361\u0283ki 'x\u0254r\u0250 s\u025b 'ra\u0292d\u0250t svo'b\u0254dni i 'ravni po dos't\u0254jnstvo i pr\u0250'va.

{"id": "4153", "revid": "166386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4153", "title": "Bipyramid", "text": "Polyhedron formed by joining mirroring pyramids base-to-base\nIn geometry, a bipyramid, dipyramid, or double pyramid is a polyhedron formed by fusing two pyramids together base-to-base. The polygonal base of each pyramid must therefore be the same, and unless otherwise specified the base vertices are usually coplanar and a bipyramid is usually \"symmetric\", meaning the two pyramids are mirror images across their common base plane. When each apex (pl.\u2009apices, the off-base vertices) of the bipyramid is on a line perpendicular to the base and passing through its center, it is a \"right\" bipyramid; otherwise it is \"oblique\". When the base is a regular polygon, the bipyramid is also called \"regular\".\nDefinition and properties.\nA bipyramid is a polyhedron constructed by fusing two pyramids which share the same polygonal base; a pyramid is in turn constructed by connecting each vertex of its base to a single new vertex (the apex) not lying in the plane of the base, for an n-gonal base forming n triangular faces in addition to the base face. An n-gonal bipyramid thus has 2\"n\" faces, 3\"n\" edges, and \"n\" + 2 vertices. More generally, a right pyramid is a pyramid where the apices are on the perpendicular line through the centroid of an arbitrary polygon or the incenter of a tangential polygon, depending on the source. Likewise, a \"right bipyramid\" is a polyhedron constructed by attaching two symmetrical right bipyramid bases; bipyramids whose apices are not on this line are called \"oblique bipyramids\".\nWhen the two pyramids are mirror images, the bipyramid is called \"symmetric\". It is called \"regular\" if its base is a regular polygon. When the base is a regular polygon and the apices are on the perpendicular line through its center (a \"regular right bipyramid\") then all of its faces are isosceles triangles; sometimes the name \"bipyramid\" refers specifically to symmetric regular right bipyramids, Examples of such bipyramids are the triangular bipyramid, octahedron (square bipyramid) and pentagonal bipyramid. If all their edges are equal in length, these shapes consist of equilateral triangle faces, making them deltahedra; the triangular bipyramid and the pentagonal bipyramid are Johnson solids, and the regular octahedron is a Platonic solid.\nThe symmetric regular right bipyramids have prismatic symmetry, with dihedral symmetry group D\"nh\" of order 4\"n\": they are unchanged when rotated of a turn around the axis of symmetry, reflected across any plane passing through both apices and a base vertex or both apices and the center of a base edge, or reflected across the mirror plane. Because their faces are transitive under these symmetry transformations, they are isohedral. They are the dual polyhedra of prisms and the prisms are the dual of bipyramids as well; the bipyramids vertices correspond to the faces of the prism, and the edges between pairs of vertices of one correspond to the edges between pairs of faces of the other, and vice versa. The prisms share the same symmetry as the bipyramids. The regular octahedron is more symmetric still, as its base vertices and apices are indistinguishable and can be exchanged by reflections or rotations; the regular octahedron and its dual, the cube, have octahedral symmetry.\nThe volume of a symmetric bipyramid is\nformula_1\nwhere B is the area of the base and h the perpendicular distance from the base plane to either apex. In the case of a regular n-sided polygon with side length s and whose altitude is h, the volume of such a bipyramid is:\nformula_2\nRelated and other types of bipyramid.\nConcave bipyramids.\nA \"concave bipyramid\" has a concave polygon base, and one example is a concave tetragonal bipyramid or an irregular concave octahedron. A bipyramid with an arbitrary polygonal base could be considered a \"right\" bipyramid if the apices are on a line perpendicular to the base passing through the base's centroid.\nAsymmetric bipyramids.\nAn \"asymmetric bipyramid\" has apices which are not mirrored across the base plane; for a right bipyramid this only happens if each apex is a different distance from the base.\nThe dual of an asymmetric right n-gonal bipyramid is an n-gonal frustum.\nA regular asymmetric right n-gonal bipyramid has symmetry group C\"n\"v, of order 2\"n\".\nScalene triangle bipyramids.\nAn isotoxal right (symmetric) di-n-gonal bipyramid is a right (symmetric) 2\"n\"-gonal bipyramid with an \"isotoxal\" flat polygon base: its 2\"n\" basal vertices are coplanar, but alternate in two radii.\nAll its faces are congruent scalene triangles, and it is isohedral. It can be seen as another type of a right symmetric di-n-gonal \"scalenohedron\", with an isotoxal flat polygon base.\nAn isotoxal right (symmetric) di-n-gonal bipyramid has n two-fold rotation axes through opposite basal vertices, n reflection planes through opposite apical edges, an n-fold rotation axis through apices, a reflection plane through base, and an n-fold rotation-reflection axis through apices, representing symmetry group D\"n\"h, [\"n\",2], (*22\"n\"), of order 4\"n\". (The reflection about the base plane corresponds to the 0\u00b0 rotation-reflection. If n is even, then there is an inversion symmetry about the center, corresponding to the 180\u00b0 rotation-reflection.)\nExample with 2\"n\" = 2\u00d73:\nAn isotoxal right (symmetric) ditrigonal bipyramid has three similar vertical planes of symmetry, intersecting in a (vertical) 3-fold rotation axis; perpendicular to them is a fourth plane of symmetry (horizontal); at the intersection of the three vertical planes with the horizontal plane are three similar (horizontal) 2-fold rotation axes; there is no center of inversion symmetry, but there is a center of symmetry: the intersection point of the four axes.\nExample with 2\"n\" = 2\u00d74:\nAn isotoxal right (symmetric) ditetragonal bipyramid has four vertical planes of symmetry of two kinds, intersecting in a (vertical) 4-fold rotation axis; perpendicular to them is a fifth plane of symmetry (horizontal); at the intersection of the four vertical planes with the horizontal plane are four (horizontal) 2-fold rotation axes of two kinds, each perpendicular to a plane of symmetry; two vertical planes bisect the angles between two horizontal axes; and there is a centre of inversion symmetry.\nDouble example:\nIn crystallography, isotoxal right (symmetric) didigonal (8-faced), ditrigonal (12-faced), ditetragonal (16-faced), and dihexagonal (24-faced) bipyramids exist.\nScalenohedra.\nA scalenohedron is similar to a bipyramid; the difference is that the scalenohedra has a zig-zag pattern in the middle edges.\nIt has two apices and 2\"n\" basal vertices, 4\"n\" faces, and 6\"n\" edges; it is topologically identical to a 2\"n\"-gonal bipyramid, but its 2\"n\" basal vertices alternate in two rings above and below the center.\nAll its faces are congruent scalene triangles, and it is isohedral. It can be seen as another type of a right symmetric di-n-gonal bipyramid, with a regular zigzag skew polygon base.\nA regular right symmetric di-n-gonal scalenohedron has n two-fold rotation axes through opposite basal mid-edges, n reflection planes through opposite apical edges, an n-fold rotation axis through apices, and a 2n\"-fold rotation-reflection axis through apices (about which 1n\" rotations-reflections globally preserve the solid), representing symmetry group D\"n\"v = D\"n\"d, [2+,2\"n\"], (2*\"n\"), of order 4\"n\". (If n is odd, then there is an inversion symmetry about the center, corresponding to the 180\u00b0 rotation-reflection.)\nExample with 2\"n\" = 2\u00d73:\nA regular right symmetric ditrigonal scalenohedron has three similar vertical planes of symmetry inclined to one another at 60\u00b0 and intersecting in a (vertical) 3-fold rotation axis, three similar horizontal 2-fold rotation axes, each perpendicular to a plane of symmetry, a center of inversion symmetry, and a vertical 6-fold rotation-reflection axis.\nExample with 2\"n\" = 2\u00d72:\nA regular right symmetric didigonal scalenohedron has only one vertical and two horizontal 2-fold rotation axes, two vertical planes of symmetry, which bisect the angles between the horizontal pair of axes, and a vertical 4-fold rotation-reflection axis; it has no center of inversion symmetry.\nFor at most two particular values of formula_11 the faces of such a scalenohedron may be isosceles.\nDouble example:\nIn crystallography, regular right symmetric didigonal (8-faced) and ditrigonal (12-faced) scalenohedra exist.\nThe smallest geometric scalenohedra have eight faces, and are topologically identical to the regular octahedron. In this case (2\"n\" = 2\u00d72), in crystallography, a regular right symmetric didigonal (8-faced) scalenohedron is called a \"tetragonal scalenohedron\".\nLet us temporarily focus on the regular right symmetric 8-faced scalenohedra with \"h\" = \"r\", i.e. \nformula_20\nTheir two apices can be represented as A, A' and their four basal vertices as U, U', V, V': \nformula_21\nwhere z is a parameter between 0 and 1.\nAt \"z\" = 0, it is a regular octahedron; at \"z\" = 1, it has four pairs of coplanar faces, and merging these into four congruent isosceles triangles makes it a disphenoid; for \"z\" &gt; 1, it is concave.\nIf the 2\"n\"-gon base is both isotoxal in-out and zigzag skew, then not all faces of the isotoxal right symmetric scalenohedron are congruent.\nExample with five different edge lengths:\nFor some particular values of \"zA\" = |\"zA'\"|, half the faces of such a scalenohedron may be isosceles or equilateral.\nExample with three different edge lengths:\nStar bipyramids.\nA \"star\" bipyramid has a star polygon base, and is self-intersecting.\nA regular right symmetric star bipyramid has congruent isosceles triangle faces, and is isohedral.\nA \"p\"/\"q\"-bipyramid has Coxeter diagram .\n4-polytopes with bipyramidal cells.\nThe dual of the rectification of each convex regular 4-polytopes is a cell-transitive 4-polytope with bipyramidal cells. In the following:\nThe bipyramid 4-polytope will have VA vertices where the apices of NA bipyramids meet. It will have VE vertices where the type E vertices of NE bipyramids meet. \nAs cells must fit around an edge,\nformula_30\nOther dimensions.\nA generalized n-dimensional \"bipyramid\" is any n-polytope constructed from an (\"n\" \u2212 1)-polytope \"base\" lying in a hyperplane, with every base vertex connected by an edge to two \"apex\" vertices. If the (\"n\" \u2212 1)-polytope is a regular polytope and the apices are equidistant from its center along the line perpendicular to the base hyperplane, it will have identical pyramidal facets.\nA 2-dimensional analog of a right symmetric bipyramid is formed by joining two congruent isosceles triangles base-to-base to form a rhombus. More generally, a kite is a 2-dimensional analog of a (possibly asymmetric) right bipyramid, and any quadrilateral is a 2-dimensional analog of a general bipyramid.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution, it was the first US college to codify that admission and instruction of students was to be equal regardless of the religious affiliation of students.\nThe university is home to the oldest applied mathematics program in the country and oldest engineering program in the Ivy League. It was one of the early doctoral-granting institutions in the U.S., adding masters and doctoral studies in 1887. In 1969, it adopted its Open Curriculum after student lobbying, which eliminated mandatory general education distribution requirements. In 1971, Brown's coordinate women's institution, Pembroke College, was fully merged into the university.\nThe university comprises the College, the Graduate School, Alpert Medical School, the School of Engineering, the School of Public Health and the School of Professional Studies. Its international programs are organized through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, and it is academically affiliated with the Marine Biological Laboratory and the Rhode Island School of Design, which offers undergraduate and graduate dual degree programs. Brown's main campus is in the College Hill neighborhood of Providence. The university is surrounded by a federally listed architectural district with a concentration of Colonial-era buildings. Benefit Street has one of America's richest concentrations of 17th- and 18th-century architecture. Undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 5% for the class of 2026.\nAs of October\u00a02025[ [update]], 12 Nobel Prize winners, 1 Fields Medalist, 7 National Humanities Medalists, and 11 National Medal of Science laureates have been affiliated with Brown as alumni, faculty, or researchers. Alumni also include 29 Pulitzer Prize winners, 21 billionaires, 4 U.S. secretaries of state, over 100 members of the United States Congress, 58 Rhodes Scholars, 22 MacArthur Genius Fellows, and 38 Olympic medalists.\nHistory.\nFoundation and charter.\nIn 1761, three residents of Newport, Rhode Island, drafted a petition to the colony's General Assembly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That your Petitioners propose to open a literary institution or School for instructing young Gentlemen in the Languages, Mathematics, Geography &amp; History, &amp; such other branches of Knowledge as shall be desired. That for this End... it will be necessary... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth &amp; the Residence of the Professors.\nThe three petitioners were Ezra Stiles, pastor of Newport's Second Congregational Church and future president of Yale University; William Ellery Jr., future signer of the United States Declaration of Independence; and Josias Lyndon, future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery later served as co-authors of the college's charter two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\"\nThe Philadelphia https:// was also interested in establishing a college in Rhode Island, which was founded as a Baptist colony in America, including the mother-church of all American Baptists: the First Baptist Church in America. At the time, the Baptists were unrepresented among the colonial colleges; the Congregationalists had Harvard University and Yale University, the Presbyterians had the College of New Jersey, which later became Princeton University, and the Episcopalians had the College of William &amp; Mary and King's College, which later became Columbia University. The local University of Pennsylvania in their native Philadelphia was founded by Benjamin Franklin without direct association with any particular denomination. Isaac Backus, the Baptist minister and historian of the New England Baptists, who was an inaugural trustee of Brown University, wrote of the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. James Manning, who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.James Manning arrived at Newport in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the charter for the college. Stiles' first draft was read to the General Assembly in August 1763, and rejected by Baptist members who worried that their denomination would be underrepresented in the College Board of Fellows. A revised charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Rhode Island General Assembly on March 3, 1764, in East Greenwich.\nIn September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the corporation\u2014the college's governing body\u2014was held in Newport's Old Colony House. Governor Stephen Hopkins was chosen chancellor, former and future governor Samuel Ward vice chancellor, John Tillinghast treasurer, and Thomas Eyres secretary. The charter stipulated that the board of trustees should be composed of 22 Baptists, 5 Quakers, 5 Episcopalians, and 4 Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, 8 should be Baptists\u2014including the college president\u2014\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\"\nAt the time of its creation, Brown's charter was a uniquely progressive document. Other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" The document additionally \"recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other [university charter] the principle of denominational cooperation.\" The oft-repeated statement that Brown's charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership is inaccurate; other college charters were similarly liberal in that particular.\nThe college was founded as Rhode Island College, at the site of the https://, Rhode Island. Manning was sworn in as the college's first president in 1765 and remained in the role until 1791. In 1766, the college authorized Rev. Morgan Edwards to travel to Europe to \"solicit Benefactions for this Institution\". During his year-and-a-half stay in the British Isles, Edwards secured funding from benefactors including Thomas Penn and Benjamin Franklin.\nIn 1770, the college moved from Warren to Providence. To establish a campus, John and Moses Brown purchased a four-acre lot on the crest of College Hill on behalf of the school. The majority of the property fell within the bounds of the original home lot of Chad Brown, an ancestor of the Browns and one of the original proprietors of Providence Plantations. After the college was relocated to the city, work began on constructing its first building.\nA building committee, organized by the corporation, developed plans for the college's first purpose-built edifice, finalizing a design on February 9, 1770. The subsequent structure, referred to as \"The College Edifice\" and later as University Hall, may have been modeled on Nassau Hall, built 14 years prior at the College of New Jersey. President Manning, an active member of the building process, was educated at Princeton and might have suggested that Brown's first building resemble that of his alma mater.\nBrown family.\nNicholas Brown, John Brown, Joseph Brown, and Moses Brown were instrumental in moving the college to Providence, constructing its first building, and securing its endowment. Joseph became a professor of natural philosophy at the college; John served as its treasurer from 1775 to 1796; and Nicholas Sr's son Nicholas Brown Jr. succeeded his uncle as treasurer from 1796 to 1825.\nOn September 8, 1803, the corporation voted, \"That the donation of $5,000, if made to this College within one Year from the late Commencement, shall entitle the donor to name the College.\" The following year, the appeal was answered by College Treasurer Nicholas Brown Jr. In a letter dated September 6, 1804, Brown committed \"a donation of Five Thousand Dollars to Rhode Island College, to remain in perpetuity as a fund for the establishment of a Professorship of Oratory and Belles Letters.\" In recognition of the gift, the corporation on the same day voted, \"That this College be called and known in all future time by the Name of Brown University.\" Over the years, the benefactions of Nicholas Brown Jr., totaled nearly $160,000 and included funds for building Hope College (1821\u201322) and Manning Hall (1834\u201335).\nIn 1904, the John Carter Brown Library was established as an independently funded research library on Brown's campus; the library's collection was founded on that of John Carter Brown, son of Nicholas Brown Jr.\nThe Brown family was involved in various business ventures in Rhode Island, and accrued wealth both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade. The family was divided on the issue of slavery. John Brown had defended slavery, while Moses and Nicholas Brown Jr. were fervent abolitionists.\nIn 2003, under the tenure of President Ruth Simmons, the university established a steering committee to investigate these ties of the university to slavery and recommend a strategy to address them.\nAmerican Revolution.\nWith British vessels patrolling Narragansett Bay in the fall of 1776, the college library was moved out of Providence for safekeeping. During the subsequent American Revolutionary War, Brown's University Hall was used to house French and other revolutionary troops led by General George Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau as they waited to commence the march of 1781 that led to the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake. This has been celebrated as marking the defeat of the British and the end of the war. The building functioned as barracks and hospital from December 10, 1776, to April 20, 1780, and as a hospital for French troops from June 26, 1780, to May 27, 1782.\nA number of Brown's founders and alumni played roles in the American Revolution and subsequent founding of the United States. Brown's first chancellor, Stephen Hopkins, served as a delegate to the Colonial Congress in Albany in 1754, and to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1776. James Manning represented Rhode Island at the Congress of the Confederation, while concurrently serving as Brown's first president. Two of Brown's founders, William Ellery and Stephen Hopkins signed the Declaration of Independence.\nJames Mitchell Varnum, who graduated from Brown with honors in 1769, served as one of General George Washington's Continental Army brigadier generals and later as major general in command of the entire Rhode Island militia. Varnum is noted as the founder and commander of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, widely regarded as the first Black battalion in U.S. military history. David Howell, who graduated with an A.M. in 1769, served as a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1782 to 1785.\nPresidents.\nNineteen individuals have served as presidents of the university since its founding in 1764. Since 2012, Christina Hull Paxson has served as president. Paxson had previously served as dean of Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs and chair of Princeton's economics department. Paxson's immediate predecessor, Ruth Simmons, is noted as the first African American president of an Ivy League institution. Other presidents of note include academic, Vartan Gregorian; and philosopher and economist, Francis Wayland.\nNew Curriculum.\nIn 1966, the first Group Independent Study Project (GISP) at Brown was formed, involving 80 students and 15 professors. The GISP was inspired by student-initiated experimental schools, especially San Francisco State College, and sought ways to \"put students at the center of their education\" and \"teach students how to think rather than just teaching facts\".\nMembers of the GISP, Ira Magaziner and Elliot Maxwell published a paper of their findings titled, \"Draft of a Working Paper for Education at Brown University.\" The paper made proposals for a new curriculum, including interdisciplinary freshman-year courses that would introduce \"modes of thought\", with instruction from faculty from different disciplines as well as for an end to letter grades. The following year Magaziner began organizing the student body to press for the reforms, organizing discussions and protests.\nIn 1968, university president Ray Heffner established a Special Committee on Curricular Philosophy. Composed of administrators, the committee was tasked with developing specific reforms and producing recommendations. A report, produced by the committee, was presented to the faculty, which voted the New Curriculum into existence on May 7, 1969. Its key features included:\nThe Modes of Thought course was discontinued early on, but the other elements remain in place. In 2006, the reintroduction of plus/minus grading was proposed in response to concerns regarding grade inflation. The idea was rejected by the College Curriculum Council after canvassing alumni, faculty, and students, including the original authors of the Magaziner-Maxwell Report.\n\"Slavery and Justice\" report.\nIn 2003, then-university president Ruth Simmons launched a steering committee to research Brown's eighteenth-century ties to slavery. In October 2006, the committee released a report documenting its findings.\nTitled \"Slavery and Justice\", the document detailed the ways in which the university benefited both directly and indirectly from the transatlantic slave trade and the labor of enslaved people. The report also included seven recommendations for how the university should address this legacy. Brown has since completed a number of these recommendations including the establishment of its Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice, the construction of its \"Slavery Memorial\", and the funding of a $10 million permanent endowment for Providence Public Schools.\nThe \"Slavery and Justice\" report marked the first major effort by an American university to address its ties to slavery and prompted other institutions to undertake similar processes.\nInteraction with the Trump administration.\nOn July 30, 2025, Brown struck a deal with the Trump administration to restore federal research grant funding, after the administration froze it due to complaints mainly about antisemitism on the campus in the wake of pro-Palestinian protests. This deal included $50 million to be paid over ten years to state workforce development programs, a vow to exclude transgender women from women's spaces, a commitment to combatting antisemitism, and renewed partnership with Israeli institutions, among other items This is the third settlement of its kind from a university to the administration, following Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania.\nFollowing the federal government's offer of compliance with increased restrictions in exchange for preferential treatment in funding decisions, the university's leaders solicited comments from the university community. Once the period for comments concluded, they chose to reject the offer, becoming the second university to do so after Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nCoat of arms.\nBrown's coat of arms was created in 1834. The prior year, president Francis Wayland had commissioned a committee to update the school's original seal to match the name the university had adopted in 1804. Central in the coat of arms is a white escutcheon divided into four sectors by a red cross. Within each sector of the coat of arms lies an open book. Above the shield is a crest consisting of the upper half of a sun in splendor among the clouds atop a red and white torse.\nCampus.\nBrown is the largest institutional landowner in Providence, with properties on College Hill and in the Jewelry District. The university was built contemporaneously with the eighteenth and nineteenth-century precincts surrounding it, making Brown's campus tightly integrated into Providence's urban fabric. Among the noted architects who have shaped Brown's campus are McKim, Mead &amp; White, Philip Johnson, Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Robert A. M. Stern.\nMain campus.\nBrown's main campus, comprises 235 buildings and in the East Side neighborhood of College Hill. The university's central campus sits on a block bounded by Waterman, Prospect, George, and Thayer Streets; newer buildings extend northward, eastward, and southward. Brown's core, historic campus, constructed primary between 1770 and 1926, is defined by three greens: the Front or Quiet Green, the Middle or College Green, and the Ruth J. Simmons Quadrangle (historically known as Lincoln Field). A brick and wrought-iron fence punctuated by decorative gates and arches traces the block's perimeter. This section of campus is primarily Georgian and Richardsonian Romanesque in its architectural character.\nTo the south of the central campus are academic buildings and residential quadrangles, including Wriston, Keeney, and Gregorian quadrangles. Immediately to the east of the campus core sit Sciences Park and Brown's School of Engineering. North of the central campus are performing and visual arts facilities, life sciences labs, and the Pembroke Campus, which houses both dormitories and academic buildings. Facing the western edge of the central campus sit two of the Brown's seven libraries, the John Hay Library and the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library.\nThe university's campus is contiguous with that of the Rhode Island School of Design, which is located immediately to Brown's west, along the slope of College Hill.\nVan Wickle Gates.\nBuilt in 1901, the Van Wickle Gates are a set of wrought iron gates that stand at the western edge of Brown's campus. The larger main gate is flanked by two smaller side gates. At Convocation the central gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students; at Commencement, the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates. A Brown superstition holds that students who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backward is said to cancel the hex.\nJohn Hay Library.\nThe John Hay Library is the second oldest library on campus. Opened in 1910, the library is named for John Hay (class of 1858), private secretary to Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State under William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. The construction of the building was funded in large part by Hay's friend, Andrew Carnegie, who contributed half of the $300,000 cost of construction.\nThe John Hay Library serves as the repository of the university's archives, rare books and manuscripts, and special collections. Noteworthy among the latter are the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection (described as \"the foremost American collection of material devoted to the history and iconography of soldiers and soldiering\"), the Harris Collection of American Poetry and Plays (described as \"the largest and most comprehensive collection of its kind in any research library\"), the Lownes Collection of the History of Science (described as \"one of the three most important private collections of books of science in America\"), and the papers of H. P. Lovecraft. The Hay Library is home to one of the broadest collections of incunabula in the Americas, one of Brown's two Shakespeare First Folios, the manuscript of George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" and three books bound in human skin.\nJohn Carter Brown Library.\nFounded in 1846, the John Carter Brown Library is generally regarded as the world's leading collection of primary historical sources relating to the exploration and colonization of the Americas. While administered and funded separately from the university, the library has been owned by Brown and located on its campus since 1904.\nThe library contains the best preserved of the eleven surviving copies of the Bay Psalm Book\u2014the earliest extant book printed in British North America and the most expensive printed book in the world. Other holdings include a Shakespeare First Folio and the world's largest collection of 16th-century Mexican texts.\nHaffenreffer Museum.\nThe exhibition galleries of the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, Brown's teaching museum, are located in Manning Hall on the campus's main green. Its one million artifacts, available for research and educational purposes, are located at its Collections Research Center in Bristol, Rhode Island. The museum's goal is to inspire creative and critical thinking about culture by fostering an interdisciplinary understanding of the material world. It provides opportunities for faculty and students to work with collections and the public, teaching through objects and programs in classrooms and exhibitions. The museum sponsors lectures and events in all areas of anthropology and also runs an extensive program of outreach to local schools.\nAnnmary Brown Memorial.\nThe Annmary Brown Memorial was constructed from 1903 to 1907 by the politician, Civil War veteran, and book collector General Rush Hawkins, as a mausoleum for his wife, Annmary Brown, a member of the Brown family. In addition to its crypt\u2014the final repository for Brown and Hawkins\u2014the Memorial includes works of art from Hawkins's private collection, including paintings by Angelica Kauffman, Peter Paul Rubens, Gilbert Stuart, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Benjamin West, and Eastman Johnson, among others. His collection of over 450 incunabula was relocated to the John Hay Library in 1990. Today the Memorial is home to Brown's Medieval Studies and Renaissance Studies programs.\nThe Walk.\nThe Walk, a landscaped pedestrian corridor, connects the Pembroke Campus to the main campus. It runs parallel to Thayer Street and serves as a primary axis of campus, extending from Ruth Simmons Quadrangle at its southern terminus to the Meeting Street entrance to the Pembroke Campus at its northern end. The walk is bordered by departmental buildings as well as the Lindemann Performing Arts Center and Granoff Center for the Creative Arts\nThe corridor is home to public art including sculptures by Maya Lin and Tom Friedman.\nPembroke campus.\nThe Women's College in Brown University, known as Pembroke College, was founded in October 1891. Upon its 1971 merger with the College of Brown University, Pembroke's campus was absorbed into the larger Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is bordered by Meeting, Brown, Bowen, and Thayer Streets and sits three blocks north of Brown's central campus. The campus is dominated by brick architecture, largely of the Georgian and Victorian styles. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907), and Metcalf Hall (1919), while the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910). The quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947).\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, originally served as the campus of Bryant University. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to relocate to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown purchased their Providence campus for $5 million. The transaction expanded the Brown campus by and 26 buildings. In 1971, Brown renamed the area East Campus. Today, the area is largely used for dormitories.\nThayer Street runs through Brown's main campus. As a commercial corridor frequented by students, Thayer is comparable to Harvard Square or Berkeley's Telegraph Avenue. Wickenden Street, in the adjacent Fox Point neighborhood, is another commercial street similarly popular among students.\nBuilt in 1925, Brown Stadium\u2014the home of the school's football team\u2014is located approximately a mile and a half northeast of the university's central campus. Marston Boathouse, the home of Brown's crew teams, lies on the Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's sailing teams are based out of the Ted Turner Sailing Pavilion at the Edgewood Yacht Club in adjacent Cranston.\nSince 2011, Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School has been located in Providence's historic Jewelry District, near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, Rhode Island Hospital and the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Other university facilities, including molecular medicine labs and administrative offices, are likewise located in the area.\nBrown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building along the Providence River. Other Brown properties include the Mount Hope Grant in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important Native American site noted as a location of King Philip's War. Brown's Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.\nSustainability.\nBrown has committed to \"minimize its energy use, reduce negative environmental impacts, and promote environmental stewardship.\" Since 2010, the university has required all new buildings meet LEED silver standards. Between 2007 and 2018, Brown reduced its greenhouse emissions by 27 percent; the majority of this reduction is attributable to the university's Thermal Efficiency Project which converted its central heating plant from a steam-powered system to a hot water-powered system.\nIn 2020, Brown announced it had sold 90 percent of its fossil fuel investments as part of a broader divestment from direct investments and managed funds that focus on fossil fuels. In 2021, the university adopted the goal of reducing quantifiable campus emissions by 75 percent by 2025 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2040. Brown is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Brown would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (\"104\") with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (\"25\").\nAcademics.\nThe College.\nFounded in 1764, The college is Brown's oldest school. About 7,200 undergraduate students are enrolled in the college , and 81 concentrations are offered. For the graduating class of 2020, the most popular concentrations were Computer Science, Economics, Biology, History, Applied Mathematics, International Relations, and Political Science. A quarter of Brown undergraduates complete more than one concentration before graduating. If the existing programs do not align with their intended curricular interests, undergraduates may design and pursue independent concentrations.\nAround 35 percent of undergraduates pursue graduate or professional study immediately, 60 percent within 5 years, and 80 percent within 10 years. For the Class of 2009, 56 percent of all undergraduate alumni have since earned graduate degrees. Among undergraduate alumni who go on to receive graduate degrees, the most common degrees earned are J.D. (16%), M.D. (14%), M.A. (14%), M.Sc. (14%), and Ph.D. (11%). The most common institutions from which undergraduate alumni earn graduate degrees are Brown University, Columbia University, and Harvard University.\nThe highest fields of employment for undergraduate alumni ten years after graduation are education and higher education (15%), medicine (9%), business and finance (9%), law (8%), and computing and technology (7%).\nBrown and RISD.\nSince its 1893 relocation to College Hill, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) has bordered Brown to its west. Since 1900, Brown and RISD students have been able to cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD to count towards their Brown degree. The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.\nDual Degree Program.\nAfter several years of discussion between the two institutions and several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008. The Brown|RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 20 of the 725 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2020, for an acceptance rate of 2.7%. The program combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with Brown's academic offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown|RISD joint committee.\nAdmitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum while taking up to three Brown classes. Students spend their second year in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual \"BRDD Exhibition\" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the broader world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.\nMADE Program.\nIn 2020, the two schools announced the establishment of a new joint Master of Arts in Design Engineering program. Abbreviated as MADE, the program intends to combine RISD's programs in industrial design with Brown's programs in engineering. The program is administered through Brown's School of Engineering and RISD's Architecture and Design Division.\nTheatre and playwriting.\nBrown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country. Six Brown graduates have received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama; Alfred Uhry '58, Lynn Nottage '86, Ayad Akhtar '93, Nilo Cruz '94, Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes '04, and Jackie Sibblies Drury MFA '04. In \"American Theater\" magazine's 2009 ranking of the most-produced American plays, Brown graduates occupied four of the top five places\u2014Peter Nachtrieb '97, Rachel Sheinkin '89, Sarah Ruhl '97, and Stephen Karam '02.\nThe undergraduate concentration encompasses programs in theatre history, performance theory, playwriting, dramaturgy, acting, directing, dance, speech, and technical production. Applications for doctoral and master's degree programs are made through the University Graduate School. Master's degrees in acting and directing are pursued in conjunction with the Brown/Trinity Rep MFA program, which partners with the Trinity Repertory Company, a local regional theatre. In January 2025, The Brown/Trinity Rep Master of Fine Arts Programs in Acting and Directing indefinitely paused its new student admissions, effectively ending the program.\nWriting programs.\nWriting at Brown\u2014fiction, non-fiction, poetry, playwriting, screenwriting, electronic writing, mixed media, and the undergraduate writing proficiency requirement\u2014is catered for by various centers and degree programs, and a faculty that has long included nationally and internationally known authors. The undergraduate concentration in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.\nAuthor prizewinners.\nAlumni authors take their degrees across the spectrum of degree concentrations, but a gauge of the strength of writing at Brown is the number of major national writing prizes won. To note only winners since the year 2000: Pulitzer Prize for Fiction-winners Jeffrey Eugenides '82 (2003), Marilynne Robinson '66 (2005), and Andrew Sean Greer '92 (2018); British Orange Prize-winners Marilynne Robinson '66 (2009) and Madeline Miller '00 (2012); Pulitzer Prize for Drama-winners Nilo Cruz '94 (2003), Lynn Nottage '86 (twice, 2009, 2017), Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes '04 (2012), Ayad Akhtar '93 (2013), and Jackie Sibblies Drury MFA '04 (2019); Pulitzer Prize for Biography-winners David Kertzer '69 (2015) and Benjamin Moser '98 (2020); Pulitzer Prize for Journalism-winners James Risen '77 (2006), Gareth Cook '91 (2005), Tony Horwitz '80 (1995), Usha Lee McFarling '89 (2007), David Rohde '90 (1996), Kathryn Schulz '96 (2016), and Alissa J. Rubin '80 (2016); Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction-winner James Forman Jr. '88 (2018); Pulitzer Prize for History-winner Marcia Chatelain PhD '08 (2021); Pulitzer Prize for Criticism-winner Salamishah Tillet MAT '97 (2022); and Pulitzer Prize for Poetry-winner Peter Balakian PhD '80 (2016)\nComputer science.\nBrown began offering computer science courses through the departments of Economics and Applied Mathematics in 1956 when it acquired an IBM machine. Brown added an IBM 650 in January 1958, the only one of its type between Hartford and Boston. In 1960, Brown opened its first dedicated computer building, the Brown University Computing Laboratory. The facility, designed by Philip Johnson, received an IBM 7070 computer the following year. The first undergraduate Computer Science degrees were awarded in 1974. Brown granted computer sciences full Departmental status in 1979. In 2009, IBM and Brown announced the installation of a supercomputer (by teraflops standards), the most powerful in the southeastern New England region.\nIn the 1960s, Andries van Dam, along with Ted Nelson and Bob Wallace invented The Hypertext Editing Systems, HES and FRESS while at Brown. Nelson coined the word \"hypertext\" while Van Dam's students helped originate XML, XSLT, and related Web standards. Among the school's computer science alumni are principal architect of the Classic Mac OS, Andy Hertzfeld; principal architect of the Intel 80386 and Intel 80486 microprocessors, John Crawford; former CEO of Apple, John Sculley; and digital effects programmer Masi Oka. Other alumni include former CS department head at MIT, John Guttag; software-defined networking pioneer Scott Shenker; Workday founder, Aneel Bhusri; MongoDB founder Eliot Horowitz; Figma founders Dylan Field and Evan Wallace (the latter of whom also created esbuild); OpenSea founder Devin Finzer; and Edward D. Lazowska, professor and Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Chair emeritus at the University of Washington.\nBetween 2012 and 2018, the number of concentrators in CS tripled. In 2017, computer science overtook economics as the school's most popular undergraduate concentration.\nApplied mathematics.\nBrown's program in applied mathematics was established in 1941 making it the oldest such program in the United States. The division is highly ranked and regarded nationally. Among the 67 recipients of the Timoshenko Medal, 22 have been affiliated with Brown's applied mathematics division as faculty, researchers, or students.\nThe Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World.\nEstablished in 2004, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World is Brown's interdisciplinary research center for archeology and ancient studies. The institute pursues fieldwork, excavations, regional surveys, and academic study of the archaeology and art of the ancient Mediterranean, Egypt, and Western Asia from the Levant to the Caucasus. The institute has a very active fieldwork profile, with faculty-led excavations and regional surveys presently in Petra (Jordan), Abydos (Egypt), Turkey, Sudan, Italy, Mexico, Guatemala, Montserrat, and Providence.\nThe Joukowsky Institute's faculty includes cross-appointments from the departments of Egyptology, Assyriology, Classics, Anthropology, and History of Art and Architecture. Faculty research and publication areas include Greek and Roman art and architecture, landscape archaeology, urban and religious architecture of the Levant, Roman provincial studies, the Aegean Bronze Age, and the archaeology of the Caucasus. The institute offers visiting teaching appointments and postdoctoral fellowships which have, in recent years, included Near Eastern Archaeology and Art, Classical Archaeology and Art, Islamic Archaeology and Art, and Archaeology and Media Studies.\nEgyptology and Assyriology\nFacing the Joukowsky Institute, across the Front Green, is the Department of Egyptology and Assyriology, formed in 2006 by the merger of Brown's departments of Egyptology and History of Mathematics. It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United States. The curricular focus is on three principal areas: Egyptology, Assyriology, and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisites and include archaeology, languages, history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, literature, and science. Students concentrating in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate-level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.\nThe Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs.\nThe Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, Brown's center for the study of global Issues and public affairs, is one of the leading institutes of its type in the country. The institute occupies facilities designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly and Japanese architect Toshiko Mori. The institute was initially endowed by Thomas Watson Jr. (Class of 1937), former Ambassador to the Soviet Union and longtime president of IBM.\nInstitute faculty and faculty emeritus include Italian prime minister and European Commission president Romano Prodi, Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Chilean president Ricardo Lagos Escobar, Mexican novelist and statesman Carlos Fuentes, Brazilian statesman and United Nations commission head Paulo S\u00e9rgio Pinheiro, Indian foreign minister and ambassador to the United States Nirupama Rao, American diplomat and Dayton Peace Accords author Richard Holbrooke (Class of 1962), and Sergei Khrushchev, editor of the papers of his father Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union.\nThe institute's curricular interest is organized into the principal themes of development, security, and governance\u2014with further focuses on globalization, economic uncertainty, security threats, environmental degradation, and poverty. Six Brown undergraduate concentrations are hosted by the Watson Institute: Development Studies, International and Public Affairs, International Relations, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Middle East Studies, Public Policy, and South Asian Studies. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Master of Public Affairs (M.P.A) Program. The institute also offers postdoctoral, professional development, and global outreach programming. In support of these programs, the institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies Center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its Costs of War Project, first released in 2011 and continuously updated since. The project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.\nThe School of Engineering.\nEstablished in 1847, Brown's engineering program is the oldest in the Ivy League and the third oldest civilian engineering program in the country. In 1916, Brown's departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a single Division of Engineering. In 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.\nEngineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The school is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines\u2014including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities, and the social sciences. The school practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.\nStudent teams have launched two CubeSats with the support of the School of Engineering. Brown Space Engineering developed EQUiSat a 1U satellite, and another interdisciplinary team developed SBUDNIC a 3U satellite.\nIE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program.\nSince 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe, IE Business School in Madrid. This relationship has since strengthened resulting in both institutions offering a dual degree program. In this partnership, Brown provides its traditional coursework while IE provides most of the business-related subjects making a differentiated alternative program to other Ivy League's EMBAs. The cohort typically consists of 25\u201330 EMBA candidates from some 20 countries. Classes are held in Providence, Madrid, Cape Town and Online.\nThe Pembroke Center.\nThe Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women was established at Brown in 1981 by Joan Wallach Scott as an interdisciplinary research center on gender. The center is named for Pembroke College, Brown's former women's college, and is affiliated with Brown's Sarah Doyle Women's Center. The Pembroke Center supports Brown's undergraduate concentration in Gender and Sexuality Studies, post-doctoral research fellowships, the annual Pembroke Seminar, and other academic programs. It also manages various collections, archives, and resources, including the Elizabeth Weed Feminist Theory Papers and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive.\nThe Graduate School.\nBrown introduced graduate courses in the 1870s and granted its first advanced degrees in 1888. The university established a Graduate Department in 1903 and a full Graduate School in 1927.\nWith an enrollment of approximately 2,600 students, the school currently offers 33 and 51 master's and doctoral programs, respectively. The school additionally offers a number of fifth-year master's programs. Overall, admission to the Graduate School is most competitive with an acceptance rate averaging at approximately 9 percent in recent years.\nCarney Institute for Brain Science.\nThe Robert J. &amp; Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science is Brown's cross-departmental neuroscience research institute. The institute's core focus areas include brain-computer interfaces and computational neuroscience; additional areas of focus include research into mechanisms of cell death with the interest of developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.\nThe Carney Institute was founded by John Donoghue in 2009 as the Brown Institute for Brain Science and renamed in 2018 in recognition of a $100 million gift. The donation, one of the largest in the university's history, established the institute as one of the best-endowed university neuroscience programs in the country.\nAlpert Medical School.\nEstablished in 1811, Brown's Alpert Medical School is the fourth oldest medical school in the Ivy League.\nIn 1827, medical instruction was suspended by President Francis Wayland after the program's faculty declined to follow a new policy requiring students to live on campus. The program was reorganized in 1972; the first M.D. degrees from the new Program in Medicine were awarded to a graduating class of 58 students in 1975. In 1991, the school was officially renamed the Brown University School of Medicine, then renamed once more to Brown Medical School in October 2000. In January 2007, entrepreneur and philanthropist Warren Alpert donated $100 million to the school. In recognition of the gift, the school's name was changed to the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.\nIn 2020, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked Brown's medical school the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8%. \"U.S. News\" ranks the school 38th for research and 35th for primary care.\nBrown's medical school is known especially for its eight-year Program in Liberal Medical Education (PLME), an eight-year combined baccalaureate-M.D. medical program. Inaugurated in 1984, the program is one of the most selective and renowned programs of its type in the country, offering admission to only 2% of applicants in 2021.\nSince 1976, the Early Identification Program (EIP) has encouraged Rhode Island residents to pursue careers in medicine by recruiting sophomores from Providence College, Rhode Island College, the University of Rhode Island, and Tougaloo College. In 2004, the school once again began to accept applications from premedical students at other colleges and universities via AMCAS like most other medical schools. The medical school also offers M.D./PhD, M.D./M.P.H. and M.D./M.P.P. dual degree programs.\nSchool of Public Health.\nBrown's School of Public Health grew out of the Alpert Medical School's Department of Community Health and was officially founded in 2013 as an independent school. The school issues undergraduate (A.B., Sc.B.), graduate (M.P.H., Sc.M., A.M.), doctoral (Ph.D.), and dual-degrees (M.P.H./M.P.A., M.D./M.P.H.).\nOnline programs.\nThe Brown University School of Professional Studies currently offers blended learning Executive master's degrees in Healthcare Leadership, Cyber Security, and Science and Technology Leadership. The master's degrees are designed to help students who have a job and life outside of academia to progress in their respective fields. The students meet in Providence every 6\u20137 weeks for a weekly seminar each trimester.\nThe university has also invested in MOOC development starting in 2013, when two courses, \"Archeology's Dirty Little Secrets\" and \"The Fiction of Relationship\", both of which received thousands of students. However, after a year of courses, the university broke its contract with Coursera and revamped its online persona and MOOC development department. By 2017, the university released new courses on edx, two of which were \"The Ethics of Memory\" and \"Artful Medicine: Art's Power to Enrich Patient Care\". In January 2018, Brown published its first \"game-ified\" course called \"Fantastic Places, Unhuman Humans: Exploring Humanity Through Literature\", which featured out-of-platform games to help learners understand materials, as well as a story-line that immerses users into a fictional world to help characters along their journey.\nAdmissions and financial aid.\nUndergraduate.\nUndergraduate admission to Brown University is considered \"most selective\" by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report.\" For the undergraduate class of 2026, Brown received 50,649 applications\u2014the largest applicant pool in the university's history and a 9% increase from the prior year. Of these applicants, 2,560 were admitted for an acceptance rate of 5.0%, the lowest in the university's history.\nIn 2021, the university reported a yield rate of 69%. For the academic year 2019\u201320 the university received 2,030 transfer applications, of which 5.8% were accepted.\nBrown's admissions policy is currently stipulated need-blind for all domestic first-year applicants, but will be extended to international first-year applicants starting with the Class of 2029. In 2017, Brown announced that loans would be eliminated from all undergraduate financial aid awards starting in 2018\u20132019, as part of a new $30 million campaign called the \"Brown Promise\". In 2016\u201317, the university awarded need-based scholarships worth $120.5 million. The average need-based award for the class of 2020 was $47,940.\nGraduate.\nIn 2017, the Graduate School accepted 11% of 9,215 applicants. In 2021, Brown received a record 948 applications for roughly 90 spots in its Master of Public Health Degree.\nIn 2020, \"U.S. News\" ranked Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School the 9th most selective in the country, with an acceptance rate of 2.8 percent.\nRankings.\nBrown University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. For their 2021 rankings, The Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education ranked Brown 5th in the \"Best Colleges 2021\" edition.\nThe \"Forbes\" magazine annual ranking of \"America's Top Colleges 2022\"\u2014which ranked 600 research universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies\u2014ranked Brown 19th overall and 18th among universities.\n\"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked Brown 9th among national universities in its 2023 edition. The 2022 edition also ranked Brown 2nd for undergraduate teaching, 25th in Most Innovative Schools, and 14th in Best Value Schools.\n\"Washington Monthly\" ranked Brown 30th in 2024 among 438 national universities in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.\nIn 2022, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranks Brown 129th globally.\nIn 2014, \"Forbes\" magazine ranked Brown 7th on its list of \"America's Most Entrepreneurial Universities.\" The \"Forbes\" analysis looked at the ratio of \"alumni and students who have identified themselves as founders and business owners on LinkedIn\" and the total number of alumni and students. LinkedIn particularized the \"Forbes\" rankings, placing Brown third (between MIT and Princeton) among \"Best Undergraduate Universities for Software Developers at Startups.\" LinkedIn's methodology involved a career-path examination of \"millions of alumni profiles\" in its membership database.\nIn 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021 the university produced the most Fulbright recipients of any university in the nation. Brown has also produced the 7th most Rhodes Scholars of all colleges and universities in the United States.\nIn 2025 the university ranked 229 of 257 top colleges in free speech rankings by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and \"College Pulse\", after ranking at 69 in 2024 and at 114 in 2022/2023.\nResearch.\nBrown is a member of the Association of American Universities since 1933 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very High Research Activity\". In FY 2017, Brown spent $212.3 million on research and was ranked 103rd in the United States by total R&amp;D expenditure by National Science Foundation. In 2021 Brown's School of Public Health received the 4th most funding in NIH awards among schools of public health in the U.S.\nStudent life.\nSpring weekend.\nEstablished in 1950, Spring Weekend is an annual spring music festival for students.

More recent headliners include Kendrick Lamar, Young Thug, Daniel Caesar, Anderson .Paak, Mitski, Amin\u00e9, and Mac DeMarco. Since 1960, Spring Weekend has been organized by the student-run Brown Concert Agency.\nResidential and Greek societies.\nApproximately 12 percent of Brown students participate in Greek Life. The university recognizes thirteen active Greek organizations. Since the early 1950s, all Greek organizations on campus have been located in Wriston Quadrangle.\nSocieties and clubs.\nThe earliest societies at Brown were devoted to oration and debate. The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of Solomon Drowne, class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. The organization seems to have disappeared during the American Revolutionary War. Subsequent societies include the Misokosmian Society (est. 1798 and renamed the Philermenian Society), the Philandrian Society (est. 1799), the United Brothers (1806), the Philophysian Society (1818), and the Franklin Society (1824). Societies served social as well as academic purposes, with many supporting literary debate and amassing large libraries. Older societies generally aligned with Federalists while younger societies generally leaned Republican.\nSocieties remained popular into the 1860s, after which they were largely replaced by fraternities.\nThe Cammarian Club was at first a semi-secret society that \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the club served as the \"de facto\" undergraduate student government. The organization was dissolved in 1971 and ultimately succeeded by a formal student government.\nSocietas Domi Pacificae, known colloquially as \"Pacifica House\", is a present-day, self-described secret society. It purports a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century.\nStudent organizations.\nThere are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests. The Student Activities Fair, during the orientation program, provides first-year students the opportunity to become acquainted with a wide range of organizations. A sample of organizations includes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLGBTQ+.\nIn 2023, 38% of Brown's students identified as being LGBTQ+, in a poll by \"The Brown Daily Herald\". The 2023 LGBTQ+ self-identification level was an increase, up from 14% LGBT identification in 2010. \"Bisexual\" was the most common answer amongst LGBTQ+ respondents to the poll.\nResource centers.\nBrown has several resource centers on campus. The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some provide academic support as well.\nThe Brown Center for Students of Color (BCSC) is a space that provides support for students of color. Established in 1972 at the demand of student protests, the BCSC encourages students to engage in critical dialogue, develop leadership skills, and promote social justice. The center houses various programs for students to share their knowledge and engage in discussion. Programs include the Third World Transition Program, the Minority Peer Counselor Program, the Heritage Series, and other student-led initiatives. Additionally, the BCSC hopes to foster community among the students it serves by providing spaces for students to meet and study.\nThe Sarah Doyle Women's Center aims to provide a space for members of the Brown community to examine and explore issues surrounding gender. The center was named after one of the first women to attend Brown, Sarah Doyle. The center emphasizes intersectionality in its conversations on gender, encouraging people to see gender as present and relevant in various aspects of life. The center hosts programs and workshops in order to facilitate dialogue and provide resources for students, faculty, and staff.\nOther centers include the LGBTQ Center, the Undocumented, First-Generation College and Low-Income Student (U-FLi) Center, and the Curricular Resource Center.\nActivism.\n1968 Black Student Walkout.\nOn December 5, 1968, several Black women from Pembroke College initiated a walkout in protest of an atmosphere at the colleges described by Black students as a \"stifling, frustrating, [and] degrading place for Black students\" after feeling the colleges were non-responsive to their concerns. In total, 65 Black students participated in the walkout. Their principal demand was to increase Black student enrollment to 11% of the student populace, in an attempt to match that of the proportion in the US. This ultimately resulted in a 300% increase in Black enrollment the following year, but some demands have yet to be met.\nRape lists.\nIn the 1990s, walls in womens' bathrooms in the John D. Rockefeller Jr. Library were used to graffiti names of alleged male rapists. The practice caused the school to re-evaluate how it handles sexual misbehaviour on campus.\nDivestment from South Africa.\nIn the mid-1980s, under student pressure, the university divested from certain companies involved in South Africa. Some students were still unsatisfied with partial divestment and began a fast in Manning Chapel and the university disenrolled them. In April 1987, \"dozens\" of students interrupted a university corporation meeting, leading to 20 being put on probation.\nProtest of speech by NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly.\nIn 2013, students and Providence community members protested and disrupted a speech by then-NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The incident was cited by Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, as a high-profile example of a form of student protest questioning conceptions of free speech. The incident was also the subject of a short critical documentary in 2016 by Brown alumnus Rob Montz.\nIsrael-Gaza protests.\nIn early November 2023, twenty students of Jewish background affiliated with the campus group \"Jews for Ceasefire Now\" (later renamed \"Jews for Palestinian Liberation\") staged a sit in at University Hall, resulting in their arrests by order of the University administration. The students were protesting the Gaza genocide and calling for a ceasefire, as well as for the university to divest from companies that \"facilitate the 'Israeli military occupation' in Gaza.\" A few weeks later, the campus was rocked by the shooting of an undergraduate student from Palestine, Hisham Awartani, while he was visiting family in Vermont. In the wake of the shooting, in early December 2023, forty-one more students held a sit-in with similar demands which resulted in additional arrests by the University. The following semester, as the administration continued to press charges on the forty-one sit-in participants, nineteen students participated in an eight-day hunger strike preceding a corporation meeting with the demand to present their case to corporation members. During the wave of pro-Palestine university protests in the spring of that year, Brown University students erected a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" on the University's Main Green, which involved over 80 students and stood for a week before negotiations between the protestors and the Brown administration brought the standoff to a close, resulting in a large number of students being put on probations of various lengths. In October 2024, the corporation held an early vote on the issue of divestment, rejecting the proposal in an 8-2 vote. Following a University investigation into student protests resulting from this decision, the University suspended the Students for Justice in Palestine chapter at Brown. \nAthletics.\nBrown is a member of the Ivy League athletic conference, which is categorized as a Division I (top-level) conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\nThe Brown Bears has one of the largest university sports programs in the United States, sponsoring 32 varsity intercollegiate teams. Brown's athletic program is one of the \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" top 20\u2014the \"College Sports Honor Roll\"\u2014based on breadth of the program and athletes' graduation rates. \nBrown's newest varsity team is women's rugby, promoted from club-sport status in 2014.

Atkinson worked at Apple Computer from 1978 to 1990. Some of Atkinson's noteworthy contributions to the field of computing include Macintosh QuickDraw and Lisa LisaGraf (Atkinson independently discovered the midpoint circle algorithm for fast drawing of circles by using the sum of consecutive odd numbers), marching ants, the menu bar, the selection lasso, MacPaint (FatBits), HyperCard, Atkinson dithering, and the PhotoCard application program.\nEarly life and education.\nAtkinson was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, on March 17, 1951. He grew up in Los Gatos, California, the third child of seven born to anesthesiologist John Atkinson and obstetrician Ethel Dana Atkinson. He had two brothers and four sisters. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of California, San Diego, where Jef Raskin, who would go on to develop the Apple Macintosh, was one of his professors. Atkinson continued his studies as a graduate student in neurochemistry at the University of Washington.\nApple.\nRaskin invited Atkinson to visit him at Apple Computer; Steve Jobs persuaded him to join the company immediately as employee No. 51, and Atkinson never finished his PhD. Atkinson was the principal designer and developer of the graphical user interface (GUI) of the Apple Lisa and, later, one of the first thirty members of the original Apple Macintosh development team, and was the creator of the MacPaint application. He also designed and implemented QuickDraw, the fundamental toolbox that the Lisa and Macintosh used for graphics. QuickDraw's performance was essential for the success of the Macintosh GUI. He also was one of the main designers of the Lisa and Macintosh user interfaces. Atkinson also conceived, designed and implemented HyperCard, an early and influential hypermedia system. HyperCard put the power of computer programming and database design into the hands of non-programmers. In 1994, Atkinson received the EFF Pioneer Award for his contributions.\nCareer after Apple.\nIn 1990, Atkinson and two others co-founded Apple spin-off General Magic. \"Byte\" magazine wrote:\nThe obstacles to General Magic's success may appear daunting, but General Magic is not your typical start-up company. Its partners include some of the biggest players in the worlds of computing, communications, and consumer electronics, and it's loaded with top-notch engineers who have been given a clean slate to reinvent traditional approaches to ubiquitous worldwide communications.\nIn 2007, Atkinson began working as an outside developer with Numenta, a startup working on computer intelligence. On his work there Atkinson said, \"what Numenta is doing is more fundamentally important to society than the personal computer and the rise of the Internet.\"\nPhotography.\nAtkinson later worked as a nature photographer, focusing on close-up photographs of stones that had been cut and polished. His 2004 book \"Within the Stone\" features a collection of his close-up photographs. The detailed images he created were made possible by the accuracy and creative control of the digital printing process that he helped create. He developed a mobile app called PhotoCard that would allow users to take digital images and make postcards with personal messages that could then be printed and sent via postal service or over email.\nPersonal life and death.\nAtkinson was married three times and had two daughters, a stepson, and a stepdaughter. He died from pancreatic cancer in Portola Valley, California, on June 5, 2025, at the age of 74.\nIn popular culture.\nActor Nelson Franklin portrayed him in the 2013 film \"Jobs\" that covered the early days of Apple under Steve Jobs. The film had drawn criticism for its take on the environment at the company. Atkinson's co-worker Bill Fernandez did not see the film, saying \"It seems to me that there\u2019s a lot of fan fiction about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs, and I think that this is the biggest, flashiest piece of fan fiction that there\u2019s been to date.\""}

A Royalist army led by Charles I of England defeated a Parliamentarian force commanded by the Earl of Essex.\nAlthough Essex and most of the cavalry escaped, between 5,000 and 6,000 Parliamentarian infantry were forced to surrender. Since the Royalists were unable to feed so many, they were given a pass back to their own territory, arriving in Southampton a month later having lost nearly half their number to disease and desertion.\nConsidered one of the worst defeats suffered by Parliament over the course of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, it secured South West England for the Royalists until early 1646.\nBackground.\nDuring April and May 1644, Parliamentarian commanders Sir William Waller and the Earl of Essex combined their armies and carried out a campaign against King Charles and the Royalist garrisons surrounding Oxford. Trusting Waller to deal with the King in Oxfordshire, Essex divided the Parliamentarian army on 6 June and headed southwest to relieve the Royalist siege of Lyme in Dorset. Lyme had been under siege by King Charles' nephew, Prince Maurice, and the Royalists for nearly two months.\nSouth-West England at that time was largely under the control of the Royalists. The town of Lyme, however, was a Parliamentarian stronghold and served as an important seaport for the Parliamentarian fleet of the Earl of Warwick. As Essex approached Lyme in mid-June Prince Maurice ended the siege and took his troops west to Exeter.\nEssex then proceeded further southwest toward Cornwall with the intent to relieve the siege of Plymouth. Plymouth was the only other significant Parliamentarian stronghold in the South-West and it was under siege by Richard Grenville and Cornish Royalists. Essex had been told by Lord Robartes, a wealthy politician and merchant from Cornwall, that the Parliamentarians would gain considerable military support if he moved against Grenville and freed Plymouth. Given Lord Robartes' advice, Essex advanced toward Plymouth. His action caused Grenville to end the siege. Essex then advanced further west, believing that he could take full control of the South-West from the Royalists.\nMeanwhile, in Oxfordshire, King Charles battled with the Parliamentarians and defeated Sir William Waller at the Battle of Cropredy Bridge on 29 June. On 12 July after a Royalist council of war recommended that Essex be dealt with before he could be reinforced, King Charles and his Oxford army departed Evesham. King Charles accepted the council's advice, not solely because it was good strategy, but more so because his Queen was in Exeter, where she had recently given birth to the Princess Henrietta and had been denied safe conduct to Bath by Essex.\nTrapped in Cornwall.\nOn 26 July, King Charles arrived in Exeter and joined his Oxford army with the Royalist forces commanded by Prince Maurice. On that same day, Essex and his Parliamentary force entered Cornwall. One week later, as Essex bivouacked with his army at Bodmin, he learned that King Charles had defeated Waller; brought his Oxford army to the South-West; and joined forces with Prince Maurice. Essex had also seen that he was not getting the military support from the people of Cornwall as Lord Robartes asserted. At that time, Essex understood that he and his army were trapped in Cornwall and his only salvation would be reinforcements or an escape through the port of Fowey by means of the Parliamentarian fleet.\nEssex immediately marched his troops five miles south to the small town of Lostwithiel arriving on 2 August. He immediately deployed his men in a defensive arc with detachments on the high ground to the north at Restormel Castle and the high ground to the east at Beacon Hill. Essex also sent a small contingent of foot south to secure the port of Fowey aiming to eventually evacuate his infantry by sea. At Essex's disposal was a force of 6,500 foot and 3,000 horse.\nAided through intelligence provided by the people of Cornwall , King Charles followed westward, slowly and deliberately cutting off the potential escape routes that Essex might attempt to utilize. On 6 August King Charles communicated with Essex, calling for him to surrender. Stalling for several days, Essex considered the offer but ultimately refused.\nOn 11 August, Grenville and the Cornish Royalists entered Bodmin forcing out Essex's rear-guard cavalry. Grenville then proceeded south across Respryn Bridge to meet and join forces with King Charles and Prince Maurice. It is estimated that the Royalist forces at that time were composed of 12,000 foot and 7,000 horse. Over the next two days the Royalists deployed detachments along the east side of the River Fowey to prevent a Parliamentarian escape across country. Finally the Royalists sent 200 foot with artillery south to garrison the fort at Polruan, effectively blocking the entrance to the harbour of Fowey. At about that time, Essex learned that reinforcements under the command of Sir John Middleton were turned back by the Royalists at Bridgwater in Somerset.\nFirst battle - 21\u201330 August 1644.\nAt 07:00 hours on 21 August, King Charles launched his first attack on Essex and the Parliamentarians at Lostwithiel. From the north, Grenville and the Cornish Royalists attacked Restormel Castle and easily dislodged the Parliamentarians who fell back quickly. From the east, King Charles and the Oxford army captured Beacon Hill with little resistance from the Parliamentarians. Prince Maurice and his force occupied Druid Hill. Casualties were fairly low and by nightfall the fighting ended and the Royalists held the high ground on the north and east sides of Lostwithiel.\nFor the next couple of days the two opposing forces exchanged fire only in a number of small skirmishes. On 24 August, King Charles further tightened the noose encircling the Parliamentarians when he sent Lord Goring and Sir Thomas Bassett to secure the town of St Blazey and the area to the southwest of Lostwithiel. This reduced the foraging area for the Parliamentarians and access to the coves and inlets in the vicinity of the port of Par.\nEssex and the Parliamentarians were now totally surrounded and boxed into a two-mile by five-mile area spanning from Lostwithiel in the north to the port of Fowey in the south. Knowing that he would not be able to fight his way out, Essex made his final plans for an escape. Since a sea evacuation of his cavalry would not be possible, Essex ordered his cavalry commander William Balfour to attempt a breakout to Plymouth. For the infantry, Essex planned to retreat south and meet Lord Warwick and the Parliamentarian fleet at Fowey. At 03:00 hours on 31 August, Balfour and 2,000 members of his cavalry executed the first step of Essex's plan when they successfully crossed the River Fowey and escaped intact without engaging the Royalist defenders.\nSecond battle - 31 August - 2 September 1644.\nEarly on the morning on 31 August, the Parliamentarians ransacked and looted Lostwithiel and began their withdrawal south. At 07:00 hours, the Royalists observed the actions of the Parliamentarians and immediately proceeded to attack. Grenville attacked from the north. King Charles and Prince Maurice crossed the River Fowey, joined up with Grenville, and entered Lostwithiel. Together the Royalists engaged the Parliamentarian rear-guards and quickly took possession of the town. The Royalist also sent detachments down along the east side of the River Fowey to protect against any further breakouts and to capture the town of Polruan.\nThe Royalists then began to pursue Essex and the Parliamentarian infantry down the river valley. At the outset the Royalists pushed the Parliamentarians nearly three miles south through the hedged fields, hills and valleys. At the narrow pass near St. Veep, Philip Skippon, Essex's commander of the infantry, counter-attacked the Royalists and pushed them back several fields attempting to give Essex time to set up a line of defense further south. At 11:00 hours, the Royalist cavalry mounted a charge and won back the territory lost. There was a lull in the battle at 12:00 hours as King Charles waited for his full army to come up and reform.\nThe fighting resumed and continued through the afternoon as the Parliamentarians tried to disengage and continue south. At 16:00 hours, the Parliamentarians tried again to counter-attack with their remaining cavalry only to be driven back by King Charles' Life Guard. About a mile north of Castle Dore, the Parliamentarians right flank began to give way. At 18:00 hours when the Parliamentarians were pushed back to Castle Dore they made their last attempt to rally only to be pushed back and surrounded.\nAbout that time the fighting ended with the Royalists satisfied in their accomplishments of the day. Exhausted and discouraged, the Parliamentarians hunkered down for the night. Later that evening under the darkness of night, Essex and his command staff stole away to the seashore where they used a fishing boat to flee to Plymouth, leaving Skippon in command.\nEarly on 1 September, Skippon met with his officers to inform them about Essex's escape and to discuss alternatives. It was decided that they would approach King Charles and seek terms. Concerned that Parliamentarian reinforcements might be on their way, the King quickly agreed on 2 September to generous terms. The battle was over. Six thousand Parliamentarians were taken as prisoners. Their weapons were taken away and they were marched to Southampton. They suffered the wrath of the Cornish people in route and as many as 3,000 died of exposure and disease along the way. Those that survived the journey were, however, eventually set free. Total casualties associated with the battle were extremely high especially when considering those who died on the march back to Southampton. To those numbers as many as 700 Parliamentarians are estimated to have been killed or wounded during the fighting in Cornwall along with an estimated 500 Royalists.\nAftermath.\nThe Battle of Lostwithiel was a great victory for King Charles and the greatest loss that the Parliamentarians would suffer in the First English Civil War. For King Charles the victory secured the South-West for the remainder of the war and mitigated criticism for a while against the Royalist war effort.\nFor the Parliamentarians, the defeat resulted in recriminations with Middleton ultimately being blamed for his failure to break through with reinforcements. The Parliamentarian failure at Lostwithiel along with the failure to defeat King Charles at the Second Battle of Newbury ultimately led Parliament to adopt the Self-denying Ordinance and led to the implementation of the New Model Army.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He influenced mathematics, logic, set theory, and various areas of analytic philosophy.\nHe was one of the early 20th century's prominent logicians and a founder of analytic philosophy, along with his predecessor Gottlob Frege, his friend and colleague G. E. Moore, and his student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ludwig Wittgenstein. Russell with Moore led the British \"revolt against idealism\". Together with his former teacher Alfred North Whitehead, Russell wrote \"Principia Mathematica\", a milestone in the development of classical logic and a major attempt to reduce the whole of mathematics to logic (see logicism). Russell's article \"On Denoting\" has been considered a \"paradigm of philosophy\".\nRussell was educated at Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, where he graduated in 1893. He was a pacifist who championed anti-imperialism and chaired the India League. He went to prison for his pacifism during the First World War, and he initially supported appeasing Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, before changing his view in 1943, describing war as a necessary \"lesser of two evils\". In the wake of the Second World War, he welcomed American global hegemony in preference to either Soviet hegemony or no (or ineffective) world leadership, even if it were to come at the cost of using their nuclear weapons. He would later criticise Stalinist totalitarianism, condemn the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, and become an outspoken proponent of nuclear disarmament.\nIn 1950 Russell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought\". He was also the recipient of the De Morgan Medal (1932), Sylvester Medal (1934), Kalinga Prize (1957), and Jerusalem Prize (1963).\nBiography.\nEarly life and background.\nBertrand Arthur William Russell was born at Ravenscroft, a country house in Trellech, Monmouthshire, on 18 May 1872, into an influential and liberal family of the British aristocracy. His parents were Viscount and Viscountess Amberley. Both were early advocates of birth control at a time when this was considered scandalous. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist Douglas Spalding. Lord Amberley, a deist, asked the philosopher John Stuart Mill to act as Russell's secular godfather. Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings later influenced Russell's life.\nRussell's paternal grandfather, Lord John Russell, later 1st Earl Russell, had twice been Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the 1840s and 1860s. A member of Parliament since the early 1810s, he met Napoleon in Elba. The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the peerage with the rise of the Tudor dynasty (see: Duke of Bedford). They established themselves as one of the leading Whig families and participated in political events from the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536\u20131540 to the Glorious Revolution in 1688\u20131689 and the Great Reform Act in 1832.\nLady Amberley was the daughter of Lord and Lady Stanley of Alderley. Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother, one of the campaigners for education of women.\nChildhood and adolescence.\nRussell had two siblings: brother Frank (seven years older), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of diphtheria, followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of bronchitis after a long period of depression.14 Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of paternal grandparents, who lived at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park. His grandfather, former Prime Minister Earl Russell, died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kind old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the Countess Russell (n\u00e9e Lady Frances Elliot), was the central family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth. The Countess was from a Scottish Presbyterian family and petitioned the Court of Chancery to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting Darwinism and supporting Irish Home Rule), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on social justice and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life.\nRussell's adolescence was lonely and he contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his interests in \"nature and books and (later) mathematics saved me from complete despondency;\" only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide. He was educated at home by a series of tutors. When Russell was eleven, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of Euclid, which he described in his autobiography as \"one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love\".\nDuring these formative years, he also discovered the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley. Russell wrote: \"I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy.\" Russell said that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of Christian religious dogma, which he found unconvincing. At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no free will and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading Mill's \"Autobiography\", he abandoned the \"First Cause\" argument and became an atheist.\nHe travelled to the continent in 1890 with an American friend, Edward FitzGerald, and with FitzGerald's family he visited the Paris Exhibition of 1889 and climbed the Eiffel Tower soon after it was completed.\nEducation.\nRussell won a scholarship to read for the Mathematical Tripos at Trinity College, Cambridge, and began his studies there in 1890, taking as coach Robert Rumsey Webb. He became acquainted with the younger George Edward Moore and came under the influence of Alfred North Whitehead, who recommended him to the Cambridge Apostles. He distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh Wrangler in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.\nEarly career.\nRussell began his published work in 1896 with \"German Social Democracy\", a study in politics that was an early indication of his interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the London School of Economics. He was a member of the Coefficients dining club of social reformers set up in 1902 by the Fabian campaigners Sidney and Beatrice Webb.\nHe now started a study of the foundations of mathematics at Trinity. In 1897, he wrote \"An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry\" (submitted at the Fellowship Examination of Trinity College) which discussed the Cayley\u2013Klein metrics used for non-Euclidean geometry. He attended the first International Congress of Philosophy in Paris in 1900 where he met Giuseppe Peano and Alessandro Padoa. The Italians had responded to Georg Cantor, making a science of set theory; they gave Russell their literature including the \"Formulario mathematico\". Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon Russell's paradox. In 1903 he published \"The Principles of Mathematics\", a work on the foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of logicism, that mathematics and logic are one and the same.\nAt the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a \"sort of mystic illumination\", after witnessing Whitehead's wife's suffering in an angina attack. \"I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty and with a desire almost as profound as that of the Buddha to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable\", Russell would later recall. \"At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person.\"\nIn 1905, he wrote the essay \"On Denoting\", which was published in the philosophical journal \"Mind\". Russell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908. The three-volume \"Principia Mathematica\", written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier \"The Principles of Mathematics\", soon made Russell world-famous in his field. Russell's first political activity was as the Independent Liberal candidate in the 1907 by-election for the Wimbledon constituency, where he was not elected.\nIn 1910, he became a lecturer at the University of Cambridge, Trinity College, where he had studied. He was considered for a fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was \"anti-clerical\", because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student Ludwig Wittgenstein, who started undergraduate study with him. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various phobias and his bouts of despair. This was a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" in 1922. Russell delivered his lectures on logical atomism, his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of World War I.\nFirst World War.\nDuring World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active pacifist activities. In 1916, due to his absence of allegiance to the war effort, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914. He later described this, in \"Free Thought and Official Propaganda\", as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression. Russell championed the case of Eric Chappelow, a poet jailed and abused as a conscientious objector. Russell played a part in the \"Leeds Convention\" in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand \"anti-war socialists\" gather; many being delegates from the Independent Labour Party and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement. The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour Members of Parliament (MPs), including Ramsay MacDonald and Philip Snowden, as well as former Liberal MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor Arnold Lupton. After the event, Russell told Lady Ottoline Morrell that, \"to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody\".\nHis conviction in 1916 resulted in Russell being fined \u00a3100 (), which he refused to pay in the hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the King James Bible that was stamped \"Confiscated by Cambridge Police\".\nA later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the United States to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in Brixton Prison (see \"Bertrand Russell's political views\") in 1918 (he was prosecuted under the Defence of the Realm Act). He later said of his imprisonment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I found prison in many ways quite agreeable. I had no engagements, no difficult decisions to make, no fear of callers, no interruptions to my work. I read enormously; I wrote a book, \"Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy\"... and began the work for \"The Analysis of Mind\". I was rather interested in my fellow-prisoners, who seemed to me in no way morally inferior to the rest of the population, though they were on the whole slightly below the usual level of intelligence as was shown by their having been caught.\nWhile he was reading Strachey's \"Eminent Victorians\" chapter about Gordon he laughed out loud in his cell prompting the warder to intervene and reminding him that \"prison was a place of punishment\".\nRussell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer in 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.\nIn 1924, Russell again gained press attention when attending a \"banquet\" in the House of Commons with well-known campaigners, including Arnold Lupton, who had been an MP and had also endured imprisonment for \"passive resistance to military or naval service\".\nG. H. Hardy on the Trinity controversy.\nIn 1941, G. H. Hardy wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled \"Bertrand Russell and Trinity\" (published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by C. D. Broad) in which he gave an authoritative account of Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing in October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one-year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.\nThe reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it since this would have been an \"unusual application\" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered with Russell's resignation since the 'world of learning' knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the \"Tarner Lectures\" on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best-received books according to Hardy: \"The Analysis of Matter\", published in 1927. In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBetween the wars.\nIn August 1920, Russell travelled to Soviet Russia as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the Russian Revolution. He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled \"Soviet Russia\u20141920\", for the magazine \"The Nation\". He met Vladimir Lenin and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an \"impish cruelty\" in him and comparing him to \"an opinionated professor\". He cruised down the Volga on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He subsequently wrote a book, \"The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism\", about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the Soviet regime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he had heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure that these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.\nRussell's lover Dora Black, a British author, feminist and socialist campaigner, visited Soviet Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.\nThe following year, Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited Peking (Beijing) to lecture on philosophy for a year. He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as then being on a new path. Other scholars present in China at the time included John Dewey and Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian Nobel-laureate poet. Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with pneumonia, and incorrect reports of his death were published in the Japanese press. When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading \"Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists\". Apparently they found this harsh and reacted resentfully. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of physics, ethics, and education to the layman.\nFrom 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and Cornwall, spending summers in Porthcurno. In the 1922 and 1923 general elections Russell stood as a Labour Party candidate in the Chelsea constituency, but only on the basis that he knew he was unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was unsuccessful on both occasions.\nAfter the birth of his two children, he became interested in education, especially early childhood education. He was not satisfied with the old traditional education and thought that progressive education also had some flaws; as a result, together with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near Harting, West Sussex. During this time, he published \"On Education, Especially in Early Childhood\". On 8 July 1930, Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.\nIn 1927 Russell met Barry Fox (later Barry Stevens), who became a known Gestalt therapist and writer in her later years. They developed an intense relationship, and in Fox's words: \"...for three years we were very close.\" Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School. From 1927 to 1932 Russell wrote 34 letters to Fox. Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.\nRussell's marriage to Dora grew tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry. They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an Oxford undergraduate named Patricia (\"Peter\") Spence, who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell, 5th Earl Russell, who became a historian and one of the leading figures in the Liberal Democrat party.\nRussell returned in 1937 to the London School of Economics to lecture on the science of power. During the 1930s, Russell became a friend and collaborator of V. K. Krishna Menon, then President of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian independence. Russell chaired the India League from 1932 to 1939.\nSecond World War.\nRussell's political views changed over time, mostly about war. He opposed rearmament against Nazi Germany. In 1937, he wrote in a personal letter: \"If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister.\" In 1940, he changed his appeasement view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare called \"relative political pacifism\": \"War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils.\"\nBefore World War II, Russell taught at the University of Chicago, later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the UCLA Department of Philosophy. He was appointed professor at the City College of New York (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him \"morally unfit\" to teach at the college because of his opinions, especially those relating to sexual morality, detailed in \"Marriage and Morals\" (1929). The matter was taken to the New York Supreme Court by Jean Kay who was afraid that her daughter would be harmed by the appointment, though her daughter was not a student at CCNY. Many intellectuals, led by John Dewey, protested at his treatment. Albert Einstein's oft-quoted aphorism that \"great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds\" originated in his open letter, dated 19 March 1940, to Morris Raphael Cohen, a professor emeritus at CCNY, supporting Russell's appointment. Dewey and Horace M. Kallen edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in \"The Bertrand Russell Case\". Russell soon joined the Barnes Foundation, lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of \"A History of Western Philosophy\". His relationship with the eccentric Albert C. Barnes soon soured, and he returned to the UK in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.\nLater life.\nRussell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly \"The Brains Trust\" and for the Third Programme, on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was known outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in Trondheim, Russell was one of 24 survivors (out of 43 passengers) of an aeroplane crash in Hommelvik in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane. \"A History of Western Philosophy\" (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.\nIn 1942, Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles. In an inquiry on dialectical materialism, launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher Wolfgang Paalen in his journal \"DYN\", Russell said: \"I think the metaphysics of both Hegel and Marx plain nonsense\u2014Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than Mary Baker Eddy's. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism.\"\nIn 1943, Russell expressed support for Zionism: \"I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to Jews to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture\".\nIn a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the USSR's aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an atomic bomb than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atomic bombs on both sides. At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a first strike in a war with the USSR, including Nigel Lawson, who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.\nJust after the atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did. In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that the USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practised in the Soviet Union. After it became known that the USSR had carried out its nuclear bomb tests, Russell declared his position advocating the total abolition of atomic weapons.\nIn 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural Reith Lectures\u2014what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled \"Authority and the Individual\", explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to \"Words and Things\" by Ernest Gellner, which was highly critical of the later thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein and of ordinary language philosophy. Gilbert Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal \"Mind\", which caused Russell to respond via \"The Times\". The result was a month-long correspondence in \"The Times\" between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.\nIn the King's Birthday Honours of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the Order of Merit, and the following year he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. When he was given the Order of Merit, George VI was affable but embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, \"You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted\". Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply \"That's right, just like your brother\" immediately came to mind.\nIn 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the Congress for Cultural Freedom, a CIA-funded anti-communist organisation committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the Cold War. Russell was one of the known patrons of the Congress until he resigned in 1956.\nIn 1952, Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother). Russell married his fourth wife, Edith Finch, soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend Lucy Donnelly. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from mental illness, which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.\nIn 1962 Russell played a public role in the Cuban Missile Crisis: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless. Russell sent this telegram to President Kennedy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;YOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR... END THIS MADNESS.\nAccording to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's assassination, Russell, \"prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer Mark Lane in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a 'Who Killed Kennedy committee' in June 1964, members of which included Michael Foot MP, Caroline Benn\n(wife of Tony Benn MP), the publisher Victor Gollancz, the writers John Arden and J. B. Priestley, and the Oxford history professor Hugh Trevor-Roper.\" Russell published a highly critical article in \"The Minority of One\" weeks before the Warren Commission report was published, setting forth \"16 Questions on the Assassination.\" Russell equated the Oswald case with the Dreyfus affair of late 19th-century France, in which the state convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.\nPolitical causes.\nBertrand Russell was opposed to war from a young age; his opposition to World War I was used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted fellow status which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.\nHe later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in Free Thought and Official Propaganda, where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously \"bad\", must be protected not only from direct State intervention but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRussell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to nuclear disarmament and opposing the Vietnam War. The 1955 Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time. In October 1960 \"The Committee of 100\" was formed with a declaration by Russell and Michael Scott, entitled \"Act or Perish\", which called for a \"movement of nonviolent resistance to nuclear war and weapons of mass destruction\". In September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in Brixton Prison for a \"breach of the peace\" after taking part in an anti-nuclear demonstration in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to \"good behaviour\", to which Russell replied: \"No, I won't.\"\nFrom 1966 to 1967, Russell worked with Jean-Paul Sartre and many other intellectual figures to form the Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam. He wrote many letters to world leaders during this period.\nEarly in his life, Russell supported eugenicist policies. In 1894, he proposed that the state issue certificates of health to prospective parents and withhold public benefits from those considered unfit. In 1929, he wrote that people deemed \"mentally defective\" and \"feebleminded\" should be sexually sterilised because they \"are apt to have enormous numbers of illegitimate children, all, as a rule, wholly useless to the community.\" Russell was also an advocate of population control:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The nations which at present increase rapidly should be encouraged to adopt the methods by which, in the West, the increase of population has been checked. Educational propaganda, with government help, could achieve this result in a generation. There are, however, two powerful forces opposed to such a policy: one is religion, the other is nationalism. I think it is the duty of all to proclaim that opposition to the spread of birth is appalling depth of misery and degradation, and that within another fifty years or so. I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing. There are others, which, one must suppose, opponents of birth control would prefer. War, as I remarked a moment ago, has hitherto been disappointing in this respect, but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective. If a Black Death could be spread throughout the whole world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.\nOn 20 November 1948, in a public speech at Westminster School, addressing a gathering arranged by the New Commonwealth, Russell shocked some observers by suggesting that a preemptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union was justified. Russell argued that war between the United States and the Soviet Union seemed inevitable, so it would be a humanitarian gesture to get it over with quickly and have the United States in the dominant position. Currently, Russell argued, humanity could survive such a war, whereas a full nuclear war after both sides had manufactured large stockpiles of more destructive weapons was likely to result in the extinction of the human race. Russell later relented from this stance, instead arguing for mutual disarmament by the nuclear powers.\nIn 1956, before and during the Suez Crisis, Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for an effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty in places such as the Suez Canal area \"where general interest is involved\". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the Hungarian Revolution and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets \"because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating\". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which Michael Polanyi had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had entered Budapest.\nIn November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, urging a summit to consider \"the conditions of co-existence\". Khrushchev responded that peace could be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in \"The Observer\", proposing a cessation of all nuclear weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear weapons programme if necessary, and with Germany \"freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West\". US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as \"The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles\".\nRussell was asked by \"The New Republic\", a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear weapons testing and flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all hydrogen bombs, with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the Oder-Neisse line as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing Arab nationalism, and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the People's Republic of China, and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council.\nHe was in contact with Lionel Rogosin while the latter was filming his anti-war film \"Good Times, Wonderful Times\" in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the New Left. In early 1963, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the Vietnam War, and felt that the US government's policies there were near-genocidal. In 1963, he became the inaugural recipient of the Jerusalem Prize, an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society. In 1964, he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the Arab countries to accept an arms embargo and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry. In October 1965, he tore up his Labour Party card because he suspected Harold Wilson's Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.\nFinal years, death and legacy.\nIn June 1955, Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in Penrhyndeudraeth, Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.\nRussell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. He made a cameo appearance playing himself in the anti-war Hindi film \"Aman\", by Mohan Kumar, which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.\nOn 23 November 1969, he wrote to \"The Times\" newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in Czechoslovakia was \"highly alarming\". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General U Thant of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The following month, he protested to Alexei Kosygin over the expulsion of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn from the Soviet Union of Writers.\nOn 31 January 1970, Russell issued a statement condemning \"Israel's aggression in the Middle East\", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the War of Attrition, which he compared to German bombing raids in the Battle of Britain and the US bombing of Vietnam. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-Six-Day War borders, stating \"The aggression committed by Israel must be condemned, not only because no state has the right to annexe foreign territory, but because every expansion is an experiment to discover how much more aggression the world will tolerate.\" This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in Cairo on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.\nRussell died of influenza, just after 8\u00a0pm on 2 February 1970 at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth, aged 97. His body was cremated in Colwyn Bay on 5 February 1970 with five people present. In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony but one minute's silence; his ashes were later scattered over the Welsh mountains. Although he was born in Monmouthshire, and died in Penrhyndeudraeth in Wales, Russell identified as English. Later in 1970, on 23 October, his will was published showing he had left an estate valued at \u00a369,423 (equivalent to \u00a3\u00a0million in 2023). In 1980, a memorial to Russell was commissioned by a committee including the philosopher A. J. Ayer. It consists of a bust of Russell in Red Lion Square in London sculpted by Marcelle Quinton.\nLady Katharine Jane Tait, Russell's daughter, founded the Bertrand Russell Society in 1974 to preserve and understand his work. It publishes the \"Bertrand Russell Society Bulletin\", holds meetings and awards prizes for scholarship, including the Bertrand Russell Society Award. She also authored several essays about her father; as well as a book, \"My Father, Bertrand Russell\", which was published in 1975. All members receive \"Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies\".\nFor the sesquicentennial of his birth, in May 2022, McMaster University's Bertrand Russell Archive, the university's largest and most heavily used research collection, organised both a physical and virtual exhibition on Russell's anti-nuclear stance in the post-war era, https://, which included the earliest version of the Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto. The Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation held a commemoration at Conway Hall in Red Lion Square, London, on 18 May, the anniversary of his birth. For its part, on the same day, \"La Estrella de Panam\u00e1\" published a biographical sketch by Francisco D\u00edaz Montilla, who commented that \"[if he] had to characterize Russell's work in one sentence [he] would say: criticism and rejection of dogmatism.\"\nBangladesh's first leader, Mujibur Rahman, named his youngest son Sheikh Russel in honour of Bertrand Russell.\nMarriages and issue.\nIn 1889, Russell, at 17 years of age, met the family of Alys Pearsall Smith, an American Quaker five years his senior, who was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia.37 He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family. They knew him as \"Lord John's grandson\" and enjoyed showing him off.48\nHe fell in love with Alys, and contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13 December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while cycling, that he no longer loved her. She asked him if he loved her, and he factually replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. A lengthy period of separation began in 1911 with Russell's affair with Lady Ottoline Morrell, and he and Alys finally divorced in 1921 to enable Russell to remarry.\nDuring his years of separation from Alys, Russell had affairs (often simultaneous) with a number of women, including Morrell and the actress Lady Constance Malleson. Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with Vivienne Haigh-Wood, the English governess and writer, and first wife of T. S. Eliot.\nIn 1921, his second marriage was to Dora Winifred Black MBE (died 1986), daughter of Sir Frederick Black. Dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England.\nThis was dissolved in 1935, having produced two children:\nAdditionally, Russell was temporarily registered as the birth father of Dora Russell\u2019s daughter, Harriett Ruth Barry (1930-2024), but this was reversed at some point and Harriett\u2019s father was correctly registered as American journalist Griffin Barry. Dora Russell also gave birth to a son by Griffin Barry in 1932, Roderick Barry (1932-1983). Though the Russell marriage was an open one, the Barry children\u2019s births led to a dissolution of the marriage and Russell divorced Dora. Russell did continue to be involved in both Barry children\u2019s lives, though not closely.\nRussell's third marriage was to his student Patricia Helen Spence (d. 2004) in 1936, with the marriage producing one child:\nRussell's third marriage ended in divorce in 1952. He married Edith Finch in the same year. They remained married at the time of his death in 1972; Finch died in 1978.\nTitles, awards and honours.\nUpon his brother's death in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell of Kingston Russell, and the subsidiary title of Viscount Amberley of Amberley and of Ardsalla. He held both titles, and the accompanying seat in the House of Lords, until his death in 1970.\nViews.\nPhilosophy.\nRussell is credited with being one of the founders of analytic philosophy. He was impressed by Gottfried Leibniz (1646\u20131716), and wrote on major areas of philosophy except aesthetics. He was prolific in the fields of metaphysics, logic and the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of language, ethics and epistemology. When Brand Blanshard asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, though he hastened to add \"but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects\".\nOn ethics, Russell wrote that he was a utilitarian in his youth, yet he later distanced himself from this view.\nFor the advancement of science and protection of liberty of expression, Russell advocated The Will to Doubt, the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are practised in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge.\nEvery man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men's attitude is tentative and full of doubt.\nReligion.\nRussell described himself in 1947 as an agnostic or an atheist: he found it difficult to determine which term to adopt, saying:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Therefore, in regard to the Olympic gods, speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the Christian God, I should, I think, take exactly the same line. For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than superstition and, despite any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the advisory council of the British Humanist Association and the president of Cardiff Humanists until his death.\nSociety.\nPolitical and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes. He was a prominent campaigner against Western intervention into the Vietnam War in the 1960s, writing essays and books, attending demonstrations, and even organising the Russell Tribunal in 1966 alongside other prominent philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, which fed into his 1967 book \"War Crimes in Vietnam.\"\nRussell argued for a \"scientific society\", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared. He suggested the establishment of a \"single supreme world government\" able to enforce peace, claiming that \"the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation\". He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth. \nRussell also expressed support for guild socialism, and commented positively on several socialist thinkers and activists. According to Jean Bricmont and Normand Baillargeon, \"Russell was both a liberal and a socialist, a combination that was perfectly comprehensible in his time, but which has become almost unthinkable today. He was a liberal in that he opposed concentrations of power in all its manifestations, military, governmental, or religious, as well as the superstitious or nationalist ideas that usually serve as its justification. But he was also a socialist, even as an extension of his liberalism, because he was equally opposed to the concentrations of power stemming from the private ownership of the major means of production, which therefore needed to be put under social control (which does not mean state control).\"\nRussell was an active supporter of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, being one of the signatories of A. E. Dyson's 1958 letter to \"The Times\" calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.\nHe expressed sympathy and support for the Palestinian people and was critical of Israel's actions. He wrote in 1960 that, \"I think it was a mistake to establish a Jewish State in Palestine, but it would be a still greater mistake to try to get rid of it now that it exists.\" In his final written document, read aloud in Cairo three days after his death on 31 January 1970, he condemned Israel as an aggressive imperialist power, which \"wishes to consolidate with the least difficulty what it has already taken by violence. Every new conquest becomes the new basis of the proposed negotiation from strength, which ignores the injustice of the previous aggression.\" In regards to the Palestinian people and refugees, he wrote that, \"No people anywhere in the world would accept being expelled en masse from their own country; how can anyone require the people of Palestine to accept a punishment which nobody else would tolerate? A permanent just settlement of the refugees in their homeland is an essential ingredient of any genuine settlement in the Middle East.\"\nRussell advocated for a universal basic income. In his 1918 book \"Roads to Freedom\", Russell wrote that \"Anarchism has the advantage as regards liberty, Socialism as regards the inducement to work.\u00a0 Can we not find a method of combining these two advantages?\u00a0It seems to me that we can. [...] Stated in more familiar terms, the plan we are advocating amounts essentially to this: that a certain small income, sufficient for necessaries, should be secured to all, whether they work or not, and that a larger income \u2013 as much larger as might be warranted by the total amount of commodities produced \u2013 should be given to those who are willing to engage in some work which the community recognizes as useful...When education is finished, no one should be compelled to work, and those who choose not to work should receive a bare livelihood and be left completely free.\"\nIn \"Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday\" (\"Postscript\" in his \"Autobiography\"), Russell wrote: \"I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken\".\nFreedom of opinion and expression.\nRussell supported freedom of opinion and was an opponent of both censorship and indoctrination. In 1928, he wrote: The fundamental argument for freedom of opinion is the doubtfulness of all our belief... when the State intervenes to ensure the indoctrination of some doctrine, it does so because there is no conclusive evidence in favour of that doctrine ... It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions make it impossible to make a living. In 1957, he wrote: \"'Free thought' means thinking freely ... to be worthy of the name freethinker he must be free of two things: the force of tradition and the tyranny of his own passions.\"\nEducation.\nRussell has presented ideas on the possible means of control of education in case of scientific dictatorship governments, of the kind of this excerpt taken from Chapter II \"General Effects of Scientific Technique\" of \"The Impact of Science on society\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This subject will make great strides when it is taken up by scientists under a scientific dictatorship. Anaxagoras maintained that snow is black, but no one believed him. The social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black. Various results will soon be arrived at. First, that the influence of home is obstructive. Second, that not much can be done unless indoctrination begins before the age of ten. Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intoned are very effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be held to show a morbid taste for eccentricity. But I anticipate. It is for future scientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costs per head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it would cost to make them believe it is dark grey. Although this science will be diligently studied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace will not be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the technique has been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for a generation will be able to control its subjects securely without the need of armies or policemen. As yet there is only one country which has succeeded in creating this politician's paradise. The social effects of scientific technique have already been many and important, and are likely to be even more noteworthy in the future. Some of these effects depend upon the political and economic character of the country concerned; others are inevitable, whatever this character may be.\nHe pushed his visionary scenarios even further into details, in Chapter III \"Scientific Technique in an Oligarchy\" of the same book, stating as an example: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In future such failures are not likely to occur where there is dictatorship. Diet, injections, and injunctions will combine, from a very early age, to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable, and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible. Even if all are miserable, all will believe themselves happy, because the government will tell them that they are so.\nSelected works.\nBelow are selected Russell's works in English, sorted by year of first publication:\nRussell was the author of more than sixty books and over two thousand articles. Additionally, he wrote many pamphlets, introductions, and letters to the editor. One pamphlet titled, \"'I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors\", ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist Stephen Hobhouse, allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of conscientious objectors.\nHis works can be found in anthologies and collections, including \"The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell\", which McMaster University began publishing in 1983. By March 2017, this collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works included 18 volumes, and several more are in progress.

The initial 767-200 variant entered service on September 8, 1982, with United Airlines, and the extended-range 767-200ER in 1984. It was stretched into the 767-300 in October 1986, followed by the extended-range 767-300ER in 1988, the most popular variant. The 767-300F, a production freighter version, debuted in October 1995. It was stretched again into the 767-400ER from September 2000.\nDesigned to complement the larger 747, it has a seven-abreast cross-section accommodating smaller LD2 ULD cargo containers.\nThe 767 is Boeing's first wide-body twinjet, powered by General Electric CF6, Rolls-Royce RB211, or Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D turbofans. JT9D engines were eventually replaced by PW4000 engines.\nThe aircraft has a conventional tail and a supercritical wing for reduced aerodynamic drag.\nIts two-crew glass cockpit, a first for a Boeing airliner, was developed jointly for the 757 \u2212 a narrow-body aircraft, allowing a common pilot type rating. Studies for a higher-capacity 767 in 1986 led Boeing to develop the larger 777 twinjet, introduced in June 1995.\nThe 767-200 typically seats 216 passengers over 3,900\u00a0nautical miles\u00a0[nmi] (7,200\u00a0km; ), while the 767-200ER seats 181 over a 6,590\u00a0nmi (12,200\u00a0km; ) range.\nThe 767-300 typically seats 269 passengers over 3,900\u00a0nmi (7,200\u00a0km; ), while the 767-300ER seats 218 over 5,980\u00a0nmi (11,070\u00a0km; ).\nThe 767-300F can haul over 3,225\u00a0nmi (6,025\u00a0km; ), and the 767-400ER typically seats 245 passengers over 5,625\u00a0nmi (10,415\u00a0km; ). Military derivatives include the E-767 for surveillance and the KC-767 and KC-46 aerial tankers.\nInitially marketed for transcontinental routes, a loosening of ETOPS rules starting in 1985 allowed the aircraft to operate transatlantic flights.\nA total of 742 of these aircraft were in service in July 2018, with Delta Air Lines being the largest operator with 77 aircraft in its fleet.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]], Boeing has received 1,430 orders from 74 customers, of which 1,345 airplanes have been delivered, while the remaining orders are for cargo or tanker variants. Competitors have included the Airbus A300, A310, and A330-200. Its successor, the 787 Dreamliner, entered service in 2011.\nDevelopment.\nBackground.\nIn 1970, the 747 entered service as the first wide-body jetliner with a fuselage wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin. Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body jetliner intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body airliners. The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies. To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation. The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.\nBy 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the baseline configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and more efficient lightweight designs were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.\nIn January 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its Everett factory\u2014which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747\u2014to accommodate its new wide-body family. In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation, and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a trijet 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes. The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes. The 767 was officially launched on July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines later that year. The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's seating, while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing the twinjet configuration.\nDesign effort.\nIn the late 1970s, operating cost replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30\u00a0percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for over a third of the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4\u00a0billion.\nEarly 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner. Both jet engine models had a maximum output of of thrust. The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets. The larger wings were designed using an aft-loaded shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed lift more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft. The wings provided higher-altitude cruise performance, added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants. The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic, and would be capable of operating routes up to .\nThe 767's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at . While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag. The fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body unit load devices side-by-side, so a smaller container, the LD2, was created specifically for the 767. Using a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section, providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.\nThe 767 was the first Boeing wide-body to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode-ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types.\nProduction and testing.\nTo produce the 767, Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.\nThe prototype aircraft, registered as N767BA and equipped with Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D turbofans, was rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight under the command of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a hydraulic fluid leak. The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.\nThe 10-month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built. The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines. The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance, while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights. During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets. Following 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in July 1982. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines. The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.\nEntry into service.\nThe 767 entered service with United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first commercial flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service three months later with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, El Al, and Pacific Western began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners.\nExemptions from major certification rule changes.\nFollowing the 1996 in-flight explosion of TWA Flight 800, the FAA introduced new rules about flammability reduction in 2008. In 2012, Boeing requested an exemption for the 767 from new wiring separation rules that would prevent ignition sources, because design improvements it introduced fell short of meeting such rules. One of the justification by Boeing: changes to the fuel quantity indication system would require a halt of delivery by three years as production of the 767 model was expected to end shortly. FAA gave the manufacturer three years to have a compliant system while deliveries continued. In 2014, Boeing, without a new design available, asked for and received another time-limited exemption for just the 767-300 and 767-300ER until 2019 when commercial production was expected to cease. But in 2017, with continual demand for the 767-300F, Boeing asked for another exemption up to the end of 2027, well past the revised production end date. It is noted that while Boeing requested extension of the original exemption from 2016 to 2019 based upon the cost of upgrading the design and their low production rate and ending production in 2019, Boeing developed the KC-46 tanker (based on the 767) which fully compliant with the new rulings and is assembled on the same production line as the 767. Since the 2019 exemption went into effect, Boeing has increased production of the freighter to satisfy demand.\nStretched derivatives.\nFirst stretch: -300/-300ER/F.\nForecasting airline interest in larger-capacity models, Boeing announced the stretched 767-300 in 1983 and the extended-range 767-300ER in 1984. Both models offered a 20\u00a0percent passenger capacity increase, while the extended-range version was capable of operating flights up to . Japan Airlines placed the first order for the -300 in September 1983. Following its first flight on January 30, 1986, the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20, 1986. The 767-300ER completed its first flight on December 9, 1986, but it was not until March 1987 that the first firm order, from American Airlines, was placed. The type entered service with American Airlines on March 3, 1988. The 767-300 and 767-300ER gained popularity after entering service, and came to account for approximately two-thirds of all 767s sold. Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest wide-bodies behind the 747.\nBuoyed by a recovering global economy and ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By the end of the decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional hub-and-spoke model.\nIn February 1990, the first 767 equipped with Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofans, a 767-300, was delivered to British Airways. Six months later, the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the engine pylons of several aircraft. The cracks were related to the extra weight of the RB211 engines, which are heavier than other 767 engines. During the grounding, interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components, and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks. Boeing also performed a structural reassessment, resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service.\nIn January 1993, following an order from UPS Airlines, Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995. The 767-300F featured a main deck cargo hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure. In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the E-767, an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER. The first two E-767s, featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance radar and other monitoring equipment, were delivered in 1998 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.\nSecond stretch:-400ER.\nIn November 1995, after abandoning development of a smaller version of the 777, Boeing announced that it was revisiting studies for a larger 767. The proposed 767-400X, a second stretch of the aircraft, offered a 12\u00a0percent capacity increase versus the 767-300, and featured an upgraded flight deck, enhanced interior, and greater wingspan. The variant was specifically aimed at Delta Air Lines' pending replacement of its aging Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, and faced competition from the A330-200, a shortened derivative of the Airbus A330. In March 1997, Delta Air Lines launched the 767-400ER when it ordered the type to replace its L-1011 fleet. In October 1997, Continental Airlines also ordered the 767-400ER to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet. The type completed its first flight on October 9, 1999, and entered service with Continental Airlines on September 14, 2000.\nDreamliner introduction.\nIn the early 2000s, cumulative 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn. In 2001, Boeing dropped plans for a longer-range model, the 767-400ERX, in favor of the proposed Sonic Cruiser, a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15\u00a0percent faster while having comparable fuel costs to the 767. The following year, Boeing announced the KC-767 Tanker Transport, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER. Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo. The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003. In May 2003, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging KC-135 tankers. The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal, resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including Philip Condit, the company's chief executive officer, and chief financial officer Michael Sears. The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.\nIn late 2002, after airlines expressed reservations about its emphasis on speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20\u00a0percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.\nContinued production.\nIn 2007, the 767 received a production boost when UPS and DHL Aviation placed a combined 33 orders for the 767-300F. Renewed freighter interest led Boeing to consider enhanced versions of the 767-200 and 767-300F with increased gross weights, 767-400ER wing extensions, and 777 avionics. Net orders for the 767 declined from 24 in 2008 to just three in 2010. During the same period, operators upgraded aircraft already in service; in 2008, the first 767-300ER retrofitted with blended winglets from Aviation Partners Incorporated debuted with American Airlines. The manufacturer-sanctioned winglets, at in height, improved fuel efficiency by an estimated 6.5\u00a0percent. Other carriers including All Nippon Airways and Delta Air Lines also ordered winglet kits.\nOn February 2, 2011, the 1,000th 767 rolled out, destined for All Nippon Airways. The aircraft was the 91st 767-300ER ordered by the Japanese carrier, and with its completion the 767 became the second wide-body airliner to reach the thousand-unit milestone after the 747. The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line. Beginning with the 1,001st aircraft, production moved to another area in the Everett factory which occupied about half of the previous floor space. The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over twenty percent.\nAt the inauguration of its new assembly line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.\nIn December 2011, FedEx Express announced a 767-300F order for 27 aircraft to replace its DC-10 freighters, citing the USAF tanker order and Boeing's decision to continue production as contributing factors. FedEx Express agreed to buy 19 more of the \u2212300F variant in June 2012. In June 2015, FedEx said it was accelerating retirements of planes both to reflect demand and to modernize its fleet, recording charges of $276 million (~$ in 2024). On July 21, 2015, FedEx announced an order for 50 767-300F with options on another 50, the largest order for the type. With the announcement FedEx confirmed that it has firm orders for 106 of the freighters for delivery between 2018 and 2023. In February 2018, UPS announced an order for 4 more 767-300Fs to increase the total on order to 63.\nWith its successor, the Boeing New Midsize Airplane, that was planned for introduction in 2025 or later, and the 787 being much larger, Boeing could restart a passenger 767-300ER production to bridge the gap. A demand for 50 to 60 aircraft could have to be satisfied. Having to replace its 40 767s, United Airlines requested a price quote for other widebodies. In November 2017, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg cited interest beyond military and freighter uses. However, in early 2018 Boeing Commercial Airplanes VP of marketing Randy Tinseth stated that the company did not intend to resume production of the passenger variant.\nIn 2019, unit cost was US$217.9 million for a -300ER, and US$220.3 million for a -300F.\nProduction of the 767 was expected to cease by the end of 2027 due to more stringent emissions and noise limits that will go into effect in 2028. However, as of \u00a02024[ [update]], the US Congress is considering giving Boeing a waiver to continue to produce the 767 freighter for an additional five years. If granted, these aircraft would be restricted to domestic use within the US only. Boeing is widely expected to begin production of 787 Freighter during that extension period.\nContinued development.\n767-X (partial double-deck).\nAfter the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for greater capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the \"Hunchback of Mukilteo\" (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage. In 1986, Boeing proposed the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest. The 767-X did not get enough interest from airlines to launch and the model was shelved in 1988 in favor of the Boeing 777.\n767-400ERX.\nIn March 2000, Boeing was to launch the 259-seat 767-400ERX with an initial order for three from Kenya Airways with deliveries planned for 2004, as it was proposed to Lauda Air. \nIncreased gross weight and a tailplane fuel tank would have boosted its range by , and GE could offer its CF6-80C2/G2. Rolls-Royce offered its Trent 600 for the 767-400ERX and the Boeing 747X.\nOffered in July, the longer-range -400ERX would have a strengthened wing, fuselage and landing gear for a 15,000\u00a0lb (6.8\u00a0t) higher MTOW, up to 465,000\u00a0lb (210.92 t).\nThrust would rise to for better takeoff performance, with the Trent 600 or the General Electric/Pratt &amp; Whitney Engine Alliance GP7172, also offered on the 747X.\nRange would increase by to , with an additional fuel tank of in the horizontal tail.\nThe 767-400ERX would offer the capacity of the Airbus A330-200 with 3% lower fuel burn and costs.\nBoeing cancelled the variant development in 2001. Kenya Airways then switched its order to the 777-200ER.\n767-XF (re-engine).\nIn October 2019, Boeing was reportedly studying a re-engined 767-XF for entry into service around 2025, based on the 767-400ER with an extended landing gear to accommodate larger General Electric GEnx or Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 turbofan engines. The cargo market is the main target, but a passenger version could be a cheaper alternative to the proposed New Midsize Airplane.\nDesign.\nOverview.\nThe 767 is a low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder. The wings are swept at 31.5 degrees and optimized for a cruising speed of Mach 0.8 (). Each wing features a supercritical airfoil cross-section and is equipped with six-panel leading edge slats, single- and double-slotted flaps, inboard and outboard ailerons, and six spoilers. The airframe further incorporates Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer composite material wing surfaces, Kevlar fairings and access panels, plus improved aluminum alloys, which together reduce overall weight by versus preceding aircraft.\nTo distribute the aircraft's weight on the ground, the 767 has a retractable tricycle landing gear with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear. The original wing and gear design accommodated the stretched 767-300 without major changes. The 767-400ER features a larger, more widely spaced main gear with 777 wheels, tires, and brakes. To prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff, 767-300 and 767-400ER models are fitted with a retractable tailskid.\nAll passenger Boeing 767 models have full-sized doors at the front and rear of the aircraft. Most -200 and -200ER models feature a single overwing exit, though an optional second overwing exit increases maximum capacity from 255 to 290. The 767-300 and 767-300ER typically have either two overwing exits or an additional full-sized mid-cabin door along with a single overwing exit. A higher-capacity configuration includes the full-sized mid-cabin door a smaller exit door aft the wing, raising the maximum capacity from 290 to 351. The 767-400ER is configured with the full-sized mid-cabin door a smaller exit door aft the wing. The 767-300F cargo model has a single exit door on the forward left side of the aircraft.\nIn addition to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 uses the same auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.\nFlight systems.\nThe original Boeing 767 flight deck features a two-crew glass cockpit, the first of its kind on a Boeing airliner, developed jointly with the narrow-body 757. This design allows for a common pilot type rating between the two aircraft. The cockpit includes six Rockwell Collins CRT screens that display electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) and engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS) information, eliminating the need for a flight engineer by enabling pilots to manage monitoring tasks. These CRT screens replace the traditional electromechanical instruments used in earlier aircraft. The aircraft's enhanced flight management system, an improvement over early Boeing 747 versions, automates navigation and other functions. Additionally, an automatic landing system supports CAT IIIb instrument landings in low-visibility conditions. In 1984, the 767 became the first aircraft to receive FAA certification for CAT IIIb landings, permitting operations with a minimum visibility of . The 767-400ER further simplifies the cockpit layout with six Rockwell Collins LCD screens, designed for operational similarity with the 777 and 737NG. To maintain commonality, these LCD screens can be configured to present information in the same format as earlier 767 models. In 2012, Rockwell Collins introduced a 787-inspired cockpit upgrade for the 767, featuring three landscape-format LCD screens capable of displaying two windows each.\nInterior.\nThe 767 features a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in business class and seven across in economy. The standard seven abreast, 2\u20133\u20132 economy class layout places approximately 87\u00a0percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats need to be filled, and each passenger is no more than one seat from the aisle. It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.\nThe 767 interior introduced larger overhead bins and more lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate garment bags without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large galley is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and service doors are an overhead plug type, which retract upwards, and commonly used doors can be equipped with an electric-assist system.\nIn 2000, a 777-style interior, known as the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently, adopted for all new-build 767s, the Signature Interior features even larger overhead bins, indirect lighting, and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior. Some operators have adopted a simpler modification known as the Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling panels and indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.\nOperational history.\nIn its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1\u00a0percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for all-new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.\nSeeking to capitalize on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, in its first year of service. Ethiopian Airlines placed the first order for the type in December 1982. Featuring increased gross weight and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to , and was targeted at overseas customers. The 767-200ER entered service with El Al Airline on March 27, 1984. The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights. In May 1984, an Ethiopian Airlines 767-200ER set a non-stop record for a commercial twinjet of from Washington, D.C. to Addis Ababa.\nIn the mid-1980s, the 767 and its European rivals, the Airbus A300 and A310, spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. In 1976, the A300 was the first twinjet to secure permission to fly 90 minutes away from diversion airports, up from 60 minutes. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to the 767, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The 767 burned less fuel per hour than a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar on the route between Boston and Paris, a huge savings. The Airbus A310 secured approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights one month later in June. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by twinjets and their turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic flights with twinjet aircraft and boosted the sales of both the 767 and its rivals.\nVariants.\nThe 767 has been produced in three fuselage lengths. These debuted in progressively larger form as the 767-200, 767-300, and 767-400ER. Longer-range variants include the 767-200ER and 767-300ER, while cargo models include the 767-300F, a production freighter, and conversions of passenger 767-200 and 767-300 models.\nWhen referring to different variants, Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number (767) and the variant designator, e.g. \u2013200 or \u2013300, into a truncated form, e.g. \"762\" or \"763\". Subsequent to the capacity number, designations may append the range identifier, though -200ER and -300ER are company marketing designations and not certificated as such. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aircraft type designator system uses a similar numbering scheme, but adds a preceding manufacturer letter; all variants based on the 767-200 and 767-300 are classified under the codes \"B762\" and \"B763\"; the 767-400ER receives the designation of \"B764\".\n767-200.\nThe 767-200 was the original model and entered service with United Airlines in 1982. The type has been used primarily by mainline U.S. carriers for domestic routes between major hub centers such as Los Angeles to Washington. The 767-200 was the first aircraft to be used on transatlantic ETOPS flights, beginning with TWA on February 1, 1985, under 90-minute diversion rules. Deliveries for the variant totaled 128 aircraft. There were 52 examples of the model in commercial service as of July\u00a02018[ [update]], almost entirely as freighter conversions. The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310.\nThe 767-200 was produced until 1987 when production switched to the extended-range 767-200ER. Some early 767-200s were subsequently upgraded to extended-range specification. In 1998, Boeing began offering 767-200 conversions to 767-200SF (Special Freighter) specification for cargo use, and Israel Aerospace Industries has been licensed to perform cargo conversions since 2005. The conversion process entails the installation of a side cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and added freight monitoring and safety equipment. The 767-200SF was positioned as a replacement for Douglas DC-8 freighters.\n767-2C.\nA commercial freighter version of the Boeing 767-200 with wings from the -300 series and an updated flightdeck was first flown on December 29, 2014. A military tanker variant of the Boeing 767-2C is developed for the USAF as the KC-46. Boeing is building two aircraft as commercial freighters which will be used to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification, a further two Boeing 767-2Cs will be modified as military tankers. As of 2014[ [update]], Boeing does not have customers for the freighter.\n767-200ER.\nThe 767-200ER was the first extended-range model and entered service with El Al in 1984. The type's increased range is due to extra fuel capacity and higher maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of up to . The additional fuel capacity is accomplished by using the center tank's dry dock to carry fuel. The non-ER variant's center tank is what is called \"cheek tanks\"; two interconnected halves in each wing root with a dry dock in between. The center tank is also used on the -300ER and -400ER variants.\nThis version was originally offered with the same engines as the 767-200, while more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 and General Electric CF6 engines later became available. The 767-200ER was the first 767 to complete a non-stop transatlantic journey, and broke the flying distance record for a twinjet airliner on April 17, 1988, with an Air Mauritius flight from Halifax, Nova Scotia to Port Louis, Mauritius, covering . The 767-200ER has been acquired by international operators seeking smaller wide-body aircraft for long-haul routes such as New York to Beijing. Deliveries of the type totaled 121 with no unfilled orders. As of July 2018, 21 examples of passenger and freighter conversion versions were in airline service. The type's main competitors of the time included the Airbus A300-600R and the A310-300.\n767-300.\nThe 767-300, the first stretched version of the aircraft, entered service with Japan Airlines in 1986. The type features a fuselage extension over the 767-200, achieved by additional sections inserted before and after the wings, for an overall length of . Reflecting the growth potential built into the original 767 design, the wings, engines, and most systems were largely unchanged on the 767-300. An optional mid-cabin exit door is positioned ahead of the wings on the left, while more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 and Rolls-Royce RB211 engines later became available. The 767-300's increased capacity has been used on high-density routes within Asia and Europe. The 767-300 was produced from 1986 until 2000. Deliveries for the type totaled 104 aircraft with no unfilled orders remaining. The type's main competitor was the Airbus A300.\n767-300ER.\nThe 767-300ER, the extended-range version of the 767-300, entered service with American Airlines in 1988. The type's increased range was made possible by greater fuel tankage and a higher MTOW of . Design improvements allowed the available MTOW to increase to by 1993. Power is provided by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000, General Electric CF6, or Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. The 767-300ER comes in three exit configurations: the baseline configuration has four main cabin doors and four over-wing window exits, the second configuration has six main cabin doors and two over-wing window exits; and the third configuration has six main cabin doors, as well as two smaller doors that are located behind the wings. Typical routes for the type include New York to Frankfurt.\nThe combination of increased capacity and range for the -300ER has been particularly attractive to both new and existing 767 operators. It is the most successful 767 version, with more orders placed than all other variants combined. As of November\u00a02017[ [update]], 767-300ER deliveries stand at 583 with no unfilled orders. There were 376 examples in service as of July\u00a02018[ [update]]. The type's main competitor is the Airbus A330-200. At its 1990s peak, a new 767-300ER was valued at $85 million, dipping to around $12 million in 2018 for a 1996 build.\n767-300F.\nThe 767-300F, the production freighter version of the 767-300ER, entered service with UPS Airlines in 1995. The 767-300F can hold up to 24 standard pallets on its main deck and up to 30 LD2 unit load devices on the lower deck, with a total cargo volume of . The freighter has a main deck cargo door and crew exit, while the lower deck features two starboard-side cargo doors and one port-side cargo door. A general market version with onboard freight-handling systems, refrigeration capability, and crew facilities was delivered to Asiana Airlines on August 23, 1996. As of August\u00a02019[ [update]], 767-300F deliveries stand at 161 with 61 unfilled orders. Airlines operated 222 examples of the freighter variant and freighter conversions in July 2018.\nConverted freighters.\nIn June 2008, All Nippon Airways took delivery of the first 767-300BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), a modified passenger-to-freighter model. The conversion work was performed in Singapore by ST Aerospace Services, the first supplier to offer a 767-300BCF program, and involved the addition of a main deck cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and additional freight monitoring and safety equipment.\nIsrael Aerospace Industries offers a passenger-to-freighter conversion program called the 767-300BDSF (BEDEK Special Freighter). Wagner Aeronautical also offers a passenger-to-freighter conversion program for 767-300 series aircraft.\n767-400ER.\nThe 767-400ER, the first Boeing wide-body jet resulting from two fuselage stretches, entered service with Continental Airlines in 2000. The type features a stretch over the 767-300, for a total length of . The wingspan is also increased by through the addition of raked wingtips. The exit configuration uses six main cabin doors and two smaller exit doors behind the wings, similar to certain 767-300ERs. Other differences include an updated cockpit, redesigned landing gear, and 777-style Signature Interior. Power is provided by uprated General Electric CF6 engines.\nThe FAA granted approval for the 767-400ER to operate 180-minute ETOPS flights before it entered service. Because its fuel capacity was not increased over preceding models, the 767-400ER has a range of , less than previous extended-range 767s. No 767-400 (non-extended range) version was developed.\nThe longer-range 767-400ERX was offered in July 2000 before being cancelled a year later, leaving the 767-400ER as the sole version of the largest 767. Boeing dropped the 767-400ER and the -200ER from its pricing list in 2014.\nA total of 37 767-400ERs were delivered to the variant's two airline customers, Continental Airlines (now merged with United Airlines as of 2010) and Delta Air Lines, with no unfilled orders. All 37 examples of the -400ER were in service in July 2018. One additional example was produced as a military testbed for cancelled E-10, and later sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport. The type's closest competitor is the Airbus A330-200.\nMilitary and government.\nVersions of the 767 serve in a number of military and government applications, with responsibilities ranging from airborne surveillance and refueling to cargo and VIP transport. Several military 767s have been derived from the 767-200ER, the longest-range version of the aircraft.\nOperators.\nIn July 2018, 742 aircraft were in airline service: 73 -200s, 632 -300, and 37 -400ER with 65 -300F on order; the largest operators are Delta Air Lines (77), FedEx (60; largest cargo operator), UPS Airlines (59), United Airlines (51), Japan Airlines (35), All Nippon Airways (34).\nThe largest 767 customers by orders placed are FedEx Express (150), Delta Air Lines (117), All Nippon Airways (96), American Airlines (88), and United Airlines (82). Delta and United are the only customers of all -200, -300, and -400ER passenger variants. In July 2015, FedEx placed a firm order for 50 Boeing 767 freighters with deliveries from 2018 to 2023. The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310.\nOrders and deliveries.\nBoeing 767 orders and deliveries (cumulative, by year): \n &lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Orders &lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0Deliveries \u2014 as of \u00a02025[ [update]]\nAccidents and incidents.\nAs of February\u00a02025[ [update]], the Boeing 767 has been in 67 aviation occurrences, including 19 hull-loss accidents. Eleven fatal crashes, including seven hijackings, have resulted in a total of 854 occupant fatalities.\nAccidents.\nThe airliner's first fatal crash, Lauda Air Flight 004, occurred near Bangkok on May 26, 1991, following the in-flight deployment of the left engine thrust reverser on a 767-300ER. None of the 223 onboard survived. As a result of this accident, all 767 thrust reversers were deactivated until a redesign was implemented. Investigators determined that an electronically controlled valve, common to late-model Boeing aircraft, was to blame. A new locking device was installed on all affected jetliners, including 767s.\nOn October 31, 1999, EgyptAir Flight 990, a 767-300ER, crashed off Nantucket, Massachusetts, in international waters killing all 217 people on board. The United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the crash was the \"result of the relief first officer's flight control inputs\"; the Egyptian government disputed this conclusion.\nOn April 15, 2002, Air China Flight 129, a 767-200ER, crashed into a hill amid inclement weather while trying to land at Gimhae International Airport in Busan, South Korea. The crash resulted in the death of 129 of the 166 people on board, and the cause was attributed to pilot error. This was the deadliest plane crash in South Korea at the time.\nOn February 23, 2019, Atlas Air Flight 3591, a Boeing 767-300ERF air freighter operating for Amazon Air, crashed into Trinity Bay near Houston, Texas, while on descent into George Bush Intercontinental Airport; both pilots and the single passenger were killed. The cause was attributed to pilot error and spatial disorientation.\nOn November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely landed at Warsaw Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland, after a mechanical failure of the landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear retracted. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and written off. An investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.\nOn October 29, 2015, Dynamic Airways Flight 405, a 767-200ER, caught fire while taxiing to the runway at Hollywood International Airport. There were no fatalities, but 22 people were injured, 1 of them seriously. The aircraft was written off.\nOn October 28, 2016, American Airlines Flight 383, a 767-300ER with 161 passengers and 9 crew members, aborted takeoff at Chicago O'Hare Airport following an uncontained failure of the right GE CF6-80C2 engine. The engine failure, which hurled fragments over a considerable distance, caused a fuel leak, resulting in a fire under the right wing. Fire and smoke entered the cabin. All passengers and crew evacuated the aircraft, with 20 passengers and one flight attendant sustaining minor injuries using the evacuation slides.\nThe 767 has been involved in six hijackings, three resulting in loss of life, for a combined total of 282 occupant fatalities. On November 23, 1996, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, a 767-200ER, was hijacked and crash-landed in the Indian Ocean near the Comoros Islands after running out of fuel, killing 125 out of the 175 persons on board; this was a rare example of occupants surviving a land-based aircraft ditching on water. Two 767s were involved in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, resulting in the collapse of its two main towers. American Airlines Flight 11, a 767-200ER, crashed into the North Tower, killing all 92 people on board, and United Airlines Flight 175, a 767-200, crashed into the South Tower, with the death of all 65 on board. In addition, more than 2,600 people were killed in the towers or on the ground. A failed shoe bomb attempt in December 2001 involved an American Airlines 767-300ER.\nIncidents.\nThe 767's first incident was Air Canada Flight 143, a 767-200, on July 23, 1983. The airplane ran out of fuel at an altitude of about 41,000 feet. Eventually, the pilots had to glide with both engines out for almost to an emergency landing at Gimli, Manitoba, Canada. The pilots used the aircraft's ram air turbine to power the hydraulic systems for aerodynamic control. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. This aircraft was nicknamed \"Gimli Glider\" after its landing site. The aircraft, registered as C-GAUN, continued flying for Air Canada until its retirement in January 2008.\nIn January 2014, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued a directive that ordered inspections of the elevators on more than 400 767s beginning in March 2014; the focus was on fasteners and other parts that can fail and cause the elevators to jam. The issue was first identified in 2000 and has been the subject of several Boeing service bulletins. The inspections and repairs are required to be completed within six years. The aircraft has also had multiple occurrences of \"uncommanded escape slide inflation\" during maintenance or operations, and during flight. In late 2015, the FAA issued a preliminary directive to address the issue.\nAircraft on display.\nAs new 767 variants roll off the assembly line, older series models have been retired and converted to cargo use, stored, or scrapped. One complete aircraft, N102DA, is the first 767-200 to operate for Delta Air Lines and the twelfth example built. It was retired from airline service in February 2006 after being repainted back to its original 1982 Delta widget livery and given a farewell tour. It was then put on display at the Delta Flight Museum in the Delta corporate campus at the edge of Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport. \"The Spirit of Delta\" is on public display as of 2022.\nIn 2013 a Brazilian entrepreneur purchased a 767-200 that had operated for the now-defunct carrier Transbrasil under the registration PT-TAC. The aircraft, which was sold at a bankruptcy auction, was placed on outdoor display in Taguatinga as part of a proposed commercial development. As of 2019[ [update]], however, the development has not come to fruition. The aircraft is devoid of engines or landing gear and has deteriorated due to weather exposure and acts of vandalism but remains publicly accessible to view.\nSpecifications.\nBelow is an organized chart composed of the variants of the 767 and their specifications.\nSee also.\nRelated development\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\nRelated lists\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "4166", "revid": "50711816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4166", "title": "Bill Walsh", "text": "American football coach (1931\u20132007)\nWilliam Ernest Walsh (November 30, 1931 \u2013 July 30, 2007) was an American professional and college football coach. He served as head coach of the San Francisco 49ers and the Stanford Cardinal, during which time he popularized the West Coast offense. After retiring from the 49ers, Walsh worked as a sports broadcaster for several years and then returned as head coach at Stanford for three seasons.\nWalsh went 102\u201363\u20131 (wins-losses-ties) with the 49ers, winning 10 of his 14 postseason games along with six division titles, three NFC Championship titles, and three Super Bowls. He was named NFL Coach of the Year in 1981 and 1984. In 1993, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He is widely considered amongst the greatest coaches in NFL history.\nEarly life.\nWalsh was born in Fremont, California. He attended Hayward High School in Hayward in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he played running back.\nWalsh played quarterback at the College of San Mateo for two seasons. (Both John Madden and Walsh played and coached at the College of San Mateo early in their careers.) After playing at the College of San Mateo, Walsh transferred to San Jos\u00e9 State University, where he played tight end and defensive end. He also participated in intercollegiate boxing, winning the golden glove.\nWalsh graduated from San Jose State with a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1955. After two years in the U.S. Army participating on their boxing team, Walsh built a championship team at Washington High School in Fremont before becoming an assistant coach at Cal, Stanford and then the Oakland Raiders in 1966.\nCollege coaching career.\nHe served under Bob Bronzan as a graduate assistant coach on the Spartans football coaching staff and graduated with a master's degree in physical education from San Jose State in 1959. His master's thesis was entitled \"Flank Formation Football -- Stress: Defense\". Thesis 796.W228f.\nFollowing graduation, Walsh coached the football and swim teams at Washington High School in Fremont, California. While there he interviewed for an assistant coaching position with the new head coach of the University of California, Berkeley California Golden Bears football team, Marv Levy.\n\"I was very impressed, individually, by his knowledge, by his intelligence, by his personality, and hired him,\" Levy said. Levy and Walsh, two future NFL Hall of Famers, would never produce a winning season for the Golden Bears.\nLeaving Berkeley, Walsh did a stint at Stanford University as an assistant coach of its Cardinal football team before beginning his pro coaching career.\nProfessional coaching career.\nEarly years.\nWalsh began his pro coaching career in 1966 as an assistant with the AFL's Oakland Raiders. There he was versed in the downfield-oriented \"vertical\" passing offense favored by Al Davis, an acolyte of Sid Gillman.\nWalsh left the Raiders the next year to become the head coach and general manager of the San Jose Apaches of the Continental Football League (CFL). He led the Apaches to second place in the Pacific Division, but the team ceased all football operations prior to the start of the 1968 CFL season.\nIn 1968, Walsh joined the staff of head coach Paul Brown of the AFL expansion Cincinnati Bengals, where he coached wide receivers from 1968 to 1970. It was there that Walsh developed the philosophy now known as the \"West Coast offense\". Cincinnati's new quarterback, Virgil Carter, was known for his great mobility and accuracy but lacked a strong arm necessary to throw deep passes. To suit his strengths, Walsh suggested a modification of the downfield based \"vertical passing scheme\" he had learned during his time with the Raiders with one featuring a \"horizontal\" approach that relied on quick, short throws, often spreading the ball across the entire width of the field. In 1971 Walsh was given the additional responsibility of coaching the quarterbacks, and Carter went on to lead the league in pass completion percentage.\nKen Anderson eventually replaced Carter as starting quarterback, and, together with star wide receiver Isaac Curtis, produced a consistent, effective offensive attack.\nWhen Brown retired as head coach following the 1975 season and appointed Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson as his successor, Walsh resigned and served as an assistant coach in 1976 for the San Diego Chargers under head coach Tommy Prothro. In a 2006 interview, Walsh claimed that during his tenure with the Bengals, Brown \"worked against my candidacy\" to be a head coach anywhere in the league. \"All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them\", Walsh said. \"And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep me out of the NFL.\" Walsh also claimed that Brown kept talking him down any time Brown was called by NFL teams considering hiring Walsh as a head coach.\nIn 1977, Walsh was hired by Stanford University as the head coach of its Cardinal football team, where he stayed for two seasons. He was quite successful, with his teams posting a 9\u20133 record in 1977 with a win in the Sun Bowl, and going 8\u20134 in 1978 with a win in the Bluebonnet Bowl. His notable players at Stanford included quarterbacks Guy Benjamin, Steve Dils, wide receivers James Lofton and Ken Margerum, linebacker Gordy Ceresino, and running back Darrin Nelson. Walsh was the Pac-8 Conference Coach of the Year in 1977.\n49ers head coach.\nOn January 9, 1979, Walsh resigned as head coach at Stanford, and San Francisco 49ers team owner Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr. fired head coach Fred O'Connor and general manager Joe Thomas following a 2\u201314 in 1978 season. Walsh was appointed head coach of the 49ers the next day.\nThe 49ers went 2-14 again in 1979. Hidden behind that record were organizational changes made by Walsh that set the team on a better course, including selecting Notre Dame quarterback Joe Montana in the third round of the 1979 NFL draft.\nIn 1980, starting quarterback Steve DeBerg got the 49ers off to a 3\u20130 start, but after a week 6 blowout loss to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 59\u201314, Walsh gave Montana a chance to start. On December 7 vs. the New Orleans Saints, the second-year player brought the 49ers back from a 35\u20137 halftime deficit to a 38\u201335 overtime win. In spite of this switch, the team struggled to a 6\u201310 finish \u2013 a record that belied a championship team in the making.\n1981 championship.\nIn 1981, Walsh's efforts as head coach led the team to a 13\u20133 regular season. The 13 wins were a franchise record at the time, and were three more than they had won in the previous three seasons combined. Key victories were two wins each over the Los Angeles Rams and the Dallas Cowboys. The Rams were only two seasons removed from a Super Bowl appearance, and had dominated the series with the 49ers since 1967, winning 23, losing 3 and tying 1. San Francisco's two wins over the Rams in 1981 marked the shift of dominance in favor of the 49ers that lasted until 1998 with 30 wins (including 17 consecutively) against only 6 defeats. The 49ers blew out the Cowboys in week 6 of the regular season. On \"Monday Night Football\" that week, the win was not included in the halftime highlights. Walsh felt that this was because the Cowboys were scheduled to play the Rams the next week in a Sunday night game and that showing the highlights of the 49ers' win would potentially hurt the game's ratings. However, Walsh used this as a motivating factor for his team, who felt they were disrespected.\nThe 49ers faced the Cowboys again in the . The contest was very close, and in the fourth quarter Walsh called a series of running plays as the 49ers marched down the field against the Cowboys' prevent defense, which had been expecting the 49ers to mainly pass. The 49ers came from behind to win the game on Joe Montana's pass completion to Dwight Clark for a touchdown, a play that came to be known simply as The Catch, propelling Walsh to his first appearance in a Super Bowl. Walsh would later write that the 49ers' two wins over the Rams showed a shift of power in their division, while the wins over the Cowboys showed a shift of power in the conference.\nTwo weeks later, on January 24, 1982, San Francisco faced the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XVI, winning 26\u201321 for the team's first NFL championship. Only a year removed from back-to-back two-win seasons, the 49ers had risen from the cellar to the top of the NFL in just two seasons. What came to be known as the West Coast offense developed by Walsh had proven a winner.\nIn all, Walsh served as 49ers head coach for 10 years, winning three Super Bowl championships, in the 1981, 1984, and 1988 seasons, and establishing a new NFL record.\nWalsh had a disciplined approach to game-planning, famously scripting the first 10\u201315 offensive plays before the start of each game. His innovative play calling and design earned him the nickname \"The Genius\". In the ten-year span under Walsh, San Francisco scored 3,714 points (24.4 per game), the most of any team in the league.\nIn addition to Joe Montana, Walsh drafted Ronnie Lott, Charles Haley, and Jerry Rice, each one going on to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He also traded a 2nd and 4th round pick in the 1987 draft for Steve Young, who took over from Montana, led the team to Super Bowl success, and was enshrined in Canton after his playing career. Walsh's success at every level of football, especially with the 49ers, earned him his own ticket to Canton in 1993.\nOn January 22, 1989, Walsh coached his final game with the 49ers, the memorable Super Bowl XXIII in which San Francisco beat Cincinnati 20\u201316. Walsh resigned as the 49ers head coach after the game. Walsh admitted years later that he immediately regretted the decision saying that he left too soon.\nCoaching tree.\nUpline.\nWalsh's upline coaching tree included working as assistant for American Football League great and Hall of Fame head coach Al Davis and NFL legend and Hall of Famer Paul Brown, and, through Davis, AFL great and Hall of Fame head coach Sid Gillman of the then AFL Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers.\nDownline.\nTree updated through December 9, 2015.\nMany Walsh assistants went on to become head coaches, including George Seifert, Mike Holmgren, Ray Rhodes, and Dennis Green. Seifert succeeded Walsh as 49ers head coach, and guided San Francisco to victories in Super Bowl XXIV and Super Bowl XXIX. Holmgren won a Super Bowl with the Green Bay Packers, and made 3 Super Bowl appearances as a head coach: 2 with the Packers, and another with the Seattle Seahawks. These coaches in turn have their own disciples who have used Walsh's West Coast system, such as former Denver Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan and former Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak. Mike Shanahan was an offensive coordinator under George Seifert and went on to win Super Bowl XXXII and Super Bowl XXXIII during his time as head coach of the Denver Broncos. Kubiak was first a quarterback coach with the 49ers, and then offensive coordinator for Shanahan with the Broncos. In 2015, he became the Broncos' head coach and led Denver to victory in Super Bowl 50. Dennis Green trained Tony Dungy, who won a Super Bowl with the Indianapolis Colts, and Brian Billick with his brother-in law and linebackers coach Mike Smith. Billick won a Super Bowl as head coach of the Baltimore Ravens.\nMike Holmgren trained many of his assistants to become head coaches, including Jon Gruden and Andy Reid. Gruden won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Reid served as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1999 to 2012, and guided the Eagles to multiple winning seasons and numerous playoff appearances, including 1 Super Bowl appearance. Ever since 2013, Reid has served as head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs. He was finally able to win a Super Bowl, when his Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV, and two consecutive when his Chiefs defeated the Eagles in Super Bowl LVII and the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. In addition to this, Marc Trestman, former head coach of the Chicago Bears, served as offensive coordinator under Seifert in the 90's. Gruden himself would train Mike Tomlin, who led the Pittsburgh Steelers to their sixth Super Bowl championship, and Jim Harbaugh, whose 49ers would face his brother, John Harbaugh, whom Reid himself trained, and the Baltimore Ravens at Super Bowl XLVII, which marked the Ravens' second World Championship.\nBill Walsh was viewed as a strong advocate for African-American head coaches in the NFL and NCAA. Thus, the impact of Walsh also changed the NFL into an equal opportunity for African-American coaches. Along with Ray Rhodes and Dennis Green, Tyrone Willingham became the head coach at Stanford, then later Notre Dame and Washington. One of Mike Shanahan's assistants, Karl Dorrell, went on to be the head coach at UCLA. Walsh directly helped propel Dennis Green into the NFL head coaching ranks by offering to take on the head coaching job at Stanford.\nLater years.\nAfter leaving the coaching ranks immediately following his team's victory in Super Bowl XXIII, Walsh went to work as a broadcaster for NBC, teaming with Dick Enberg to form the lead broadcasting team, replacing Merlin Olsen.\nDuring his time with NBC, rumors began to surface that Walsh would coach again in the NFL. There were at least two known instances.\nFirst, according to a February 2015 article by Mike Florio of NBC Sports, after a 5\u201311 season in 1989, the Patriots fired Raymond Berry and unsuccessfully attempted to lure Walsh to Foxborough to become head coach and general manager. When that failed, New England promoted defensive coordinator Rod Rust; the team split its first two games and then lost 14 straight in 1990.\nSecond, late in the 1990 season, Walsh was rumored to become Tampa Bay's next head coach and general manager after the team fired Ray Perkins and promoted Richard Williamson on an interim basis. Part of the speculation was fueled by the fact that Walsh's contract with NBC, which ran for 1989 and 1990, would soon be up for renewal, to say nothing of the pressure Hugh Culverhouse faced to increase fan support and to fill the seats at Tampa Stadium. However, less than a week after Super Bowl XXV, Walsh not only declined Tampa Bay's offer, but he and NBC agreed on a contract extension. Walsh would continue in his role with NBC for 1991. Meanwhile, after unsuccessfully courting then-recently fired Eagles coach Buddy Ryan or Giants then-defensive coordinator Bill Belichick to man the sidelines for Tampa Bay in 1991, the Bucs stuck with Williamson. Under Williamson's leadership, Tampa Bay won only three games in 1991.\nOn January 15, 1992, Walsh agreed to return to Stanford to serve as their head coach with a five-year contract with an annual salary of $350,000 to replace Dennis Green; he immediately named Terry Shea as offensive coordinator. That year, he led the Cardinal to a 10\u20133 record and a Pacific-10 Conference co-championship; it was the first conference championship for the program since 1971. Stanford finished the season with a victory over Penn State in the Blockbuster Bowl on January 1, 1993, and a #9 ranking in the final AP Poll. In November 1994, after consecutive losing seasons, Walsh left Stanford and retired from coaching.\nIn 1996, Walsh returned to the 49ers as an administrative aide. Walsh was the vice president and general manager for the 49ers from 1999 to 2001 and was a special consultant to the team for three years afterwards.\nIn 2004, Walsh was appointed as special assistant to the athletic director at Stanford. In 2005, after then-athletic director Ted Leland stepped down, Walsh was named interim athletic director. He also acted as a consultant for his alma mater San Jose State University in their search for an athletic director and Head Football Coach in 2005.\nWalsh was also the author of three books, a motivational speaker, and taught classes at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\nWalsh was a board member for the Lott IMPACT Trophy, which is named after Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back Ronnie Lott, and is awarded annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year. Walsh served as a keynote speaker at the award's banquet.\nPersonal life.\nWalsh married his college sweetheart Geri, and had 3 children, Steve, Craig and Elizabeth.\nDeath.\nBill Walsh died of leukemia on July 30, 2007, at his home in Woodside, California.\nFollowing Walsh's death, the playing field at the former Candlestick Park was renamed \"Bill Walsh Field\". Additionally, the regular San Jose State versus Stanford football game was renamed the \"Bill Walsh Legacy Game\". Super Bowl XLII was also dedicated to Walsh's memory; at the end of the player introduction ceremonies, his son, Craig, accompanied by Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice and Steve Young, performed the ceremonial coin toss with New York Giants captain Michael Strahan, playing his final career NFL game, calling the toss on behalf of his Giants co-captains and the New England Patriots' captains.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "4168", "revid": "50662453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4168", "title": "Utility knife", "text": "Knife used for general or utility purposes\nA utility knife is any type of knife used for general manual work purposes. Such knives were originally fixed-blade knives with durable cutting edges suitable for rough work such as cutting cordage, cutting/scraping hides, butchering animals, cleaning fish scales, reshaping timber, and other tasks. Craft knives are small utility knives used as precision-oriented tools for finer, more delicate tasks such as carving and papercutting.\nToday, the term \"utility knife\" also includes small folding-, retractable- and/or replaceable-blade knives suited for use in the general workplace or in the construction industry. The latter type is sometimes generically called a Stanley knife, after a prominent brand designed by the American tool manufacturing company Stanley Works (subsequently merged into Stanley Black &amp; Decker).\nThere is also a utility knife for kitchen use, which is sized between a chef's knife and paring knife.\nHistory.\nThe fixed-blade utility knife was developed some 500,000 years ago, when human ancestors began to make stone knives. These knives were general-purpose tools, designed for cutting and shaping wooden implements, scraping hides, preparing food, and for other utilitarian purposes.\nBy the 19th century the fixed-blade utility knife had evolved into a steel-bladed outdoors field knife capable of butchering game, cutting wood, and preparing campfires and meals. With the invention of the backspring, pocket-size utility knives were introduced with folding blades and other folding tools designed to increase the utility of the overall design. The folding pocketknife and utility tool is typified by the \"Camper\" or \"Boy Scout\" pocketknife, the Swiss Army Knife, and by multi-tools fitted with knife blades. The development of stronger locking blade mechanisms for folding knives\u2014as with the Spanish navaja, the Opinel, and the Buck 110 Folding Hunter\u2014significantly increased the utility of such knives when employed for heavy-duty tasks such as preparing game or cutting through dense or tough materials.\nContemporary utility knives.\nThe fixed or folding blade utility knife is popular for both indoor and outdoor use. One of the most popular types of workplace utility knife is the retractable or folding utility knife (also known as a \"Stanley knife\", \"box cutter\", or by various other names). These types of utility knives are designed as multi-purpose cutting tools for use in a variety of trades and crafts. Designed to be lightweight and easy to carry and use, utility knives are commonly used in factories, warehouses, construction projects, and other situations where a tool is routinely needed to mark cut lines, trim plastic or wood materials, or to cut tape, cord, strapping, cardboard, or other packaging material.\nNames.\nIn British, Australian and New Zealand English, along with Dutch, Danish and Austrian German, a utility knife is referred to as a \"Stanley knife\". This name is a generic trademark named after Stanley Works, a manufacturer of such knives. In Israel and Switzerland, these knives are known as \"Japanese knives\". In Brazil they are known as \"estiletes\" or \"cortadores Olfa\" (the latter, being another genericised trademark). In Portugal, Panama and Canada they are also known as \"X-Acto\" (yet another genericised trademark ). In India, Russia, the Philippines, France, Iraq, Italy, Egypt, and Germany, they are simply called \"cutter\". In the Flemish region of Belgium it is called \"cuttermes(je)\" (cutter knife). In general Spanish, they are known as \"cortaplumas\" (penknife, when it comes to folding blades); in Spain, Mexico, and Costa Rica, they are colloquially known as \"cutters\"; in Argentina and Uruguay the segmented fixed-blade knives are known as \"Trinchetas\". In Turkey, they are known as \"maket b\u0131\u00e7a\u011f\u0131\" (which literally translates as \"model knife\").\nOther names for the tool are \"box cutter\" or \"boxcutter\", \"blade knife\", \"carpet knife\", \"pen knife\", \"stationery knife\", \"sheetrock knife\", or \"drywall knife\".\nDesign.\nUtility knives may use fixed, folding, or retractable or replaceable blades, and come in a wide variety of lengths and styles suited to the particular set of tasks they are designed to perform. Thus, an outdoors utility knife suited for camping or hunting might use a broad fixed blade, while a utility knife designed for the construction industry might feature a replaceable utility blade for cutting packaging, cutting shingles, marking cut lines, or scraping paint.\nFixed blade utility knife.\nLarge fixed-blade utility knives are most often employed in an outdoors context, such as fishing, camping, or hunting. Outdoor utility knives typically feature sturdy blades from in length, with edge geometry designed to resist chipping and breakage.\nThe term \"utility knife\" may also refer to small fixed-blade knives used for crafts, model-making and other artisanal projects. These small knives feature light-duty blades best suited for cutting thin, lightweight materials. The small, thin blade and specialized handle permit cuts requiring a high degree of precision and control.\nRetractable utility knife.\nConstruction utility knives, typically made from die-cast metal or robust molded plastic, have retractable and replaceable blades. The user of the knife can adjust the distance that the blade extends from the handle. For example, cutting the tape that seals a package without damaging the contents requires the blade to be extended slightly, while cutting the cardboard box requires the blade to be extended further forward.\nA utility blade that has become dull can be reversed or replaced with a new one. Spare or used utility blades can be stored in the handle of some utility knife models and can be accessed by removing a bolt and opening the handle. There are also models of utility knives equipped with a quick-change feature that allows blades to be replaced without additional tools. Retractable utility knives are commonly used in construction, crafting, utility and warehouse work.\nUtility knife blades.\nIt is the material to be cut that determines which type of utility blade is required to be installed in the utility knife. In standard knives can be installed different forms of blades, varying and expanding the functionality of the knife. So the standard and universal option for craft and construction work is considered a trapezoidal blade, which is suitable for drywall, cardboard, cutting flooring covering materials, and more. There are also specialized blades for cutting roofing felt, linoleum, carpeting, foam, insulation and other building materials.\nStandard blade types include:\nSnap-off utility knife.\nAnother type of utility knife is a snap-off utility knife that contains a long, segmented blade that slides out from it. As the endmost edge becomes dull, it can be broken off the remaining blade, exposing the next section, which is sharp and ready for use. The snapping is best accomplished with a blade snapper that is often built-in, or a pair of pliers, and the break occurs at the score lines, where the metal is thinnest. When all of the individual segments are used, the knife may be thrown away, or, more often, refilled with a replacement blade. \nThis design was introduced by Japanese manufacturer OLFA in 1956 as the world's first snap-off blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments. The sharp cutting edge on these knives is not on the edge where the blade is snapped off; rather one long edge of the whole blade is sharpened, and there are scored diagonal breakoff lines at intervals down the blade. Thus each snapped-off piece is roughly a parallelogram, with each long edge being a breaking edge, and one or both of the short ends being a sharpened edge.\nBox cutter knife.\nAnother utility knife often used for cutting open boxes consists of a simple sleeve around a rectangular handle into which single-edge utility blades can be inserted. The sleeve slides up and down on the handle, holding the blade in place during use and covering the blade when not in use. The blade holder may either retract or fold into the handle, much like a folding-blade pocketknife. The blade holder is designed to expose just enough edge to cut through one layer of corrugated fibreboard, to minimize chances of damaging contents of cardboard boxes.\nUse as weapon.\nMost utility knives are not well suited to use as offensive weapons, with the exception of some outdoor-type utility knives employing longer blades. However, even small blade type utility knives may sometimes find use as slashing weapons, particularly when used opportunistically due to their ubiquity. The 9/11 Commission report stated passengers in cell phone calls reported knives or \"box-cutters\" were used as weapons (also mace) in hijacking airplanes in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States, though the exact design of the knives used is unknown. Two of the hijackers were known to have purchased Leatherman knives, which feature a slip-joint blade, which were not prohibited on U.S. flights at the time. Those knives were not found in the possessions the two hijackers left behind. Similar cutters, including paper cutters, have also been known to be used as a lethal weapon.\nSmall work-type utility knives have also been used to commit robbery and other crimes. In June 2004, a Japanese student was slashed to death with a segmented-type utility knife.\nIn the United Kingdom, the law was changed (effective 1 October 2007) to raise the age limit for purchasing knives, including utility knives, from 16 to 18, and to make it illegal to carry a utility knife in public without a good reason.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4169", "revid": "24465790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4169", "title": "Bronze", "text": "Alloy of copper and tin\nBronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12\u201312.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals (including aluminium, manganese, nickel, or zinc) and sometimes non-metals (such as phosphorus) or metalloids (such as arsenic or silicon). These additions produce a range of alloys some of which are harder than copper alone or have other useful properties, such as strength, ductility, or machinability.\nThe archaeological period during which bronze was the hardest metal in widespread use is known as the Bronze Age. The beginning of the Bronze Age in western Eurasia is conventionally dated to the mid-4th millennium BCE (~3500 BCE), and to the early 2nd millennium BCE in China; elsewhere it gradually spread across regions. The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age, which started about 1300 BCE and reached most of Eurasia by about 500 BCE, although bronze continued to be much more widely used than it is in modern times.\nBecause historical artworks were often made of bronzes and brasses (alloys of copper and zinc) of different metallic compositions, modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older artworks increasingly use the generalized term \"copper alloy\" instead of the names of individual alloys. This is done (at least in part) to prevent database searches from failing merely because of errors or disagreements in the naming of historic copper alloys.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"bronze\" (1730\u20131740) is borrowed from Middle French (1511), itself borrowed from Italian 'bell metal, brass' (13th century, transcribed in Medieval Latin as ) from either:\nA Dictionary of the English Language (1746) offers: \"\"a composition of copper and tin makes bell metal; and copper and brass; melted in equal quantities, produces what the French call bronze, used for figures and statues. Chambers\".\nWebster's Dictionary (1828) offers: \"Tin united with copper in different proportions, forms bronze, bell metal, and speculum-metal. D.Olmsted\"\"\nChambers Dictionary (1872) offers: \"Bronze, bronz, n. an alloy of copper and tin, of a brown or burned colour ;\"\nHistory.\nThe discovery of bronze enabled people to create metal objects that were harder and more durable than had previously been possible. Bronze tools, weapons, armor, and building materials such as decorative tiles were harder and more durable than their stone and copper (\"Chalcolithic\") predecessors.\nThe earliest tin-copper-alloy artifact has been dated to c.\u20094650 BCE, in a Vin\u010da culture site in Plo\u010dnik (Serbia), and believed to have been smelted from a natural tin-copper ore, stannite. Other early examples date to the late 4th millennium BCE in Egypt, Susa (Iran) and some ancient sites in China, Luristan (Iran), Tepe Sialk (Iran), Mundigak (Afghanistan), and Mesopotamia (Iraq).\nCopper arsenic alloys, from naturally or artificially mixed ores of those metals, forming Arsenical copper, were found to result in a metal of a silver hue, with similarly increased strength, a lower melting point, and simpler to work, than copper. The earliest known arsenic-copper-alloy artifacts come from a Yahya Culture (Period V 3800\u20133400 BCE) site, at Tal-i-Iblis on the Iranian plateau, and were smelted from native arsenical copper and copper-arsenides, such as algodonite and domeykite.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Tin bronze was superior to arsenic copper in that the alloying process could be more easily controlled, and the resulting alloy was stronger and easier to cast. Also, unlike those of arsenic, metallic tin and the fumes from tin refining are not toxic.\nTin became the major non-copper ingredient of bronze in the late 3rd millennium BCE. Ores of copper and the far rarer tin are not often found together (exceptions include Cornwall in the United Kingdom, one ancient site in Thailand and one in Iran), so serious bronze work has always involved trade with other regions. Tin sources and trade in ancient times had a major influence on the development of cultures. In Europe, a major source of tin was the British deposits of ore in Cornwall, which were traded as far as Phoenicia in the eastern Mediterranean. In many parts of the world, large hoards of bronze artifacts are found, suggesting that bronze also represented a store of value and an indicator of social status. In Europe, large hoards of bronze tools, typically socketed axes (illustrated above), are found, which mostly show no signs of wear. With Chinese ritual bronzes, which are documented in the inscriptions they carry and from other sources, the case is clear. These were made in enormous quantities for elite burials, and also used by the living for ritual offerings.\nAn analysis of 324 metallic finds of the Indus Valley Civilisation (2600\u20131900 BCE), in the 1990s, found 67 (20%) to have some tin content, to be considered Bronze artefacts, with 26 (8%) of the artefacts having a tin content in excess of 10%, permitting casting; the source of the tin is unknown, but has been speculated to be from Bokhara or Samarkand, in Uzbekistan.\nTransition to iron.\nThough bronze, whose Vickers hardness is 60\u2013258, is generally harder than wrought iron, with a hardness of 30\u201380, the Bronze Age gave way to the Iron Age after a serious disruption of the tin trade: the population migrations of around 1200\u20131100 BCE reduced the shipment of tin around the Mediterranean and from Britain, limiting supplies and raising prices. As the art of working in iron improved, iron became cheaper and improved in quality. As later cultures advanced from hand-wrought iron to machine-forged iron (typically made with trip hammers powered by water), blacksmiths also learned how to make steel, which is stronger and harder than bronze and holds a sharper edge longer. Bronze was still used during the Iron Age and has continued in use for many purposes to the modern day.\nComposition.\nThere are many different bronze alloys, but typically modern bronze is about 88% copper and 12% tin. \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Alpha bronze\" consists of the alpha solid solution of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4\u20135% tin are used to make coins, springs, turbines and blades. Historical \"bronzes\" are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English Gloucester Candlestick is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic and an unusually large amount of silver \u2013 between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins. The 13th-century Benin Bronzes are in fact brass, and the 12th-century Romanesque Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge is sometimes described as bronze and sometimes as brass.\nDuring the Bronze Age, two forms of bronze were commonly used: \"classic bronze\", about 10% tin, was used in casting; \"mild bronze\", about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were primarily cast from classic bronze while helmets and armor were hammered from mild bronze.\nModern &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;commercial bronze (90% copper and 10% zinc) and architectural bronze (57% copper, 3% lead, 40% zinc) are more properly regarded as brass alloys because they contain zinc as the main alloying ingredient. They are commonly used in architectural applications. Plastic bronze contains a significant quantity of lead, which makes for improved plasticity, and may have been used by the ancient Greeks in ship construction. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Silicon bronze has a composition of Si: 2.80\u20133.80%, Mn: 0.50\u20131.30%, Fe: 0.80% max., Zn: 1.50% max., Pb: 0.05% max., Cu: balance. Other bronze alloys include aluminium bronze, phosphor bronze, manganese bronze, bell metal, arsenical bronze, speculum metal, bismuth bronze, and cymbal alloys.\nProperties.\nCopper-based alloys have lower melting points than steel or iron and are more readily produced from their constituent metals. They are generally about 10 percent denser than steel, although alloys using aluminium or silicon may be slightly less dense. Bronze conducts heat and electricity better than most steels. Copper-base alloys are generally more costly than steels but less so than nickel-base alloys.\nBronzes are typically ductile alloys and are considerably less brittle than cast iron. Copper and its alloys have a huge variety of uses that reflect their versatile physical, mechanical, and chemical properties. Some common examples are the high electrical conductivity of pure copper, the low-friction properties of bearing bronze, which has a high lead content of 6\u20138%, the resonant qualities of bell bronze (20% tin, 80% copper), and the resistance to corrosion by seawater of several bronze alloys.\nThe melting point of bronze is about but varies depending on the ratio of the alloy components. Bronze is usually nonmagnetic, but certain alloys containing iron or nickel may have magnetic properties. Bronze typically oxidizes only superficially; once a copper oxide (eventually becoming copper carbonate) layer is formed, the underlying metal is protected from further corrosion. This can be seen on statues from the Hellenistic period. If copper chlorides are formed, a corrosion-mode called \"bronze disease\" will eventually destroy it completely.\nUses.\nBronze, or bronze-like alloys and mixtures, were used for coins over a longer period. Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of stainless steel owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings. In the 20th century, silicon was introduced as the primary alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary statuary. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze brazing rod, which allows color-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminium is also used for the structural metal aluminium bronze.\nUnlike steel, bronze struck against a hard surface will not generate sparks, so it (along with beryllium copper) is used to make hammers, mallets, wrenches and other durable tools to be used in explosive atmospheres or in the presence of flammable vapors. Bronze is used to make bronze wool for woodworking applications where steel wool would discolor oak. Phosphor bronze is used for ships' propellers, musical instruments, and electrical contacts.\nBronze parts are tough and typically used for bearings, clips, electrical connectors and springs. Bronze also has low friction against dissimilar metals, making it important for cannons prior to modern tolerancing, where iron cannonballs would otherwise stick in the barrel.\nArchitectural bronze.\nThe Seagram Building on New York City's Park Avenue is the \"iconic glass box sheathed in bronze, designed by Mies van der Rohe.\" The Seagram Building was the first time that an entire building was sheathed in bronze. The General Bronze Corporation fabricated 3,200,000 pounds (1,600 tons) of bronze at its plant in Garden City, New York. The Seagram Building is a 38-story, 516-foot bronze-and-topaz-tinted glass building. The building looks like a \"squarish 38-story tower clad in a restrained curtain wall of metal and glass.\" \"Bronze was selected because of its color, both before and after aging, its corrosion resistance, and its extrusion properties. In 1958, it was not only the most expensive building of its time \u2014 $36 million \u2014 but it was the first building in the world with floor-to-ceiling glass walls. Mies van der Rohe achieved the crisp edges that were custom-made with specific detailing by General Bronze and \"even the screws that hold in the fixed glass-plate windows were made of brass.\"\nCoins and medals.\nBronze has also been used in coins; most \"copper\" coins are actually bronze, with about 4 percent tin and 1 percent zinc.\nAs with coins, bronze has been used in the manufacture of various types of medals for centuries, and \"bronze medals\" are known in contemporary times for being awarded for third place in sporting competitions and other events. The term is now often used for third place even when no actual bronze medal is awarded. The usage in part arose from the trio of gold, silver and bronze to represent the first three Ages of Man in Greek mythology: the Golden Age, when men lived among the gods; the Silver age, where youth lasted a hundred years; and the Bronze Age, the era of heroes. It was first adopted for a sports event at the 1904 Summer Olympics. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given rather than medals.\nBronze is the normal material for the related form of the plaquette, normally a rectangular work of art with a scene in relief, for a collectors' market.\nBronze is also associated with eighth wedding anniversaries.\nFountains and doors.\nThe largest and most ornate bronze fountain known to be cast in the world was by the Roman Bronze Works and General Bronze Corporation in 1952. The material used for the fountain, known as statuary bronze, is a quaternary alloy made of copper, zinc, tin, and lead, and traditionally golden brown in color. This was made for the Andrew W. Mellon Memorial Fountain in Federal Triangle in Washington, DC. Another example of the massive, ornate design projects of bronze, and attributed to General Bronze/Roman Bronze Works were the massive bronze doors to the United States Supreme Court Building in Washington, DC.\nLamps.\nTiffany Glass Studios, made famous by Louis C. Tiffany commonly referred to his product as favrile glass or \"Tiffany glass\", and used bronze in their artisan work for his Tiffany lamps.\nMechanical bearings and springs.\nIt is still widely used today for springs, bearings, bushings, automobile transmission pilot bearings, and similar fittings, and is particularly common in the bearings of small electric motors. Phosphor bronze is particularly suited to precision-grade bearings and springs. It is also used in guitar and piano strings. Bearings are often made of bronze for its friction properties. It can be impregnated with oil to make the proprietary Oilite and similar material for bearings. Aluminium bronze is hard and wear-resistant, and is used for bearings and machine tool ways. The Doehler Die Casting Co. of Toledo, Ohio were known for the production of Brastil, a high tensile corrosion resistant bronze alloy.\nMirrors.\nBefore it became possible to produce glass with acceptably flat surfaces, bronze was a standard material for mirrors. Bronze was used for this purpose in many parts of the world, probably based on independent discoveries. Bronze mirrors survive from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom (2040\u20131750 BCE), and China from at least c.\u2009550 BCE. In Europe, the Etruscans were making bronze mirrors in the sixth century BCE, and Greek and Roman mirrors followed the same pattern. Although other materials such as speculum metal had come into use, and Western glass mirrors had largely taken over, bronze mirrors were still being made in Japan and elsewhere in the eighteenth century, and are still made on a small scale in Kerala, India.\nMusical instruments.\nBronze is the preferred metal for bells in the form of a high tin bronze alloy known as bell metal, which is typically about 23% tin.\nNearly all professional cymbals are made from bronze, which gives a desirable balance of durability and timbre. Several types of bronze are used, commonly B20 bronze, which is roughly 20% tin, 80% copper, with traces of silver, or the tougher B8 bronze made from 8% tin and 92% copper. As the tin content in a bell or cymbal rises, the timbre drops.\nBronze is also used for the windings of steel and nylon strings of various stringed instruments such as the double bass, piano, harpsichord, and guitar. Bronze strings are commonly reserved on pianoforte for the lower pitch tones, as they possess a superior sustain quality to that of high-tensile steel.\nBronzes of various metallurgical properties are widely used in struck idiophones around the world, notably bells, singing bowls, gongs, cymbals, and other idiophones from Asia. Examples include Tibetan singing bowls, temple bells of many sizes and shapes, Javanese gamelan, and other bronze musical instruments. The earliest bronze archeological finds in Indonesia date from 1\u20132 BCE, including flat plates probably suspended and struck by a wooden or bone mallet. Ancient bronze drums from Thailand and Vietnam date back 2,000 years. Bronze bells from Thailand and Cambodia date back to 3600 BCE.\nSome companies are now making saxophones from phosphor bronze (3.5 to 10% tin and up to 1% phosphorus content). Bell bronze/B20 is used to make the tone rings of many professional model banjos. The tone ring is a heavy (usually ) folded or arched metal ring attached to a thick wood rim, over which a skin, or most often, a plastic membrane (or head) is stretched \u2013 it is the bell bronze that gives the banjo a crisp powerful lower register and clear bell-like treble register.\nSculptures.\nBronze is widely used for casting bronze sculptures. Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Then, as the bronze cools, it shrinks a little, making it easier to separate from the mould. The Assyrian king Sennacherib (704\u2013681 BCE) claims to have been the first to cast monumental bronze statues (of up to 30 tonnes) using two-part moulds instead of the lost-wax method.\nBronze statues were regarded as the highest form of sculpture in Ancient Greek art, though survivals are few, as bronze objects were frequently melted down for reuse throughout the Classical period. Many of the most famous Greek bronze sculptures are known through Roman copies in marble, which were more likely to survive.\nIn India, bronze sculptures from the Kushana (Chausa hoard) and Gupta periods (Brahma from Mirpur-Khas, Akota Hoard, Sultanganj Buddha) and later periods (Hansi Hoard) have been found. Indian Hindu artisans from the period of the Chola empire in Tamil Nadu used bronze to create intricate statues via the lost-wax casting method with ornate detailing depicting the deities of Hinduism. The art form survives to this day, with many silpis, craftsmen, working in the areas of Swamimalai and Chennai.\nIn antiquity other cultures also produced works of high art using bronze. For example, in Europe, Grecian bronzes typically of figures from Greek mythology; in east Asia, Chinese ritual bronzes of the Shang and Zhou dynasty\u2014more often ceremonial vessels but including some figurine examples. Bronze continues into modern times as one of the materials of choice for monumental statuary.\nThe medieval and early-modern Castings of the Benin Empire (13\u201319th century CE), that are often labelled Bronzes, are technically cast, from an often leaded, Brass alloy.\nBiblical references.\nThere are over 125 references to copper and its alloys () in the Bible. In the King James Version, it was translated as \"brass\". However, the ancient Hebrews are thought to not have had the capability to process zinc, which is needed to make brass. It is likely that \"\u05e0\u05d7\u05d5\u05e9\u05ea\" refers to copper and its alloys with tin, now called bronze, which is what modern translations use. Bronze was used widely in the Tabernacle for items such as the bronze altar (Exodus Ch. 27), bronze laver (Exodus Ch. 30), utensils, and mirror (Exodus Ch. 38). It was mentioned in the account of Moses holding up a bronze snake on a pole in Numbers Ch. 21. In I Kings, it is mentioned that Hiram I was very skilled in working with bronze, and he made many furnishings for Solomon's Temple including pillars, capitals, stands, wheels, bowls, and plates, some of which were highly decorative (see I Kings 7:13-47). Bronze was also widely used as battle armor and helmet, as in the battle of David and Goliath in I Samuel 17:5-6;38 (also see II Chron. 12:10).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name is a portmanteau formed from joining the first few letters of each country's name and was first used to name the customs agreement that initiated the union (signed in 1944). It is now used more generally to refer to the geographic, economic, and cultural grouping of the three countries.\nThe Benelux is an economically dynamic and densely populated region, with 5.6% of the European population (29.55 million residents) and 7.9% of the joint EU GDP (\u20ac36,000/resident) on 1.7% of the whole surface of the EU. In 2015, 37% of the total number of EU cross-border workers worked in the Benelux; 35,000 Belgian residents work in Luxembourg, while 37,000 others cross the border to work in the Netherlands each day. In addition, 12,000 Dutch and close to a thousand Luxembourg residents work in Belgium.\nThe main institutions of the Union are the Committee of Ministers, the Council of the Union, the General Secretariat, the Interparliamentary Consultative Council and the Benelux Court of Justice the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property (BOIP) covers the same land but is not part of the Benelux Union. However, as from June 2018, the Benelux Court of Justice has the competence to judge BOIP's decisions in appeal.\nThe Benelux General Secretariat is located in Brussels. It is the central platform of the Benelux Union cooperation. It handles the secretariat of the Committee of Ministers, the Council of Benelux Union and the sundry committees and working parties. The General Secretariat provides day-to-day support for the Benelux cooperation on the substantive, procedural, diplomatic and logistical levels. The Secretary-General is Frans Weekers from the Netherlands and there are two deputies: Deputy Secretary-General Michel-Etienne Tilemans from Belgium and Deputy Secretary-General Jean-Claude Meyer from Luxembourg.\nThe presidency of the Benelux is held in turn by the three countries for a period of one year. Luxembourg holds the presidency for 2025.\nAbout 80 percent of the Benelux population speaks Dutch, about 20 percent speaks French and one percent Luxembourgish as their native language. A small minority under one percent are native German speakers.\nHistory.\nIn 1944, exiled representatives of the three countries signed the London Customs Convention, the treaty that established the Benelux Customs Union. Ratified in 1947, the treaty was in force from 1948 until it was superseded by the Benelux Economic Union. The initial form of economic cooperation expanded steadily over time, leading to the signing of the treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union (\"Benelux Economische Unie\", \"Union \u00c9conomique Benelux\") on 3 February 1958 in The Hague, which came into force on 1 November 1960. Initially, the purpose of cooperation among the three partners was to put an end to customs barriers at their borders and ensure free movement of persons, capital, services, and goods between the three countries. This treaty was the first example of international economic integration in Europe since the Second World War.\nThe three countries therefore foreshadowed and provided the model for future European integration, such as the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic Community (EEC), and the European Community\u2013European Union (EC\u2013EU). The three partners also launched the Schengen process, which came into operation in 1985. Benelux cooperation has been constantly adapted and now goes much further than mere economic cooperation, extending to new and topical policy areas connected with security, sustainable development, and the economy. \nIn 1965, the treaty establishing a Benelux Court of Justice was signed. It entered into force in 1974. The court, composed of judges from the highest courts of the three states, has to guarantee the uniform interpretation of common legal rules. This international judicial institution is located in Luxembourg.\nRenewal of the agreement.\nThe 1958 Treaty between the Benelux countries establishing the Benelux Economic Union was limited to a period of 50 years. During the following years, and even more so after the creation of the European Union, the Benelux cooperation focused on developing other fields of activity within a constantly changing international context.\nAt the end of the 50 years, the governments of the three Benelux countries decided to renew the agreement, taking into account the new aspects of the Benelux-cooperation \u2013 such as security \u2013 and the new federal government structure of Belgium. The original establishing treaty, set to expire in 2010, was replaced by a new legal framework (called the Treaty revising the Treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union), which was signed on 17 June 2008.\nThe new treaty has no set time limit and the name of the \"Benelux Economic Union\" changed to \"Benelux Union\" to reflect the broad scope on the union. The main objectives of the treaty are the continuation and enlargement of the cooperation between the three member states within a larger European context. The renewed treaty explicitly foresees the possibility that the Benelux countries will cooperate with other European member states or with regional cooperation structures. The new Benelux cooperation focuses on three main topics: internal market and economic union, sustainability, justice and internal affairs. The number of structures in the renewed Treaty has been reduced and thus simplified.\nBenefits of the Benelux cooperation.\nThe Benelux Union also serves as a testing ground for European cooperation. Initiatives such as diploma recognition and cross-border truck inspections set an example for further European harmonization.\nBenelux pilot projects 2025.\nActivities since 2008.\nBenelux seeks region-to-region cooperation, be it with France and Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia) or beyond with the Baltic states, the Nordic Council, the Visegrad countries, or even further. In 2018, a renewed political declaration was adopted between Benelux and North Rhine-Westphalia to give cooperation a further impetus.\nThe Benelux is particularly active in the field of intellectual property. The three countries established a Benelux Trademarks Office and a Benelux Designs Office, both situated in The Hague. In 2005, they concluded a treaty establishing the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property, which replaced both offices upon its entry into force on 1 September 2006. This organisation is the official body for the registration of trademarks and designs in the Benelux. In addition, it offers the possibility to formally record the existence of ideas, concepts, designs, prototypes and the like.\nSome examples of recent Benelux initiatives include: automatic level recognition of diplomas and degrees within the Benelux for bachelor's and master's programs in 2015, and for all other degrees in 2018; common road inspections in 2014; and a Benelux pilot with digital consignment notes (e-CMR) in 2017; a new Benelux Treaty on Police Cooperation in 2018, providing for direct access to each other's police databases and population registers within the limits of national legislation, and allowing some police forces to cross borders in some situations. The Benelux is also committed to working together on adaptation to climate change. A joint political declaration in July 2020 called on the European Commission to prioritise cycling in European climate policy and Sustainable Transport strategies, to co-finance the construction of cycling infrastructure, and to provide funds to stimulate cycling policy.\nOn 5 June 2018, the Benelux Treaty celebrated its 60 years of existence. In 2018, a Benelux Youth Parliament was created.\nIn addition to cooperation based on a Treaty, there is also political cooperation in the Benelux context, including summits of the Benelux government leaders. In 2019 a Benelux summit was held in Luxembourg. In 2020, a Benelux summit was held \u2013 online, due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 under Dutch Presidency on 7 October between the prime ministers.\nAs of 1 January 2017, a new arrangement for NATO Air Policing started for the airspace of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg (Benelux). The Belgian Air Component and the Royal Netherlands Air Force will take four-month turns to ensure that Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) fighter jets are available at all times to be launched under NATO control.\nCooperation with other geopolitical regions.\nThe Benelux countries also work together in the so-called Pentalateral Energy Forum, a regional cooperation group formed of five members\u2014the Benelux states, France, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Formed on 6 June 2007, the ministers for energy from the various countries represent a total of 200 million residents and 40% of the European electricity network.\nIn 2017 the members of the Benelux, the Baltic Assembly, three members of the Nordic Council (Sweden, Denmark and Finland), and all the other countries EU member states, sought to increase cooperation in the Digital Single Market, as well as discussing social matters, the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, immigration and defence cooperation. Foreign relations in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea and the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum were also on the agenda.\nSince 2008 the Benelux Union works together with the German Land (state) North Rhine-Westphalia.\nIn 2018 Benelux Union signed a declaration with France to strengthen cross-border cooperation.\nPolitics.\nBenelux institutions.\nUnder the 2008 treaty there are five Benelux institutions: the Benelux Committee of Ministers, the Benelux Council, the Benelux Parliament, the Benelux Court of Justice, the Benelux Secretariat General. Beside these five institutions, the Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property is also an independent organisation.\nBenelux Committee of Ministers:\nThe Committee of Ministers is the supreme decision-making body of the Benelux. It includes at least one representative at ministerial level from the three countries. Its composition varies according to its agenda. The ministers determine the orientations and priorities of Benelux cooperation. The presidency of the Committee rotates between the three countries on an annual basis.\nBenelux Council:\nThe council is composed of senior officials from the relevant ministries. Its composition varies according to its agenda. The council's main task is to prepare the dossiers for the ministers.\nBenelux InterParliamentary Consultative Council:\nThe Benelux Parliament (officially referred to as an \"Interparliamentary Consultative Council\") was created in 1955. This parliamentary assembly is composed of 49 members from the respective national parliaments (21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21 members of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the Luxembourg parliament). Its members inform and advise their respective governments on all Benelux matters. On 20 January 2015, the governments of the three countries, including, as far as Belgium is concerned, the community and regional governments, signed in Brussels the Treaty of the Benelux Interparliamentary Assembly. This treaty entered into force on 1 August 2019. This superseded the 1955 Convention on the Consultative Interparliamentary Council for the Benelux. The official name has been largely obsolete in daily practice for a number of years: both internally in the Benelux and in external references, the name Benelux Parliament has been used \"de facto\" for a number of years now.\nBenelux Court of Justice:\nThe Benelux Court of Justice is an international court. Its mission is to promote uniformity in the application of Benelux legislation. When faced with difficulty interpreting a common Benelux legal rule, national courts must seek an interpretive ruling from the Benelux Court, which subsequently renders a binding decision. The members of the Court are appointed from among the judges of the 'Cour de cassation' of Belgium, the 'Hoge Raad of the Netherlands' and the 'Cour de cassation' of Luxembourg.\nBenelux General Secretariat:\nThe General Secretariat, which is based in Brussels, forms the cooperation platform of the Benelux Union. It acts as the secretariat of the Committee of Ministers, the council and various commissions and working groups. The General Secretariat has years of expertise in the area of Benelux cooperation and is familiar with the policy agreements and differences between the three countries. Building on what already been achieved, the General Secretariat puts its knowledge, network and experience at the service of partners and stakeholders who endorse its mission. It initiates, supports and monitors cooperation results in the areas of economy, sustainability and security.\nThe Secretary General of the Benelux is Frans Weekers (NL), the Deputy Secretary General is Michel-Etienne Tilemans (BE) and Jean-Claude Meyer (LU)\nBenelux works together on the basis of an annual plan embedded in a four-year joint work programme.\nBenelux legal instruments.\nThe Benelux Union involves intergovernmental cooperation.\nThe Treaty establishing the Benelux Union explicitly provides that the Benelux Committee of Ministers can resort to four legal instruments (art. 6, paragraph 2, under a), f), g) and h)):\n1. Decisions\nDecisions are legally binding regulations for implementing the Treaty establishing the Benelux Union or other Benelux treaties.\nTheir legally binding force concerns the Benelux states (and their sub-state entities), which have to implement them. However, they have no direct effect towards individual citizens or companies (notwithstanding any indirect protection of their rights based on such decisions as a source of international law). Only national provisions implementing a decision can directly create rights and obligations for citizens or companies.\n2. Agreements\nThe Committee of Ministers can draw up agreements, which are then submitted to the Benelux states (and/or their sub-state entities) for signature and subsequent parliamentary ratification. These agreements can deal with any subject matter, also in policy areas that are not yet covered by cooperation in the framework of the Benelux Union.\nThese are in fact traditional treaties, with the same direct legally binding force towards both authorities and citizens or companies. The negotiations do however take place in the established context of the Benelux working groups and institutions, rather than on an ad hoc basis.\n3. Recommendations\nRecommendations are non-binding orientations, adopted at ministerial level, which underpin the functioning of the Benelux Union. These (policy) orientations may not be legally binding, but given their adoption at the highest political level and their legal basis vested directly in the Treaty, they do entail a strong moral obligation for any authority concerned in the Benelux countries.\n4. Directives\nDirectives of the Committee of Ministers are mere inter-institutional instructions towards the Benelux Council and/or the Secretariat-General, for which they are binding. This instrument has so far only been used occasionally, basically in order to organize certain activities within a Benelux working group or to give them impetus.\nAll four instruments require the unanimous approval of the members of the Committee of Ministers (and, in the case of agreements, subsequent signature and ratification at national level).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1846 and is one of the oldest daily newspapers in the United States. It has been awarded eight Pulitzer Prizes in its history, including four for editorial writing and three for photography before it was converted to tabloid format in 1981.\nIn December 2017, the \"Herald\" filed for bankruptcy. On February 14, 2018, Digital First Media successfully bid $11.9 million to purchase the company in a bankruptcy auction; the acquisition was completed on March 19, 2018. As of August 2018, the paper had approximately 110 total employees, compared to about 225 before the sale.\nHistory.\nThe \"Herald\"'s history traces back through two lineages, the \"Daily Advertiser\" and the old \"Boston Herald\", and two media moguls, William Randolph Hearst and Rupert Murdoch.\nFounding.\nThe original \"Boston Herald\" was founded in 1846 by a group of Boston printers jointly under the name of John A. French &amp; Company. The paper was published as a single two-sided sheet, selling for one cent. Its first editor, William O. Eaton, just 22 years old, said \"The \"Herald\" will be independent in politics and religion; liberal, industrious, enterprising, critically concerned with literacy and dramatic matters, and diligent in its mission to report and analyze the news, local and global.\"\nIn 1847, the \"Boston Herald\" absorbed the Boston \"American Eagle\".\n\"The Boston Herald and Boston Journal\".\nIn October 1917, John H. Higgins, the publisher and treasurer of the Boston Herald bought out its next door neighbor \"The Boston Journal\" and created \"The Boston Herald and Boston Journal\"\n\"The American Traveler\".\nEven earlier than the \"Herald\", the weekly \"American Traveler\" was founded in 1825 as a bulletin for stagecoach listings.\nThe \"Boston Evening Traveller\".\nThe \"Boston Evening Traveler\" was founded in 1845. The \" Boston Evening Traveler\" was the successor to the weekly \"American Traveler\" and the semi-weekly \"Boston Traveler\". In 1912, the \"Herald\" acquired the \"Traveler\", continuing to publish both under their own names. For many years, the newspaper was controlled by many of the investors in United Shoe Machinery Corporation. After a newspaper strike in 1967, Herald-Traveler Corp. suspended the afternoon \"Traveler\" and absorbed the evening edition into the Herald to create the \"Boston Herald Traveler.\"\n\"The Boston Daily Advertiser\".\nThe \"Boston Daily Advertiser\" was established in 1813 in Boston by Nathan Hale. The paper grew to prominence throughout the 19th century, taking over other Boston area papers. In 1832 The Advertiser took over control of \"The Boston Patriot\", and then in 1840 it took over and absorbed \"The Boston Gazette\". The paper was purchased by William Randolph Hearst in 1917. In 1920 the \"Advertiser\" was merged with \"The Boston Record\", initially the combined newspaper was called the \"Boston Advertiser\" however when the combined newspaper became an illustrated tabloid in 1921 it was renamed \"The Boston American\". Hearst Corp. continued using the name \"Advertiser\" for its Sunday paper until the early 1970s.\n\"The Boston Record\".\nOn September 3, 1884, \"The Boston Evening Record\" was started by the \"Boston Advertiser\" as a campaign newspaper. The \"Record\" was so popular that it was made a permanent publication.\n\"The Boston American\".\nIn 1904, William Randolph Hearst began publishing his own newspaper in Boston called \"The American\". Hearst ultimately ended up purchasing the \"Daily Advertiser\" in 1917. By 1938, the \"Daily Advertiser\" had changed to the \"Daily Record\", and \"The American\" had become the \"Sunday Advertiser\". A third paper owned by Hearst, called the \"Afternoon Record\", which had been renamed the \"Evening American\", merged in 1961 with the \"Daily Record\" to form the \"Record American\". The \"Sunday Advertiser\" and \"Record American\" would ultimately be merged in 1972 into \"The Boston Herald Traveler\" a line of newspapers that stretched back to the old \"Boston Herald\".https://\n\"The Boston Herald Traveler\".\nIn 1946, Herald-Traveler Corporation acquired Boston radio station WHDH. Two years later, WHDH-FM was licensed, and on November 26, 1957, WHDH-TV made its debut as an ABC affiliate on channel 5. In 1961, WHDH-TV's affiliation switched to CBS. The television station operated for years beginning some time after under temporary authority from the Federal Communications Commission. Controversy arose over luncheon meetings the newspaper's chief executive purportedly had with John C. Doerfer, chairman of the FCC between 1957 and 1960, who served as a commissioner during the original licensing process. (Some Boston broadcast historians accuse \"The Boston Globe\" of being covertly behind the proceeding as a sort of vendetta for not getting a license\u2014The \"Herald Traveler\" was Republican in sympathies, and the \"Globe\" then had a firm policy of not endorsing political candidates, although Doerfer's history at the FCC also lent suspicions.) The FCC ordered comparative hearings, and in 1969 a competing applicant, Boston Broadcasters, Inc., was granted a construction permit to replace WHDH-TV on channel 5. Herald-Traveler Corporation fought the decision in court\u2014by this time, revenues from channel 5 were all but keeping the newspaper afloat\u2014but lost its final appeal. On March 19, 1972, WHDH-TV was forced to surrender channel 5 to the new WCVB-TV.\n\"The Boston Herald Traveler and Record American\".\nWithout a television station to subsidize the newspaper, the \"Herald Traveler\" was no longer able to remain in business, and the newspaper was sold to Hearst Corporation, which published the rival all-day newspaper, the \"Record American\". The two papers were merged to become an all-day paper called the \"Boston Herald Traveler and Record American\" in the morning and \"Record American and Boston Herald Traveler\" in the afternoon. The first editions published under the new combined name were those of June 19, 1972. The afternoon edition was soon dropped and the unwieldy name shortened to \"Boston Herald American\", with the Sunday edition called the \"Sunday Herald Advertiser\". The \"Herald American\" was printed in broadsheet format, and failed to target a particular readership; where the \"Record American\" had been a typical city tabloid, the \"Herald Traveler\" was a Republican paper.\nMurdoch purchases \"The Herald American\".\nThe \"Herald American\" converted to tabloid format in September 1981, but Hearst faced steep declines in circulation and advertising. The company announced it would close the \"Herald American\"\u2014making Boston a one-newspaper town\u2014on December 3, 1982. When the deadline came, Australian-born media baron Rupert Murdoch was negotiating to buy the paper and save it. He closed on the deal after 31 hours of talks with Hearst and newspaper unions\u2014and five hours after Hearst had sent out notices to newsroom employees telling them they were terminated. The newspaper announced its own survival the next day with a full-page headline: \"You Bet We're Alive!\"\nThe \"Boston Herald\".\nMurdoch changed the paper's name back to the \"Boston Herald\". The \"Herald\" continued to grow, expanding its coverage and increasing its circulation until 2001, when nearly all newspapers fell victim to declining circulations and revenue.\nIndependent ownership.\nIn February 1994, Murdoch's News Corporation was forced to sell the paper, in order that its subsidiary Fox Television Stations could legally consummate its purchase of Fox affiliate WFXT (Channel 25) because Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy included language in an appropriations bill barring one company from owning a newspaper and television station in the same market. Patrick J. Purcell, who was the publisher of the \"Boston Herald\" and a former News Corporation executive, purchased the \"Herald\" and established it as an independent newspaper. Several years later, Purcell would give the \"Herald\" a suburban presence it never had by purchasing the money-losing Community Newspaper Company from Fidelity Investments. Although the companies merged under the banner of Herald Media, Inc., the suburban papers maintained their distinct editorial and marketing identity.\nAfter years of operating profits at Community Newspaper and losses at the \"Herald\", Purcell in 2006 sold the suburban chain to newspaper conglomerate Liberty Group Publishing of Illinois, which soon after changed its name to GateHouse Media. The deal, which also saw GateHouse acquiring \"The Patriot Ledger\" and \"The Enterprise\" respectively in south suburban Quincy and Brockton, netted $225 million for Purcell, who vowed to use the funds to clear the \"Herald\"'s debt and reinvest in the Paper.\nBoston Herald Radio.\nOn August 5, 2013, the \"Herald\" launched an internet radio station named Boston Herald Radio, which includes shows hosted by much of the \"Herald\" staff. The station's morning lineup is simulcast on 830 AM WCRN from 10 am Eastern time to 12 noon Eastern time.\nBankruptcy.\nIn December 2017, the \"Herald\" announced plans to sell itself to GateHouse Media after filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The deal was scheduled to be completed by February 2018, with the new company streamlining and having layoffs in coming months. However, in early January 2018, another potential buyer, Revolution Capital Group of Los Angeles, filed a bid with the federal bankruptcy court; the \"Herald\" reported in a press release that \"the court requires BHI [Boston Herald, Inc.] to hold an auction to allow all potential buyers an opportunity to submit competing offers.\"\nDigital First Media acquisition.\nIn February 2018, acquisition of the \"Herald\" by Digital First Media for almost $12 million was approved by the bankruptcy court judge in Delaware. The new owner, DFM, said they would be keeping 175 of the approximately 240 employees the \"Herald\" had when it sought bankruptcy protection in December 2017. The acquisition was completed on March 19, 2018.\nThe Herald and parent DFM were criticized for ending the ten-year printing contract with competitor \"The Boston Globe\", moving printing from Taunton, Massachusetts, to Rhode Island and its \"dehumanizing cost-cutting efforts\" in personnel. In June, some design and advertising layoffs were expected, with work moving to a sister paper, \"The Denver Post\". The \"consolidation\" took effect in August, with nine jobs eliminated.\nIn late August 2018, it was announced that the \"Herald\" would move its offices from Boston's Seaport District to Braintree, Massachusetts, in late November or early December.\nOn October 27, 2020, the \"Boston Herald\" endorsed Donald Trump for the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election.\nIn July 2024, the newspaper laid off three employees. It is not publicly known how many people still work at the \"Boston Herald\", but the newsroom in 2020 consisted of 24 employees. A few years prior, the paper employed 240 people.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n Boston Herald July 29, 1998"}

Nicknamed \"the Bambino\" and \"the Sultan of Swat\", he began his MLB career as a star left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1936, Ruth was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame as one of its \"first five\" members.\nAt age seven, Ruth was sent to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play Minor League baseball for the Baltimore Orioles but was soon sold to the Red Sox. By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the dead-ball era. Although Ruth twice won 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three World Series championship teams with the Red Sox, he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, he broke the MLB single-season home run record in 1919 with 29.\nAfter that season, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy. The trade fueled Boston's subsequent 86-year championship drought and popularized the \"Curse of the Bambino\" superstition. In his 15 years with the Yankees, Ruth helped the team win seven American League (AL) pennants and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport's popularity but also helped usher in baseball's live-ball era, which evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor. As part of the Yankees' vaunted \"Murderers' Row\" lineup of 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs, which extended his own MLB single-season record by a single home run. Ruth's last season with the Yankees was 1934, and he retired after a short stint with the Boston Braves the following year. In his career, he led the American League (AL) in home runs 12 times.\nDuring Ruth's career, he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. After his retirement as a player, he was denied the opportunity to manage a major league club, most likely because of poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with nasopharyngeal cancer and died from the disease two years later. Ruth remains a major figure in American culture.\nEarly life.\nGeorge Herman Ruth Jr. was born on February 6, 1895, at 216 Emory Street in the Pigtown neighborhood of Baltimore, in a house which belonged to his maternal grandfather Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and trade unionist. Ruth's parents, Katherine (n\u00e9e\u00a0Schamberger) and George Herman Ruth Sr., were both of German ancestry. Ruth Sr. worked a series of jobs that included lightning rod salesman and streetcar operator. The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business. Only one of Ruth's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.\nMany details of Ruth's childhood are unknown. As a child, Ruth spoke German. When Ruth was a toddler, the family moved to 339 South Woodyear Street; by the time he was six years old, his father had a saloon with an upstairs apartment at 426 West Camden Street. Details are equally scanty about why Ruth was sent at the age of seven to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a reformatory and orphanage. However, according to Julia Ruth Stevens' recount in 1999, because George Sr. was a saloon owner and had given Ruth little supervision, he became a delinquent. Ruth was sent to St. Mary's because George Sr. ran out of ideas to discipline his son. As an adult, Ruth admitted that as a youth he ran the streets, rarely attended school, and drank beer when his father was not looking. Some accounts say that following a violent incident at his father's saloon, the city authorities decided that this environment was unsuitable for a child. Ruth entered St. Mary's on June 13, 1902. He was recorded as \"incorrigible\" and spent much of the next 12 years there.\nAlthough St. Mary's boys received an education, students were also expected to learn work skills and help operate the school, particularly once the boys turned 12. Ruth became a shirtmaker and was also a proficient carpenter. He would adjust his own shirt collars, even during his well-paid baseball career. The boys, aged 5 to 21, did most of the work around the facility, and renovated St. Mary's in 1912. The food was simple, and the Xaverian Brothers who ran the school insisted on strict discipline; corporal punishment was common. Ruth's nickname there was \"Niggerlips\", as he had large facial features and was darker than most boys at the all-white reformatory.\nRuth was sometimes allowed to rejoin his family or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with work in the community, but he was always returned to St. Mary's. He was rarely visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and, by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Mary's only to attend the funeral. How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St. Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking windows with long hits while playing street ball; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St. Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a catcher even though left-handers rarely play that position. During his time there he also played third base and shortstop, again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear gloves made for right-handers. He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier. Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness. For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's. Ruth stated, \"I think I was born as a hitter the first day I ever saw him hit a baseball.\" The older man became a mentor and role model to Ruth; biographer Robert W. Creamer commented on the closeness between the two:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe school's influence remained with Ruth in other ways. He was a lifelong Catholic who would sometimes attend Mass after carousing all night, and he became a well-known member of the Knights of Columbus. He would visit orphanages, schools, and hospitals throughout his life, often avoiding publicity. He was generous to St. Mary's as he became famous and rich, donating money and his presence at fundraisers, and spending $5,000 to buy Brother Matthias a Cadillac in 1926\u2014subsequently replacing it when it was destroyed in an accident. Nevertheless, his biographer Leigh Montville suggests that many of the off-the-field excesses of Ruth's career were driven by the deprivations of his time at St. Mary's.\nMost of the boys at St. Mary's played baseball in organized leagues at different levels of proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions at one time or another, he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on community teams. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.\nProfessional baseball.\nMinor leagues: Baltimore Orioles.\nIn early 1914, Ruth signed a professional baseball contract with Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing are not known with certainty. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to be punished, and then returning to pitch St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21, though SportsCentury stated in a documentary that Ruth had already been discharged from St. Mary's when he turned 19, and earned a monthly salary of $100.\nThe train journey to spring training in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in early March was likely Ruth's first outside the Baltimore area. The rookie ballplayer was the subject of various pranks by veteran players, who were probably also the source of his famous nickname. There are various accounts of how Ruth came to be called \"Babe\", but most center on his being referred to as \"Dunnie's babe\" (or some variant). SportsCentury reported that his nickname was gained because he was the new \"darling\" or \"project\" of Dunn, not only because of Ruth's raw talent, but also because of his lack of knowledge of the proper etiquette of eating out in a restaurant, being in a hotel, or being on a train. \"Babe\" was, at that time, a common nickname in baseball, with perhaps the most famous to that point being Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher and 1909 World Series hero Babe Adams, who appeared younger than his actual age.\nRuth made his first appearance as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop and pitched the last two innings of a 15\u20139 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by Jim Thorpe in Fayetteville. Ruth made his first appearance against a team in organized baseball in an exhibition game versus the major-league Philadelphia Phillies. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In a game against the Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest of the way. The Orioles scored seven runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to overcome a 6\u20130 deficit, and Ruth was the winning pitcher.\nOnce the regular season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also dangerous at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the Federal League, had begun play, and the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored that city to the major leagues for the first time since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.\nThe competition from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses. Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to Richmond, Virginia, as well as the sale of a minority interest in the club. These possibilities fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money. He offered Ruth to the reigning World Series champions, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, but Mack had his own financial problems. The Cincinnati Reds and New York Giants expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers Ernie Shore and Ben Egan, to the Boston Red Sox of the American League (AL) on July 4. The sale price was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11.\nBoston Red Sox (1914\u20131919).\nDeveloping star.\nOn July 11, 1914, Ruth arrived in Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later told the story of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who would become his first wife. She was a 16-year-old waitress at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when he began to court his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4\u20133, over the Cleveland Naps. His catcher was Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a start by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. In his major league debut as a batter, Ruth went 0-for-2 against left-hander Willie Mitchell, striking out in his first at bat before being removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, begin a legendary comeback that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the 1914 World Series championship.\nEgan was traded to Cleveland after two weeks on the Boston roster. During his time with the Red Sox, he kept an eye on the inexperienced Ruth, much as Dunn had in Baltimore. When he was traded, no one took his place as supervisor. Ruth's new teammates considered him brash and would have preferred him as a rookie to remain quiet and inconspicuous. When Ruth insisted on taking batting practice despite being both a rookie who did not play regularly and a pitcher, he arrived to find his bats sawed in half. His teammates nicknamed him \"the Big Baboon\", a name the swarthy Ruth, who had disliked the nickname \"Niggerlips\" at St. Mary's, detested. Ruth had received a raise on promotion to the major leagues and quickly acquired tastes for fine food, liquor, and women, among other temptations.\nManager Carrigan allowed Ruth to pitch two exhibition games in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, he was not restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends\u2014incorporated into the 1948 film \"The Babe Ruth Story\"\u2014that Ruth had a habit of signaling his intent to throw a curveball by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and needing to break this habit would not constitute a reason to not use him at all; Creamer suggested Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to the rookie's poor behavior.\nOn July 30, 1914, Boston owner Joseph Lannin had purchased the minor-league Providence Grays, members of the International League. The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the Detroit Tigers, including star hitter Ty Cobb, and as part of the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays. This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann claimed him by waiver. After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop as a player, and would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent to the minors. Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence to make him a better player, but to help the Grays win the International League pennant (league championship).\nRuth joined the Grays on August 18, 1914. After Dunn's deals, the Baltimore Orioles managed to hold on to first place until August 15, after which they continued to fade, leaving the pennant race between Providence and Rochester. Ruth was deeply impressed by Providence manager \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, previously a star pitcher with a 25\u20134 win\u2013loss record for Detroit in 1907; in later years, he credited Donovan with teaching him much about pitching. Ruth was often called upon to pitch, in one stretch starting (and winning) four games in eight days. On September 5 at Maple Leaf Park in Toronto, Ruth pitched a one-hit 9\u20130 victory, and hit his first professional home run, his only one as a minor leaguer, off Ellis Johnson. Recalled to Boston after Providence finished the season in first place, he pitched and won a game for the Red Sox against the New York Yankees on October 2, getting his first major league hit, a double. Ruth finished the season with a record of 2\u20131 as a major leaguer and 23\u20138 in the International League (for Baltimore and Providence). Once the season concluded, Ruth married Helen in Ellicott City, Maryland. Creamer speculated that they did not marry in Baltimore, where the newlyweds boarded with George Ruth Sr., to avoid possible interference from those at St. Mary's\u2014both bride and groom were not yet of age and Ruth remained on parole from that institution until his 21st birthday.\nIn March 1915, Ruth reported to Hot Springs, Arkansas, for his first major league spring training. Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two \"superb\" left-handed pitchers, according to Creamer: the established stars Dutch Leonard, who had broken the record for the lowest earned run average (ERA) in a single season; and Ray Collins, a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good relief appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. Ruth took a 3\u20132 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4\u20133 in 13 innings. Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in right field off of Jack Warhop. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher to give up a home run to Babe Ruth.\nCarrigan was sufficiently impressed by Ruth's pitching to give him a spot in the starting rotation. Ruth finished the 1915 season 18\u20138 as a pitcher; as a hitter, he batted .315 and had four home runs. The Red Sox won the AL pennant, but with the pitching staff healthy, Ruth was not called upon to pitch in the 1915 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Boston won in five games. Ruth was used as a pinch hitter in Game Five, but grounded out against Phillies ace Grover Cleveland Alexander. Despite his success as a pitcher, Ruth was acquiring a reputation for long home runs; at Sportsman's Park against the St. Louis Browns, a Ruth hit soared over Grand Avenue, breaking the window of a Chevrolet dealership.\nIn 1916, attention focused on Ruth's pitching as he engaged in repeated pitching duels with Washington Senators' ace Walter Johnson. The two met five times during the season with Ruth winning four and Johnson one (Ruth had a no decision in Johnson's victory). Two of Ruth's victories were by the score of 1\u20130, one in a 13-inning game. Of the 1\u20130 shutout decided without extra innings, AL president Ban Johnson stated, \"That was one of the best ball games I have ever seen.\" For the season, Ruth went 23\u201312, with a 1.75 ERA and nine shutouts, both of which led the league. Ruth's nine shutouts in 1916 set a league record for left-handers that would remain unmatched until Ron Guidry tied it in 1978. The Red Sox won the pennant and World Series again, this time defeating the Brooklyn Robins (as the Dodgers were then known) in five games. Ruth started and won Game 2, 2\u20131, in 14 innings. Until another game of that length was played in 2005, this was the longest World Series game, and Ruth's pitching performance is still the longest postseason complete game victory.\nCarrigan retired as player and manager after 1916, returning to his native Maine to be a businessman. Ruth, who played under four managers who are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, always maintained that Carrigan, who is not enshrined there, was the best skipper he ever played for. There were other changes in the Red Sox organization that offseason, as Lannin sold the team to a three-man group headed by New York theatrical promoter Harry Frazee. Jack Barry was hired by Frazee as manager.\nEmergence as a hitter.\nRuth pitched a league-leading 35 complete games and went 24\u201313 with a 2.01 ERA and six shutouts in 1917, but the Sox finished in second place in the league, nine games behind the Chicago White Sox in the standings. On June 23 at Washington, when home plate umpire 'Brick' Owens called the first four pitches as balls, Ruth was ejected from the game and threw a punch at him, and was later suspended for ten days and fined $100. Ernie Shore was called in to relieve Ruth, and was allowed eight warm-up pitches. The runner who had reached base on the walk was caught stealing, and Shore retired all 26 batters he faced to win the game. Shore's feat was listed as a perfect game for many years. In 1991, Major League Baseball's (MLB) Committee on Statistical Accuracy amended it to be listed as a combined no-hitter. In 1917, Ruth was used little as a batter, other than for his plate appearances while pitching, and hit .325 with two home runs.\nThe United States' entry into World War I occurred at the start of the season and overshadowed baseball. Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players in the big leagues were of draft age. This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the Naval Reserve in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called up after the 1917 season. Frazee hired International League President Ed Barrow as Red Sox manager. Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally. With the major leagues shorthanded because of the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.\nRuth also noticed these vacancies in the lineup. He was dissatisfied in the role of a pitcher who appeared every four or five days and wanted to play every day at another position. Barrow used Ruth at first base and in the outfield during the exhibition season, but he restricted him to pitching as the team moved toward Boston and the season opener. At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.\nInexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player Harry Hooper advise him on baseball game strategy. Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position when he was not pitching, arguing to Barrow, who had invested in the club, that the crowds were larger on days when Ruth played, as they were attracted by his hitting. In early May, Barrow gave in; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson. For the first time in his career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was assigned a place in the batting order higher than ninth.\nAlthough Barrow predicted that Ruth would beg to return to pitching the first time he experienced a batting slump, that did not occur. Barrow used Ruth primarily as an outfielder in the war-shortened 1918 season. Ruth hit .300, with 11 home runs, enough to secure him a share of the major league home run title with Tilly Walker of the Philadelphia Athletics. He was still occasionally used as a pitcher, and had a 13\u20137 record with a 2.22 ERA. On July 8, in the bottom of the ninth inning in a scoreless game, with a runner on first base Ruth hit a ball out of the ballpark to drive in the game-winning run; this was recorded as a triple, since the rules at that time considered the game over once the winning run scored. In 1968 the Special Baseball Records Committee unanimously ruled this, along with 36 other hits, a home run, but in part due to the perceived importance of preserving Ruth's home run total at 714, in 1969 the committee reversed this decision.\nIn 1918, the Red Sox won their third pennant in four years and faced the Chicago Cubs in the World Series, which began on September 5, the earliest date in history. The season had been shortened because the government had ruled that baseball players who were eligible for the military would have to be inducted or work in critical war industries, such as armaments plants. Ruth pitched and won Game One for the Red Sox, a 1\u20130 shutout. Before Game Four, Ruth injured his left hand in a fight but pitched anyway. He gave up seven hits and six walks, but was helped by outstanding fielding behind him and by his own batting efforts, as a fourth-inning triple by Ruth gave his team a 2\u20130 lead. The Cubs tied the game in the eighth inning, but the Red Sox scored to take a 3\u20132 lead again in the bottom of that inning. After Ruth gave up a hit and a walk to start the ninth inning, he was relieved on the mound by Joe Bush. To keep Ruth and his bat in the game, he was sent to play left field. Bush retired the side to give Ruth his second win of the Series, and the third and last World Series pitching victory of his career, against no defeats, in three pitching appearances. Ruth's effort gave his team a three-games-to-one lead, and two days later the Red Sox won their third Series in four years, four-games-to-two. Before allowing the Cubs to score in Game Four, Ruth pitched &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;29+2\u20443 consecutive scoreless innings, a World Series record that stood for more than 40 years until 1961, broken by Whitey Ford. Ruth was prouder of that record than he was of any of his batting feats.\nWith the World Series over, Ruth gained exemption from the war draft by accepting a nominal position with a Pennsylvania steel mill. Many industrial establishments took pride in their baseball teams and sought to hire major leaguers. The end of the war in November set Ruth free to play baseball without such contrivances.\nDuring the 1919 season, Ruth was used as a pitcher in only 17 of his 130 games and compiled a 9\u20135 record. Barrow used him as a pitcher mostly in the early part of the season, when the Red Sox still had hopes of a second consecutive pennant. By late June, the Red Sox were clearly out of the race, and Barrow had no objection to Ruth concentrating on his hitting, if only because it drew people to the ballpark. Ruth had hit a home run against the Yankees on Opening Day, and another during a month-long batting slump that soon followed. Relieved of his pitching duties, Ruth began an unprecedented spell of slugging home runs, which gave him widespread public and press attention. Even his failures were seen as majestic\u2014one sportswriter said, \"When Ruth misses a swipe at the ball, the stands quiver.\"\nTwo home runs by Ruth on July 5, and one in each of two consecutive games a week later, raised his season total to 11, tying his career best from 1918. The first record to fall was the AL single-season mark of 16, set by Ralph \"Socks\" Seybold in 1902. Ruth matched that on July 29, then pulled ahead toward the major league record of 25, set by Buck Freeman in 1899. By the time Ruth reached this in early September, writers had discovered that Ned Williamson of the 1884 Chicago White Stockings had hit 27\u2014though in a ballpark where the distance to right field was only . On September 20, \"Babe Ruth Day\" at Fenway Park, Ruth won the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying Williamson. He broke the record four days later against the Yankees at the Polo Grounds, and hit one more against the Senators to finish with 29. The home run at Washington made Ruth the first major league player to hit a home run at all eight ballparks in his league. In spite of Ruth's hitting heroics, the Red Sox finished sixth, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;20+1\u20442 games behind the league champion White Sox. In his six seasons with Boston, he won 89 games and recorded a 2.19 ERA. He had a four-year stretch where he was second in the AL in wins and ERA behind Walter Johnson, and Ruth had a winning record against Johnson in head-to-head matchups.\nSale to New York.\nAs an out-of-towner from New York City, Frazee had been regarded with suspicion by Boston's sportswriters and baseball fans when he bought the team. He won them over with success on the field and a willingness to build the Red Sox by purchasing or trading for players. He offered the Senators $60,000 for Walter Johnson, but Washington owner Clark Griffith was unwilling. Even so, Frazee was successful in bringing other players to Boston, especially as replacements for players in the military. This willingness to spend for players helped the Red Sox secure the 1918 title. The 1919 season saw record-breaking attendance, and Ruth's home runs for Boston made him a national sensation. In March 1919 Ruth was reported as having accepted a three-year contract for a total of $27,000, after protracted negotiations. Nevertheless, on December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Ruth's contract to the New York Yankees.\nNot all the circumstances concerning the sale are known, but brewer and former congressman Jacob Ruppert, the New York team's principal owner, reportedly asked Yankee manager Miller Huggins what the team needed to be successful. \"Get Ruth from Boston\", Huggins supposedly replied, noting that Frazee was perennially in need of money to finance his theatrical productions. An often-told story is that Frazee needed money, and sold Ruth to finance the musical \"No, No, Nanette\"; that play did not open until 1925, by which time Frazee had sold the Red Sox, but was based on a Frazee-produced play, \"My Lady Friends\", which opened in 1919. There were also other financial pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, fully aware of baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from the purchase of the club.\nAlthough Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.\nFrazee sold the rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.\nThe transaction was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly accomplished\u2014Ruth agreed to fulfill the remaining two years on his contract, but was given a $20,000 bonus, payable over two seasons. The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered at the loss of Ruth; others conceded that Ruth had become difficult to deal with. \"The New York Times\" suggested that \"The short right field wall at the Polo Grounds should prove an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer.\" According to Reisler, \"The Yankees had pulled off the sports steal of the century.\"\nAccording to Marty Appel in his history of the Yankees, the transaction, \"changed the fortunes of two high-profile franchises for decades\". The Red Sox, winners of five of the first 16 World Series, those played between 1903 and 1919, would not win another pennant until 1946, or another World Series until 2004, a drought attributed in baseball superstition to Frazee's sale of Ruth and sometimes dubbed the \"Curse of the Bambino\". Conversely, the Yankees had not won the AL championship prior to their acquisition of Ruth. They won seven AL pennants and four World Series with him, and lead baseball with 41 pennants and 27 World Series titles in their history.\nNew York Yankees (1920\u20131934).\nInitial success (1920\u20131923).\nWhen Ruth signed with the Yankees, his transition from a pitcher to a power-hitting outfielder was complete. His 15-season Yankee career consisted of over 2,000 games, and Ruth broke many batting records while making only five widely scattered appearances on the mound, winning all of them.\nAt the end of April 1920, the Yankees were 4\u20137, with the Red Sox leading the league with a 10\u20132 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself swinging the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home run that sent the ball completely out of the Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees won, 6\u20130, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, and by the end of the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth play when the Yankees were on the road.\nThe home runs kept on coming. Ruth tied his own record of 29 on July 15 and broke it with home runs in both games of a doubleheader four days later. By the end of July, he had 37, but his pace slackened somewhat after that. Nevertheless, on September 4, he both tied and broke the organized baseball record for home runs in a season, snapping Perry Werden's 1895 mark of 44 in the minor Western League. The Yankees played well as a team, battling for the league lead early in the summer, but slumped in August in the AL pennant battle with Chicago and Cleveland. The pennant and the World Series were won by Cleveland, who surged ahead after the Black Sox Scandal broke on September 28 and led to the suspension of many of Chicago's top players, including Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees finished third, but drew 1.2\u00a0million fans to the Polo Grounds, the first time a team had drawn a seven-figure attendance. The rest of the league sold 600,000 more tickets, many fans there to see Ruth, who led the league with 54 home runs, 158 runs, and 137 runs batted in (RBIs).\nIn 1920 and afterwards, Ruth was aided in his power hitting by the fact that A.J. Reach Company\u2014the maker of baseballs used in the major leagues\u2014was using a more efficient machine to wind the yarn found within the baseball. The new baseballs went into play in 1920 and ushered the start of the live-ball era; the number of home runs across the major leagues increased by 184 over the previous year. Baseball statistician Bill James pointed out that while Ruth was likely aided by the change in the baseball, there were other factors at work, including the gradual abolition of the spitball (accelerated after the death of Ray Chapman, struck by a pitched ball thrown by Mays in August 1920) and the more frequent use of new baseballs (also a response to Chapman's death). Nevertheless, James theorized that Ruth's 1920 explosion might have happened in 1919, had a full season of 154 games been played rather than 140, had Ruth refrained from pitching 133 innings that season, and if he were playing at any other home field but Fenway Park, where he hit only 9 of 29 home runs.\nYankees business manager Harry Sparrow had died early in the 1920 season. Ruppert and Huston hired Barrow to replace him. The two men quickly made a deal with Frazee for New York to acquire some of the players who would be mainstays of the early Yankee pennant-winning teams, including catcher Wally Schang and pitcher Waite Hoyt. The 21-year-old Hoyt became close to Ruth:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The outrageous life fascinated Hoyt, the don't-give-a-shit freedom of it, the nonstop, pell-mell charge into excess. How did a man drink so much and never get drunk?... The puzzle of Babe Ruth never was dull, no matter how many times Hoyt picked up the pieces and stared at them. After games he would follow the crowd to the Babe's suite. No matter what the town, the beer would be iced and the bottles would fill the bathtub.\nIn the offseason, Ruth spent some time in Havana, Cuba, where he was said to have lost $35,000 () betting on horse races.\nRuth hit home runs early and often in the 1921 season, during which he broke Roger Connor's mark for home runs in a career, 138. Each of the almost 600 home runs Ruth hit in his career after that extended his own record. After a slow start, the Yankees were soon locked in a tight pennant race with Cleveland, winners of the 1920 World Series. On September 15, Ruth hit his 55th home run, breaking his year-old single-season record. In late September, the Yankees visited Cleveland and won three out of four games, giving them the upper hand in the race, and clinched their first pennant a few days later. Ruth finished the regular season with 59 home runs, batting .378 and with a slugging percentage of .846. Ruth's 177 runs scored, 119 extra-base hits, and 457 total bases set modern-era records that still stand as of 2024[ [update]].\nThe Yankees had high expectations when they met the New York Giants in the 1921 World Series, every game of which was played in the Polo Grounds. The Yankees won the first two games with Ruth in the lineup. However, Ruth badly scraped his elbow during Game 2 when he slid into third base (he had walked and stolen both second and third bases). After the game, he was told by the team physician not to play the rest of the series. Despite this advice, he did play in the next three games, and pinch-hit in Game Eight of the best-of-nine series, but the Yankees lost, five games to three. Ruth hit .316, drove in five runs and hit his first World Series home run.\nAfter the Series, Ruth and teammates Bob Meusel and Bill Piercy participated in a barnstorming tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and undermining its value. Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.\nOn March 4, 1922, Ruth signed a new contract for three years at $52,000 a year (). This was more than two times the largest sum ever paid to a ballplayer up to that point and it represented 40% of the team's player payroll.\nDespite his suspension, Ruth was named the Yankees' new on-field captain prior to the 1922 season. During the suspension, he worked out with the team in the morning and played exhibition games with the Yankees on their off days. He and Meusel returned on May 20 to a sellout crowd at the Polo Grounds, but Ruth batted 0-for-4 and was booed. On May 25, he was thrown out of the game for throwing dust in umpire George Hildebrand's face, then climbed into the stands to confront a heckler. Ban Johnson ordered him fined, suspended, and stripped of position as team captain. In his shortened season, Ruth appeared in 110 games, batted .315, with 35 home runs, and drove in 99 runs, but the 1922 season was a disappointment in comparison to his two previous dominating years. Despite Ruth's off-year, the Yankees managed to win the pennant and faced the New York Giants in the World Series for the second consecutive year. In the Series, Giants manager John McGraw instructed his pitchers to throw him nothing but curveballs, and Ruth never adjusted. Ruth had just two hits in 17 at bats, and the Yankees lost to the Giants for the second straight year, by 4\u20130 (with one tie game). Sportswriter Joe Vila called him, \"an exploded phenomenon\".\nAfter the season, Ruth was a guest at an Elks Club banquet, set up by Ruth's agent with Yankee team support. There, each speaker, concluding with future New York mayor Jimmy Walker, censured him for his poor behavior. An emotional Ruth promised reform, and, to the surprise of many, followed through. When he reported to spring training, he was in his best shape as a Yankee, weighing only .\nThe Yankees' status as tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds had become increasingly uneasy, and in 1922, Giants owner Charles Stoneham said the Yankees' lease, expiring after that season, would not be renewed. Ruppert and Huston had long contemplated a new stadium, and had taken an option on property at 161st Street and River Avenue in the Bronx. Yankee Stadium was completed in time for the home opener on April 18, 1923, at which Ruth hit the first home run in what was quickly dubbed \"the House that Ruth Built\". The ballpark was designed with Ruth in mind: although the venue's left-field fence was further from home plate than at the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium's right-field fence was closer, making home runs easier to hit for left-handed batters. To spare Ruth's eyes, right field\u2014his defensive position\u2014was not pointed into the afternoon sun, as was traditional; left fielder Meusel soon developed headaches from squinting toward home plate.\nDuring the 1923 season, the Yankees were never seriously challenged and won the AL pennant by 17 games. Ruth finished the season with a career-high .393 batting average and 41 home runs, which tied Cy Williams for the most in the major-leagues that year. Ruth hit a career-high 45 doubles in 1923, and he reached base 379 times, then a major league record. For the third straight year, the Yankees faced the Giants in the World Series, which Ruth dominated. He batted .368, walked eight times, scored eight runs, hit three home runs and slugged 1.000 during the series, as the Yankees christened their new stadium with their first World Series championship, four games to two.\nBatting title and \"bellyache\" (1924\u20131925).\nIn 1924, the Yankees were favored to become the first team to win four consecutive pennants. Plagued by injuries, they found themselves in a battle with the Senators. Although the Yankees won 18 of 22 at one point in September, the Senators beat out the Yankees by two games. Ruth hit .378, winning his only AL batting title, with a league-leading 46 home runs.\nRuth did not look like an athlete; he was described as \"toothpicks attached to a piano\", with a big upper body but thin wrists and legs. Ruth had kept up his efforts to stay in shape in 1923 and 1924, but by early 1925 weighed nearly . His annual visit to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he exercised and took saunas early in the year, did him no good as he spent much of the time carousing in the resort town. He became ill while there, and relapsed during spring training. Ruth collapsed in Asheville, North Carolina, as the team journeyed north. He was put on a train for New York, where he was briefly hospitalized. A rumor circulated that he had died, prompting British newspapers to print a premature obituary. In New York, Ruth collapsed again and was found unconscious in his hotel bathroom. He was taken to a hospital where he had multiple convulsions. After sportswriter W. O. McGeehan wrote that Ruth's illness was due to binging on hot dogs and soda pop before a game, it became known as \"the bellyache heard 'round the world\". However, the exact cause of his ailment has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Glenn Stout, in his history of the Yankees, writes that the Ruth legend is \"still one of the most sheltered in sports\"; he suggests that alcohol was at the root of Ruth's illness, pointing to the fact that Ruth remained six weeks at St. Vincent's Hospital but was allowed to leave, under supervision, for workouts with the team for part of that time. He concludes that the hospitalization was behavior-related. Playing just 98 games, Ruth had his worst season as a Yankee; he finished with a .290 average and 25 home runs. The Yankees finished next to last in the AL with a 69\u201385 record, their last season with a losing record until 1965.\nMurderers' Row (1926\u20131928).\nRuth spent part of the offseason of 1925\u201326 working out at Artie McGovern's gym, where he got back into shape. Barrow and Huggins had rebuilt the team and surrounded the veteran core with good young players like Tony Lazzeri and Lou Gehrig, but the Yankees were not expected to win the pennant.\nRuth returned to his normal production during 1926, when he batted .372 with 47 home runs and 146 RBIs. The Yankees built a 10-game lead by mid-June and coasted to win the pennant by three games. The St. Louis Cardinals had won the National League with the lowest winning percentage for a pennant winner to that point (.578) and the Yankees were expected to win the World Series easily. Although the Yankees won the opener in New York, St. Louis took Games Two and Three. In Game Four, Ruth hit three home runs\u2014the first time this had been done in a World Series game\u2014to lead the Yankees to victory. In the fifth game, Ruth caught a ball as he crashed into the fence. The play was described by baseball writers as a defensive gem. New York took that game, but Grover Cleveland Alexander won Game Six for St. Louis to tie the Series at three games each, then got very drunk. He was nevertheless inserted into Game Seven in the seventh inning and shut down the Yankees to win the game, 3\u20132, and win the Series. Ruth had hit his fourth home run of the Series earlier in the game and was the only Yankee to reach base off Alexander; he walked in the ninth inning before being thrown out to end the game when he attempted to steal second base. Although Ruth's attempt to steal second is often deemed a baserunning blunder, Creamer pointed out that the Yankees' chances of tying the game would have been greatly improved with a runner in scoring position.\nThe 1926 World Series was also known for Ruth's promise to Johnny Sylvester, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy. Ruth promised the child that he would hit a home run on his behalf. Sylvester had been injured in a fall from a horse, and a friend of Sylvester's father gave the boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals. The friend relayed a promise from Ruth (who did not know the boy) that he would hit a home run for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly inflated it, and by some accounts, Ruth allegedly saved the boy's life by visiting him, emotionally promising to hit a home run, and doing so. Ruth's 1926 salary of $52,000 was far more than any other baseball player, but he made at least twice as much in other income, including $100,000 from 12 weeks of vaudeville.\nThe 1927 New York Yankees team is considered one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as Murderers' Row because of the power of its lineup, the team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the AL pennant by 19 games. There was no suspense in the pennant race, and the nation turned its attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. Ruth was not alone in this chase. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown; he tied Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45\u201344, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two blasts of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently\u2014Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of Paul Hopkins, facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off Tom Zachary to break a 2\u20132 tie. \"Sixty! Let's see some son of a bitch try to top that one\", Ruth exulted after the game. In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted .356, drove in 164 runs and slugged .772. In the 1927 World Series, the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving Forbes Field. According to Appel, \"The 1927 New York Yankees. Even today, the words inspire awe... all baseball success is measured against the '27 team.\"\nThe following season started off well for the Yankees, who led the league in the early going. But the Yankees were plagued by injuries, erratic pitching and inconsistent play. The Philadelphia Athletics, rebuilding after some lean years, erased the Yankees' big lead and even took over first place briefly in early September. The Yankees, however, regained first place when they beat the Athletics three out of four games in a pivotal series at Yankee Stadium later that month, and clinched the pennant in the final weekend of the season. Ruth's play in 1928 mirrored his team's performance. He got off to a hot start and on August 1, he had 42 home runs. This put him ahead of his 60 home run pace from the previous season. He then slumped for the latter part of the season, and he hit just twelve home runs in the last two months. Ruth's batting average also fell to .323, well below his career average. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 54 home runs. The Yankees swept the favored Cardinals in four games in the World Series, with Ruth batting .625 and hitting three home runs in Game Four, including one off Alexander.\n\"Called shot\" and final Yankee years (1929\u20131934).\nBefore the 1929 season, Ruppert (who had bought out Huston in 1923) announced that the Yankees would wear uniform numbers to allow fans at cavernous Yankee Stadium to easily identify the players. The Cardinals and Indians had each experimented with uniform numbers; the Yankees were the first to use them on both home and away uniforms. Ruth batted third and was given number 3. According to a long-standing baseball legend, the Yankees adopted their now-iconic pinstriped uniforms in hopes of making Ruth look slimmer. In truth, though, they had been wearing pinstripes since 1915.\nAlthough the Yankees started well, the Athletics soon proved they were the better team in 1929, splitting two series with the Yankees in the first month of the season, then taking advantage of a Yankee losing streak in mid-May to gain first place. Although Ruth performed well, the Yankees were not able to catch the Athletics\u2014Connie Mack had built another great team. Tragedy struck the Yankees late in the year when manager Huggins died at 51 of erysipelas, a bacterial skin infection, on September 25, only ten days after he had last directed the team. Despite their past differences, Ruth praised Huggins and described him as a \"great guy\". The Yankees finished second, 18 games behind the Athletics. Ruth hit .345 during the season, with 46 home runs and 154 RBIs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA few seasons ago I used a 54 ounce bat, long and with the weight well at the end. Now I'm using a 46 ounce club\u2014and each season when I have a new set of bats made, I have an additional ounce taken off.\nRuth in \"Babe Ruth's Own Book of Baseball\" (1928), p. 171\nOn October 17, the Yankees hired Bob Shawkey as manager; he was their fourth choice. Ruth had politicked for the job of player-manager, but Ruppert and Barrow never seriously considered him for the position. Stout deemed this the first hint Ruth would have no future with the Yankees once he retired as a player. Shawkey, a former Yankees player and teammate of Ruth, would prove unable to command Ruth's respect.\nOn January 7, 1930, salary negotiations between the Yankees and Ruth quickly broke down. Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, Ruth promptly rejected both the Yankees' initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and their 'final' offer of two years at seventy-five\u2014the latter figure equaling the annual salary of then US President Herbert Hoover; instead, Ruth demanded at least $85,000 and three years. When asked why he thought he was \"worth more than the President of the United States,\" Ruth responded: \"Say, if I hadn't been sick last summer, I'd have broken hell out of that home run record! Besides, the President gets a four-year contract. I'm only asking for three.\" Exactly two months later, a compromise was reached, with Ruth settling for two years at an unprecedented $80,000 per year. Ruth's salary was more than 2.4 times greater than the next-highest salary that season, a record margin as of 2025[ [update]].\nIn 1930, Ruth hit .359 with 49 home runs (his best in his years after 1928) and 153 RBIs, and pitched his first game in nine years, a complete game victory. Nevertheless, the Athletics won their second consecutive pennant and World Series, as the Yankees finished in third place, sixteen games back. At the end of the season, Shawkey was fired and replaced with Cubs manager Joe McCarthy, though Ruth again unsuccessfully sought the job.\nMcCarthy was a disciplinarian, but chose not to interfere with Ruth, who did not seek conflict with the manager. The team improved in 1931, but was no match for the Athletics, who won 107 games, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;13+1\u20442 games in front of the Yankees. Ruth, for his part, hit .373, with 46 home runs and 163 RBIs. He had 31 doubles, his most since 1924. In the 1932 season, the Yankees went 107\u201347 and won the pennant. Ruth's effectiveness had decreased somewhat, but he still hit .341 with 41 home runs and 137 RBIs. Nevertheless, he was sidelined twice because of injuries during the season.\nThe Yankees faced the Cubs, McCarthy's former team, in the 1932 World Series. There was bad blood between the two teams as the Yankees resented the Cubs only awarding half a World Series share to Mark Koenig, a former Yankee. The games at Yankee Stadium had not been sellouts; both were won by the home team, with Ruth collecting two singles, but scoring four runs as he was walked four times by the Cubs pitchers. In Chicago, Ruth was resentful at the hostile crowds that met the Yankees' train and jeered them at the hotel. The crowd for Game Three included New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic candidate for president, who sat with Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak. Many in the crowd threw lemons at Ruth, a sign of derision, and others (as well as the Cubs themselves) shouted abuse at Ruth and other Yankees. They were briefly silenced when Ruth hit a three-run home run off Charlie Root in the first inning, but soon revived, and the Cubs tied the score at 4\u20134 in the fourth inning, partly due to Ruth's fielding error in the outfield. When Ruth came to the plate in the top of the fifth, the Chicago crowd and players, led by pitcher Guy Bush, were screaming insults at Ruth. With the count at two balls and one strike, Ruth gestured, possibly in the direction of center field, and after the next pitch (a strike), may have pointed there with one hand. Ruth hit the fifth pitch over the center field fence; estimates were that it traveled nearly . Whether or not Ruth intended to indicate where he planned to (and did) hit the ball (Charlie Devens, who, in 1999, was interviewed as Ruth's surviving teammate in that game, did not think so), the incident has gone down in legend as Babe Ruth's called shot. The Yankees won Game Three, and the following day clinched the Series with another victory. During that game, Bush hit Ruth on the arm with a pitch, causing words to be exchanged and provoking a game-winning Yankee rally.\nRuth remained productive in 1933. He batted .301, with 34 home runs, 103 RBIs, and a league-leading 114 walks, as the Yankees finished in second place, seven games behind the Senators. Athletics manager Connie Mack selected him to play right field in the first Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held on July 6, 1933, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. He hit the first home run in the All-Star Game's history, a two-run blast against Bill Hallahan during the third inning, which helped the AL win the game 4\u20132. During the final game of the 1933 season, as a publicity stunt organized by his team, Ruth was called upon and pitched a complete game victory against the Red Sox, his final appearance as a pitcher. Despite unremarkable pitching numbers, Ruth had a 5\u20130 record in five games for the Yankees, raising his career totals to 94\u201346.\nIn 1934, Ruth played in his last full season with the Yankees. By this time, years of high living were starting to catch up with him. His conditioning had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer field or run. He accepted a pay cut to $35,000 from Ruppert, but he was still the highest-paid player in the major leagues. He could still handle a bat, recording a .288 batting average with 22 home runs, and on July 13, 1934, he hit his 700th career home run. However, Reisler described these statistics as \"merely mortal\" by Ruth's previous standards. Ruth was selected to the AL All-Star team for the second consecutive year, even though he was in the twilight of his career. During the game, New York Giants pitcher Carl Hubbell struck out Ruth and four other future Hall-of-Famers consecutively. The Yankees finished second again, seven games behind the Tigers.\nBoston Braves (1935).\nBy this time, Ruth knew he was nearly finished as a player. He desired to remain in baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated that he was not yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, and Detroit Tigers were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.\nJust before the 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth the manager of the Yankees' top minor-league team, the Newark Bears, but he was talked out of it by his wife, Claire, and his business manager, Christy Walsh. Tigers owner Frank Navin seriously considered acquiring Ruth and making him player-manager. However, Ruth insisted on delaying the meeting until he came back from a trip to Hawaii. Navin was unwilling to wait. Ruth opted to go on his trip, despite Barrow advising him that he was making a mistake; in any event, Ruth's asking price was too high for the notoriously tight-fisted Navin. The Tigers' job ultimately went to Mickey Cochrane.\nEarly in the 1934 season, Ruth made no secret of his desire to manage the Yankees. However, that job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always supported McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. The relationship between Ruth and McCarthy had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's open campaigning to replace him further chilled their interpersonal relations. By the end of the season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted Ruth to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.\nDuring the 1934\u201335 offseason, Ruth circled the world with his wife; the trip included a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, he stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted that he could not have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.\nAlso during the offseason, Ruppert had been sounding out the other clubs in hopes of finding one that would be willing to take Ruth as a manager or player. However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth. However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.\nWhile the barnstorming tour was underway, Ruppert began negotiating with Boston Braves owner Judge Emil Fuchs, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. The Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing fourth in the National League in both 1933 and 1934, but the team drew poorly at the box office. Unable to afford the rent at Braves Field, Fuchs had considered holding dog races there when the Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis. After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. Ruppert had stated that he would not release Ruth to go to another team as a full-time player. For this reason, it was announced that Ruth would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper Bill McKechnie. In a long letter to Ruth a few days before the press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth succeeding McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936. Ruppert called the deal \"the greatest opportunity Ruth ever had\".\nThere was considerable attention as Ruth reported for spring training. He did not hit his first home run of the spring until after the team had left Florida, and was beginning the road north in Savannah. He hit two in an exhibition game against the Bears. Amid much press attention, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, including five of New England's six state governors, Ruth accounted for all the Braves' runs in a 4\u20132 win over the New York Giants, hitting a two-run home run, singling to drive in a third run and later in the inning scoring the fourth. Although age and weight had slowed him, he made a running catch in left field that sportswriters deemed the defensive highlight of the game.\nRuth had two hits in the second game of the season, but it quickly went downhill both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. McKechnie later said that Ruth's presence made enforcing discipline nearly impossible.\nRuth soon realized that Fuchs had deceived him, and had no intention of making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later said his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of \"his\" money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, Fuchs and Ruppert had both known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.\nBy the end of the first month of the season, Ruth concluded he was finished even as a part-time player. As early as May 12, he asked Fuchs to let him retire. Ultimately, Fuchs persuaded Ruth to remain at least until after the Memorial Day doubleheader in Philadelphia. In the interim was a western road trip, at which the rival teams had scheduled days to honor him. In Chicago and St. Louis, Ruth performed poorly, and his batting average sank to .155, with only two additional home runs for a total of three on the season. In the first two games in Pittsburgh, Ruth had only one hit, though a long fly caught by Paul Waner probably would have been a home run in any other ballpark besides Forbes Field.\nRuth played in the third game of the Pittsburgh series on May 25, 1935, and added one more tale to his playing legend. Ruth went 4-for-4, including three home runs, though the Braves lost the game 11\u20137. The last two were off Ruth's old Cubs nemesis, Guy Bush. The final home run, both of the game and of Ruth's career, sailed out of the park over the right field upper deck\u2013the first time anyone had hit a fair ball completely out of Forbes Field. Ruth was urged to make this his last game, but he had given his word to Fuchs to stay on through Memorial Day and played in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. The first game of the doubleheader in Philadelphia\u2014the Braves lost both\u2014would be his final major league appearance. Ruth retired on June 2 after an argument with Fuchs. He finished 1935 with a .181 average\u2014easily his worst as a full-time position player\u2014and the final six of his 714 home runs. The Braves, 10\u201327 when Ruth left, finished 38\u2013115, at .248 the worst winning percentage in modern National League history. Insolvent like his team, Fuchs gave up control of the Braves before the end of the season; the National League took over the franchise at the end of the year.\nCareer overall.\nAt the time of his retirement, Ruth held many baseball batting records. These include the career records for home runs (714), slugging percentage (0.690), runs batted in (2,213), bases on balls (2,062) and on-base percentage (.474). He still remains in the top ten of many statistical rankings.\nStatistics and achievements.\nBatting\nPitching\nRetirement.\nAlthough Fuchs had given Ruth his unconditional release, no major league team expressed an interest in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement and the end of the 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner Alva Bradley replied negatively. Of the five members in the inaugural class of Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936 (Ty Cobb, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson and Ruth), only Ruth was not given an offer to manage a baseball team. Team owners and general managers assessed Ruth's flamboyant personal habits as a reason to exclude him from a managerial job; Barrow said of him, \"How can he manage other men when he can't even manage himself?\" Creamer believed Ruth was unfairly treated in never being given an opportunity to manage a major league club. The author believed there was not necessarily a relationship between personal conduct and managerial success, noting that John McGraw, Billy Martin, and Bobby Valentine were winners despite character flaws.\nRuth played much golf and in a few exhibition baseball games, where he demonstrated a continuing ability to draw large crowds. This appeal contributed to the Dodgers hiring him as first base coach in 1938. When Ruth was hired, Brooklyn general manager Larry MacPhail made it clear that Ruth would not be considered for the manager's job if, as expected, Burleigh Grimes retired at the end of the season. Although much was said about what Ruth could teach the younger players, in practice, his duties were to appear on the field in uniform and encourage base runners\u2014he was not called upon to relay signs. In August, shortly before the baseball rosters expanded, Ruth sought an opportunity to return as an active player in a pinch hitting role. Ruth often took batting practice before games and felt that he could take on the limited role. Grimes denied his request, citing Ruth's poor vision in his right eye, his inability to run the bases, and the risk of an injury to Ruth.\nRuth got along well with everyone except team captain Leo Durocher, who was hired as Grimes' replacement at season's end. Ruth then left his job as a first base coach and would never again work in any capacity in the game of baseball.\nOn July 4, 1939, Ruth spoke on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium as members of the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, who was forced into premature retirement by ALS, which would kill him two years later. The next week, Ruth went to Cooperstown, New York, for the formal opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Three years earlier, he was one of the first five players elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers. During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball when he contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but he was sent a rejection letter. In 1999, Ruth's granddaughter, Linda Tosetti, and his daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, said that Babe's inability to land a managerial role with the Yankees caused him to feel hurt and slump into a severe depression.\nRuth started playing golf when he was 20 and continued playing the game throughout his life. His appearance at many New York courses drew spectators and headlines. Rye Golf Club was among the courses he played with teammate Lyn Lary in June 1933. With birdies on 3 holes, Ruth posted the best score. In retirement, he became one of the first celebrity golfers participating in charity tournaments, including one where he was pitted against Ty Cobb.\nPersonal life.\nRuth met Helen Woodford, by some accounts, in a coffee shop in Boston, where she was a waitress. They married as teenagers on October 17, 1914. Although Ruth later claimed to have been married in Elkton, Maryland, records show that they were married at St. Paul's Catholic Church in Ellicott City. They adopted a daughter, Dorothy, in 1921. Ruth and Helen separated around 1925 reportedly because of Ruth's repeated infidelities and neglect. They appeared in public as a couple for the last time during the 1926 World Series. Helen died in January 1929 at age 31 in a fire in a house in Watertown, Massachusetts owned by Edward Kinder, a dentist with whom she had been living as \"Mrs. Kinder\". In her book, \"My Dad, the Babe\", Dorothy claimed that she was Ruth's biological child by a mistress named Juanita Jennings. In 1980, Juanita, who was at the time very ill, admitted this to Dorothy and Dorothy's sister, Julia.\nOn April 17, 1929, three months after the death of his first wife, Ruth married actress and model Claire Merritt Hodgson and adopted her daughter Julia. It was the second and final marriage for both parties. Claire, unlike Helen, was well-travelled and educated, and put structure into Ruth's life, like Miller Huggins did for him on the field.\nBy one account, Julia and Dorothy were, through no fault of their own, the reason for the seven-year rift in Ruth's relationship with teammate Lou Gehrig. Sometime in 1932, during a conversation that she assumed was private, Gehrig's mother remarked, \"It's a shame [Claire] doesn't dress Dorothy as nicely as she dresses her own daughter.\" When the comment got back to Ruth, he angrily told Gehrig to tell his mother to mind her own business. Gehrig, in turn, took offense at what he perceived as Ruth's comment about his mother. The two men reportedly never spoke off the field until they reconciled at Yankee Stadium on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, July 4, 1939, shortly after Gehrig's retirement from baseball.\nAlthough Ruth was married throughout most of his baseball career, when team co-owner Tillinghast 'Cap' Huston asked him to tone down his lifestyle, Ruth replied, \"I'll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier, but not for you, fifty thousand dollars, or two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars will I give up women. They're too much fun.\" A detective that the Yankees hired to follow him one night in Chicago reported that Ruth had been with six women. Ping Bodie said that he was not Ruth's roommate while traveling; \"I room with his suitcase\". Before the start of the 1922 season, Ruth had signed a three-year contract at $52,000 per year () with an option to renew for two additional years. His performance during the 1922 season had been disappointing, attributed in part to his drinking and late-night hours. After the end of the 1922 season, he was asked to sign a contract addendum with a morals clause. Ruth and Ruppert signed it on November 11, 1922. It called for Ruth to abstain entirely from the use of intoxicating liquors, and to not stay up later than 1:00\u00a0a.m. during the training and playing season without permission of the manager. Ruth was also enjoined from any action or misbehavior that would compromise his ability to play baseball.\nRuth was a self described Democrat. In 1928, Ruth campaigned for Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Al Smith.\nCancer and death (1946\u20131948).\nAs early as the war years, doctors had cautioned Ruth to take better care of his health, and he grudgingly followed their advice, limiting his drinking and not going on a proposed trip to support the troops in the South Pacific. In 1946, Ruth began experiencing severe pain over his left eye and had difficulty swallowing. In November 1946, Ruth entered French Hospital in New York for tests, which revealed that he had an inoperable malignant tumor at the base of his skull and in his neck. The malady was a lesion known as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or lymphoepithelioma. A physician who reviewed Ruth's autopsy in 1998 concluded that Ruth's lifelong use of tobacco \"probably played a part\" in his cancer. His name and fame gave him access to experimental treatments, and he was one of the first cancer patients to receive both drugs and radiation treatment simultaneously. Having lost , he was discharged from the hospital in February and went to Florida to recuperate. He returned to New York and Yankee Stadium after the season started. The new commissioner, Happy Chandler (Judge Landis had died in 1944), proclaimed April 27, 1947, Babe Ruth Day around the major leagues, with the most significant observance to be at Yankee Stadium. A number of teammates and others spoke in honor of Ruth, who briefly addressed the crowd of almost 60,000. By then, his voice was a soft whisper with a very low, raspy tone.\nAround this time, developments in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors had not told Ruth he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with pterolyl triglutamate (Teropterin), a folic acid derivative; he may have been the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.\nThe improvement was only a temporary remission, and by late 1947, Ruth was unable to help with the writing of his autobiography, \"The Babe Ruth Story\", which was almost entirely ghostwritten. In and out of the hospital in Manhattan, he left for Florida in February 1948, doing what activities he could. After six weeks he returned to New York to appear at a book-signing party. He also traveled to California to witness the filming of the movie based on the book.\nOn June 5, 1948, a \"gaunt and hollowed-out\" Ruth visited Yale University to donate a manuscript of \"The Babe Ruth Story\" to its library. At Yale, he met with future president George H. W. Bush, who was the captain of the Yale baseball team. On June 13, Ruth visited Yankee Stadium for the final time in his life, appearing at the 25th-anniversary celebrations of \"The House that Ruth Built\". By this time he had lost much weight and had difficulty walking. Introduced along with his surviving teammates from 1923, Ruth used a bat as a cane. Nat Fein's photo of Ruth taken from behind, standing near home plate and facing \"Ruthville\" (right field) became one of baseball's most famous and widely circulated photographs, and won the Pulitzer Prize.\nRuth made one final trip on behalf of American Legion Baseball. He then entered Memorial Hospital, where he would die. He was never told he had cancer; however, before his death, he surmised it. He was able to leave the hospital for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film \"The Babe Ruth Story\". Shortly thereafter, he returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse, and only a few visitors were permitted to see him, one of whom was National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball Ford C. Frick. \"Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard\", Frick said years later.\nThousands of New Yorkers, including many children, stood vigil outside the hospital during Ruth's final days. On August 16, 1948, at 8:01\u00a0p.m., Ruth died in his sleep at the age of 53. His funeral service took place over three days. His open casket was placed on display in the rotunda of Yankee Stadium, where it remained for two days; 77,000 people filed past to pay him tribute. His Requiem Mass was celebrated by Francis Cardinal Spellman at St. Patrick's Cathedral; a crowd estimated at 75,000 waited outside. Ruth is buried with his second wife, Claire, on a hillside in Section 25 at the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.\nMemorial and museum.\nOn April 19, 1949, the Yankees unveiled a granite monument in Ruth's honor in center field of Yankee Stadium. The monument was located in the field of play next to a flagpole and similar tributes to Huggins and Gehrig until the stadium was remodeled from 1974 to 1975, which resulted in the outfield fences moving inward and enclosing the monuments from the playing field. This area was known thereafter as Monument Park. Yankee Stadium, \"the House that Ruth Built\", was replaced after the 2008 season with a new Yankee Stadium across the street from the old one; Monument Park was subsequently moved to the new venue behind the center field fence. Ruth's uniform number 3 has been retired by the Yankees, and he is one of five Yankees players or managers to have a granite monument within the stadium.\nIn 1974, Ruth's birthplace in Baltimore was renovated and opened to the public as the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum. The museum houses a collection of artifacts from Ruth's life, including some rare baseball cards and the earliest known signature of Ruth, from when he was still pitching in the schoolyard. Ruth's widow, Claire, his two daughters, Dorothy and Julia, and his sister, Mamie, helped select and install exhibits for the museum.\nImpact.\nRuth was the first baseball star to be the subject of overwhelming public adulation. Baseball had been known for star players such as Ty Cobb and \"Shoeless Joe\" Jackson, but both men had uneasy relations with fans. In Cobb's case, the incidents were sometimes marked by violence. Ruth's biographers agreed that he benefited from the timing of his ascension to \"Home Run King\". The country had been hit hard by both the war and the 1918 flu pandemic and longed for something to help put these traumas behind it. Ruth also resonated in a country which felt, in the aftermath of the war, that it took second place to no one. Montville argued that Ruth was a larger-than-life figure who was capable of unprecedented athletic feats in the nation's largest city. Ruth became an icon of the social changes that marked the early 1920s. In his history of the Yankees, Glenn Stout writes that \"Ruth was New York incarnate\u2014uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, out of scale, and absolutely unstoppable\".\nDuring his lifetime, Ruth became a symbol of the United States. During World War II, Japanese soldiers yelled in English, \"To hell with Babe Ruth\", to anger American soldiers. Ruth replied that he hoped \"every Jap that mention[ed] my name gets shot\". Creamer recorded that \"Babe Ruth transcended sport and moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages\". Wagenheim stated, \"He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable.\" According to Glenn Stout, \"Ruth's home runs were [an] exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for. A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible.\"\nAlthough Ruth was not just a power hitter\u2014he was the Yankees' best bunter, and an excellent outfielder\u2014Ruth's penchant for hitting home runs altered how baseball is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games by getting a runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the bunt, and the hit and run. Advocates of what was dubbed \"inside baseball\", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on the purity of the game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, \"settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star.\" Bill James states, \"When the owners discovered that the fans \"liked\" to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace [in the Black Sox Scandal], then there was no turning back.\" While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.\nAccording to sportswriter Grantland Rice, only two sports figures of the 1920s approached Ruth in popularity\u2014boxer Jack Dempsey and racehorse Man o' War. One of the factors that contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something better than anyone else in the world. Montville writes that \"the fog [surrounding his childhood] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility.\" Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play, allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler states that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.\nLegacy.\nCreamer describes Ruth as \"a unique figure in the social history of the United States\". Thomas Barthel describes him as one of the first celebrity athletes; numerous biographies have portrayed him as \"larger than life\". A dominant figure in a field is often referred to as \"the Babe Ruth\" of that field. Similarly, \"Ruthian\" has come to mean in sports, \"colossal, dramatic, prodigious, magnificent; with great power\". He was the first athlete to make more money from endorsements and off-the-field activities than from his sport.\nIn 2006, Montville stated that more books have been written about Ruth than any other member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. At least five of these books (including Creamer's and Wagenheim's) were written in 1973 and 1974 to capitalize on the increase in public interest in Ruth as Hank Aaron approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974. Montville suggested that Ruth is probably even more popular today than he was then. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball: owners build ballparks to encourage home runs.\nIn various rankings, Ruth has been named the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1998, \"The Sporting News\" ranked him number one on the list of \"Baseball's 100 Greatest Players\". In 1999, baseball fans named Ruth to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. He was named baseball's Greatest Player Ever in a ballot commemorating the 100th anniversary of professional baseball in 1969. The Associated Press reported in 1993 that Muhammad Ali was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athlete in America. In 1999, the Associated Press named Ruth the greatest athlete of the 20th century, while an ESPN poll ranked him the second-greatest North American athlete of the century, behind Michael Jordan. In 1983, the United States Postal Service honored Ruth with a twenty-cent stamp. In 2022, \"The Sporting News\" named Ruth on their \"New York Mount Rushmore of Sports\", while ESPN ranked him as the greatest baseball player ever that same year.\nSeveral of the most expensive items of sports memorabilia ever sold at auction are associated with Ruth. The jersey Ruth wore when hitting his \"called shot\" home run in the 1932 World Series sold in 2024 for a record $24\u00a0million. A Ruth 1920 Yankees jersey that sold for $4.4 million in 2012 (equivalent to $ million in 2024) was, for several years, one of the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold. The bat with which he hit the first home run at Yankee Stadium is in \"The Guinness Book of World Records\" as the most expensive baseball bat sold at auction, having fetched $1.265\u00a0million in 2004 (equivalent to $ million in 2024). Other bats used by Ruth sold for $1.6 million in 2022 and $1.85 million in 2023. A hat of Ruth's from the 1934 season set a record for a baseball cap when David Wells sold it at auction for $537 thousand in 2012. In 2017, Charlie Sheen sold Ruth's 1927 World Series ring for $2 million, a record for a championship ring. \nOne lasting legacy of the craze over Ruth may be the Baby Ruth candy bar. The original company to market the confectionery, the Curtiss Candy Company, maintained that the bar was named after Ruth Cleveland, daughter of president Grover Cleveland. She died in 1904 and the bar was first marketed in 1921, at the height of the craze over Ruth. He later sought to market candy bearing his name; he was refused a trademark because of the Baby Ruth bar. The Ruth estate licensed his likeness for use in an advertising campaign for Baby Ruth in 1995. In 2005, Baby Ruth became the official candy bar of Major League Baseball.\nIn 2018, Ruth was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump; his grandson Tom Stevens accepted the award on his behalf. Montville describes the continuing relevance of Babe Ruth in American culture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The fascination with his life and career continues. He is a bombastic, sloppy hero from our bombastic, sloppy history, origins undetermined, a folk tale of American success. His moon face is as recognizable today as it was when he stared out at Tom Zachary on a certain September afternoon in 1927. If sport has become the national religion, Babe Ruth is the patron saint. He stands at the heart of the game he played, the promise of a warm summer night, a bag of peanuts, and a beer. And just maybe, the longest ball hit out of the park.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBook sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "4177", "revid": "30410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4177", "title": "Barge", "text": "Flat-bottomed watercraft for transport of bulk goods\nA barge is typically a flat-bottomed boat which does not have its own means of mechanical propulsion. Their original use was on inland waterways, while modern use is on both inland and marine water environments. The first modern barges were pulled by tugs, but on inland waterways, most are pushed by pusher boats, or other vessels. The term \"barge\" has a rich history, and therefore there are many types of barges.\nHistory of the barge.\nEtymology.\n\"Barge\" is attested from 1300, from Old French \"barge\", from Vulgar Latin \"barga\". The word originally could refer to any small boat; the modern meaning arose around 1480. \"Bark\" \"small ship\" is attested from 1420, from Old French \"barque\", from Vulgar Latin \"barca\" (400 AD). A more precise meaning (see Barque) arose in the 17th century and often takes the French spelling for disambiguation. Both are probably derived from the Latin \"barica\", from Greek \"baris\" \"Egyptian boat\", from Coptic \"bari\" \"small boat\", hieroglyphic Egyptian and similar \"ba-y-r\" for \"basket-shaped boat\". By extension, the term \"embark\" literally means to board the kind of boat called a \"barque\".\nBritish river barges.\n18th century.\nIn Great Britain, a merchant barge was originally a flat bottomed merchant vessel for use on navigable rivers. Most of these barges had sails. For traffic on the River Severn, the barge was described thus: \"The lesser sort are called barges and frigates, being from forty to sixty feet in length, having a single mast and square sail, and carrying from twenty to forty tons burthen.\" The larger vessels were called trows. On the River Irwell, there was reference to barges passing below Barton Aqueduct with their mast and sails standing. Early barges on the Thames were called west country barges.\n19th century.\nIn the United Kingdom, the word barge had many meanings by the 1890s, and these varied locally. On the Mersey, a barge was called a 'Flat', on the Thames a Lighter or barge, and on the Humber a 'Keel'. A Lighter had neither mast nor rigging. A keel did have a single mast with sails. Barge and lighter were used indiscriminately. A local distinction was that any flat that was not propelled by steam was a barge, although it might be a sailing flat.\nThe term Dumb barge was probably taken into use to end the confusion. The term Dumb barge surfaced in the early nineteenth century. It first denoted the use of a barge as a mooring platform in a fixed place. As it went up and down with the tides, it made a very convenient mooring place for steam vessels. Within a few decades, the term dumb barge evolved and came to mean: 'a vessel propelled by oars only'. By the 1890s, Dumb barge was still used only on the Thames.\nBy 1880, barges on British rivers and canals were often towed by steam tugboats. On the Thames, many dumb barges still relied on their poles, oars and the tide. Others dumb barges made use of about 50 tugboats to tow them to their destinations. While many coal barges were towed, many dumb barges that handled single parcels were not.\nThe Thames barge and Dutch barge today.\nOn the British river system and larger waterways, the Thames sailing barge, and Dutch barge and unspecified other styles of barge, are still known as barges. The term Dutch barge is nowadays often used to refer to an accommodation ship, but originally refers to the slightly larger Dutch version of the Thames sailing barge.\nBritish canals: narrowboats and widebeams.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, a substantial network of canals was developed in Great Britain from 1750 onward. Whilst the largest of these could accommodate ocean-going vessels, e.g. the later Manchester Ship Canal, a complex network of smaller canals was also developed. These smaller canals had locks, bridges and tunnels that were at minimum only wide at the waterline. On wider sections, standard barges and other vessels could trade, but full access to the network necessitated the parallel development of the narrowboat, which usually had a beam a couple of inches less to allow for clearance, e.g. . It was soon realized that the narrow locks were too limiting, and later locks were therefore doubled in width to . This led to the development of the widebeam canal boat. The narrowboat (one word) definition in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Narrowboat: a British canal boat of traditional long, narrow design, steered with a tiller; spec. one not exceeding 7 feet (approx. 2.1 metres) in width or 72 feet (approx. 21.9 metres) in length\nThe narrowboats were initially also known as barges, and the new canals were constructed with an adjacent towpath along which draft horses walked, towing the barges. These types of canal craft are so specific that on the British canal system the term 'barge' is no longer used to describe narrowboats and widebeams. Narrowboats and widebeams are still seen on canals, mostly for leisure cruising, and now engine-powered.\nCrew and pole.\nThe people who moved barges were known as lightermen. Poles are used on barges to fend off other nearby vessels or a wharf. These are often called 'pike poles'. The long pole used to maneuver or propel a barge has given rise to the saying \"I wouldn't touch that [subject/thing] with a barge pole.\"\nThe 19th century American barge.\nIn the United States a barge was not a sailing vessel by the end of the 19th century. Indeed, barges were often created by cutting down (razeeing) sailing vessels. In New York this was an accepted meaning of the term barge. The somewhat smaller scow was built as such, but the scow also had its sailing counterpart the sailing scow.\nThe modern barge.\nThe iron barge.\nThe innovation that led to the modern barge was the use of iron barges towed by a steam tugboat. These were first used to transport grain and other bulk products. From about 1840 to 1870 the towed iron barge was quickly introduced on the Rhine, Danube, Don, Dniester, and rivers in Egypt, India and Australia. Many of these barges were built in Great Britain.\nNowadays 'barge' generally refers to a dumb barge. In Europe, a Dumb barge is: \"An inland waterway transport freight vessel designed to be towed which does not have its own means of mechanical propulsion\". In America, a barge is generally pushed.\nModern use.\nBarges are used today for transporting low-value bulk items, as the cost of hauling goods that way is very low and for larger project cargo, such as offshore wind turbine blades. Barges are also used for very heavy or bulky items; a typical American barge measures , and can carry up to about of cargo. The most common European barges measure and can carry up to about .\nAs an example, on June 26, 2006, in the US a catalytic cracking unit reactor was shipped by barge from the Tulsa Port of Catoosa in Oklahoma to a refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi. Extremely large objects are normally shipped in sections and assembled after delivery, but shipping an assembled unit reduces costs and avoids reliance on construction labor at the delivery site, which in the case of the reactor was still recovering from Hurricane Katrina. Of the reactor's journey, only about were traveled overland, from the final port to the refinery.\nThe Transportation Institute at Texas A&amp;M found that inland barge transportation in the US produces far fewer emissions of carbon dioxide for each ton of cargo moved compared to transport by truck or rail. According to the study, transporting cargo by barge produces 43% less greenhouse gas emissions than rail and more than 800% less than trucks. Environmentalists claim that in areas where barges, tugboats and towboats idle may produce more emissions like in the locks and dams of the Mississippi River.\nSelf-propelled barges may be used for traveling downstream or upstream in placid waters; they are operated as an unpowered barge, with the assistance of a tugboat, when traveling upstream in faster waters. Canal barges are usually made for the particular canal in which they will operate.\nUnpowered vessels\u2014barges\u2014may be used for other purposes, such as large accommodation vessels, towed to where they are needed and stationed there as long as necessary. An example is the Bibby Stockholm.\nTypes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn the United States, \"deck barge\" may refer to flat deck barges, work flats, fuel flats or flats. Smaller flats are used in shipyards to permit workers to access vessels in drydocks.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Schelter is credited with the development of the GNU Common Lisp (GCL) implementation of Common Lisp and the GPL'd version of the computer algebra system Macsyma called Maxima. Schelter authored Austin Kyoto Common Lisp (AKCL) under contract with IBM. AKCL formed the foundation for Axiom, another computer algebra system. AKCL eventually became GNU Common Lisp. He is also credited with the first port of the GNU C compiler to the Intel 386 architecture, used in the original implementation of the Linux kernel.\nSchelter obtained his Ph.D. at McGill University in 1972. His mathematical specialties were noncommutative ring theory and computational algebra and its applications, including automated theorem proving in geometry.\nIn the summer of 2001, age 54, he died suddenly of a heart attack while traveling in Russia.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
