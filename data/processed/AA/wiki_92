The first seven ecumenical councils, recognised by both the eastern and western denominations comprising Chalcedonian Christianity, were convoked by Roman Emperors, who also enforced the decisions of those councils within the state church of the Roman Empire.\nStarting with the third ecumenical council, noteworthy schisms led to non-participation by some members of what had previously been considered a single Christian Church. Thus, some parts of Christianity did not attend later councils, or attended but did not accept the results. Bishops belonging to what became known as the Eastern Orthodox Church accept seven ecumenical councils, as described below. Bishops belonging to what became known as the Church of the East participated in the first two councils. Bishops belonging to what became known as Oriental Orthodoxy participated in the first four councils, but rejected the decisions of the fourth and did not attend any subsequent ecumenical councils.\nAcceptance of councils as ecumenical and authoritative varies between different Christian denominations. Disputes over Christological and other questions have led certain branches to reject some councils that others accept.\nAcceptance of councils by denomination.\nThe Church of the East (accused by others of adhering to Nestorianism) accepts as ecumenical the first two councils. Oriental Orthodox Churches accept the first three, while some accept also the previous Second Council of Ephesus.\nBoth the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church recognize as ecumenical the first seven councils, held from the 4th to the 9th centuries. While some Eastern Orthodox accept one later council as ecumenical (which was later repudiated by the Catholic Church), the Catholic Church continues to hold general councils of the bishops in full communion with the Pope, reckoning them as ecumenical. In all, the Catholic Church recognizes twenty-one councils as ecumenical.\nThe first four ecumenical councils are recognized by some Lutheran Churches, Anglican Communion and Reformed Churches\u2014though they are \"considered subordinate to Scripture\". The Lutheran World Federation recognizes the first seven Ecumenical Councils as \"exercises of apostolic authority\" and recognizes their decisions as authoritative; while member churches are not required to accept all theological statements produced by the Federation, but only to subscribe to the most basic Lutheran historical confessional documents, most do follow this recommendation. The Anglican Communion \"acknowledge the authoritative place of the Ecumenical Councils in the life of the Church.\" The Anglican Communion has further affirmed the following: The Anglican Communion has not expressly, or officially, defined, in its historic formularies or Canons, an exact number of those councils which it receives as Ecumenical, although there is a broad consensus in favour of the first four councils, and a respect for six and sometimes even seven.\nInfallibility of ecumenical councils.\nThe doctrine of the \"infallibility of ecumenical councils\" states that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils, which concern faith or morals, and to which the whole Church must adhere, are infallible. Such decrees are often labeled as 'Canons' and they often have an attached anathema, a penalty of excommunication, against those who refuse to believe the teaching. The doctrine does not claim that every aspect of every ecumenical council is dogmatic, but that every aspect of an ecumenical council is free of errors or impeccable.\nBoth the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches uphold versions of this doctrine. However, the Catholic Church holds that solemn definitions of ecumenical councils meet the conditions of infallibility only when approved by the Pope, while the Eastern Orthodox Church holds that an ecumenical council is itself infallible when pronouncing on a specific matter.\nProtestant churches would generally view ecumenical councils as fallible human institutions that have no more than a derived authority to the extent that they correctly expound Scripture (as most would generally consider occurred with the first four councils in regard to their dogmatic decisions).\nCouncil documents.\nChurch councils were, from the beginning, bureaucratic exercises. Written documents were circulated, speeches made and responded to, votes taken, and final documents published and distributed. A large part of what is known about the beliefs of heresies comes from the documents quoted in councils in order to be refuted, or indeed only from the deductions based on the refutations.\nMost councils dealt not only with doctrinal but also with disciplinary matters, which were decided in \"canons\" (\"laws\"). Study of the canons of church councils is the foundation of the development of canon law, especially the reconciling of seemingly contradictory canons or the determination of priority between them. Canons consist of doctrinal statements and disciplinary measures\u2014most Church councils and local synods dealt with immediate disciplinary concerns as well as major difficulties of doctrine. Eastern Orthodoxy typically views the purely doctrinal canons as dogmatic and applicable to the entire church at all times, while the disciplinary canons apply to a particular time and place and may or may not be applicable in other situations.\nCircumstances of the first ecumenical councils.\nOf the seven councils recognised in whole or in part by both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Church as ecumenical, all were called by a Roman emperor. The emperor gave them legal status within the entire Roman Empire. All were held in the eastern part of the Roman Empire. The bishop of Rome (self-styled as \"pope\" since the end of the fourth century) did not attend, although he sent legates to some of them.\nChurch councils were traditional and the ecumenical councils were a continuation of earlier councils (also known as synods) held in the Empire before Christianity was made legal. These include the Council of Jerusalem (c. 50), the Council of Rome (155), the Second Council of Rome (193), the Council of Ephesus (193), the Council of Carthage (251), the Council of Iconium (258), the Council of Antioch (264), the Councils of Arabia (246\u2013247), the Council of Elvira (306), the Council of Carthage (311), the Synod of Neo-Caesarea (c. 314), the Council of Ancyra (314) and the Council of Arles (314).\nThe first seven councils recognised in both East and West as ecumenical and several others to which such recognition is refused were called by the Byzantine emperors. In the first millennium, various theological and political differences such as Nestorianism or Dyophysitism caused parts of the Church to separate after councils such as those of Ephesus and Chalcedon, but councils recognised as ecumenical continued to be held.\nThe Council of Hieria of 754, held at the imperial palace of that name close to Chalcedon in Anatolia, was summoned by Byzantine Emperor Constantine V and was attended by 338 bishops, who regarded it as the seventh ecumenical council. The Second Council of Nicaea, which annulled that of Hieria, was itself annulled at the synod held in 815 in Constantinople under Emperor Leo V. This synod, presided over by Patriarch Theodotus I of Constantinople, declared the Council of Hieria to be the seventh ecumenical council, but, although the Council of Hieria was called by an emperor and confirmed by another, and although it was held in the East, it later ceased to be considered ecumenical.\nSimilarly, the Second Council of Ephesus of 449, also held in Anatolia, was called by the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II and, though annulled by the Council of Chalcedon, was confirmed by Emperor Basiliscus, who annulled the Council of Chalcedon. \nCatholic views on those circumstances.\nThe Catholic Church does not consider the validity of an ecumenical council's teaching to be in any way dependent on where it is held or on the granting or withholding of prior authorization or legal status by any state, in line with the attitude of the 5th-century bishops who \"saw the definition of the church's faith and canons as supremely their affair, with or without the leave of the Emperor\" and who \"needed no one to remind them that Synodical process pre-dated the Christianisation of the royal court by several centuries\".\nThe Catholic Church recognizes as ecumenical various councils held later than the First Council of Ephesus (after which churches out of communion with the Holy See because of the Nestorian Schism did not participate), later than the Council of Chalcedon (after which there was no participation by churches that rejected Dyophysitism), later than the Second Council of Nicaea (after which there was no participation by the Eastern Orthodox Church), and later than the Fifth Council of the Lateran (after which groups that adhered to Protestantism did not participate).\nOf the twenty-one ecumenical councils recognised by the Catholic Church, some gained recognition as ecumenical only later. Thus the Eastern First Council of Constantinople became ecumenical only when its decrees were rejected in the West.\nList of ecumenical councils.\nFirst seven ecumenical councils.\nIn the history of Christianity, the first seven ecumenical councils, from the First Council of Nicaea (325) to the Second Council of Nicaea (787), represent an attempt to reach an orthodox consensus and to unify Christendom.\nAll of the original seven ecumenical councils as recognized in whole or in part were called by an emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire and all were held in the Eastern Roman Empire, a recognition denied to other councils similarly called by an Eastern Roman emperor and held in his territory, in particular the Council of Serdica (343), the Second Council of Ephesus (449) and the Council of Hieria (754), which saw themselves as ecumenical or were intended as such.\n1.The First Council of Nicaea (325) repudiated Arianism, declared that Christ is \"homoousios with the Father\" (of the same substance as the Father), and adopted the original Nicene Creed; addressed the Quartodeciman controversy by fixing the date of Easter; recognised authority of the sees of Rome, Alexandria and Antioch outside their own civil provinces and granted the see of Jerusalem a position of honour.\n2.The First Council of Constantinople (381) repudiated Arianism and Macedonianism, declared that Christ is \"born of the Father before all time\", revised the Nicene Creed in regard to the Holy Spirit and water baptism.\n3.The Council of Ephesus (431) repudiated Nestorianism, proclaimed the Virgin Mary as the Theotokos (\"Birth-giver to God\", \"God-bearer\", \"Mother of God\"), repudiated Pelagianism, and reaffirmed the Nicene Creed.\"This and all the following councils in this list are not recognised by all of the Church of the East.\"\n\u2022The Second Council of Ephesus (449) received Eutyches as orthodox based on his petition outlining his confession of faith. It also deposed Theodoret of Cyrrhus and Ibas of Edessa, and condemned Ibas's Letter to \"Maris the Persian\" (possibly a misunderstood title, indicating as the receiver a certain Catholicus Dadyeshu, bishop of Ardashir/Ctesiphon between 421 and 456; this same letter later became one of the Three Chapters).\"Though originally convened as an ecumenical council, this council is not recognised as ecumenical and is denounced as a \"Robber Council\" by the Chalcedonians (Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Protestants).\"\n4.The Council of Chalcedon (451) repudiated the Eutychian doctrine of monophysitism, and instead adopted the Chalcedonian Creed, which described the hypostatic union of the two natures of Christ, human and divine. It accordingly reinstated those deposed in 449 including Theodoret of Cyrus restored Ibas of Edessa to his see and declared him innocent upon reading his letter. It also deposed Dioscorus of Alexandria, and elevated the bishoprics of Constantinople and Jerusalem to the status of patriarchates. This is also the last council explicitly recognised by the Anglican Communion. &lt;br&gt; \"This council is rejected by Oriental Orthodox churches.\"\n\u2022The Third Council of Ephesus (475) ratified an encyclical of Emperor Basiliscus which repudiated the Council of Chalcedon and particularly the Tome of Leo. &lt;br&gt; \"This council is recognised by all the Oriental Orthodox churches, but is not recognised by the Chalcedonians (Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Protestants). All the following councils in this list are rejected or at least not explicitly affirmed by Oriental Orthodox churches.\"\n5.The Second Council of Constantinople (553) repudiated the Three Chapters as Nestorian, condemned Origenism, and decreed the theopaschite formula.\n6.The Third Council of Constantinople (680\u2013681) repudiated monothelitism and monoenergism.\n\u2022The Quinisext Council, also called Council in Trullo (692) addressed matters of discipline (in amendment to the 5th and 6th councils).&lt;br&gt;\"The ecumenical status of this council was repudiated by the Catholic church.\"\n7.The Second Council of Nicaea (787) restored the veneration of icons (condemned at the Council of Hieria, 754) and repudiated iconoclasm.\nFurther councils recognised as ecumenical in the Catholic Church.\nAs late as the 11th century, seven councils were recognised as ecumenical in the Catholic Church. Then, in the time of Pope Gregory VII (1073\u20131085), canonists who in the Investiture Controversy quoted the prohibition in canon 22 of the Council of Constantinople of 869\u2013870 against laymen influencing the appointment of prelates elevated this council to the rank of ecumenical council. In the 16th century was recognition as ecumenical granted by Catholic scholars to the Councils of the Lateran, of Lyon and those that followed. The following is a list of further councils recognised as ecumenical by the Catholic Church\n8 Fourth Council of Constantinople (869\u2013870) deposed Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople as a usurper and reinstated his predecessor Saint Ignatius, thus ending the Photian schism. Photius had already been declared deposed by the Pope, an act to which the See of Constantinople acquiesced at this council.\n9. First Council of the Lateran (1123) addressed investment of bishops and the Holy Roman Emperor's role therein.\n10. Second Council of the Lateran (1139) reaffirmed Lateran I and addressed clerical discipline (clerical celibacy, dress).\n11. Third Council of the Lateran (1179) restricted papal election to the cardinals, condemned simony, and introduced minimum ages for ordination (thirty for bishops).\n12. Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) defined transubstantiation, addressed papal primacy and clerical discipline.\n13. First Council of Lyon (1245) proclaimed the deposition of Emperor Frederick II and instituted a levy to support the Holy Land.\n14. Second Council of Lyon (1274) attempted reunion with the Eastern churches, defined teaching on purgatory, approved Franciscan and Dominican orders, a tithe to support crusades, and conclave procedures.\n15. Council of Vienne (1311\u20131312) disbanded the Knights Templar.\n\u2022 Council of Pisa (1409) attempted to solve the Great Western Schism.&lt;br&gt;\"The council is not numbered because it was not convened by a pope and its outcome was repudiated at Constance.\"\n16. Council of Constance (1414\u20131418) resolved the Great Western Schism and condemned John Hus.&lt;br&gt;\"The Catholic Church declared invalid the first sessions of the Council of Constance, gathered under the authority of Antipope John XXIII, which included the famous decree \"Haec Sancta Synodus\", which marked the high-water mark of the conciliar movement of reform.\" Decrees of the council later annulled by Pope Sixtus IV\n\u2022Council of Siena (1423\u20131424) addressed church reform.&lt;br&gt;Not numbered as it was swiftly disbanded.\n17. Council of Basel, Ferrara and Florence (1431\u20131445) addressed church reform and reunion with the Eastern Churches but split into two parties. The fathers remaining at Basel became the apogee of conciliarism. The fathers at Florence achieved union with various Eastern Churches and temporarily with the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n18. Fifth Council of the Lateran (1512\u20131517) addressed church reform.\n19. Council of Trent (1545\u20131563, with interruptions) addressed church reform and repudiated Protestantism, defined the role and canon of Scripture and the seven sacraments, and strengthened clerical discipline and education. Considered the founding event of the Counter-Reformation.&lt;br&gt;\"Temporarily attended by Lutheran delegates.\"\n20. First Council of the Vatican (1869\u20131870) defined the Pope's primacy in church governance and his infallibility, repudiated rationalism, materialism and atheism, addressed revelation, interpretation of scripture and the relationship of faith and reason.\n21. Second Council of the Vatican (1962\u20131965) addressed pastoral and disciplinary issues dealing with the Church and its relation to the modern world, including liturgy and ecumenism.\nFurther councils recognised as ecumenical by some Eastern Orthodox.\nEastern Orthodox catechisms teach that there are seven ecumenical councils and there are feast days for seven ecumenical councils. Nonetheless, some Eastern Orthodox theologians consider events like the rival Council of Constantinople of 879\u2013880, that of Constantinople in 1341\u20131351 and that of Jerusalem in 1672 to be ecumenical:\nIt is unlikely that formal ecumenical recognition will be granted to these councils, despite the acknowledged orthodoxy of their decisions, so that seven are universally recognized among the Eastern Orthodox as ecumenical.\nThe 2016 Pan-Orthodox Council was sometimes referred to as a potential \"Eighth Ecumenical Council\" following debates on several issues facing Eastern Orthodoxy; however, not all autocephalous churches were represented.\nAcceptance of the councils.\nAlthough some Protestants reject the concept of an ecumenical council establishing doctrine for the entire Christian faith, Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox all accept the authority of ecumenical councils in principle. Where they differ is in which councils they accept and what the conditions are for a council to be considered \"ecumenical\". The relationship of the Papacy to the validity of ecumenical councils is a ground of controversy between Catholicism and the Eastern Orthodox churches. The Catholic Church holds that recognition by the Pope is an essential element in qualifying a council as ecumenical; Eastern Orthodox view approval by the Bishop of Rome (the Pope) as being roughly equivalent to that of other patriarchs.\nSome have held that a council is ecumenical only when all five patriarchs of the Pentarchy are represented at it. Others reject this theory in part because there were no patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem at the time of the first ecumenical council.\nCatholic Church.\nBoth the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches recognize seven councils in the early centuries of the church, but Catholics also recognize fourteen councils in later times called or confirmed by the Pope. At the urging of German King Sigismund, who was to become Holy Roman Emperor in 1433, the Council of Constance was convoked in 1414 by Antipope John XXIII, one of three claimants to the papal throne, and was reconvened in 1415 by the Roman Pope Gregory XII. The Council of Florence is an example of a council accepted as ecumenical in spite of being rejected by the East, as the Councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon are accepted in spite of being rejected respectively by the Church of the East and Oriental Orthodoxy.\nThe Catholic Church teaches that an ecumenical council is a gathering of the College of Bishops (of which the Bishop of Rome is an essential part) to exercise in a solemn manner its supreme and full power over the whole Church. It holds that \"there never is an ecumenical council which is not confirmed or at least recognized as such by Peter's successor\". Its present canon law requires that an ecumenical council be convoked and presided over, either personally or through a delegate, by the Pope, who is also to decide the agenda; but the church makes no claim that all past ecumenical councils observed these present rules, declaring only that the Pope's confirmation or at least recognition has always been required, and saying that the version of the Nicene Creed adopted at the First Council of Constantinople (381) was accepted by the Church of Rome only seventy years later, in 451.\nEastern Orthodox Church.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Church accepts seven ecumenical councils, with the disputed Council in Trullo\u2014rejected by Catholics\u2014being incorporated into, and considered as a continuation of, the Third Council of Constantinople.\nTo be considered ecumenical, Orthodox accept a council that meets the condition that it was accepted by the whole church. That it was called together legally is also an important factor. A case in point is the Third Ecumenical Council, where two groups met as duly called for by the emperor, each claiming to be the legitimate council. The Emperor had called for bishops to assemble in the city of Ephesus. Theodosius did not attend but sent his representative Candidian to preside. However, Cyril managed to open the council over Candidian's insistent demands that the bishops disperse until the delegation from Syria could arrive. Cyril was able to completely control the proceedings, completely neutralizing Candidian, who favored Cyril's antagonist, Nestorius. When the pro-Nestorius Antiochene delegation finally arrived, they decided to convene their own council, over which Candidian presided. The proceedings of both councils were reported to the emperor, who decided ultimately to depose Cyril, Memnon and Nestorius. Nonetheless, the Orthodox accept Cyril's group as being the legitimate council because it maintained the same teaching that the church has always taught.\nParaphrasing a rule by St Vincent of L\u00e9rins, Hasler states\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...a teaching can only be defined if it has been held to be revealed at all times, everywhere, and by all believers.\nOrthodox believe that councils could over-rule or even depose popes. At the Sixth Ecumenical Council, Pope Honorius and Patriarch Sergius were declared heretics. The council anathematized them and declared them tools of the devil and cast them out of the church.\nIt is their position that, since the Seventh Ecumenical Council, there has been no synod or council of the same scope. Local meetings of hierarchs have been called \"pan-Orthodox\", but these have invariably been simply meetings of local hierarchs of whatever Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions are party to a specific local matter. From this point of view, there has been no fully \"pan-Orthodox\" (Ecumenical) council since 787. The use of the term \"pan-Orthodox\" is confusing to those not within Eastern Orthodoxy, and it leads to mistaken impressions that these are \"ersatz\" ecumenical councils rather than purely local councils to which nearby Orthodox hierarchs, regardless of jurisdiction, are invited.\nOthers, including 20th-century theologians Metropolitan Hierotheos (Vlachos) of Naupactus, Fr. John S. Romanides, and Fr. George Metallinos (all of whom refer repeatedly to the \"Eighth and Ninth Ecumenical Councils\"), Fr. George Dragas, and the 1848 Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs (which refers explicitly to the \"Eighth Ecumenical Council\" and was signed by the patriarchs of Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria as well as the Holy Synods of the first three), regard other synods beyond the Seventh Ecumenical Council as being ecumenical.\nFrom the Eastern Orthodox perspective, a council is accepted as being ecumenical if it is accepted by the Eastern Orthodox church at large\u2014clergy, monks and assembly of believers. Teachings from councils that purport to be ecumenical, but which lack this acceptance by the church at large, are, therefore, not considered ecumenical.\nOriental Orthodoxy.\nOriental Orthodoxy accepts three ecumenical councils, the First Council of Nicaea, the First Council of Constantinople, and the Council of Ephesus. Some theologians of the Oriental Orthodox Church also recognize the Second Council of Ephesus as ecumenical that was ratified by the principal patriarchs in the time and the people, except the Pope.\nThe formulation of the Chalcedonian Creed caused a schism in the Alexandrian and Syriac churches. Reconciliatory efforts between Oriental Orthodox with the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic Church in the mid- and late 20th century have led to common Christological declarations. The Oriental and Eastern Churches have also been working toward reconciliation as a consequence of the ecumenical movement.\nThe Oriental Orthodox hold that the Dyophysite formula of two natures formulated at the Council of Chalcedon is inferior to the Miaphysite formula of \"One Incarnate Nature of God the Word\" (Byzantine Greek: \"Mia physis tou theou logou sarkousomene\") and that the proceedings of Chalcedon themselves were motivated by imperial politics. The Alexandrian Church, the main Oriental Orthodox body, also felt unfairly underrepresented at the council following the deposition of their Pope, Dioscorus of Alexandria at the council.\nChurch of the East.\nThe Church of the East accepts two ecumenical councils, the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople, as well as a series of their own national councils, starting with the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410 AD. It was the formulation of Mary as the Theotokos which caused a schism with the Church of the East, now divided between the Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East, while the Chaldean Catholic Church entered into full communion with Rome in the 16th century. Meetings between Pope John Paul II and the Assyrian Patriarch Mar Dinkha IV led to a common Christological declaration on 11 November 1994 that \"the humanity to which the Blessed Virgin Mary gave birth always was that of the Son of God himself\". Both sides recognised the legitimacy and rightness, as expressions of the same faith, of the Assyrian Church's liturgical invocation of Mary as \"the Mother of Christ our God and Saviour\" and the Catholic Church's use of \"the Mother of God\" and also as \"the Mother of Christ\".\nProtestantism.\nLutheran Churches.\nThe Lutheran World Federation, in ecumenical dialogues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, has affirmed all of the first seven councils as ecumenical and authoritative. It teaches:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Both Orthodox and Lutherans affirm that apostolic authority was exercised in the ecumenical councils of the Church in which the bishops, through illumination and glorification brought about by the Holy Spirit, exercised responsibility. Ecumenical councils are a special gift of God to the Church and are an authoritative inheritance through the ages. Through ecumenical councils the Holy Spirit has led the Church to preserve and transmit the faith once delivered to the saints. They handed on the prophetic and apostolic truth, formulated it against heresies of their time and safeguarded the unity of the churches.\nAnglican Communion.\nArticle XXI of the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion of Anglicanism teaches: \"General Councils ... when they be gathered together, forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and word of God, they may err and sometime have erred, even in things pertaining to God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.\"\nThe 19th Canon of 1571 asserted the authority of the Councils in this manner: \"Let preachers take care that they never teach anything ... except what is agreeable to the doctrine of the Old and New Testament, and what the Catholic Fathers and ancient Bishops have collected from the same doctrine.\" This remains the Church of England's teaching on the subject. A modern version of this appeal to catholic consensus is found in the Canon Law of the Church of England and also in the liturgy published in \"Common Worship\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Church of England is part of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church, worshipping the one true God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It professes the faith uniquely revealed in the Holy Scriptures and set forth in the catholic creeds, which faith the Church is called upon to proclaim afresh in each generation. Led by the Holy Spirit, it has borne witness to Christian truth in its historic formularies, the Thirty-nine Articles of Religion, \"The Book of Common Prayer\" and the Ordering of Bishops, Priests and Deacons.\nI, AB, do so affirm, and accordingly declare my belief in the faith which is revealed in the Holy Scriptures and set forth in the catholic creeds and to which the historic formularies of the Church of England bear witness; and in public prayer and administration of the sacraments, I will use only the forms of service which are authorized or allowed by Canon.\nThe 1559 Act of Supremacy made a distinction between the decisions of the first four ecumenical councils, which were to be used as sufficient proof that something was heresy, as opposed to those of later councils, which could only be used to that purpose if \"the same was declared heresy by the express and plain words of the ... canonical Scriptures\". As such, the Anglican tradition accepts the first four ecumenical councils, though they \"considered subordinate to Scripture\".\nWhile the Councils are part of the \"historic formularies\" of Anglican tradition, it is difficult to locate an explicit reference in Anglicanism to the unconditional acceptance of all Seven Ecumenical Councils. There is little evidence of dogmatic or canonical acceptance beyond the statements of individual Anglican theologians and bishops. Anglican cleric of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship Bishop Chandler Holder Jones, SSC, explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe quotes William Tighe, Associate Professor of History at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, (another member of the Anglo-Catholic wing of Anglicanism):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMethodist Churches.\nMethodist theologian Charles W. Brockwell Jr wrote that the first \"four ecumenical councils produced and clarified the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Symbol (Nicene Creed), the most important document in Christian history after the Bible itself.\"\nThe Manual of the Church of the Nazarene, part of the Wesleyan-Holiness movement within Methodism, states \"Our denomination receives the creeds of the first five Christian centuries as expressions of its own faith,\" including the Christological doctrines formulated during the first four Ecumenical Councils.\nOther Protestant denominations.\nSome, including some fundamentalist Christians, condemn the ecumenical councils for other reasons. Independency or congregationalist polity among Protestants may involve the rejection of any governmental structure or binding authority above local congregations; conformity to the decisions of these councils is therefore considered purely voluntary and the councils are to be considered binding only insofar as those doctrines are derived from the Scriptures. Many of these churches reject the idea that anyone other than the authors of Scripture can directly lead other Christians by original divine authority; after the New Testament, they assert, the doors of revelation were closed and councils can only give advice or guidance, but have no authority. They consider new doctrines not derived from the sealed canon of Scripture to be both impossible and unnecessary whether proposed by church councils or by more recent prophets. Catholic and Orthodox objections to this position point to the fact that the Canon of Scripture itself was fixed by these councils. They conclude that this would lead to a logical inconsistency of a non-authoritative body fixing a supposedly authoritative source.\nNontrinitarian groups.\nEcumenical councils are not recognised by nontrinitarian churches such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (and other denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement), Christadelphians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Church of God (Seventh-Day), their descendants and Unitarians. They view the ecumenical councils as misguided human attempts to establish doctrine, and as attempts to define dogmas by debate rather than by revelation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first confirmed detection of an exoplanet was in 1992 around a pulsar, and the first detection around a main-sequence star was in 1995. A different planet, first detected in 1988, was confirmed in 2003. In 2016, it was recognized that the first possible evidence of an exoplanet had been noted in 1917. As of none }}, there are 6,042 confirmed exoplanets in 4,501 planetary systems, with 1,020 systems having more than one planet.\nThere are many methods of detecting exoplanets. Transit photometry and Doppler spectroscopy have found the most, but these methods suffer from a clear observational bias favoring the detection of planets near the star; thus, 85% of the exoplanets detected are inside the tidal locking zone. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars are estimated to have an \"Earth-sized\" planet in the habitable zone. Assuming there are 200 billion stars in the Milky Way, it can be hypothesized that there are 11 billion potentially habitable Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way, rising to 40 billion if planets orbiting the numerous red dwarfs are included.\nThe least massive exoplanet known is Draugr, which is about twice the mass of the Moon. The most massive exoplanet listed on the NASA Exoplanet Archive is HR 2562 b, about 30 times the mass of Jupiter. However, according to some definitions of a planet (based on the nuclear fusion of deuterium), it is too massive to be a planet and might be a brown dwarf. Known orbital times for exoplanets vary from less than an hour (for those closest to their star) to thousands of years. Some exoplanets are so far away from the star that it is difficult to tell whether they are gravitationally bound to it.\nThe nearest exoplanets are located 4.2 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from Earth and orbit Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun. At the other extreme, there is evidence for extragalactic planets\u00a0\u2013 exoplanets located in other galaxies. \nThe discovery of exoplanets has intensified interest in the search for extraterrestrial life. There is special interest in planets that orbit in a star's habitable zone (sometimes called \"goldilocks zone\"), where it is possible for liquid water, a prerequisite for life as we know it, to exist on the surface. However, the study of planetary habitability also considers a wide range of other factors in determining the suitability of a planet for hosting life.\nIn collaboration with ground-based and other space-based observatories, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expected to give more insight into exoplanet traits, such as their composition, environmental conditions, and habitability.\nRogue planets are those that are not in planetary systems. Such objects are generally considered in a separate category from planets, especially if they are gas giants, often counted as sub-brown dwarfs. The rogue planets in the Milky Way possibly number in the billions or more.\nDefinition.\nIAU.\nThe official definition of the term \"planet\" used by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) only covers the Solar System and thus does not apply to exoplanets. The IAU Working Group on Extrasolar Planets issued a position statement containing a working definition of \"planet\" in 2001 and which was modified in 2003. An \"exoplanet\" was defined by the following criteria:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis working definition was amended by the IAU's Commission F2: Exoplanets and the Solar System in August 2018. The official working definition of an \"exoplanet\" is now as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAlternatives.\nThe IAU's working definition is not always used. One alternate suggestion is that planets should be distinguished from brown dwarfs on the basis of their formation. It is widely thought that giant planets form through core accretion, which may sometimes produce planets with masses above the deuterium fusion threshold; massive planets of that sort may have already been observed. Brown dwarfs form like stars from the direct gravitational collapse of clouds of gas, and this formation mechanism also produces objects that are below the 13\u00a0MJup limit and can be as low as 1\u00a0MJup. Objects in this mass range that orbit their stars with wide separations of hundreds or thousands of astronomical units (AU) and have large star/object mass ratios likely formed as brown dwarfs; their atmospheres would likely have a composition more similar to their host star than accretion-formed planets, which would contain increased abundances of heavier elements. Most directly imaged planets as of April 2014 are massive and have wide orbits so probably represent the low-mass end of a brown dwarf formation. One study suggests that objects above 10\u00a0MJup formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets.\nAlso, the 13-Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have a precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with a mass below that cutoff. The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object. In 2011, the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia included objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, \"The fact that there is no special feature around 13\u00a0MJup in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit\". As of 2016, this limit was increased to 60 Jupiter masses based on a study of mass\u2013density relationships. The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: \"The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity.\" The NASA Exoplanet Archive includes objects with a mass (or minimum mass) equal to or less than 30 Jupiter masses. Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium fusion, formation process or location, is whether the core pressure is dominated by Coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure with the dividing line at around 5 Jupiter masses.\nConfirmation.\nAn exoplanet is confirmed for NASA's Exoplanet Archive either when \"different observation techniques reveal features that can only be explained by a planet\" or by analytical techniques. For the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia, \"A planet is considered as Confirmed if it is claimed unambiguously in an accepted paper or a professional conference.\"\nNomenclature.\n&lt;section begin=nomenclature /&gt;\nThe convention for naming exoplanets is an extension of the system used for designating multiple-star systems as adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). For exoplanets orbiting a single star, the IAU designation is formed by taking the designated or proper name of its parent star, and adding a lower case letter. Letters are given in order of each planet's discovery around the parent star, so that the first planet discovered in a system is designated \"b\" (the parent star is considered \"a\") and later planets are given subsequent letters. If several planets in the same system are discovered at the same time, the closest one to the star gets the next letter, followed by the other planets in order of orbital size. A provisional IAU-sanctioned standard exists to accommodate the designation of circumbinary planets. A limited number of exoplanets have IAU-sanctioned proper names. Other naming systems exist.&lt;section end=nomenclature /&gt;\nHistory of detection.\nFor centuries scientists, philosophers, and science fiction writers suspected that extrasolar planets existed, but there was no way of knowing whether they were real in fact, how common they were, or how similar they might be to the planets of the Solar System. Various detection claims made in the nineteenth century were rejected by astronomers.\nThe first evidence of a possible exoplanet, orbiting Van Maanen 2, was recorded in 1917, but was not recognized as such until 2016. The astronomer Walter Sydney Adams produced a spectrum of the star using Mount Wilson's 60-inch telescope which he interpreted the spectrum to be of an F-type main-sequence star. This spectrum was reexamined during studies of white dwarf stars with unpredicted compositions. It is now thought that such a spectrum could be caused by the residue of a nearby exoplanet that had been pulverized by the gravity of the star, the resulting dust then falling onto the star.\nNumerous other claims of discovery took place in the mid 20th century, involving 61 Cygnus, Lalande 21185, and Barnard's Star, which were not discredited until the mid to late 1970s (see Discredited claims below). Another suspected scientific detection of an exoplanet occurred in 1988. Shortly afterwards, the first detection that is currently accepted came in 1992 when Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two terrestrial-mass planets orbiting the millisecond pulsar PSR B1257+12. The first confirmation of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star was made in 1995, when a giant planet was found in a four-day orbit around the nearby star 51 Pegasi. Some exoplanets have been imaged directly by telescopes, but the vast majority have been detected through indirect methods, such as the transit method and the radial-velocity method.\nIn February 2018, researchers using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, combined with a planet detection technique called microlensing, found evidence of planets in a distant galaxy, stating, \"Some of these exoplanets are as (relatively) small as the moon, while others are as massive as Jupiter. Unlike Earth, most of the exoplanets are not tightly bound to stars, so they're actually wandering through space or loosely orbiting between stars. We can estimate that the number of planets in this [faraway] galaxy is more than a trillion.\"\nEarly speculations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nIn the sixteenth century, the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno, an early supporter of the Copernican theory that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun (heliocentrism), put forward the view that fixed stars are similar to the Sun and are likewise accompanied by planets.\nIn the eighteenth century, the same possibility was mentioned by Isaac Newton in the \"General Scholium\" that concludes his \"Principia\". Making a comparison to the Sun's planets, he wrote \"And if the fixed stars are the centres of similar systems, they will all be constructed according to a similar design and subject to the dominion of \"One\".\"\nIn 1938, D.Belorizky demonstrated that it was realistic to search for exo-Jupiters by using transit photometry.\nIn 1952, more than 40 years before the first hot Jupiter was discovered, Otto Struve wrote that there is no compelling reason that planets could not be much closer to their parent star than is the case in the Solar System, and proposed that Doppler spectroscopy and the transit method could detect super-Jupiters in short orbits.\nDiscredited claims.\nClaims of exoplanet detections have been made since the nineteenth century. Some of the earliest involve the binary star 70 Ophiuchi. In 1855, William Stephen Jacob at the East India Company's Madras Observatory reported that orbital anomalies made it \"highly probable\" that there was a \"planetary body\" in this system. In the 1890s, Thomas J. J. See of the University of Chicago and the United States Naval Observatory stated that the orbital anomalies proved the existence of a dark body in the 70\u00a0Ophiuchi system with a 36-year period around one of the stars. However, Forest Ray Moulton published a paper proving that a three-body system with those orbital parameters would be highly unstable.\nMultiple claims have been made that 61 Cygni might have a planetary system. Kaj Strand of the Sproul Observatory in 1942 observed tiny but systematic variations in the orbital motions of 61 Cygni A and B, suggesting that a third body of about 16 Jupiter masses must be orbiting 61 Cygni A. Multiple further claims were made, but more recent observations have yet to find confirmation. More information at 61 Cygni:Claims of a planetary system.\nAround the same time that 61 Cygni was being investigated, similar claims about the presence of exoplanets were made about Lalande 21185: Lalande 21185#Past claims of planets.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Peter van de Kamp of Swarthmore College made another prominent series of detection claims, this time for planets orbiting Barnard's Star. Astronomers now generally regard all early reports of detection as erroneous.\nIn 1991, Andrew Lyne, M. Bailes and S. L. Shemar claimed to have discovered a pulsar planet in orbit around PSR 1829-10, using pulsar timing variations. The claim briefly received intense attention, but Lyne and his team soon retracted it.\nConfirmed discoveries.\nAs of none }}, a total of 6,042 confirmed exoplanets are listed in the NASA Exoplanet Archive, including a few that were confirmations of controversial claims from the late 1980s. The first published discovery to receive subsequent confirmation was made in 1988 by the Canadian astronomers Bruce Campbell, G. A. H. Walker, and Stephenson Yang of the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia. Although they were cautious about claiming a planetary detection, their radial-velocity observations suggested that a planet orbits the star Gamma Cephei. Partly because the observations were at the very limits of instrumental capabilities at the time, astronomers remained skeptical for several years about this and other similar observations. It was thought some of the apparent planets might instead have been brown dwarfs, objects intermediate in mass between planets and stars. In 1990, additional observations were published that supported the existence of the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei, but subsequent work in 1992 again raised serious doubts. Finally, in 2003, improved techniques allowed the planet's existence to be confirmed.\nOn 9 January 1992, radio astronomers Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail announced the discovery of two planets orbiting the millisecond pulsar PSR 1257+12 based on the variability of timing of the pulses. This discovery was confirmed, and is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of exoplanets. Follow-up observations solidified these results, and confirmation of a third planet in 1994 revived the topic in the popular press. These pulsar planets are thought to have formed from the unusual remnants of the supernova that produced the pulsar, in a second round of planet formation, or else to be the remaining rocky cores of gas giants that somehow survived the supernova and then decayed into their current orbits. As pulsars are aggressive stars, it was considered unlikely at the time that a planet could form in their orbit.\nIn the early 1990s, a group of astronomers led by Donald Backer, who were studying what they thought was a binary pulsar (PSR B1620\u221226 b), determined that a third object was needed to explain the observed Doppler shifts. Within a few years, the gravitational effects of the planet on the orbit of the pulsar and white dwarf had been measured, giving an estimate of the mass of the third object that was too small to be a star. The conclusion that the third object was a planet was announced by Stephen Thorsett and his collaborators in 1993.\nOn 6 October 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, nearby G-type star 51 Pegasi. This discovery, made at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence, ushered in the modern era of exoplanetary discovery, and was recognized by a share of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics. Technological advances, most notably in high-resolution spectroscopy, led to the rapid detection of many new exoplanets: astronomers could detect exoplanets indirectly by measuring their gravitational influence on the motion of their host stars. More extrasolar planets were later detected by observing the variation in a star's apparent luminosity as an orbiting planet transited in front of it.\nInitially, most known exoplanets were massive planets that orbited very close to their parent stars. Astronomers were surprised by these \"hot Jupiters\", because theories of planetary formation had indicated that giant planets should only form at large distances from stars. But eventually more planets of other sorts were found, and it is now clear that hot Jupiters make up a minority of exoplanets. In 1999, Upsilon Andromedae became the first main-sequence star known to have multiple planets. Kepler-16 contains the first discovered planet that orbits a binary main-sequence star system.\nOn 26 February 2014, NASA announced the discovery of 715 newly verified exoplanets around 305 stars by the \"Kepler\" Space Telescope. These exoplanets were checked using a statistical technique called \"verification by multiplicity\". Before these results, most confirmed planets were gas giants comparable in size to Jupiter or larger because they were more easily detected, but the \"Kepler\" planets are mostly between the size of Neptune and the size of Earth.\nOn 23 July 2015, NASA announced Kepler-452b, a near-Earth-size planet orbiting the habitable zone of a G2-type star.\nOn 6 September 2018, NASA discovered an exoplanet about 145 light years away from Earth in the constellation Virgo. This exoplanet, Wolf 503b, is twice the size of Earth and was discovered orbiting a type of star known as an \"Orange Dwarf\". Wolf 503b completes one orbit in as few as six days because it is very close to the star. Wolf 503b is the only exoplanet that large that can be found near the so-called small planet radius gap. The gap, sometimes called the Fulton gap, is the observation that it is unusual to find exoplanets with sizes between 1.5 and 2 times the radius of the Earth.\nIn January 2020, scientists announced the discovery of TOI 700 d, the first Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone detected by TESS.\nCandidate discoveries.\nAs of January 2020, NASA's \"Kepler\" and TESS missions had identified 4374 planetary candidates yet to be confirmed, several of them being nearly Earth-sized and located in the habitable zone, some around Sun-like stars.\nIn September 2020, astronomers reported evidence, for the first time, of an extragalactic planet, M51-ULS-1b, detected by eclipsing a bright X-ray source (XRS), in the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51a).\nDetection methods.\nDirect imaging.\nPlanets are extremely faint compared to their parent stars. For example, a Sun-like star is about a billion times brighter than the reflected light from any exoplanet orbiting it. It is difficult to detect such a faint light source, and furthermore, the parent star causes a glare that tends to wash it out. It is necessary to block the light from the parent star to reduce the glare while leaving the light from the planet detectable; doing so is a major technical challenge which requires extreme optothermal stability. All exoplanets that have been directly imaged are both large (more massive than Jupiter) and widely separated from their parent stars.\nSpecially designed direct-imaging instruments such as Gemini Planet Imager, VLT-SPHERE, and SCExAO will image dozens of gas giants, but the vast majority of known extrasolar planets have only been detected through indirect methods.\n If a planet crosses (or transits) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed brightness of the star drops by a small amount. The amount by which the star dims depends on its size and on the size of the planet, among other factors. Because the transit method requires that the planet's orbit intersect a line-of-sight between the host star and Earth, the probability that an exoplanet in a randomly oriented orbit will be observed to transit the star is somewhat small. The Kepler telescope used this method.\n As a planet orbits a star, the star also moves in its own small orbit around the system's center of mass. Variations in the star's radial velocity\u2014that is, the speed with which it moves towards or away from Earth\u2014can be detected from displacements in the star's spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. Extremely small radial-velocity variations can be observed, of 1\u00a0m/s or even somewhat less.\nWhen multiple planets are present, each one slightly perturbs the others' orbits. Small variations in the times of transit for one planet can thus indicate the presence of another planet, which itself may or may not transit. For example, variations in the transits of the planet Kepler-19b suggest the existence of a second planet in the system, the non-transiting Kepler-19c.\n When a planet orbits multiple stars or if the planet has moons, its transit time can significantly vary per transit. Although no new planets or moons have been discovered with this method, it is used to successfully confirm many transiting circumbinary planets.\nMicrolensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. Planets orbiting the lensing star can cause detectable anomalies in magnification as it varies over time. Unlike most other methods which have a detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, the microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1\u201310\u00a0AU away from Sun-like stars.\n Astrometry consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky and observing the changes in that position over time. The motion of a star due to the gravitational influence of a planet may be observable. Because the motion is so small, however, this method was not very productive until the 2020s. It has produced only a few confirmed discoveries, though it has been successfully used to investigate the properties of planets found in other ways.\nA pulsar, a small, dense remnant of a star that has exploded as a supernova, emits radio waves regularly as it rotates. If planets orbit the pulsar, the motion of the pulsar around the system's center of mass alters the pulsar's distance to Earth over time. As a result, the radio pulses from the pulsar arrive on Earth at a later or earlier time. This light travel delay due to the pulsar being physically closer or farther from Earth is known as a Roemer time delay. The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet was made using this method. But as of 2011, it has not been very productive; five planets have been detected in this way, around three different pulsars.\nLike pulsars, there are some other types of stars which exhibit periodic activity. Deviations from periodicity can sometimes be caused by a planet orbiting it. As of 2013, a few planets have been discovered with this method.\nWhen a planet orbits very close to a star, it catches a considerable amount of starlight. As the planet orbits the star, the amount of light changes due to planets having phases from Earth's viewpoint or planets glowing more from one side than the other due to temperature differences.\nRelativistic beaming measures the observed flux from the star due to its motion. The brightness of the star changes as the planet moves closer or further away from its host star.\nMassive planets close to their host stars can slightly deform the shape of the star. This causes the brightness of the star to slightly deviate depending on how it is rotated relative to Earth.\nWith the polarimetry method, a polarized light reflected off the planet is separated from unpolarized light emitted from the star. No new planets have been discovered with this method, although a few already discovered planets have been detected with this method.\nDisks of space dust surround many stars, thought to originate from collisions among asteroids and comets. The dust can be detected because it absorbs starlight and re-emits it as infrared radiation. Features on the disks may suggest the presence of planets, though this is not considered a definitive detection method.\nFormation and evolution.\nPlanets may form within a few to tens (or more) of millions of years of their star forming.\nThe planets of the Solar System can only be observed in their current state, but observations of different planetary systems of varying ages allows us to observe planets at different stages of evolution. Available observations range from young protoplanetary disks where planets are still forming to planetary systems of over 10 Gyr old. When planets form in a gaseous protoplanetary disk, they accrete hydrogen/helium envelopes. These envelopes cool and contract over time and, depending on the mass of the planet, some or all of the hydrogen/helium is eventually lost to space. This means that even terrestrial planets may start off with large radii if they form early enough. An example is Kepler-51b which has only about twice the mass of Earth but is almost the size of Saturn, which is a hundred times the mass of Earth. Kepler-51b is quite young at a few hundred million years old.\nPlanet-hosting stars.\nThere is at least one planet on average per star. About 1 in 5 Sun-like stars have an \"Earth-sized\" planet in the habitable zone.\nMost known exoplanets orbit stars roughly similar to the Sun, i.e. main-sequence stars of spectral categories F, G, or K. Lower-mass stars (red dwarfs, of spectral category M) are less likely to have planets massive enough to be detected by the radial-velocity method. Despite this, several tens of planets around red dwarfs have been discovered by the Kepler space telescope, which uses the transit method to detect smaller planets.\nUsing data from Kepler, a correlation has been found between the metallicity of a star and the probability that the star hosts a giant planet, similar to the size of Jupiter. Stars with higher metallicity are more likely to have planets, especially giant planets, than stars with lower metallicity.\nSome planets orbit one member of a binary star system, and several circumbinary planets have been discovered which orbit both members of a binary star. A few planets in triple star systems are known and one in the quadruple system Kepler-64.\nGeneral features.\nColor and brightness.\nThe apparent brightness (apparent magnitude) of a planet depends on how far away the observer is, how reflective the planet is (albedo), and how much light the planet receives from its star, which depends on how far the planet is from the star and how bright the star is. So, a planet with a low albedo that is close to its star can appear brighter than a planet with a high albedo that is far from the star.\nIn 2013, the color of an exoplanet was determined for the first time. The best-fit albedo measurements of HD 189733b suggest that it is deep dark blue. Later that same year, the colors of several other exoplanets were determined, including GJ 504 b which visually has a magenta color, and Kappa Andromedae b, which if seen up close would appear reddish in color. Helium planets are expected to be white or grey in appearance.\nThe darkest known planet in terms of geometric albedo is TrES-2b, a hot Jupiter that reflects less than 1% of the light from its star, making it less reflective than coal or black acrylic paint. Hot Jupiters are expected to be quite dark due to sodium and potassium in their atmospheres, but it is not known why TrES-2b is so dark\u2014it could be due to an unknown chemical compound.\nFor gas giants, geometric albedo generally decreases with increasing metallicity or atmospheric temperature unless there are clouds to modify this effect. Increased cloud-column depth increases the albedo at optical wavelengths, but decreases it at some infrared wavelengths. Optical albedo increases with age, because older planets have higher cloud-column depths. Optical albedo decreases with increasing mass, because higher-mass giant planets have higher surface gravities, which produces lower cloud-column depths. Also, elliptical orbits can cause major fluctuations in atmospheric composition, which can have a significant effect.\nThere is more thermal emission than reflection at some near-infrared wavelengths for massive and/or young gas giants. So, although optical brightness is fully phase-dependent, this is not always the case in the near infrared.\nTemperatures of gas giants reduce over time and with distance from their stars. Lowering the temperature increases optical albedo even without clouds. At a sufficiently low temperature, water clouds form, which further increase optical albedo. At even lower temperatures, ammonia clouds form, resulting in the highest albedos at most optical and near-infrared wavelengths.\nMagnetic field.\nIn 2014, a magnetic field around HD 209458 b was inferred from the way hydrogen was evaporating from the planet. It is the first (indirect) detection of a magnetic field on an exoplanet. The magnetic field is estimated to be about one-tenth as strong as Jupiter's.\nThe magnetic fields of exoplanets are thought to be detectable by their auroral radio emissions with sensitive low-frequency radio telescopes such as LOFAR, although they have yet to be found. The radio emissions could measure the rotation rate of the interior of an exoplanet, and may yield a more accurate way to measure exoplanet rotation than by examining the motion of clouds. However, the most sensitive radio search for auroral emissions, thus far, from nine exoplanets with Arecibo also did not result in any discoveries.\nEarth's magnetic field results from its flowing liquid metallic core, but on massive super-Earths with high pressure, different compounds may form which do not match those created under terrestrial conditions. Compounds may form with greater viscosities and high melting temperatures, which could prevent the interiors from separating into different layers and so result in undifferentiated coreless mantles. Forms of magnesium oxide such as could be a liquid metal at the pressures and temperatures found in super-Earths and could generate a magnetic field in the mantles of super-Earths.\nHot Jupiters have been observed to have a larger radius than expected. This could be caused by the interaction between the stellar wind and the planet's magnetosphere creating an electric current through the planet that heats it up (Joule heating) causing it to expand. The more magnetically active a star is, the greater the stellar wind and the larger the electric current leading to more heating and expansion of the planet. This theory matches the observation that stellar activity is correlated with inflated planetary radii.\nIn August 2018, scientists announced the transformation of gaseous deuterium into a liquid metallic hydrogen form. This may help researchers better understand giant gas planets, such as Jupiter, Saturn and related exoplanets, since such planets are thought to contain a lot of liquid metallic hydrogen, which may be responsible for their observed powerful magnetic fields.\nAlthough scientists previously announced that the magnetic fields of close-in exoplanets may cause increased stellar flares and starspots on their host stars, in 2019 this claim was demonstrated to be false in the HD 189733 system. The failure to detect \"star-planet interactions\" in the well-studied HD 189733 system calls other related claims of the effect into question. A later search for radio emissions from eight exoplanets that orbit within 0.1 astronomical units of their host stars, conducted by the Arecibo radio telescope also failed to find signs of these magnetic star-planet interactions.\nIn 2019, the strength of the surface magnetic fields of 4 hot Jupiters were estimated and ranged between 20 and 120 gauss compared to Jupiter's surface magnetic field of 4.3 gauss.\nIn 2023 astronomers detected what might be the first sign of magnetosphere around a rocky exoplanet in the YZ Ceti system.\nPlate tectonics.\nIn 2007, two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger super-Earths with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or stagnant and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-Earths even if the planet is dry.\nIf super-Earths have more than 80 times as much water as Earth, then they become ocean planets with all land completely submerged. However, if there is less water than this limit, then the deep water cycle would move enough water between the oceans and mantle to allow continents to exist.\nVolcanism.\nLarge surface temperature variations on 55 Cancri e have been attributed to possible volcanic activity releasing large clouds of dust which blanket the planet and block thermal emissions.\nTidal heating caused by gravitational tug of neighboring planets might lead to the emergence of volcanic activities on a terrestrial exoplanet.\nRings.\nIn 2007, the star V1400 Centauri was occulted by an object (either a planet or brown dwarf) surrounded by an extensive disc of debris. The object, designated J1407b, was long believed to host a vast planetary ring system much larger than Saturn's rings. Follow-up observations found the supposed ring system could instead be a circumplanetary disk.\nThere is strong evidence of a ring system around HIP 41378 f, given the planet's measured radius is too large for its mass, the radius measurement might have been affected by a ring system around the planet.\nThe rings of the Solar System's gas giants are aligned with their planet's equator. However, for exoplanets that orbit close to their star, tidal forces from the star would lead to the outermost rings of a planet being aligned with the planet's orbital plane around the star. A planet's innermost rings would still be aligned with the planet's equator so that if the planet has a tilted rotational axis, then the different alignments between the inner and outer rings would create a warped ring system.\nMoons.\nThere is evidence that moons around other planets, commonly referred to exomoons, may exist. None has been confirmed so far.\nIn 2012 a candidate exomoon was detected around WASP-12b via periodic light variations in the planet's light curve. Subsequent observations found this object might actually be a trojan planet.\nIn December 2013, a candidate exomoon was detected in the microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-262, it was believed to be either a 0.5\u00a0M\ud83d\udf28 exomoon around a Jupiter-sized free-floating planet or a Neptune-mass planet around a red dwarf, but follow-up observations confirmed the latter scenario.\nOn 3 October 2018, evidence suggesting a large exomoon orbiting Kepler-1625b was reported, and in 2021 evidence of an exomoon around Kepler-1708b was also reported. Their existence, however, remain doubtful, but follow-up observations may confirm these exomoons.\nThe detection of sodium in hot Jupiters such as WASP-76b, HD 189733 b or WASP-49b is likely due to a Io-like exomoon around these planets.\nAtmospheres.\nAtmospheres have been detected around several exoplanets. The first to be observed was HD 209458 b in 2001.\nAs of February 2014, more than fifty transiting and five directly imaged exoplanet atmospheres have been observed, resulting in detection of molecular spectral features; observation of day\u2013night temperature gradients; and constraints on vertical atmospheric structure. Also, an atmosphere has been detected on the non-transiting hot Jupiter Tau Bo\u00f6tis b.\nIn May 2017, glints of light from Earth, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere. The technology used to determine this may be useful in studying the atmospheres of distant worlds, including those of exoplanets.\nComet-like tails.\nKepler-1520b is a small rocky planet, very close to its star, that is evaporating and leaving a trailing tail of cloud and dust like a comet. The dust could be ash erupting from volcanos and escaping due to the small planet's low surface-gravity, or it could be from metals that are vaporized by the high temperatures of being so close to the star with the metal vapor then condensing into dust.\nIn June 2015, scientists reported that the atmosphere of GJ 436 b was evaporating, resulting in a giant cloud around the planet and, due to radiation from the host star, a long trailing tail long.\nInsolation pattern.\nTidally locked planets in a 1:1 spin-orbit resonance would have their star always shining directly overhead on one spot, which would be hot with the opposite hemisphere receiving no light and being freezing cold. Such a planet could resemble an eyeball, with the hotspot being the pupil. Planets with an eccentric orbit could be locked in other resonances. 3:2 and 5:2 resonances would result in a double-eyeball pattern with hotspots in both eastern and western hemispheres. Planets with both an eccentric orbit and a tilted axis of rotation would have more complicated insolation patterns.\nSurface.\nSurface composition.\nSurface features can be distinguished from atmospheric features by comparing emission and reflection spectroscopy with transmission spectroscopy. Mid-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets may detect rocky surfaces, and near-infrared may identify magma oceans or high-temperature lavas, hydrated silicate surfaces and water ice, giving an unambiguous method to distinguish between rocky and gaseous exoplanets.\nSurface temperature.\nMeasuring the intensity of the light it receives from its parent star can estimate the temperature of an exoplanet. For example, the planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb is estimated to have a surface temperature of roughly \u2212220\u00a0\u00b0C (50 K). However, such estimates may be substantially in error because they depend on the planet's usually unknown albedo, and because factors such as the greenhouse effect may introduce unknown complications. A few planets have had their temperature measured by observing the variation in infrared radiation as the planet moves around in its orbit and is eclipsed by its parent star. For example, the planet HD 189733b has been estimated to have an average temperature of 1,205 K (932\u00a0\u00b0C) on its dayside and 973 K (700\u00a0\u00b0C) on its nightside.\nHabitability.\nAs more planets are discovered, the field of exoplanetology continues to grow into a deeper study of extrasolar worlds, and will ultimately tackle the prospect of life on planets beyond the Solar System. At cosmic distances, life can only be detected if it is developed at a planetary scale and strongly modified the planetary environment, in such a way that the modifications cannot be explained by classical physico-chemical processes (out of equilibrium processes). For example, molecular oxygen () in the atmosphere of Earth is a result of photosynthesis by living plants and many kinds of microorganisms, so it can be used as an indication of life on exoplanets, although small amounts of oxygen could also be produced by non-biological means. Furthermore, a potentially habitable planet must orbit a stable star at a distance within which planetary-mass objects with sufficient atmospheric pressure can support liquid water at their surfaces.\nHabitable zone.\nThe habitable zone around a star is the region where the temperature is just right to allow liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet; that is, not too close to the star for the water to evaporate and not too far away from the star for the water to freeze. The heat produced by stars varies depending on the size and age of the star, so that the habitable zone can be at different distances for different stars. Also, the atmospheric conditions on the planet influence the planet's ability to retain heat so that the location of the habitable zone is also specific to each type of planet: desert planets (also known as dry planets), with very little water, will have less water vapor in the atmosphere than Earth and so have a reduced greenhouse effect, meaning that a desert planet could maintain oases of water closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun. The lack of water also means there is less ice to reflect heat into space, so the outer edge of desert-planet habitable zones is further out. Rocky planets with a thick hydrogen atmosphere could maintain surface water much further out than the Earth\u2013Sun distance. Planets with larger mass have wider habitable zones because gravity reduces the water cloud column depth which reduces the greenhouse effect of water vapor, thus moving the inner edge of the habitable zone closer to the star.\nPlanetary rotation rate is one of the major factors determining the circulation of the atmosphere and hence the pattern of clouds: slowly rotating planets create thick clouds that reflect more and so can be habitable much closer to their star. Earth with its current atmosphere would be habitable in Venus's orbit, if it had Venus's slow rotation. If Venus lost its water ocean due to a runaway greenhouse effect, it is likely to have had a higher rotation rate in the past. Alternatively, Venus never had an ocean because water vapor was lost to space during its formation and could have had its slow rotation throughout its history.\nTidally locked planets (a.k.a. \"eyeball\" planets) can be habitable closer to their star than previously thought due to the effect of clouds: at high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near the substellar point that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce surface temperatures.\nPlanets in the habitable zones of stars with low metallicity are more habitable for complex life on land than high metallicity stars because the stellar spectrum of high metallicity stars is less likely to cause the formation of ozone thus enabling more ultraviolet rays to reach the planet's surface.\nHabitable zones have usually been defined in terms of surface temperature, however over half of Earth's biomass is from subsurface microbes, and the temperature increases with depth, so the subsurface can be conducive for microbial life when the surface is frozen and if this is considered, the habitable zone extends much further from the star, even rogue planets could have liquid water at sufficient depths underground. In an earlier era of the universe the temperature of the cosmic microwave background would have allowed any rocky planets that existed to have liquid water on their surface regardless of their distance from a star. Jupiter-like planets might not be habitable, but they could have habitable moons.\nIce ages and snowball states.\nThe outer edge of the habitable zone is where planets are completely frozen, but planets well inside the habitable zone can periodically become frozen. If orbital fluctuations or other causes produce cooling, then this creates more ice, but ice reflects sunlight causing even more cooling, creating a feedback loop until the planet is completely or nearly completely frozen. When the surface is frozen, this stops carbon dioxide weathering, resulting in a build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from volcanic emissions. This creates a greenhouse effect which thaws the planet again. Planets with a large axial tilt are less likely to enter snowball states and can retain liquid water further from their star. Large fluctuations of axial tilt can have even more of a warming effect than a fixed large tilt. Paradoxically, planets orbiting cooler stars, such as red dwarfs, are less likely to enter snowball states because the infrared radiation emitted by cooler stars is mostly at wavelengths that are absorbed by ice which heats it up.\nTidal heating.\nIf a planet has an eccentric orbit, then tidal heating can provide another source of energy besides stellar radiation. This means that eccentric planets in the radiative habitable zone can be too hot for liquid water. Tides also circularize orbits over time, so there could be planets in the habitable zone with circular orbits that have no water because they used to have eccentric orbits. Eccentric planets further out than the habitable zone would still have frozen surfaces, but the tidal heating could create a subsurface ocean similar to Europa's. In some planetary systems, such as in the Upsilon Andromedae system, the eccentricity of orbits is maintained or even periodically varied by perturbations from other planets in the system. Tidal heating can cause outgassing from the mantle, contributing to the formation and replenishment of an atmosphere.\nPotentially habitable planets.\nA review in 2015 identified exoplanets Kepler-62f, Kepler-186f and Kepler-442b as the best candidates for being potentially habitable. These are at a distance of 1000, 490 and 1,120 light-years away, respectively. Of these, Kepler-186f is in similar size to Earth with its 1.2-Earth-radius measure, and it is located towards the outer edge of the habitable zone around its red dwarf star.\nWhen looking at the nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidates, Proxima Centauri b is about 4.2 light-years away. Its equilibrium temperature is estimated to be .\nPlanetary system.\nExoplanets are often members of planetary systems of multiple planets around a star. The planets interact with each other gravitationally and sometimes form resonant systems where the orbital periods of the planets are in integer ratios. The Kepler-223 system contains four planets in an 8:6:4:3 orbital resonance.\nSome hot Jupiters orbit their stars in the opposite direction to their stars' rotation. One proposed explanation is that hot Jupiters tend to form in dense clusters, where perturbations are more common and gravitational capture of planets by neighboring stars is possible.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9764", "revid": "16185737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9764", "title": "Emma Goldman", "text": "Lithuanian-born anarchist, writer and orator (1869\u20131940)\nEmma Goldman (June 27, 1869 \u2013 May 14, 1940) was a Russian-born anarchist revolutionary, political activist, and writer. She played a pivotal role in the development of anarchist political philosophy in North America and Europe in the first half of the 20th century.\nBorn in Kaunas, Lithuania (then within the Russian Empire), to a Lithuanian Jewish family, Goldman immigrated to the United States in 1885. Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket affair in Chicago, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands. She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Frick survived the attempt on his life in 1892, and Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for \"inciting to riot\" and illegally distributing information about birth control. In 1906, Goldman founded the anarchist journal \"Mother Earth\".\nIn 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to \"induce persons not to register\" for the newly instated draft. After their release from prison, they were arrested\u2014along with 248 others\u2014in the so-called Palmer Raids during the First Red Scare and deported to Russia in December 1919. Initially supportive of that country's October Revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman changed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion; she denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. She left the Soviet Union and in 1923 published a book about her experiences, \"My Disillusionment in Russia\". While living in England, Canada, and France, she wrote an autobiography called \"Living My Life\". It was published in two volumes, in 1931 and 1935. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Goldman traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there. She died in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1940, aged 70.\nDuring her life, Goldman was lionized as a freethinking \"rebel woman\" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from first-wave feminism and its efforts toward women's suffrage, she developed new ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. After decades of obscurity, Goldman gained iconic status in the 1970s by a revival of interest in her life, when feminist and anarchist scholars rekindled popular interest.\nBiography.\nFamily.\nEmma Goldman was born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Kaunas in Lithuania, then within the Russian Empire. Goldman's mother Taube Bienowitch had been married before to a man with whom she had two daughters\u2014Helena in 1860 and Lena in 1862. When her first husband died of tuberculosis, Taube was devastated. Goldman later wrote: \"Whatever love she had had died with the young man to whom she had been married at the age of fifteen.\"\nTaube's second marriage was arranged by her family and, as Goldman puts it, \"mismated from the first\". Her second husband, Abraham Goldman, invested Taube's inheritance in a business that quickly failed. The ensuing hardship, combined with the emotional distance between husband and wife, made the household a tense place for the children. When Taube became pregnant, Abraham hoped desperately for a son; a daughter, he believed, would be one more sign of failure. They eventually had three sons, but their first child was Emma.\nEmma Goldman was born on June 27, 1869. Her father used violence to punish his children, beating them when they disobeyed him. He used a whip on Emma, the most rebellious of them. Her mother provided scarce comfort, rarely calling on Abraham to tone down his beatings. Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper was at least partly a result of sexual frustration.\nGoldman's relationships with her elder half-sisters, Helena and Lena, were a study in contrasts. Helena, the oldest, provided the comfort the children lacked from their mother and filled Goldman's childhood with \"whatever joy it had\". Lena, however, was distant and uncharitable. The three sisters were joined by brothers Louis (who died at the age of six), Herman (born in 1872), and Moishe (born in 1879).\nAdolescence.\nWhen Emma Goldman was a young girl, the Goldman family moved to the village of Papil\u0117, where her father ran an inn. While her sisters worked, she became friends with a servant named Petrushka, who excited her \"first erotic sensations\". Later in Papil\u0117 she witnessed a peasant being whipped with a knout in the street. This event traumatized her and contributed to her lifelong distaste for violent authority.\nAt the age of seven, Goldman moved with her family to the Prussian city of K\u00f6nigsberg (then part of the German Empire), and she was enrolled in a \"Realschule\". One teacher punished disobedient students\u2014targeting Goldman in particular\u2014by beating their hands with a ruler. Another teacher tried to molest his female students and was fired when Goldman fought back. She found a sympathetic mentor in her German-language teacher, who loaned her books and took her to an opera. A passionate student, Goldman passed the exam for admission into a gymnasium, but her religion teacher refused to provide a certificate of good behavior and she was unable to attend.\nThe family moved to the Russian capital of Saint Petersburg, where her father opened one unsuccessful store after another. Their poverty forced the children to work, and Goldman took an assortment of jobs, including one in a corset shop. As a teenager Goldman begged her father to allow her to return to school, but instead he threw her French book into the fire and shouted: \"Girls do not have to learn much! All a Jewish daughter needs to know is how to prepare gefilte fish, cut noodles fine, and give the man plenty of children.\"\nGoldman pursued an independent education on her own. She studied the political turmoil around her, particularly the Nihilists responsible for assassinating Alexander II of Russia. The ensuing turmoil intrigued Goldman, although she did not fully understand it at the time. When she read Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel, \"What Is to Be Done?\" (1863), she found a role model in the protagonist Vera, who adopts a Nihilist philosophy and escapes her repressive family to live freely and organize a sewing cooperative. The book enthralled Goldman and remained a source of inspiration throughout her life.\nHer father, meanwhile, continued to insist on a domestic future for her, and he tried to arrange for her to be married at the age of fifteen. They fought about the issue constantly; he complained that she was becoming a \"loose\" woman, and she insisted that she would marry for love alone. At the corset shop, she was forced to fend off unwelcome advances from Russian officers and other men. One man took her into a hotel room and committed what Goldman described as \"violent contact\"; two biographers call it rape. She was stunned by the experience, overcome by \"shock at the discovery that the contact between man and woman could be so brutal and painful.\" Goldman felt that the encounter forever soured her interactions with men.\nRochester, New York.\nIn 1885, her sister Helena made plans to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer to pay for the trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman threatened to throw herself into the Neva River if she could not go. Their father finally agreed. On December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's Castle Garden, the entry for immigrants.\nThey settled upstate, living in the Rochester home which Lena had made with her husband, Samuel. Fleeing the rising antisemitism of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a seamstress, sewing overcoats for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.\nAt her new job, Goldman met a fellow worker named Jacob Kershner, who shared her love for books, dancing, and traveling, as well as her frustration with the monotony of factory work. After four months, they married in February 1887. Once he moved in with Goldman's family, their relationship faltered. On their wedding night she discovered that he was impotent; they became emotionally and physically distant. Before long he became jealous and suspicious and threatened to commit suicide should she leave him. Meanwhile, Goldman was becoming more engaged with the political turmoil around her, particularly the aftermath of executions related to the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago and the anti-authoritarian political philosophy of anarchism.\nLess than a year after the wedding, the couple were divorced; Kershner begged Goldman to return and threatened to poison himself if she did not. They reunited, but after three months she left once again. Her parents considered her behavior \"loose\" and refused to allow Goldman into their home. Carrying her sewing machine in one hand and a bag with five dollars in the other, she left Rochester and headed southeast to New York City.\nMost and Berkman.\nOn her first day in New York City, Goldman met two men who would have a significant and enduring influence on the course of her life. At Sachs' Caf\u00e9, a gathering place for radicals, she was introduced to Alexander Berkman, an anarchist who invited her to a public speech that evening. They went to hear Johann Most, editor of a radical publication called \"Freiheit\" and an advocate of \"propaganda of the deed\"\u2014the use of violence to instigate change. She was impressed by his fiery oration, and Most took her under his wing, training her in methods of public speaking. He encouraged her vigorously, telling her that she was \"to take my place when I am gone.\" One of her first public talks in support of \"the Cause\" was in Rochester. After convincing Helena not to tell their parents of her speech, Goldman found her mind a blank once on stage. She later wrote, suddenly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;something strange happened. In a flash I saw it\u2014every incident of my three years in Rochester: the Garson factory, its drudgery and humiliation, the failure of my marriage, the Chicago crime...I began to speak. Words I had never heard myself utter before came pouring forth, faster and faster. They came with passionate intensity...The audience had vanished, the hall itself had disappeared; I was conscious only of my own words, of my ecstatic song.\nExcited by the experience, Goldman refined her public persona during subsequent engagements. She quickly found herself arguing with Most over her independence. After a momentous speech in Cleveland, she felt as though she had become \"a parrot repeating Most's views\" and resolved to express herself on the stage. When she returned to New York, Most became furious and told her: \"Who is not with me is against me!\" She left \"Freiheit\" and joined another publication, \"Die Autonomie\".\nMeanwhile, Goldman had begun a friendship with Berkman, whom she affectionately called Sasha. Before long they became lovers and moved into a communal apartment with his cousin Modest \"Fedya\" Stein and Goldman's friend, Helene Minkin, on 42nd Street. Although their relationship had numerous difficulties, Goldman and Berkman would share a close bond for decades, united by their anarchist principles and commitment to personal equality.\nIn 1892, Goldman joined with Berkman and Stein in opening an ice cream shop in Worcester, Massachusetts. After a few months of operating the shop, Goldman and Berkman were diverted to participate in the Homestead Strike near Pittsburgh.\nHomestead plot.\nBerkman and Goldman came together through the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania, owned by Andrew Carnegie became the focus of national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton guards to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.\nWhen a majority of the nation's newspapers expressed support of the strikers, Goldman and Berkman resolved to assassinate Frick, an action they expected would inspire the workers to revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman chose to carry out the assassination and ordered Goldman to stay behind in order to explain his motives after he went to jail. He would be in charge of \"the deed\"; she of the associated propaganda. Berkman set off for Pittsburgh on his way to Homestead, where he planned to shoot Frick.\nGoldman, meanwhile, decided to help fund the scheme through prostitution. Remembering the character of Sonya in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel \"Crime and Punishment\" (1866), she mused: \"She had become a prostitute in order to support her little brothers and sisters ... Sensitive Sonya could sell her body; why not I?\" Once on the street, Goldman caught the eye of a man who took her into a saloon, bought her a beer, gave her ten dollars, informed her she did not have \"the knack,\" and told her to quit the business. She was \"too astounded for speech\". She wrote to Helena, claiming illness, and asked her for fifteen dollars.\nOn July 23, Berkman gained access to Frick's office while carrying a concealed handgun; he shot Frick three times, and stabbed him in the leg. A group of workers\u2014far from joining in his \"attentat\"\u2014beat Berkman unconscious, and he was carried away by the police. Berkman was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison. Goldman suffered during his long absence.\nConvinced Goldman was involved in the plot, police raided her apartment. Although they found no evidence, they pressured her landlord into evicting her. Furthermore, the \"attentat\" had failed to rouse the masses: workers and anarchists alike condemned Berkman's action. Johann Most, their former mentor, lashed out at Berkman and the assassination attempt. Furious at these attacks, Goldman brought a toy horsewhip to a public lecture and demanded, onstage, that Most explain his betrayal. He dismissed her, whereupon she struck him with the whip, broke it on her knee, and hurled the pieces at him. She later regretted her assault, confiding to a friend: \"At the age of twenty-three, one does not reason.\"\n\"Inciting to riot\".\nWhen the Panic of 1893 struck in the following year, the United States suffered one of its worst economic crises. By year's end, the unemployment rate was higher than 20 percent, and \"hunger demonstrations\" sometimes gave way to riots. Goldman began speaking to crowds of frustrated men and women in New York City. On August 21, she spoke to a crowd of nearly 3,000 people in Union Square, where she encouraged unemployed workers to take immediate action. Her exact words are unclear: undercover agents insist she ordered the crowd to \"take everything\u00a0...\u00a0by force\". But Goldman later recounted this message: \"Well then, demonstrate before the palaces of the rich; demand work. If they do not give you work, demand bread. If they deny you both, take bread.\" Later in court, Detective-Sergeant Charles Jacobs offered yet another version of her speech.\nA week later, Goldman was arrested in Philadelphia and returned to New York City for trial, charged with \"inciting to riot\". During the train ride, Jacobs offered to drop the charges against her if she would inform on other radicals in the area. She responded by throwing a glass of ice water in his face. As she awaited trial, Goldman was visited by Nellie Bly, a reporter for the \"New York World.\" She spent two hours talking to Goldman and wrote a positive article about the woman she described as a \"modern Joan of Arc.\"\nDespite this positive publicity, the jury was persuaded by Jacobs's testimony and frightened by Goldman's politics. The assistant district attorney questioned Goldman about her anarchism, as well as her atheism; the judge spoke of her as \"a dangerous woman\". She was sentenced to one year in the Blackwell's Island Penitentiary. Once inside, she suffered an attack of rheumatism and was sent to the infirmary. There, she befriended a visiting doctor and received informal training in nursing, eventually being placed in charge of a 16-bed women's ward in the infirmary. She also read dozens of books, including works by the American activist-writers Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau; novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne; poet Walt Whitman, and philosopher John Stuart Mill. When Goldman was released after ten months, a raucous crowd of nearly 3,000 people greeted her at the Thalia Theater in New York City. She soon became swamped with requests for interviews and lectures.\nTo make money, Goldman decided to continue the medical studies she had started in prison, but her preferred fields of specialization\u2014midwifery and massage\u2014were unavailable to nursing students in the United States. She sailed to Europe, lecturing in London, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. She met with renowned anarchists such as Errico Malatesta, Louise Michel, and Peter Kropotkin. In Vienna, she received two diplomas for midwifery and put them immediately to use back in the United States.\nAlternating between lectures and midwifery, Goldman conducted the first cross-country tour by an anarchist speaker. In November 1899, she returned to Europe to speak, where she met the Czech anarchist Hippolyte Havel in London. They went together to France and helped organize what would have been the 1900 International Anarchist Congress on the outskirts of Paris. Afterward, Havel immigrated to the United States, traveling with Goldman to Chicago. They shared a residence there with friends of Goldman.\nMcKinley assassination.\nOn September 6, 1901, Leon Czolgosz, an unemployed factory worker and anarchist, shot U.S. President William McKinley twice during a public speaking event in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was hit in the breastbone and stomach, and died eight days later. Czolgosz was arrested, and interrogated around the clock. During interrogation he claimed to be an anarchist and said he had been inspired to act after attending a speech by Goldman. The authorities used this as a pretext to charge Goldman with planning McKinley's assassination. They tracked her to the residence in Chicago she shared with Havel, as well as with Mary and Abe Isaak, an anarchist couple and their family. Goldman was arrested, along with Isaak, Havel, and ten other anarchists.\nEarlier, Czolgosz had tried but failed to become friends with Goldman and her companions. During a talk in Cleveland, Czolgosz had approached Goldman and asked her advice on which books he should read. In July 1901, he had appeared at the Isaak house, asking a series of unusual questions. They assumed he was an infiltrator, like a number of police agents sent to spy on radical groups. They had remained distant from him, and Abe Isaak sent a notice to associates warning of \"another spy\".\nAlthough Czolgosz repeatedly denied Goldman's involvement, the police held her in close custody, subjecting her to what she called the \"third degree\" (intense interrogation by police). She explained her housemates' distrust of Czolgosz, and the police finally recognized that she had not had any significant contact with the attacker. No evidence was found linking Goldman to the attack, and she was released after two weeks of detention. Before McKinley died, Goldman offered to provide nursing care, referring to him as \"merely a human being\". Czolgosz, despite considerable evidence of mental illness, was convicted of murder and executed.\nThroughout her detention and after her release, Goldman steadfastly refused to condemn Czolgosz's actions, standing virtually alone in doing so. Friends and supporters\u2014including Berkman\u2014urged her to quit his cause. But Goldman defended Czolgosz as a \"supersensitive being\" and chastised other anarchists for abandoning him. She was vilified in the press as the \"high priestess of anarchy\", while many newspapers declared the anarchist movement responsible for the murder. In the wake of these events, socialism gained support over anarchism among U.S. radicals. McKinley's successor, Theodore Roosevelt, declared his intent to crack down \"not only against anarchists, but against all active and passive sympathizers with anarchists\".\n\"Mother Earth\" and Berkman's release.\nAfter Czolgosz was executed, Goldman withdrew from society and, from 1903 to 1913, lived at 208\u2013210 East 13th Street, New York City. Scorned by her fellow anarchists, vilified by the press, and separated from her love, Berkman, she retreated into anonymity and nursing. \"It was bitter and hard to face life anew,\" she wrote later.\nUsing the name E. G. Smith, she left public life and took on a series of private nursing jobs while suffering from severe depression. The U.S. Congress's passage of the Anarchist Exclusion Act (1903) stirred a new wave of oppositional activism, pulling Goldman back into the movement. A coalition of people and organizations across the left end of the political spectrum opposed the law on grounds that it violated freedom of speech, and she had the nation's ear once again.\nAfter an English anarchist named John Turner was arrested under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and threatened with deportation, Goldman joined forces with the Free Speech League to champion his cause. The league enlisted the aid of noted attorneys Clarence Darrow and Edgar Lee Masters, who took Turner's case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although Turner and the League lost, Goldman considered it a victory of propaganda. She had returned to anarchist activism, but it was taking its toll on her. \"I never felt so weighed down,\" she wrote to Berkman. \"I fear I am forever doomed to remain public property and to have my life worn out through the care for the lives of others.\"\nIn 1906, Goldman decided to start a publication, \"a place of expression for the young idealists in arts and letters\". \"Mother Earth\" was staffed by a cadre of radical activists, including Hippolyte Havel, Max Baginski, and Leonard Abbott. In addition to publishing original works by its editors and anarchists around the world, \"Mother Earth\" reprinted selections from a variety of writers. These included the French philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and British writer Mary Wollstonecraft. Goldman wrote frequently about anarchism, politics, labor issues, atheism, sexuality, and feminism, and was the first editor of the magazine.\nOn May 18 of the same year, Alexander Berkman was released from prison. Carrying a bouquet of roses, Goldman met him on the train platform and found herself \"seized by terror and pity\" as she beheld his gaunt, pale form. Neither was able to speak; they returned to her home in silence. For weeks, he struggled to readjust to life on the outside: an abortive speaking tour ended in failure, and in Cleveland he purchased a revolver with the intent of killing himself. Upon returning to New York, he learned that Goldman had been arrested with a group of activists meeting to reflect on Czolgosz. Invigorated anew by this violation of freedom of assembly, he declared, \"My resurrection has come!\" and set about securing their release.\nBerkman took the helm of \"Mother Earth\" in 1907, while Goldman toured the country to raise funds to keep it operating. Editing the magazine was a revitalizing experience for Berkman. But his relationship with Goldman faltered, and he had an affair with a 15-year-old anarchist named Becky Edelsohn. Goldman was pained by his rejection of her but considered it a consequence of his prison experience. Later that year she served as a delegate from the U.S. to the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam. Anarchists and syndicalists from around the world gathered to sort out the tension between the two ideologies, but no decisive agreement was reached. Goldman returned to the U.S. and continued speaking to large audiences.\nReitman, essays, and birth control.\nFor the next ten years, Goldman traveled around the country nonstop, delivering lectures and agitating for anarchism. The coalitions formed in opposition to the Anarchist Exclusion Act had given her an appreciation for reaching out to those of other political positions. When the U.S. Justice Department sent spies to observe, they reported the meetings as \"packed\". Writers, journalists, artists, judges, and workers from across the spectrum spoke of her \"magnetic power\", her \"convincing presence\", her \"force, eloquence, and fire\".\nIn the spring of 1908, Goldman met and fell in love with Ben Reitman, the so-called \"Hobo doctor\". Having grown up in Chicago's Tenderloin District, Reitman spent several years as a drifter before earning a medical degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago. As a doctor, he treated people suffering from poverty and illness, particularly venereal diseases. He and Goldman began an affair. They shared a commitment to free love and Reitman took a variety of lovers, but Goldman did not. She tried to reconcile her feelings of jealousy with a belief in freedom of the heart but found it difficult.\nTwo years later, Goldman began feeling frustrated with lecture audiences. She yearned to \"reach the few who really want to learn, rather than the many who come to be amused\". She collected a series of speeches and items she had written for \"Mother Earth\" and published a book titled \"Anarchism and Other Essays.\" Covering a wide variety of topics, Goldman tried to represent \"the mental and soul struggles of twenty-one years\".\nWhen Margaret Sanger, an advocate of access to contraception, coined the term \"birth control\" and disseminated information about various methods in the June 1914 issue of her magazine \"The Woman Rebel,\" she received aggressive support from Goldman. The latter had already been active in efforts to increase birth control access for several years. In 1916, Goldman was arrested for giving lessons in public on how to use contraceptives. Sanger, too, was arrested under the Comstock Law, which prohibited the dissemination of \"obscene, lewd, or lascivious articles\", which authorities defined as including information relating to birth control.\nAlthough they later split from Sanger over charges of insufficient support, Goldman and Reitman distributed copies of Sanger's pamphlet \"Family Limitation\" (along with a similar essay of Reitman's). In 1915 Goldman conducted a nationwide speaking tour, in part to raise awareness about contraception options. Although the nation's attitude toward the topic seemed to be liberalizing, Goldman was arrested on February 11, 1916, as she was about to give another public lecture. Goldman was charged with violating the Comstock Law. Refusing to pay a $100 fine, she spent two weeks in a prison workhouse, which she saw as an \"opportunity\" to reconnect with those rejected by society.\nWorld War I.\nAlthough President Woodrow Wilson was re-elected in 1916 under the slogan \"He kept us out of the war\", at the start of his second term, he announced that Germany's continued deployment of unrestricted submarine warfare was sufficient cause for the U.S. to enter the Great War. Shortly afterward, Congress passed the Selective Service Act of 1917, which required all males aged 21\u201330 to register for military conscription. Goldman saw the decision as an exercise in militarist aggression, driven by capitalism. She declared in \"Mother Earth\" her intent to resist conscription, and to oppose U.S. involvement in the war.\nTo this end, she and Berkman organized the No Conscription League of New York, which proclaimed: \"We oppose conscription because we are internationalists, antimilitarists, and opposed to all wars waged by capitalistic governments.\" The group became a vanguard for anti-draft activism, and chapters began to appear in other cities. When police began raiding the group's public events to find young men who had not registered for the draft, Goldman and others focused their efforts on distributing pamphlets and other writings. In the midst of the nation's patriotic fervor, many elements of the political left refused to support the League's efforts. The Women's Peace Party, for example, ceased their peace efforts and turned to war relief once the U.S. entered the war. The Socialist Party of America took an official stance against U.S. involvement but supported Wilson in most of his activities.\nOn June 15, 1917, Goldman and Berkman were arrested during a raid of their offices, in which authorities seized \"a wagon load of anarchist records and propaganda\". \"The New York Times\" reported that Goldman asked to change into a more appropriate outfit, and emerged in a gown of \"royal purple\". The pair were charged with conspiracy to \"induce persons not to register\" under the newly enacted Espionage Act, and were held on $25,000 bail each. Defending herself and Berkman during their trial, Goldman invoked the First Amendment, asking how the government could claim to fight for democracy abroad while suppressing free speech at home:\nWe say that if America has entered the war to make the world safe for democracy, she must first make democracy safe in America. How else is the world to take America seriously, when democracy at home is daily being outraged, free speech suppressed, peaceable assemblies broken up by overbearing and brutal gangsters in uniform; when free press is curtailed and every independent opinion gagged? Verily, poor as we are in democracy, how can we give of it to the world? \nThe jury found Goldman and Berkman guilty. Judge Julius Marshuetz Mayer imposed the maximum sentence: two years' imprisonment, a $10,000 fine each, and the possibility of deportation after their release from prison. As she was transported to Missouri State Penitentiary, Goldman wrote to a friend: \"Two years imprisonment for having made an uncompromising stand for one's ideal. Why that is a small price.\"\nIn prison, she was assigned to work as a seamstress, under the eye of a \"miserable gutter-snipe of a 21-year-old boy paid to get results\". She met the socialist Kate Richards O'Hare, who had also been imprisoned under the Espionage Act. Although they differed on political strategy\u2014O'Hare believed in voting to achieve state power\u2014the two women came together to agitate for better conditions among prisoners. Goldman also met and became friends with Gabriella Segata Antolini, an anarchist and follower of Luigi Galleani. Antolini had been arrested transporting a satchel filled with dynamite on a Chicago-bound train. She had refused to cooperate with authorities and was sent to prison for 14 months. Working together to make life better for the other inmates, the three women became known as \"The Trinity\". Goldman was released on September 27, 1919.\nDeportation.\nGoldman and Berkman were released from prison during the United States' Red Scare of 1919\u201320, when public anxiety about wartime pro-German activities had expanded into a pervasive fear of Bolshevism and the prospect of an imminent radical revolution. It was a time of social unrest due to union organizing strikes and actions by activist immigrants. Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer and J. Edgar Hoover, head of the U.S. Department of Justice's General Intelligence Division (now the FBI), were intent on using the Anarchist Exclusion Act and its 1918 expansion to deport any non-citizens they could identify as advocates of anarchy or revolution. \"Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman,\" Hoover wrote while they were in prison, \"are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and return to the community will result in undue harm.\"\nAt her deportation hearing on October 27, 1919, Goldman refused to answer questions about her beliefs, on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the U.S.. She presented a written statement instead: \"Today so-called aliens are deported. Tomorrow native Americans will be banished. Already some patrioteers are suggesting that native American sons to whom democracy is a sacred ideal should be exiled.\" Louis Post at the Department of Labor, which had ultimate authority over deportation decisions, determined that the revocation of her husband Kershner's American citizenship in 1908 after his conviction had revoked hers as well. After initially promising a court fight, Goldman decided not to appeal his ruling.\nThe Labor Department included Goldman and Berkman among 249 aliens it deported \"en masse,\" mostly people with only vague associations with radical groups, who had been swept up in government raids in November. \"Buford\", a ship the press nicknamed the \"Soviet Ark\", sailed from the Army's New York Port of Embarkation on December 21. Some 58 enlisted men and four officers provided security on the journey, and pistols were distributed to the crew. Most of the press approved enthusiastically. The Cleveland \"Plain Dealer\" wrote: \"It is hoped and expected that other vessels, larger, more commodious, carrying similar cargoes, will follow in her wake.\" The ship landed her charges in Hanko, Finland, on Saturday, January 17, 1920. Upon arrival in Finland, authorities there conducted the deportees to the Russian frontier under a flag of truce.\nRussia.\nGoldman initially viewed the Bolshevik revolution in a positive light. She wrote in \"Mother Earth\" that despite its dependence on Communist government, it represented \"the most fundamental, far-reaching and all-embracing principles of human freedom and of economic well-being\". By the time she neared Europe, she expressed fears about what was to come. She was worried about the ongoing Russian Civil War and the possibility of being seized by anti-Bolshevik forces. The state, anti-capitalist though it was, also posed a threat. \"I could never in my life work within the confines of the State,\" she wrote to her niece, \"Bolshevist or otherwise.\"\nShe quickly discovered that her fears were justified. Days after returning to Petrograd (Saint Petersburg), she was shocked to hear a party official refer to free speech as a \"bourgeois superstition\". As she and Berkman traveled around the country, they found repression, mismanagement, and corruption instead of the equality and worker empowerment they had dreamed of. Those who questioned the government were demonized as counter-revolutionaries, and workers labored under severe conditions. They met with Vladimir Lenin, who assured them that government suppression of press liberties was justified. He told them: \"There can be no free speech in a revolutionary period.\" Berkman was more willing to forgive the government's actions in the name of \"historical necessity\", but he eventually joined Goldman in opposing the Soviet state's authority.\nIn March 1921, strikes erupted in Petrograd when workers took to the streets demanding better food rations and more union autonomy. Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: \"To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal.\" The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them. \"More and more\", she wrote, \"we have come to the conclusion that we can do nothing here. And as we can not keep up a life of inactivity much longer we have decided to leave.\"\nIn December 1921, they left the country and went to the Latvian capital city of Riga. The U.S. commissioner in that city wired officials in Washington, D.C., who began requesting information from other governments about the couple's activities. After a short trip to Stockholm, they moved to Berlin for several years; during this time Goldman agreed to write a series of articles about her time in Russia for Joseph Pulitzer's newspaper, the \"New York World.\" These were later collected and published in book form as \"My Disillusionment in Russia\" (1923) and \"My Further Disillusionment in Russia\" (1924). The publishers added these titles to attract attention; Goldman protested, albeit in vain.\nEngland, Canada, and France.\nGoldman found it difficult to acclimate to the German leftist community in Berlin. Communists despised her outspokenness about Soviet repression; liberals derided her radicalism. While Berkman remained in Berlin helping Russian exiles, Goldman moved to London in September 1924. Upon her arrival, the novelist Rebecca West arranged a reception dinner for her, attended by philosopher Bertrand Russell, novelist H. G. Wells, and more than 200 other guests. When she spoke of her dissatisfaction with the Soviet government, the audience was shocked. Some left the gathering; others berated her for prematurely criticizing the Communist experiment. Later, in a letter, Russell declined to support her efforts at systemic change in the Soviet Union and ridiculed her anarchist idealism.\nIn 1925, the spectre of deportation loomed again, but James Colton, a Scottish anarchist Goldman had first met in Glasgow whilst on a speaking tour in 1895, had offered to marry her and provide British citizenship. Although they were only distant acquaintances, she accepted and they were married on June 27, 1925, Goldman's 58th birthday. Her new status gave her peace of mind and allowed her to travel to France and Canada. The pair sporadically exchanged correspondence until Colton's death in 1936. Life in London was stressful for Goldman; she wrote to Berkman: \"I am awfully tired and so lonely and heartsick. It is a dreadful feeling to come back here from lectures and find not a kindred soul, no one who cares whether one is dead or alive.\" She worked on analytical studies of drama, expanding on the work she had published in 1914. But the audiences were \"awful,\" and she never finished her second book on the subject.\nGoldman traveled to Canada in 1927, just in time to receive news of the impending executions of Italian anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti in Boston. Angered by the many irregularities of the case, she saw it as another travesty of justice in the United States. She longed to join the mass demonstrations in Boston; memories of the Haymarket affair overwhelmed her, compounded by her isolation. \"Then,\" she wrote, \"I had my life before me to take up the cause for those killed. Now I have nothing.\"\nIn 1928, she began writing her autobiography, with the support of a group of American admirers, including journalist H. L. Mencken, poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, novelist Theodore Dreiser and art collector Peggy Guggenheim, who raised $4,000 for her. She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of Saint-Tropez and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at the price of a strain on their relationship. Goldman intended the book, \"Living My Life,\" as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher Alfred A. Knopf released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, but unable to force a change. Due in large part to the Great Depression, sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the United States. Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; \"The New York Times\", \"The New Yorker\", and \"Saturday Review of Literature\" all listed it as one of the year's top non-fiction books.\nIn 1933, Goldman received permission to lecture in the United States under the condition that she speak only about drama and her autobiography\u2014but not current political events. She returned to New York on February 2, 1934, to generally positive press coverage\u2014except from Communist publications. Soon she was surrounded by admirers and friends, besieged with invitations to talks and interviews. Her visa expired in May, and she went to Toronto in order to file another request to visit the United States. This second attempt was denied. She stayed in Canada, writing articles for U.S. publications.\nIn February and March 1936, Berkman underwent a pair of prostate gland operations. Recuperating in Nice and cared for by his companion, Emmy Eckstein, he missed Goldman's sixty-seventh birthday in Saint-Tropez in June. She wrote in sadness, but he never read the letter; she received a call in the middle of the night that Berkman was in great distress. She left for Nice immediately, but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.\nSpanish Civil War.\nIn July 1936, the Spanish Civil War started after an attempted \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" by parts of the Spanish Army against the government of the Second Spanish Republic. At the same time, the Spanish anarchists, fighting against the Nationalist forces, started an anarchist revolution. Goldman was invited to Barcelona and in an instant, as she wrote to her niece, \"the crushing weight that was pressing down on my heart since Sasha's death left me as by magic\". She was welcomed by the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica (FAI) organizations, and for the first time in her life lived in a community run by and for anarchists, according to true anarchist principles. \"In all my life\", she wrote later, \"I have not met with such warm hospitality, comradeship and solidarity.\" After touring a series of collectives in the province of Huesca, she told a group of workers: \"Your revolution will destroy forever [the notion] that anarchism stands for chaos.\" She began editing the weekly \"CNT-FAI Information Bulletin\" and responded to English-language mail.\nGoldman began to worry about the future of Spain's anarchism when the CNT-FAI joined a coalition government in 1937\u2014against the core anarchist principle of abstaining from state structures\u2014and, more distressingly, made repeated concessions to Communist forces in the name of uniting against fascism. In November 1936, she wrote that cooperating with Communists in Spain was \"a denial of our comrades in Stalin's concentration camps\". The USSR, meanwhile, refused to send weapons to anarchist forces, and disinformation campaigns were being waged against the anarchists across Europe and the United States. Her faith in the movement unshaken, Goldman returned to London as an official representative of the CNT-FAI.\nDelivering lectures and giving interviews, Goldman enthusiastically supported the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists. She wrote regularly for \"Spain and the World\", a biweekly newspaper focusing on the civil war. In May 1937, Communist-led forces attacked anarchist strongholds and broke up agrarian collectives. Newspapers in England and elsewhere accepted the timeline of events offered by the Second Spanish Republic at face value. British journalist George Orwell, present for the crackdown, wrote: \"[T]he accounts of the Barcelona riots in May\u00a0...\u00a0beat everything I have ever seen for lying.\"\nGoldman returned to Spain in September, but the CNT-FAI appeared to her like people \"in a burning house\". Worse, anarchists and other radicals around the world refused to support their cause. The Nationalist forces declared victory in Spain just before she returned to London. Frustrated by England's repressive atmosphere\u2014which she called \"more fascist than the fascists\"\u2014she returned to Canada in 1939. Her service to the anarchist cause in Spain was not forgotten. On her seventieth birthday, the former Secretary-General of the CNT, Mariano R. V\u00e1zquez, sent a message to her from Paris, praising her for her contributions and naming her as \"our spiritual mother\". She called it \"the most beautiful tribute I have ever received\".\nFinal years.\nAs the events preceding World War II began to unfold in Europe, Goldman reiterated her opposition to wars waged by governments. \"[M]uch as I loathe Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and Franco\", she wrote to a friend, \"I would not support a war against them and for the democracies which, in the last analysis, are only Fascist in disguise.\" She felt that Britain and France had missed their opportunity to oppose fascism, and that the coming war would only result in \"a new form of madness in the world\".\nDeath.\nOn Saturday, February 17, 1940, Goldman suffered a debilitating stroke. She became paralyzed on her right side, and although her hearing was unaffected, she could not speak. As one friend described it: \"Just to think that here was Emma, the greatest orator in America, unable to utter one word.\" For three months she improved slightly, receiving visitors and on one occasion gesturing to her address book to signal that a friend might find friendly contacts during a trip to Mexico. She suffered another stroke on May 8 and she died six days later in Toronto, aged 70.\nThe U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service allowed her body to be brought back to the United States. She was buried in German Waldheim Cemetery (now named Forest Home Cemetery) in Forest Park, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago, near the graves of those executed after the Haymarket affair. The bas relief on her grave marker was created by sculptor Jo Davidson, and the stone includes the quote \"Liberty will not descend to a people, a people must raise themselves to liberty\".\nPhilosophy.\nGoldman spoke and wrote extensively on a wide variety of issues. While she rejected orthodoxy and fundamentalist thinking, she was an important contributor to several fields of modern political philosophy. She was influenced by many diverse thinkers and writers, including Mikhail Bakunin, Henry David Thoreau, Peter Kropotkin, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nikolai Chernyshevsky, and Mary Wollstonecraft. Another philosopher who influenced Goldman was Friedrich Nietzsche. In her autobiography, she wrote: \"Nietzsche was not a social theorist, but a poet, a rebel, and innovator. His aristocracy was neither of birth nor of purse; it was the spirit. In that respect Nietzsche was an anarchist, and all true anarchists were aristocrats.\"\nAnarchism.\nAnarchism was central to Goldman's view of the world, and she is widely considered one of the most important figures in the history of anarchism and libertarian socialism. First drawn to it during the persecution of anarchists after the 1886 Haymarket affair, she wrote and spoke regularly on behalf of anarchism. In the title essay of her book \"Anarchism and Other Essays\", she wrote:\nAnarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.\nGoldman's anarchism was intensely personal. She believed it was necessary for anarchist thinkers to live their beliefs, demonstrating their convictions with every action and word. \"I don't care if a man's theory for tomorrow is correct,\" she once wrote. \"I care if his spirit of today is correct.\" Anarchism and free association were to her logical responses to the confines of government control and capitalism. \"It seems to me that \"these\" are the new forms of life,\" she wrote, \"and that they will take the place of the old, not by preaching or voting, but by living them.\" At the same time, she believed that the movement on behalf of human liberty must be staffed by liberated humans. While dancing among fellow anarchists one evening, she was chided by an associate for her carefree demeanor. In her autobiography, Goldman wrote:\nI told him to mind his own business, I was tired of having the Cause constantly thrown in my face. I did not believe that a Cause which stood for a beautiful ideal, for anarchism, for release and freedom from conventions and prejudice, should demand denial of life and joy. I insisted that our Cause could not expect me to behave as a nun and that the movement should not be turned into a cloister. If it meant that, I did not want it. \"I want freedom, the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things.\"\nTactical uses of violence.\nIn her political youth, Goldman held targeted violence to be a legitimate means of revolutionary struggle. At that time, she believed that the use of violence, while distasteful, could be justified in relation to the social benefits it might accrue. She advocated propaganda of the deed\u2014\"attentat\", or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt. She supported her partner Alexander Berkman's attempt to kill industrialist Henry Clay Frick, and even begged him to allow her to participate. She believed that Frick's actions during the Homestead strike were reprehensible and that his murder would produce a positive result for working people. She later wrote in her autobiography, \"Yes, the end in this case justified the means.\" While she never gave explicit approval of Leon Czolgosz's assassination of U.S. President William McKinley, she defended his ideals and believed actions like his were a natural consequence of repressive institutions. As she wrote in \"The Psychology of Political Violence\" that \"the accumulated forces in our social and economic life, culminating in an act of violence, are similar to the terrors of the atmosphere, manifested in storm and lightning.\"\nHer experiences in Russia led her to qualify her earlier belief that revolutionary ends might justify violent means. In the afterword to \"My Disillusionment in Russia\", she wrote: \"There is no greater fallacy than the belief that aims and purposes are one thing, while methods and tactics are another. ... The means employed become, through individual habit and social practice, part and parcel of the final purpose ... .\" In the same chapter, Goldman affirmed that \"Revolution is indeed a violent process,\" and noted that violence was the \"tragic inevitability of revolutionary upheavals\". Some misinterpreted her comments on the Bolshevik terror as a rejection of all militant force, but Goldman corrected this in the preface to the first U.S. edition of \"My Disillusionment in Russia\":\nThe argument that destruction and terror are part of revolution I do not dispute. I know that in the past every great political and social change necessitated violence. ... Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet it is one thing to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.\nGoldman saw the militarization of Soviet society not as a result of armed resistance per se, but of the statist vision of the Bolsheviks, writing that \"an insignificant minority bent on creating an absolute State is necessarily driven to oppression and terrorism.\"\nCapitalism and labor.\nGoldman believed that the economic system of capitalism was incompatible with human liberty. \"The only demand that property recognizes,\" she wrote in \"Anarchism and Other Essays\", \"is its own gluttonous appetite for greater wealth, because wealth means power; the power to subdue, to crush, to exploit, the power to enslave, to outrage, to degrade.\" She also argued that capitalism dehumanized workers, \"turning the producer into a mere particle of a machine, with less will and decision than his master of steel and iron.\" Originally opposed to anything less than complete revolution, Goldman was challenged during one talk by an elderly worker in the front row. In her autobiography, she wrote:\nHe said that he understood my impatience with such small demands as a few hours less a day, or a few dollars more a week... But what were men of his age to do? They were not likely to live to see the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. Were they also to forgo the release of perhaps two hours a day from the hated work? That was all they could hope to see realized in their lifetime.\nState.\nGoldman viewed the state as essentially and inevitably a tool of control and domination. As a result of her anti-state views, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst. Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making. Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance in the form of strikes, protests, and \"direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of our moral code\". She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic. Goldman wrote that any power anarchists wielded as a voting bloc should instead be used to strike across the country.\nGoldman disagreed with the movement for women's suffrage, which demanded the right of women to vote. In her essay \"Woman Suffrage\", she ridicules the idea that women's involvement would infuse the democratic state with a more just orientation: \"As if women have not sold their votes, as if women politicians cannot be bought!\" She agreed with the suffragists' assertion that women are equal to men but disagreed that their participation alone would make the state more just. \"To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in purifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to credit her with supernatural powers.\" Goldman was also critical of Zionism, which she saw as another failed experiment in state control.\nGoldman was a passionate critic of the prison system, critiquing both the treatment of prisoners and the social causes of crime. Goldman viewed crime as a natural outgrowth of an unjust economic system, and in her essay \"Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure\", she quoted liberally from the 19th-century authors Fyodor Dostoevsky and Oscar Wilde on prisons, and wrote:\nYear after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated, deformed, will-less, shipwrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted. With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence.\nGoldman was a committed war resister and was particularly opposed to the draft, viewing it as one of the worst of the state's forms of coercion, and was one of the founders of the No-Conscription League for which she was ultimately arrested and imprisoned in 1917 before being deported in 1919.\nGoldman was routinely surveilled, arrested, and imprisoned for her speech and organizing activities in support of workers and various strikes, access to birth control, and in opposition to World War I. As a result, she became active in the early 20th century free speech movement, seeing freedom of expression as a fundamental necessity for achieving social change. Her outspoken championship of her ideals, in the face of persistent arrests, inspired Roger Baldwin, one of the founders of the American Civil Liberties Union. Goldman's and Reitman's experiences with vigilantism in the San Diego free speech fight in 1912 is an example of their persistence in the fight for free speech despite risking their safety.\nFeminism and sexuality.\nAlthough she was hostile to the suffragist goals of first-wave feminism, Goldman advocated passionately for the rights of women, and is today heralded as a founder of anarcha-feminism, which challenges patriarchy as a hierarchy to be resisted alongside state power and class divisions. In 1897, she wrote: \"I demand the independence of woman, her right to support herself; to live for herself; to love whomever she pleases, or as many as she pleases. I demand freedom for both sexes, freedom of action, freedom in love and freedom in motherhood.\"\nA nurse by training, Goldman was an early advocate for educating women concerning contraception. Like many feminists of her time, she saw abortion as a tragic consequence of social conditions, and birth control as a positive alternative. Goldman was also an advocate of free love, and a strong critic of marriage. She saw early feminists as confined in their scope and bounded by social forces of Puritanism and capitalism. She wrote: \"We are in need of unhampered growth out of old traditions and habits. The movement for women's emancipation has so far made but the first step in that direction.\"\nGoldman was an outspoken critic of prejudice against homosexual and genderqueer people. Her belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists. As German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld wrote, \"she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.\" In numerous speeches and letters, she defended the right of gay men and lesbians to love as they pleased and condemned the fear and stigma associated with homosexuality. As Goldman wrote in a letter to Hirschfeld, \"It is a tragedy, I feel, that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life.\"\nAtheism.\nA committed atheist, Goldman viewed religion as another instrument of control and domination. Her essay \"The Philosophy of Atheism\" quoted Bakunin at length on the subject and added:\nConsciously or unconsciously, most theists see in gods and devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment... The philosophy of Atheism expresses the expansion and growth of the human mind. The philosophy of theism, if we can call it a philosophy, is static and fixed.\nIn essays like \"The Hypocrisy of Puritanism\" and a speech entitled \"The Failure of Christianity\", Goldman made more than a few enemies among religious communities by attacking their moralistic attitudes and efforts to control human behavior. She blamed Christianity for \"the perpetuation of a slave society\", arguing that it dictated individuals' actions on Earth and offered poor people a false promise of a plentiful future in heaven.\nLegacy.\nGoldman was well known during her life, described as\u2014among other things\u2014\"the most dangerous woman in America\". After her death and through the middle part of the 20th century, her fame faded. Scholars and historians of anarchism viewed her as a great speaker and activist but did not regard her as a philosophical or theoretical thinker on par with, for example, Kropotkin.\nIn 1970, Dover Press reissued Goldman's autobiography, \"Living My Life\", and in 1972, feminist writer Alix Kates Shulman issued a collection of Goldman's writing and speeches, \"Red Emma Speaks\". These works brought Goldman's life and writings to a larger audience, and she was in particular lionized by the women's movement of the late 20th century. In 1973, Shulman was asked by a printer friend for a quotation by Goldman for use on a T-shirt. She sent him the selection from \"Living My Life\" about \"the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things\", recounting that she had been admonished \"that it did not behoove an agitator to dance\". The printer created a statement based on these sentiments that has become one of the most famous quotations attributed to Goldman even though she probably never said or wrote it as such: \"If I can't dance I don't want to be in your revolution.\" Variations of this saying have appeared on thousands of T-shirts, buttons, posters, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, hats, and other items.\nThe women's movement of the 1970s that \"rediscovered\" Goldman was accompanied by a resurgent anarchist movement, beginning in the late 1960s, which also reinvigorated scholarly attention to earlier anarchists. The growth of feminism also initiated some reevaluation of Goldman's philosophical work, with scholars pointing out the significance of Goldman's contributions to anarchist thought in her time. Goldman's belief in the value of aesthetics, for example, can be seen in the later influences of anarchism and the arts. Similarly, Goldman is now given credit for significantly influencing and broadening the scope of activism on issues of sexual liberty, reproductive rights, and freedom of expression.\nGoldman has been honored by a number of organizations named in her memory. The Emma Goldman Clinic, a women's health center located in Iowa City, Iowa, selected Goldman as a namesake \"in recognition of her challenging spirit.\" Red Emma's Bookstore Coffeehouse, an infoshop in Baltimore, Maryland adopted her name out of their belief \"in the ideas and ideals that she fought for her entire life: free speech, sexual and racial equality and independence, the right to organize in our jobs and in our own lives, ideas and ideals that we continue to fight for, even today\".\nIn popular culture.\nGoldman has been depicted in numerous works of fiction.\nThe character of Goldman appeared in Warren Beatty's 1981 film \"Reds\", in which she was portrayed by Maureen Stapleton, who won an Academy Award for her performance.\nGoldman is a character in the Broadway musicals \"Tintypes\", \"Ragtime\", and \"Assassins\". Plays depicting Goldman's life include: Howard Zinn's play, \"Emma\"; Martin Duberman's \"Mother Earth\"; Jessica Litwak's \"Love, Anarchy, and Other Affairs\" (about Goldman's arrest in connection with McKinley's assassination); Lynn Rogoff's \"Love Ben, Love Emma\" (about Goldman's relationship with Reitman); Carol Bolt's \"Red Emma\"; and Alexis Roblan's \"Red Emma and the Mad Monk\".\nEthel Mannin's 1941 novel \"Red Rose\" is based on Goldman's life. Lisa Norton portrays Goldman in three episodes of the period detective series \"Murdoch Mysteries\".\nWorks.\nGoldman was a prolific writer, penning countless pamphlets and articles on a diverse range of subjects. She authored six books, including an autobiography, \"Living My Life\", and a biography of fellow anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nDigital collections\nPhysical collections"}

Its name is Latin for \"little horse\", a foal. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is the second smallest of the modern constellations (after Crux), spanning only 72 square degrees. It is also very faint, having no stars brighter than the fourth magnitude.\nNotable features.\nStars.\nThe brightest star in Equuleus is \u03b1 Equulei, traditionally called Kitalpha, a yellow star magnitude 3.9, 186 light-years from Earth. Its traditional name means \"the section of the horse\".\nThere are few variable stars in Equuleus. Only around 25 are known, most of which are faint. \u03b3 Equulei is an \u03b12 CVn variable star, ranging between magnitudes 4.58 and 4.77 over a period of around 12\u00bd minutes. It is a white star 115 light-years from Earth, and has an optical companion of magnitude 6.1, 6 Equulei. It is divisible in binoculars. 6 Equulei is an astrometric binary system itself, with an apparent magnitude of 6.07. R Equulei is a Mira variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 15.7 over nearly 261 days. It has a spectral type of M3e-M4e and has an average B-V colour index of +1.41.\nEquuleus contains some double stars of interest. \u03b3 Equulei consists of a primary star with a magnitude around 4.7 (slightly variable) and a secondary star of magnitude 11.6, separated by 2 arcseconds. \u03b5 Equulei is a triple star also designated 1 Equulei. The system, 197 light-years away, has a primary of magnitude 5.4 that is itself a binary star; its components are of magnitude 6.0 and 6.3 and have a period of 101 years. The secondary is of magnitude 7.4 and is visible in small telescopes. The components of the primary are becoming closer together and will not be divisible in amateur telescopes beginning in 2015. \u03b4 Equulei is a binary star with an orbital period of 5.7 years, which at one time was the shortest known orbital period for an optical binary. The two components of the system are never more than 0.35 arcseconds apart.\nDeep-sky objects.\nDue to its small size and its distance from the plane of the Milky Way, Equuleus is rather devoid of deep sky objects such as star clusters and nebulae. Some very faint galaxies in the New General Catalogue between magnitudes 13 and 15 include NGC 7015, NGC 7040, and NGC 7046. NGC 7045 is a triple star that was mistaken as a nebula by its discoverer, John Herschel. Other faint galaxies in the Index Catalogue include IC 1360, IC 1361, IC 1364, IC 1367, IC 1375, and IC 5083. IC 1365 is a group of galaxies. The magnitudes of these objects vary from 14.5 to 15.5, making them hard to see in even the largest of amateur telescopes.\nMythology.\nIn Greek mythology, one myth associates Equuleus with the foal Celeris (meaning \"swiftness\" or \"speed\"), who was the offspring or brother of the winged horse Pegasus. Celeris was given to Castor by Mercury. Other myths say that Equuleus is the horse struck from Poseidon's trident, during the contest between him and Athena when deciding which would be the superior. Because this section of stars rises before Pegasus, it is often called Equus Primus, or the First Horse. Equuleus is also linked to the story of Philyra and Saturn.\nCreated by Hipparchus and included by Ptolemy, it abuts Pegasus; unlike the larger horse, it is depicted as a horse's head alone.\nEquivalents.\nIn Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Equuleus are located within the Black Tortoise of the North (\u5317\u65b9\u7384\u6b66, \"B\u011bi F\u0101ng Xu\u00e1n W\u01d4\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9767", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9767", "title": "Eucharist", "text": "Christian rite and sacrament\nThe Eucharist ( ; from , lit.\u2009'thanksgiving'), also called Holy Communion, the Blessed Sacrament or the Lord's Supper, is a Christian rite, considered a sacrament in most churches and an ordinance in others. Christians believe that the rite was instituted by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper, the night before his crucifixion, giving his disciples bread and wine. Passages in the New Testament state that he commanded them to \"do this in memory of me\" while referring to the bread as \"my body\" and the cup of wine as \"the blood of my covenant, which is poured out for many\". According to the synoptic Gospels, this was at a Passover meal.\nThe elements of the Eucharist, sacramental bread\u2014either leavened or unleavened\u2014and sacramental wine (among Catholics, Anglicans, Lutherans, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox) or non-alcoholic grape juice (among Methodists, Baptists and Plymouth Brethren), are consecrated on an altar or a communion table and consumed thereafter. The consecrated elements are the end product of the Eucharistic Prayer. \nChristians generally recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite, though they differ about exactly how, where, and when Christ is present. The Catholic Church states that the Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ under the species of bread and wine. It maintains that by the consecration, the substances of the bread and wine actually become the substances of the body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation) while the form and appearances of the bread and wine remain unaltered (e.g. colour, taste, feel, and smell). The Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches agree that an objective change occurs of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. Lutherans believe the true body and blood of Christ are really present \"in, with, and under\" the forms of the bread and wine, known as the sacramental union. Reformed Christians believe in a real spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Anglican eucharistic theologies universally affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, though Evangelical Anglicans believe that this is a spiritual presence, while Anglo-Catholics hold to a corporeal presence. Others, such as the Plymouth Brethren and the Jehovah's Witnesses, hold the Lord's Supper to be a memorial in which believers are \"one with Him\". As a result of these different understandings, \"the Eucharist has been a central issue in the discussions and deliberations of the ecumenical movement.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology.\nEucharist.\nThe New Testament was originally written in the Greek language and the Greek noun (), meaning \"thanksgiving\", appears a few times in it, while the related Greek verb is found several times in New Testament accounts of the Last Supper, including the earliest such account:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks (), he broke it, and said, \"This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me\".\u2014\u200a\nThe term (thanksgiving) is that by which the rite is referred to in the \"Didache\" (a late 1st or early 2nd century document), by Ignatius of Antioch (who died between 98 and 117) and by Justin Martyr (\"First Apology\" written between 155 and 157). Today, \"the Eucharist\" is the name still used by Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Catholics, Anglicans, Presbyterians, and Lutherans. Other Protestant denominations rarely use this term, preferring \"Communion\", \"the Lord's Supper\", \"Remembrance\", or \"the Breaking of Bread\". Latter-day Saints call it \"the Sacrament\".\nLord's Supper.\nIn the First Epistle to the Corinthians Paul uses the term \"Lord's Supper\", in Greek (), in the early 50s of the 1st century:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat, for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.\u2014\u200a\nThe term \"Lord's Supper\" came into popular use after the Protestant Reformation and remains the predominant term among certain Evangelicals, such as Baptists and Pentecostals. \nCommunion.\nUse of the term \"Communion\" (or \"Holy Communion\") to refer to the Eucharistic rite began by some groups originating in the Protestant Reformation. Others, such as the Catholic Church, do not formally use this term for the rite, but instead mean by it the act of partaking of the consecrated elements; they speak of receiving Holy Communion at Mass or outside of it, they also use the term First Communion when one receives the Eucharist for the first time. The term \"Communion\" is derived from Latin (\"sharing in common\"), translated from the Greek () in 1 Corinthians 10:16:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the \"communion\" of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the \"communion\" of the body of Christ?\u2014\u200a\nOther terms.\nBreaking of bread.\nThe phrase (, 'breaking of the bread'; in later liturgical Greek also ) appears in various related forms five times in the New Testament in contexts which, according to some, may refer to the celebration of the Eucharist, in either closer or symbolically more distant reference to the Last Supper. This term is used by the Plymouth Brethren.\nSacrament or Blessed Sacrament.\nThe \"Blessed Sacrament\", the \"Sacrament of the Altar\", and other variations, are common terms used by Catholics, Lutherans and some Anglicans (Anglo-Catholics) for the consecrated elements, particularly when reserved in a tabernacle. In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints the term \"The Sacrament\" is used of the rite.\nMass.\nThe term \"Mass\" is used in the Catholic Church, the Lutheran churches (especially the Churches of Sweden, Norway and Finland), and by some Anglicans. It derives from the Latin word , a dismissal: or \"go, it is sent\", the very last phrase of the service. That Latin word has come to imply \"mission\" as well because the congregation is sent out to serve Christ.\nAt least in the Catholic Church, the Mass is a long rite in two parts: the Liturgy of the Word and the Liturgy of the Eucharist. The former consists of readings from the Bible and a homily, or sermon, given by a priest or deacon. The latter, which follows seamlessly, includes the \"Offering\" of the bread and wine at the altar, their consecration by the priest through prayer, and their reception by the congregation in Holy Communion. Among the many other terms used in the Catholic Church are \"Holy Mass\", \"the Memorial of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of the Lord\", the \"Holy Sacrifice of the Mass\", and the \"Holy Mysteries\".\nDivine Liturgy and Divine Service.\nThe term Divine Liturgy () is used in Byzantine Rite traditions, whether in the Eastern Orthodox Church or among the Eastern Catholic Churches. These also speak of \"the Divine Mysteries\", especially in reference to the consecrated elements, which they also call \"the Holy Gifts\".\nThe term Divine Service () has often been used to refer to Christian worship more generally and is still used in Lutheran churches, in addition to the terms \"Eucharist\", \"Mass\" and \"Holy Communion\". Historically this refers (like the term \"worship\" itself) to service of God, although more recently it has been associated with the idea that God is serving the congregants in the liturgy.\nOther Eastern rites.\nSome Eastern rites have yet more names for the Eucharist. Holy Qurbana is common in Syriac Christianity and \"Badarak\" in the Armenian Rite; in the Alexandrian Rite, the term \"prosphora\" (from the Greek ) is common in Coptic Christianity and \"Keddase\" in Ethiopian and Eritrean Christianity.\nHistory.\nBiblical basis.\nThe Last Supper appears in all three synoptic Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It also is found in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, which suggests how early Christians celebrated what Paul the Apostle called the Lord's Supper. Although the Gospel of John does not reference the Last Supper explicitly, some argue that it contains theological allusions to the early Christian celebration of the Eucharist, especially in the chapter 6 Bread of Life Discourse but also in other passages.\nGospels.\nThe synoptic Gospels, Mark 14:22\u201325, Matthew 26:26\u201329 and Luke 22:13\u201320 depict Jesus as presiding over the Last Supper prior to his crucifixion. The versions in Matthew and Mark are almost identical, but the Gospel of Luke presents a textual difference, in that a few manuscripts omit the second half of verse 19 and all of verse 20 (\"given for you [\u2026] poured out for you\"), which are found in the vast majority of ancient witnesses to the text. If the shorter text is the original one, then Luke's account is independent of both that of Paul and that of Matthew/Mark. If the majority longer text comes from the author of the third gospel, then this version is very similar to that of Paul in 1 Corinthians, being somewhat fuller in its description of the early part of the Supper, particularly in making specific mention of a cup being blessed before the bread was broken.\nIn the one prayer given to posterity by Jesus, the Lord's Prayer, the word epiousion\u2014which is otherwise unknown in Classical Greek literature\u2014was interpreted by some early Christian writers as meaning \"super-substantial\", and hence a possible reference to the Eucharist as the Bread of Life.\nIn the Gospel of John, however, the account of the Last Supper does not mention Jesus taking bread and \"the cup\" and speaking of them as his body and blood; instead, it recounts other events: his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers, in which he went on to speak of the importance of the unity of the disciples with him, with each other, and with God. Some would find in this unity and in the washing of the feet the deeper meaning of the Communion bread in the other three Gospels. In John 6:26\u201365, a long discourse is attributed to Jesus that deals with the subject of the living bread; John 6:51\u201359 also contains echoes of Eucharistic language.\nFirst Epistle to the Corinthians.\n1 Corinthians 11:23\u201325 gives the earliest recorded description of Jesus' Last Supper: \"The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.' In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.\u201d\" The Greek word used in the passage for 'remembrance' is (), which itself has a much richer theological history than the English word \"remember\".\nThe expression \"The Lord's Supper\", derived from Paul's usage in 1 Corinthians 11:17\u201334, may have originally referred to the Agape feast (or love feast), the shared communal meal with which the Eucharist was originally associated. The Agape feast is mentioned in Jude 12 but \"The Lord's Supper\" is now commonly used in reference to a celebration involving no food other than the sacramental bread and wine.\nEarly Christian sources.\nThe \"Didache\" (Greek: , \"teaching\") is an Early Church treatise that includes instructions for baptism and the Eucharist. Most scholars date it to the late 1st century, and distinguish in it two separate Eucharistic traditions, the earlier tradition in chapter 10 and the later one preceding it in chapter 9. The Eucharist is mentioned again in chapter 14.\nIgnatius of Antioch (born c.\u200935 or 50, died between 98 and 117), one of the Apostolic Fathers, mentions the Eucharist as \"the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again. [...] Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is [administered] either by the bishop, or by one to whom he has entrusted it.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Take heed, then, to have but one Eucharist. For there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup to [show forth ] the unity of His blood; one altar; as there is one bishop, along with the presbytery and deacons, my fellow-servants: that so, whatsoever you do, you may do it according to [the will of] God.\u2014\u200a\nJustin Martyr (born c.\u2009100, died c.\u2009165) mentions in this regard:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And this food is called among us [the Eucharist], of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined. For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh by the Word of God, had both flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.\nPaschasius Radbertus (785\u2013865) was a Carolingian theologian, and the abbot of Corbie, whose best-known and influential work is an exposition on the nature of the Eucharist written around 831, entitled . In it, Paschasius agrees with St Ambrose in affirming that the Eucharist contains the true, historical body of Jesus Christ. According to Paschasius, God is truth itself, and therefore, his words and actions must be true. Christ's proclamation at the Last Supper that the bread and wine were his body and blood must be taken literally, since God is truth. He thus believes that the transubstantiation of the bread and wine offered in the Eucharist really occurs. Only if the Eucharist is the actual body and blood of Christ can a Christian know it is salvific.\nJews and the Eucharist.\nThe concept of the Jews both destroying and partaking in some perverted version of the Eucharist has been a vessel to promote anti-Judaism and anti-Jewish ideology and violence. In medieval times, Jews were often depicted stabbing or in some other way physically harming communion wafers. These characterizations drew parallels to the idea that the Jews killed Christ; murdering this transubstantiation or \"host\" was thought of as a repetition of the event. Jewish people's eagerness to destroy hosts were also a variation of blood libel charges, with Jews being accused of murdering bodies of Christ, whether they be communion wafers or Christian children. The blood libel charges and the concept of Eucharist are also related in the belief that blood is efficacious, meaning it has some sort of divine power.\nEucharistic theology.\nMost Christians, even those who deny that there is any real change in the elements used, recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite. However, Christians differ about exactly how, where and how long Christ is present in it. Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Church of the East teach that the reality (the \"substance\") of the elements of bread and wine is wholly changed into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, while the appearances (the \"species\") remain. Transubstantiation (\"change of the substance\") is the term used by Catholics to denote what is changed, not to explain how the change occurs, since the Catholic Church teaches that \"the signs of bread and wine become, \"in a way surpassing understanding\", the Body and Blood of Christ\". The Orthodox use various terms such as transelementation, but no explanation is official as they prefer to leave it a mystery.\nLutherans believe Christ to be \"truly and substantially present\" with the bread and wine that are seen in the Eucharist, in a manner referred to as the sacramental union. They attribute the real presence of Jesus' living body to his word spoken in the Eucharist, and not to the faith of those receiving it. They also believe that \"forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation\" are given through the words of Christ in the Eucharist to those who believe his words (\"given and shed for you\").\nReformed Christians also believe Christ to be present in the Eucharist, but describe this presence as a spiritual presence, not a physical one. Anglicans adhere to a range of views depending on churchmanship although the teaching in the Anglican Thirty-Nine Articles also holds that the body of Christ is received by the faithful only in a heavenly and spiritual manner, a doctrine also taught in the Methodist Articles of Religion.\nChristians adhering to the theology of Memorialism, such as the Anabaptist Churches, do not believe in the concept of the real presence, believing that the Eucharist is only a ceremonial remembrance or memorial of the death of Christ.\nThe \"Baptism, Eucharist and Ministry\" document of the World Council of Churches, attempting to present the common understanding of the Eucharist on the part of the generality of Christians, describes it as \"essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit\", \"Thanksgiving to the Father\", \"Anamnesis or Memorial of Christ\", \"the sacrament of the unique sacrifice of Christ, who ever lives to make intercession for us\", \"the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, the sacrament of his real presence\", \"Invocation of the Spirit\", \"Communion of the Faithful\", and \"Meal of the Kingdom\".\nRitual and liturgy.\nMany Christian denominations classify the Eucharist as a sacrament. Anabaptists usually refer to the Lord's Supper as being an \"ordinance\", viewing it as an expression of faith and of obedience to Christ, though Anabaptists have used the word \"sacrament\" interchangeably with the word \"ordinance\".\nCatholic Church.\nIn the Catholic Church the Eucharist is considered as a sacrament, according to the church the Eucharist is \"the source and summit of the Christian life\". \"The other sacraments, and indeed all ecclesiastical ministries and works of the apostolate, are bound up with the Eucharist and are oriented toward it. For in the blessed Eucharist is contained the whole spiritual good of the Church, namely Christ himself, our Pasch.\" (\"Pasch\" is a word that sometimes means Easter, sometimes Passover.)\nAs a sacrifice.\nIn the Eucharist the same sacrifice that Jesus made only once on the cross is believed to be made present at every Mass. According to Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \"The Eucharist is the very sacrifice of the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus which he instituted to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until his return in glory.\"\n\"When the Church celebrates the Eucharist, she commemorates Christ's Passover, and it is made present the sacrifice Christ offered once for all on the cross remains ever present. [...] The Eucharist is thus a sacrifice because it re-presents (makes present) the same and only sacrifice offered once for all on the cross\"\nThe sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are considered as one single sacrifice: \"The victim is one and the same: the same now offers through the ministry of priests, who then offered himself on the cross; only the manner of offering is different.\" In the holy sacrifice of the Mass, \"it is Christ himself, the eternal high priest of the New Covenant who, acting through the ministry of the priests, offers the Eucharistic sacrifice. And it is the same Christ, really present under the species of bread and wine, who is the offering of the Eucharistic sacrifice.\"\nAs a real presence.\nAccording to the Catholic Church Jesus Christ is present in the Eucharist in a true, real and substantial way, with his body, blood, soul and divinity. By the consecration, the substances of the bread and wine actually become the substances of the body and blood of Christ (transubstantiation) while the appearances or \"species\" of the bread and wine remain unaltered (e.g. colour, taste, feel, and smell). This change is brought about in the eucharistic prayer through the efficacy of the word of Christ and by the action of the Holy Spirit. The Eucharistic presence of Christ begins at the moment of the consecration and endures as long as the Eucharistic species subsist, that is, until the Eucharist is digested, physically destroyed, or decays by some natural process (at which point, theologian Thomas Aquinas argued, the substance of the bread and wine cannot return).\nThe Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 spoke of the bread and wine as \"transubstantiated\" into the body and blood of Christ: \"His body and blood are truly contained in the sacrament of the altar under the forms of bread and wine, the bread and wine having been transubstantiated, by God's power, into his body and blood\". In 1551, the Council of Trent definitively declared: \"Because Christ our Redeemer said that it was truly his body that he was offering under the species of bread, it has always been the conviction of the Church of God, and this holy Council now declares again that by the consecration of the bread and wine there takes place a change of the whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of Christ and of the whole substance of the wine into the substance of his blood. This change the holy Catholic Church has fittingly and properly called transubstantiation.\"\nThe church holds that the body and blood of Jesus can no longer be truly separated. Where one is, the other must be. Therefore, although the priest (or extraordinary minister of Holy Communion) says \"The Body of Christ\" when administering the Host and \"The Blood of Christ\" when presenting the chalice, the communicant who receives either one receives Christ, whole and entire. \"Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and whole and entire in each of their parts, in such a way that the breaking of the bread does not divide Christ.\"\nThe Catholic Church sees as the main basis for this belief the words of Jesus himself at his Last Supper: the synoptic Gospels and Paul's recount that Jesus at the time of taking the bread and the cup said: \"This is my body [\u2026] this is my blood.\" The Catholic understanding of these words, from the Patristic authors onward, has emphasized their roots in the covenantal history of the Old Testament. The interpretation of Christ's words against this Old Testament background coheres with and supports belief in the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist.\nReception and devotions.\nAccording to the Catholic Church doctrine receiving the Eucharist in a state of mortal sin is a sacrilege and only those who are in a state of grace, that is, without any mortal sin, can receive it. Based on 1 Corinthians 11:27\u201329, it affirms the following: \"Anyone who is aware of having committed a mortal sin must not receive Holy Communion, even if he experiences deep contrition, without having first received sacramental absolution, unless he has a grave reason for receiving Communion and there is no possibility of going to confession.\"\nSince the Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ, \"the worship due to the sacrament of the Eucharist, whether during the celebration of the Mass or outside it, is the worship of , that is, the adoration given to God alone.\"\" The Blessed Sacrament can be exposed (displayed) on an altar in a monstrance. Rites involving the exposure of the Blessed Sacrament include Benediction and eucharistic adoration. According to Catholic theology, the host, after the Rite of Consecration, is no longer bread, but is the Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ. Catholics believe that Jesus is the sacrificial Lamb of God prefigured in the Old Testament Passover. The flesh of that Passover sacrificial lamb was to be consumed by the family members. Any left overs were to be burned before daybreak so that none of the Passover Lamb's flesh remained. Only by marking the doorposts and lintel of one's home with the Blood of the Lamb were the members of the household saved from death. The consumption of the Lamb was not to save them but rather to give them energy for the journey of escape (Exodus = escape from slavery in Egypt) as was also true for the unleavened bread () As the Passover was the Old Covenant, so the Eucharist became the New Covenant. (, , , and )\nEastern Orthodoxy.\nWithin Eastern Christianity, the Eucharistic service is called the \"Divine Liturgy\" (Byzantine Rite) or similar names in other rites. It comprises two main divisions: the first is the \"Liturgy of the Catechumens\" which consists of introductory litanies, antiphons and scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the Gospels and, often, a homily; the second is the \"Liturgy of the Faithful\" in which the Eucharist is offered, consecrated, and received as Holy Communion. Within the latter, the actual Eucharistic prayer is called the \"anaphora\", (literally \"offering\" or \"carrying up\", from the Greek ). In the Rite of Constantinople, two different anaphoras are currently used: one is attributed to John Chrysostom, the other to Basil the Great. \n In the Oriental Orthodox Church, a variety of anaphoras are used, but all are similar in structure to those of the Constantinopolitan Rite, in which the Anaphora of Saint John Chrysostom is used most days of the year; Saint Basil's is offered on the Sundays of Great Lent, the eves of Christmas and Theophany, Holy Thursday, Holy Saturday, and upon his feast day (1 January). At the conclusion of the Anaphora, the bread and wine are held to be the body and blood of Christ. Unlike the Latin Church, the Byzantine Rite uses leavened bread, with the leaven symbolizing the presence of the Holy Spirit. The Greek Orthodox Church utilizes leavened bread in their celebration and requires parishioners to recite \"The Kanon of Preparation to Receive Holy Communion\" before receiving communion.\nIn Eastern theology, one idea of consecration as a process has been suggested. This understands the change in the elements to be accomplished at the epiclesis (\"invocation\") by which the Holy Spirit is invoked and the consecration of the bread and wine as the genuine body and blood of Christ is specifically requested, but since the anaphora as a whole is considered a unitary (albeit lengthy) prayer, no one moment within it can readily be singled out.\nProtestantism.\nAnabaptists.\nAnabaptist denominations, such as the Mennonites and German Baptist Brethren Churches like the Church of the Brethren churches and congregations have the Agape feast, footwashing, as well as the serving of the bread and wine in the celebration of the Lovefeast. In the more modern groups, Communion is only the serving of the Lord's Supper. In the communion meal, the members of the Mennonite churches renew their covenant with God and with each other.\nMoravian/Hussite.\nThe Moravian Church adheres to a view known as the \"sacramental presence\", teaching that in the sacrament of Holy Communion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Christ gives his body and blood according to his promise to all who partake of the elements. When we eat and drink the bread and the wine of the Supper with expectant faith, we thereby have communion with the body and blood of our Lord and receive the forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation. In this sense, the bread and wine are rightly said to be Christ's body and blood which he gives to his disciples. \nNicolaus Zinzendorf, a bishop of the Moravian Church, stated that Holy Communion is the \"most intimate of all connection with the person of the Saviour.\"\nThe Order of Service for the observance of the Lord's Supper includes a salutation, hymns, the right hand of fellowship, prayer, consecration of the elements, distribution of the elements, partaking of the elements, and a benediction. Moravian Christians traditionally practice footwashing before partaking in the Lord's Supper, although in certain Moravian congregations, this rite is observed chiefly on Maundy Thursday.\nAnglican.\nAnglican theology on the matter of the Eucharist is nuanced. The Eucharist is neither wholly a matter of transubstantiation nor simply devotional and memorialist in orientation. The Anglican churches do not adhere to the belief that the Lord's Supper is merely a devotional reflection on Christ's death. For some Anglicans, Christ is spiritually present in the fullness of his person in the Eucharist.\nThe Church of England itself has repeatedly refused to make official any definition of \"the presence of Christ\". Church authorities prefer to leave it a mystery while proclaiming the consecrated bread and wine to be \"spiritual food\" of \"Christ's Most Precious Body and Blood\"; the bread and wine are an \"outward sign of an inner grace\". The words of administration at communion allow for real presence or for a real but spiritual presence (Calvinist receptionism and virtualism). This concept was congenial to most Anglicans well into the 19th century. From the 1840s, the Tractarians reintroduced the idea of \"the real presence\" to suggest a corporeal presence, which could be done since the language of the BCP rite referred to the body and blood of Christ without details as well as referring to these as spiritual food at other places in the text. Both are found in the Latin and other rites, but in the former, a definite interpretation as corporeal is applied.\nBoth receptionism and virtualism assert the real presence. The former places emphasis on the recipient and the latter states \"the presence\" is confected by the power of the Holy Spirit but not in Christ's natural body. His presence is objective and does not depend on its existence from the faith of the recipient. The liturgy petitions that elements \"be\" rather than \"become\" the body and blood of Christ leaving aside any theory of a change in the natural elements: bread and wine are the outer reality and \"the presence\" is the inner invisible except as perceived in faith.\nIn 1789, the Episcopal Church in the United States restored explicit language that the Eucharist is an oblation (sacrifice) to God. Subsequent revisions of the \"Book of Common Prayer\" by member churches of the Anglican Communion have done likewise (the Church of England did so in the proposed 1928 prayer book).\nThe so-called \"Black Rubric\" in the 1552 prayer book, which allowed kneeling when receiving Holy Communion was omitted in the 1559 edition at Queen Elizabeth I's insistence. It was reinstated in the 1662 prayer book, modified to deny any corporal presence of Christ's natural flesh and blood, which are in Heaven and not here. \nBaptists.\nThe bread and \"fruit of the vine\" indicated in Matthew, Mark and Luke as the elements of the Lord's Supper are interpreted by many Baptists as unleavened bread (although leavened bread is often used) and, in line with the historical stance of some Baptist groups (since the mid-19th century) against partaking of alcoholic beverages, grape juice, which they commonly refer to simply as \"the Cup\". The unleavened bread also underscores the symbolic belief attributed to Christ's breaking the bread and saying that it was his body.\nSome Baptists, such as certain Independent Baptist congregations, consider the Communion to be primarily an act of remembrance of Christ's atonement, and a time of renewal of personal commitment (memorialism), while others, such as Reformed Baptists (Calvinistic Baptists) affirm the Reformed doctrine of a pneumatic presence, which is expressed in confessions of faith such as the Second London Baptist Confession, specifically in Chapter 30, Articles 3 and 7. As such, those within the Founders movement (a Calvinistic movement among the Southern Baptist Convention) adhere to the real spiritual presence. Apart from the Reformed Baptists, there are certain General Baptists adhere to the view of the real spiritual presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, which was taught in Helwys Confession (1611).\nCommunion practices and frequency vary among congregations. A typical practice among some Baptists is to have small cups of juice and plates of broken bread distributed to the seated congregation. In other congregations, especially the more traditional ones, communicants may proceed to the altar or communion table to receive the elements, then return to their pews. A widely accepted practice is for all to receive and hold the elements until everyone is served, then consume the bread and cup in unison. Usually, hymns are performed and Scripture such as the precise verses of Jesus speaking at the Last Supper is read during the receiving of the elements.\nSome Baptist churches are closed-Communionists (even requiring full membership in the local church congregation before partaking), with others being partially or fully open-Communionists. Adults and children in attendance who have not received baptism are expected to not participate.\nLutheran.\nLutherans believe that the body and blood of Christ are \"truly and substantially present in, with, and under the forms\" of the consecrated bread and wine (the elements), so that communicants eat and drink the body and blood of Christ himself as well as the bread and wine in the Eucharistic sacrament. The Lutheran doctrine of the Real Presence is more accurately and formally known as the \"sacramental union\". Others have erroneously called this consubstantiation, a Lollardist doctrine, though this term is specifically rejected by Lutheran churches and theologians since it creates confusion about the actual doctrine and subjects the doctrine to the control of a non-biblical philosophical concept in the same manner as, in their view, does the term \"transubstantiation\".\nIn the Church of Sweden, the Eucharist is celebrated at least every Sunday, with some churches offering it daily, as with monasteries and convents. There is in Lutheran congregations, a movement to celebrate Eucharist weekly, though it was historically common for congregations to celebrate the Eucharist monthly or even quarterly. Even in congregations where Eucharist is offered weekly, there is not a requirement that every church service be a Eucharistic service, nor that all members of a congregation must receive it weekly.\nOpen Brethren and Exclusive Brethren.\nAmong Open assemblies, also termed Plymouth Brethren, the Eucharist is more commonly called the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper. They believe it is only a symbolic reenactment of the Last Supper and a memorial \"to remind believers of his body given and his blood shed for their salvation\". and is central to the worship of both individual and assembly. In principle, the service is open to all baptized Christians, but an individual's eligibility to participate depends on the views of each particular assembly. The service takes the form of non-liturgical, open worship with all male participants allowed to pray audibly and select hymns or readings. The breaking of bread itself typically consists of one leavened loaf, which is prayed over and broken by a participant in the meeting and then shared around. The wine is poured from a single container into one or several vessels, and these are again shared around.\nThe Exclusive Brethren follow a similar practice to the Open Brethren. They also call the Eucharist the Breaking of Bread or the Lord's Supper.\nReformed (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian and Congregationalist).\nIn the Reformed tradition (which includes the Continental Reformed Churches, the Presbyterian Churches, and the Congregationalist Churches), the Eucharist is variously administered. The Calvinist view of the Sacrament sees a real presence of Christ in the supper which differs both from the objective ontological presence of the Catholic view, and from the real absence of Christ and the mental recollection of the memorialism of the Zwinglians and their successors.\nThe bread and wine become the means by which the believer has real communion with Christ in his death and Christ's body and blood are present to the faith of the believer as really as the bread and wine are present to their senses but this presence is \"spiritual\", that is the work of the Holy Spirit. There is no standard frequency; John Calvin desired weekly communion, but the city council only approved monthly, and monthly celebration has become the most common practice in Reformed churches today.\nMany, on the other hand, follow John Knox in celebration of the Lord's supper on a quarterly basis, to give proper time for reflection and inward consideration of one's own state and sin. Recently, Presbyterian and Reformed Churches have been considering whether to restore more frequent communion, including weekly communion in more churches, considering that infrequent communion was derived from a memorialist view of the Lord's Supper, rather than Calvin's view of the sacrament as a means of grace. Some churches use bread without any raising agent (whether yeast or another leaven.) in view of the use of unleavened bread at Jewish Passover meals, while others use any bread available.\nThe Presbyterian Church (USA), for instance, prescribes \"bread common to the culture\". Harking back to the regulative principle of worship, the Reformed tradition had long eschewed coming forward to receive communion, preferring to have the elements distributed throughout the congregation by the presbyters (elders) more in the style of a shared meal. Over the last half a century it is much more common in Presbyterian churches to have Holy Communion monthly or on a weekly basis. It is also becoming common to receive the elements by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). Wine and grape juice are both used, depending on the congregation. Most Reformed churches practice \"open communion\", i.e., all believers who are united to a church of like faith and practice, and who are not living in sin, would be allowed to join in the Sacrament.\nMethodist.\nThe British \"Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists\" states that, \"[in the Eucharist] Jesus Christ is present with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour\". Methodist theology of this sacrament is reflected in one of the fathers of the movement, Charles Wesley, who wrote a Eucharistic hymn with the following stanza:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nWe need not now go up to Heaven,\nTo bring the long sought Saviour down;\nThou art to all already given,\nThou dost e'en now Thy banquet crown:\nTo every faithful soul appear,\nAnd show Thy real presence here!\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nReflecting Wesleyan covenant theology, Methodists also believe that the Lord's Supper is a sign and seal of the covenant of grace.\nIn many Methodist denominations, non-alcoholic wine (grape juice) is used, so as to include those who do not take alcohol for any reason, as well as a commitment to the Church's historical support of temperance. Variations of the Eucharistic Prayer are provided for various occasions, including communion of the sick and brief forms for occasions that call for greater brevity. Though the ritual is standardized, there is great variation amongst Methodist churches, from typically high-church to low-church, in the enactment and style of celebration. Methodist clergy are not required to be vested when celebrating the Eucharist.\nJohn Wesley, a founder of Methodism, said that it was the duty of Christians to receive the sacrament as often as possible. Methodists in the United States are encouraged to celebrate the Eucharist every Sunday, though it is typically celebrated on the first Sunday of each month, while a few go as long as celebrating quarterly (a tradition dating back to the days of circuit riders that served multiple churches). Communicants may receive standing, kneeling, or while seated. Gaining more wide acceptance is the practice of receiving by intinction (receiving a piece of consecrated bread or wafer, dipping it in the blessed wine, and consuming it). The most common alternative to intinction is for the communicants to receive the consecrated juice using small, individual, specially made glass or plastic cups known as communion cups. The United Methodist Church practices open communion (which it describes as an \"open table\"), inviting \"all who intend a Christian life, together with their children\" to receive the eucharistic elements. \"The Doctrines and Discipline of the Methodist Church\" specifies, on days during which Holy Communion is celebrated, that \"Upon entering the church let the communicants bow in prayer and in the spirit of prayer and meditation approach the Blessed Sacrament.\"\nNondenominational Christians.\nMany non-denominational Christians, including the Churches of Christ, receive communion every Sunday. Others, including Evangelical churches such as the Church of God and Calvary Chapel, typically receive communion on a monthly or periodic basis. Non-denominational churches are often autonomous, with governance and practices determined by individual congregations rather than by a central authority.\nSome Churches of Christ, among others, use grape juice and unleavened wafers or unleavened bread and practice open communion.\nSyriac Christianity.\nEdessan Rite (Church of the East).\nHoly Qurbana or Qurbana Qaddisha, the \"Holy Offering\" or \"Holy Sacrifice\", refers to the Eucharist as celebrated according to the East Syriac Christianity. The main Anaphora of the East Syrian tradition is the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari.\nSyro-Antiochene Rite (West Syriac).\nHoly Qurobo or Qurobo Qadisho refers to the Eucharist as celebrated in the West Syrian traditions of Syriac Christianity, while that of the West Syrian tradition is the Liturgy of Saint James.\nBoth are extremely old, going back at least to the third century, and are the oldest extant liturgies continually in use.\nRestorationism.\nIrvingian.\nIn the Irvingian Churches, Holy Communion, along with Holy Baptism and Holy Sealing, is one of the three sacraments. It is the focus of the Divine Service in the liturgies of Irvingism.\nEdward Irving, who founded the Irvingian Churches, such as the New Apostolic Church, taught the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, emphasizing \"the \"humiliated\" humanity of Christ in the Lord's Supper.\" Additionally, the Irvingian Churches affirm the \"real presence of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ in Holy Communion\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Jesus Christ is in the midst of the congregation as the crucified, risen, and returning Lord. Thus His once-brought sacrifice is also present in that its effect grants the individual access to salvation. In this way, the celebration of Holy Communion causes the partakers to repeatedly envision the sacrificial death of the Lord, which enables them to proclaim it with conviction (1 Corinthians 11: 26).\nIn the Irvingian tradition of Restorationist Christianity, consubstantiation is taught as the explanation of how the real presence is effected in the liturgy.\nSeventh-day Adventists.\nIn the Seventh-day Adventist Church the Holy Communion service customarily is celebrated once per quarter. The service includes the ordinance of footwashing and the Lord's Supper. Unleavened bread and unfermented (non-alcoholic) grape juice is used. Open communion is practised: all who have committed their lives to the Saviour may participate. The communion service must be conducted by an ordained pastor, minister or church elder.\nJehovah's Witnesses.\nJehovah's Witnesses commemorate Jesus' death annually on the evening that corresponds to the Passover, Nisan 14, according to the ancient Jewish calendar. They generally refer to the observance as \"the Lord's Evening Meal\" or the \"Memorial of Christ's Death\". They believe the event is the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians in the Bible.\nOf those who attend the Memorial, a small minority worldwide partake of the wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people will go to heaven, to serve as under-priests and co-rulers with Christ the King in God's Kingdom. They are referred to as the \"anointed\" class. They believe that the baptized \"other sheep\" also benefit from the ransom sacrifice, and are respectful observers and viewers of the Lord's Supper, but they hope to obtain everlasting life in Paradise restored on earth.\nThe Memorial, held after sundown, includes a sermon on the meaning and importance of the celebration and gathering, and includes the circulation of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread (matzo). Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the bread represents Jesus' perfect body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine represents his perfect blood which he shed to redeem fallen man from inherited sin and death. The wine and the bread (sometimes referred to as \"emblems\") are viewed as symbolic and commemorative; the Witnesses do not believe in transubstantiation or consubstantiation.\nLatter-day Saints.\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the \"Holy Sacrament of the Lord's Supper\", more simply referred to as the Sacrament, is administered every Sunday (except General Conference or other special Sunday meeting) in each Latter-Day Saint Ward or branch worldwide at the beginning of Sacrament meeting. The Sacrament, which consists of both ordinary bread and water (rather than wine or grape juice), is prepared by priesthood holders prior to the beginning of the meeting. At the beginning of the Sacrament, priests say specific prayers to bless the bread and water. The Sacrament is passed row-by-row to the congregation by priesthood holders (typically deacons).\nThe prayer recited for the bread and the water is found in the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants. The prayer contains the above essentials given by Jesus: \"Always remember him, and keep his commandments [\u2026] that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.\" (Moroni, 4:3.)\nNon-observing denominations.\nSalvation Army.\nWhile the Salvation Army does not reject the Eucharistic practices of other churches or deny that their members truly receive grace through this sacrament, it does not practice the sacraments of Communion or Baptism. This is because they believe that these are unnecessary for the living of a Christian life, and because in the opinion of Salvation Army founders William and Catherine Booth, the sacrament placed too much stress on outward ritual and too little on inward spiritual conversion.\nQuakers.\nEmphasizing the inward spiritual experience of their adherents over any outward ritual, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) historically do not baptize or observe physical Communion. George Fox, founder of the society, emphasized a personal relationship with God. Quakers associated with the Friends General Conference, Conservatives, and the Friends United Meeting continue to not observe the practice. Some Evangelical Quakers, however, do sometimes offer voluntary outward rituals, although most continue to emphasize an inward spiritual experience.\nChristian Scientists.\nAlthough the early Church of Christ, Scientist observed Communion, founder Mary Baker Eddy eventually discouraged the physical ritual as she believed it distracted from the true spiritual nature of the sacrament. As such, Christian Scientists do not observe physical communion with bread and wine, but spiritual communion at two special Sunday services each year by \"uniting together with Christ in silent prayer and on bended knee\".\nShakers.\nThe United Society of Believers (commonly known as Shakers) do not take communion, instead viewing every meal as a Eucharistic feast.\nPractice and customs.\nOpen and closed communion.\nChristian denominations differ in their understanding of whether they may celebrate the Eucharist with those with whom they are not in full communion. The apologist Justin Martyr (c.\u2009150) wrote of the Eucharist \"of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined.\" This was continued in the practice of dismissing the catechumens (those still undergoing instruction and not yet baptized) before the sacramental part of the liturgy, a custom which has left traces in the expression \"Mass of the Catechumens\" and in the Byzantine Rite exclamation by the deacon or priest, \"The doors! The doors!\", just before recitation of the Creed.\nChurches such as the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches practice closed communion under normal circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Church of the East) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the Holy See judges to be sacramentally in the same position as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but who share the Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of their own community. Some Protestant communities exclude non-members from Communion.\nThe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) practices open communion, provided those who receive are baptized, but the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) practice closed communion, excluding non-members and requiring communicants to have been given catechetical instruction. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, the Evangelical Church in Germany, the Church of Sweden, and many other Lutheran churches outside of the U.S. also practice open communion.\nSome use the term \"close communion\" for restriction to members of the same denomination, and \"closed communion\" for restriction to members of the local congregation alone.\nMost Protestant communities including Congregational churches, the Church of the Nazarene, the Assemblies of God, Methodists, most Presbyterians and Baptists, Anglicans, and Churches of Christ and other non-denominational churches practice various forms of open communion. Some churches do not limit it to only members of the congregation, but to any people in attendance (regardless of Christian affiliation) who consider themselves to be Christian. Others require that the communicant be a baptized person, or a member of a church of that denomination or a denomination of \"like faith and practice\". Some Progressive Christian congregations offer communion to any individual who wishes to commemorate the life and teachings of Christ, regardless of religious affiliation.\nMost Latter-Day Saint churches practice closed communion; one notable exception is the Community of Christ, the second-largest denomination in this movement. While The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the largest of the LDS denominations) technically practice a closed communion, their official direction to local Church leaders (in Handbook 2, section 20.4.1, last paragraph) is as follows: \"Although the sacrament is for Church members, the bishopric should not announce that it will be passed to members only, and nothing should be done to prevent nonmembers from partaking of it.\"\nIn the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church the Eucharist is only given to those who have come prepared to receive the life-giving body and blood. Therefore, in a manner to worthily receive, believers fast the night before the liturgy, from around 6pm or the conclusion of evening prayer, and remain fasting until they receive Holy Qurbana the next morning. Additionally, members who plan to receive the holy communion have to follow a strict guide of prescribed prayers from the Shehimo, or the book of common prayers, for the week.\nPreparation.\nCatholic.\nThe Catholic Church requires its members to receive the sacrament of Penance or Reconciliation before taking Communion if they are aware of having committed a mortal sin and to prepare by fasting, prayer, and other works of piety.\nEastern Orthodox.\nTraditionally, the Eastern Orthodox church has required its members to have observed all church-appointed fasts (most weeks, this will be at least Wednesday and Friday) for the week prior to partaking of communion, and to fast from all food and water from midnight the night before. In addition, Orthodox Christians are to have made a recent confession to their priest (the frequency varying with one's particular priest), and they must be at peace with all others, meaning that they hold no grudges or anger against anyone. In addition, one is expected to attend Vespers or the All-Night Vigil, if offered, on the night before receiving communion. Furthermore, various pre-communion prayers have been composed, which many (but not all) Orthodox churches require or at least strongly encourage members to say privately before coming to the Eucharist. However, all this will typically vary from priest to priest and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but abstaining from food and water for several hours beforehand is a fairly universal rule.\nProtestant confessions.\nMany Protestant congregations generally reserve a period of time for self-examination and private, silent confession just before partaking in the Lord's Supper.\nAdoration.\nEucharistic adoration is a practice in the Latin Church, Anglo-Catholic and some Lutheran traditions, in which the Blessed Sacrament is exposed to and adored by the faithful. When this exposure and adoration is constant (twenty-four hours a day), it is called \"Perpetual Adoration\". In a parish, this is usually done by volunteer parishioners; in a monastery or convent, it is done by the resident monks or nuns. In the \"Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament\", the Eucharist is displayed in a monstrance, typically placed on an altar, at times with a light focused on it, or with candles flanking it.\nHealth issues.\nGluten.\nThe gluten in wheat bread is dangerous to people with celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders, such as non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy. For the Catholic Church, this issue was addressed in the 24 July 2003 letter of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which summarized and clarified earlier declarations. The Catholic Church believes that the matter for the Eucharist must be wheaten bread and fermented wine from grapes: it holds that, if the gluten has been entirely removed, the result is not true wheaten bread. For celiacs, but not generally, it allows low-gluten bread. It also permits Holy Communion to be received under the form of either bread or wine alone, except by a priest who is celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. Many Protestant churches offer communicants gluten-free alternatives to wheaten bread, usually in the form of a rice-based or other gluten-free wafer.\nAlcohol.\nAs already indicated, the one exception is in the case of a priest celebrating Mass without other priests or as principal celebrant. The water that in the Roman Rite is prescribed to be mixed with the wine must be only a relatively small quantity. The practice of the Coptic Church is that the mixture should be two parts wine to one part water.\nSome Protestant churches allow communion in a non-alcoholic form, either normatively or as a pastoral exception. Since the invention of the necessary technology, grape juice which has been pasteurized to stop the fermentation process the juice naturally undergoes and de-alcoholized wine from which most of the alcohol has been removed (between 0.5% and 2% remains) are commonly used, and more rarely water may be offered. Exclusive use of unfermented grape juice is common in Baptist churches, the United Methodist Church, Seventh-day Adventists, Christian Churches/Churches of Christ, Churches of Christ, Church of God (Anderson, Indiana), some Lutherans, Assemblies of God, Pentecostals, Evangelicals, the Christian Missionary Alliance, and other American independent Protestant churches. \nFor members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, water is exclusively used in place of wine.\nTransmission of diseases.\nRisk of infectious disease transmission related to use of a common communion cup exists but it is low. No case of transmission of an infectious disease related to a common communion cup has ever been documented. Experimental studies have demonstrated that infectious diseases can be transmitted. The most likely diseases to be transmitted would be common viral illnesses such as the common cold. A study of 681 individuals found that taking communion up to daily from a common cup did not increase the risk of infection beyond that of those who did not attend services at all.\nIn influenza epidemics, some churches suspend the giving wine at communion, for fear of spreading the disease. This is in full accord with Catholic Church belief that communion under the form of bread alone makes it possible to receive all the fruit of Eucharistic grace. However, the same measure has also been taken by churches that normally insist on the importance of receiving communion under both forms. This was done in 2009 by the Church of England.\nSome fear contagion through the handling involved in distributing the hosts to the communicants, even if they are placed on the hand rather than on the tongue. Accordingly, some churches use mechanical wafer dispensers or \"pillow packs\" (communion wafers with wine inside them). While these methods of distributing communion are not generally accepted in Catholic parishes, one parish provides a mechanical dispenser to allow those intending to commune to place in a bowl, without touching them by hand, the hosts for use in the celebration.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9770", "revid": "42778291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9770", "title": "Eclipse", "text": "Astronomical event where one body is hidden by another\nAn eclipse is an astronomical event which occurs when an astronomical object or spacecraft is temporarily obscured, by passing into the shadow of another body or by having another body pass between it and the viewer. This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a \"syzygy\". An eclipse is the result of either an \"occultation\" (completely hidden) or a \"transit\" (partially hidden). A \"deep eclipse\" (or \"deep occultation\") is when a small astronomical object is behind a bigger one.\nThe term \"eclipse\" is most often used to describe either a solar eclipse, when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow. However, it can also refer to such events beyond the Earth\u2013Moon system: for example, a planet moving into the shadow cast by one of its moons, a moon passing into the shadow cast by its host planet, or a moon passing into the shadow of another moon. A binary star system can also produce eclipses if the plane of the orbit of its constituent stars intersects the observer's position.\nFor the special cases of solar and lunar eclipses, these only happen during an \"eclipse season\", the two times of each year when the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun crosses with the plane of the Moon's orbit around the Earth and the line defined by the intersecting planes points near the Sun. The type of solar eclipse that happens during each season (whether total, annular, hybrid, or partial) depends on apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun and the Moon's orbit around the Earth were both in the same plane with each other, then eclipses would happen every month. There would be a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and a solar eclipse at every new moon. It is because of the non-planar differences that eclipses are not a common event. If both orbits were perfectly circular, then each eclipse would be the same type every month.\nLunar eclipses can be viewed from the entire nightside half of the Earth. But solar eclipses, particularly total eclipses occurring at any one particular point on the Earth's surface, are very rare events that can be many decades apart.\nEtymology.\nThe term is derived from the ancient Greek noun ('), which means 'the abandonment', 'the downfall', or 'the darkening of a heavenly body', which is derived from the verb (') which means 'to abandon', 'to darken', or 'to cease to exist', a combination of prefix ('), from preposition ('), 'out', and of verb (\"\"), 'to be absent'.\nUmbra, penumbra and antumbra.\nFor any two objects in space, a line can be extended from the first through the second. The latter object will block some amount of light being emitted by the former, creating a region of shadow around the axis of the line. Typically these objects are moving with respect to each other and their surroundings, so the resulting shadow will sweep through a region of space, only passing through any particular location in the region for a fixed interval of time. As viewed from such a location, this shadowing event is known as an eclipse.\nTypically the cross-section of the objects involved in an astronomical eclipse is roughly disk-shaped. The region of an object's shadow during an eclipse is divided into three parts:\nA total eclipse occurs when the observer is within the umbra, an annular eclipse when the observer is within the antumbra, and a partial eclipse when the observer is within the penumbra. During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable, because the antumbra of the Sun-Earth system lies far beyond the Moon. Analogously, Earth's apparent diameter from the viewpoint of the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun and thus cannot produce an annular eclipse. The same terms may be used analogously in describing other eclipses, e.g., the antumbra of Deimos crossing Mars, or Phobos entering Mars's penumbra.\nThe \"first contact\" occurs when the eclipsing object's disc first starts to impinge on the light source; \"second contact\" is when the disc moves completely within the light source; \"third contact\" when it starts to move out of the light; and \"fourth\" or \"last contact\" when it finally leaves the light source's disc entirely.\nFor spherical bodies, when the occulting object is smaller than the star, the length (\"L\") of the umbra's cone-shaped shadow is given by:\nformula_1\nwhere \"Rs\" is the radius of the star, \"Ro\" is the occulting object's radius, and \"r\" is the distance from the star to the occulting object. For Earth, on average \"L\" is equal to 1.384\u00d7106\u00a0km, which is much larger than the Moon's semimajor axis of 3.844\u00d7105\u00a0km. Hence the umbral cone of the Earth can completely envelop the Moon during a lunar eclipse. If the occulting object has an atmosphere, however, some of the luminosity of the star can be refracted into the volume of the umbra. This occurs, for example, during an eclipse of the Moon by the Earth\u2014producing a faint, ruddy illumination of the Moon even at totality.\nOn Earth, the shadow cast during an eclipse moves very approximately at 1\u00a0km per sec. This depends on the location of the shadow on the Earth and the angle in which it is moving.\nEclipse cycles.\nAn eclipse cycle takes place when eclipses in a series are separated by a certain interval of time. This happens when the orbital motions of the bodies form repeating harmonic patterns. A particular instance is the saros, which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3\u00a0days, or a little over 18 years. Because this is not a whole number of days, successive eclipses will be visible from different parts of the world. In one saros period there are 239.0 anomalistic periods, 241.0 sidereal periods, 242.0 nodical periods, and 223.0 synodic periods. Although the orbit of the Moon does not give exact integers, the numbers of orbit cycles are close enough to integers to give strong similarity for eclipses spaced at 18.03 yr intervals.\nEarth\u2013Moon system.\nAn eclipse involving the Sun, Earth, and Moon can occur only when they are nearly in a straight line, allowing one to be hidden behind another, viewed from the third. Because the orbital plane of the Moon is tilted with respect to the orbital plane of the Earth (the ecliptic), eclipses can occur only when the Moon is close to the intersection of these two planes (the nodes). The Sun, Earth and nodes are aligned twice a year (during an eclipse season), and eclipses can occur during a period of about two months around these times. There can be from four to seven eclipses in a calendar year, which repeat according to various eclipse cycles, such as a saros.\nBetween 1901 and 2100 there are the maximum of seven eclipses in:\nExcluding penumbral lunar eclipses, there are a maximum of seven eclipses in:\nSolar eclipse.\nAs observed from the Earth, a solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes in front of the Sun. The type of solar eclipse event depends on the distance of the Moon from the Earth during the event. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Earth intersects the umbra portion of the Moon's shadow. When the umbra does not reach the surface of the Earth, the Sun is only partially occulted, resulting in an annular eclipse. Partial solar eclipses occur when the viewer is inside the penumbra.\nThe eclipse magnitude is the fraction of the Sun's diameter that is covered by the Moon. For a total eclipse, this value is always greater than or equal to one. In both annular and total eclipses, the eclipse magnitude is the ratio of the angular sizes of the Moon to the Sun.\nSolar eclipses are relatively brief events that can only be viewed in totality along a relatively narrow track. Under the most favorable circumstances, a total solar eclipse can last for 7\u00a0minutes, 31\u00a0seconds, and can be viewed along a track that is up to 250\u00a0km wide. However, the region where a partial eclipse can be observed is much larger. The Moon's umbra will advance eastward at a rate of 1,700\u00a0km/h, until it no longer intersects the Earth's surface.\nDuring a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun's when viewed from the Earth. A total solar eclipse is in fact an occultation while an annular solar eclipse is a transit.\nWhen observed at points in space other than from the Earth's surface, the Sun can be eclipsed by bodies other than the Moon. Two examples include when the crew of Apollo 12 observed the in 1969 and when the \"Cassini\" probe observed in 2006.\nLunar eclipse.\nLunar eclipses occur when the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow. This happens only during a full moon, when the Moon is on the far side of the Earth from the Sun. Unlike a solar eclipse, an eclipse of the Moon can be observed from nearly an entire hemisphere. For this reason it is much more common to observe a lunar eclipse from a given location. A lunar eclipse lasts longer, taking several hours to complete, with totality itself usually averaging anywhere from about 30 minutes to over an hour.\nThere are three types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only the Earth's penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses partially into the Earth's umbra; and total, when the Moon crosses entirely into the Earth's umbra. Total lunar eclipses pass through all three phases. Even during a total lunar eclipse, however, the Moon is not completely dark. Sunlight refracted through the Earth's atmosphere enters the umbra and provides a faint illumination. Much as in a sunset, the atmosphere tends to more strongly scatter light with shorter wavelengths, so the illumination of the Moon by refracted light has a red hue, thus the phrase 'Blood Moon' is often found in descriptions of such lunar events as far back as eclipses are recorded.\nHistorical record.\nRecords of solar eclipses have been kept since ancient times. Eclipse dates can be used for chronological dating of historical records. A Syrian clay tablet, in the Ugaritic language, records a solar eclipse which occurred on March 5, 1223, B.C., while Paul Griffin argues that a stone in Ireland records an eclipse on November 30, 3340 B.C. Positing classical-era astronomers' use of Babylonian eclipse records mostly from the 13th century BC provides a feasible and mathematically consistent explanation for the Greek finding all three lunar mean motions (synodic, anomalistic, draconitic) to a precision of about one part in a million or better. Chinese historical records of solar eclipses date back over 3,000 years and have been used to measure changes in the Earth's rate of spin.\nThe first person to give scientific explanation on eclipses was Anaxagoras [c500BC - 428BC]. Anaxagoras stated that the Moon shines by reflected light from the Sun.\nIn 5th century AD, solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata, in his treatise \"Aryabhatiya.\" Aryabhata states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight and explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth. Aryabhata provides the computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Indian computations were very accurate that 18th-century French scientist Guillaume Le Gentil, during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations of the duration of the lunar eclipse of 30 August 1765 to be short by only 41 seconds, whereas Le Gentil's charts were long by 68 seconds.\nBy the 1600s, European astronomers were publishing books with diagrams explaining how lunar and solar eclipses occurred. In order to disseminate this information to a broader audience and decrease fear of the consequences of eclipses, booksellers printed broadsides explaining the event either using the science or via astrology.\nEclipses in mythology and religion.\nThe American author Gene Weingarten described the tension between belief and eclipses thus: \"I am a devout atheist but can't explain why the moon is exactly the right size, and gets positioned so precisely between the Earth and the sun, that total solar eclipses are perfect. It bothers me.\"\nThe Graeco-Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing between AD 211\u2013229, relates the anecdote that Emperor Claudius considered it necessary to prevent disturbance among the Roman population by publishing a prediction for a solar eclipse which would fall on his birthday anniversary [1 August in the year AD 45]. In this context, Cassius Dio provides a detailed explanation of solar and lunar eclipses.\nTypically in mythology, eclipses were understood to be one variation or another of a spiritual battle between the sun and evil forces or spirits of darkness. More specifically, in Norse mythology, it is believed that there is a wolf by the name of Fenrir that is in constant pursuit of the Sun, and eclipses are thought to occur when the wolf successfully devours the divine Sun. Other Norse tribes believed that there are two wolves by the names of Sk\u00f6ll and Hati that are in pursuit of the Sun and the Moon, known by the names of Sol and Mani, and these tribes believed that an eclipse occurs when one of the wolves successfully eats either the Sun or the Moon.\nIn most types of mythologies and certain religions, eclipses were seen as a sign that the gods were angry and that danger was soon to come, so people often altered their actions in an effort to dissuade the gods from unleashing their wrath. In the Hindu religion, for example, people often sing religious hymns for protection from the evil spirits of the eclipse, and many people of the Hindu religion refuse to eat during an eclipse to avoid the effects of the evil spirits. Hindu people living in India will also wash off in the Ganges River, which is believed to be spiritually cleansing, directly following an eclipse to clean themselves of the evil spirits. In early Judaism and Christianity, eclipses were viewed as signs from God, and some eclipses were seen as a display of God's greatness or even signs of cycles of life and death. However, more ominous eclipses such as a blood moon were believed to be a divine sign that God would soon destroy their enemies.\nOther planets and dwarf planets.\nGas giants.\nThe gas giant planets have many moons and thus frequently display eclipses. The most striking involve Jupiter, which has four large moons and a low axial tilt, making eclipses more frequent as these bodies pass through the shadow of the larger planet. Transits occur with equal frequency. It is common to see the larger moons casting circular shadows upon Jupiter's cloudtops.\nThe eclipses of the Galilean moons by Jupiter became accurately predictable once their orbital elements were known. During the 1670s, it was discovered that these events were occurring about 17 minutes later than expected when Jupiter was on the far side of the Sun. Ole R\u00f8mer deduced that the delay was caused by the time needed for light to travel from Jupiter to the Earth. This was used to produce the first estimate of the speed of light.\nThe timing of the Jovian satellite eclipses was also used to calculate an observer's longitude upon the Earth. By knowing the expected time when an eclipse would be observed at a standard longitude (such as Greenwich), the time difference could be computed by accurately observing the local time of the eclipse. The time difference gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15\u00b0 around the Earth's equator. This technique was used, for example, by Giovanni D. Cassini in 1679 to re-map France.\nOn the other three gas giants (Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) eclipses only occur at certain periods during the planet's orbit, due to their higher inclination between the orbits of the moon and the orbital plane of the planet. The moon Titan, for example, has an orbital plane tilted about 1.6\u00b0 to Saturn's equatorial plane. But Saturn has an axial tilt of nearly 27\u00b0. The orbital plane of Titan only crosses the line of sight to the Sun at two points along Saturn's orbit. As the orbital period of Saturn is 29.7\u00a0years, an eclipse is only possible about every 15 years.\nMars.\nOn Mars, only partial solar eclipses (transits) are possible, because neither of its moons is large enough, at their respective orbital radii, to cover the Sun's disc as seen from the surface of the planet. Eclipses of the moons by Mars are not only possible, but commonplace, with hundreds occurring each Earth year. There are also rare occasions when Deimos is eclipsed by Phobos. Martian eclipses have been photographed from both the surface of Mars and from orbit.\nPluto.\nPluto, with its proportionately largest moon Charon, is also the site of many eclipses. A series of such mutual eclipses occurred between 1985 and 1990. These daily events led to the first accurate measurements of the physical parameters of both objects.\nMercury and Venus.\nEclipses are impossible on Mercury and Venus, which have no moons. However, as seen from the Earth, both have been observed to transit across the face of the Sun. Transits of Venus occur in pairs separated by an interval of eight years, but each pair of events happen less than once a century. According to NASA, the next pair of Venus transits will occur on December 10, 2117, and December 8, 2125. Transits of Mercury are much more common, occurring 13 times each century, on average.\nEclipsing binaries.\nA binary star system consists of two stars that orbit around their common centre of mass. The movements of both stars lie on a common orbital plane in space. When this plane is very closely aligned with the location of an observer, the stars can be seen to pass in front of each other. The result is a type of extrinsic variable star system called an eclipsing binary.\nThe maximum luminosity of an eclipsing binary system is equal to the sum of the luminosity contributions from the individual stars. When one star passes in front of the other, the luminosity of the system is seen to decrease. The luminosity returns to normal once the two stars are no longer in alignment.\nThe first eclipsing binary star system to be discovered was Algol, a star system in the constellation Perseus. Normally this star system has a visual magnitude of 2.1. However, every 2.867 days the magnitude decreases to 3.4 for more than nine hours. This is caused by the passage of the dimmer member of the pair in front of the brighter star. The concept that an eclipsing body caused these luminosity variations was introduced by John Goodricke in 1783.\nTypes.\nSun \u2013 Moon \u2013 Earth: Solar eclipse | annular eclipse | hybrid eclipse | partial eclipse\nSun \u2013 Earth \u2013 Moon: Lunar eclipse | penumbral eclipse | partial lunar eclipse | central lunar eclipse\nSun \u2013 Phobos \u2013 Mars: Transit of Phobos from Mars | Solar eclipses on Mars\nSun \u2013 Deimos \u2013 Mars: Transit of Deimos from Mars | Solar eclipses on Mars\nOther types: Solar eclipses on Jupiter | Solar eclipses on Saturn | Solar eclipses on Uranus | Solar eclipses on Neptune | Solar eclipses on Pluto\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was one of the first parts of the Unix operating system that was developed, in August 1969. It remains part of the POSIX and Open Group standards for Unix-based operating systems, alongside the more sophisticated full-screen editor vi.\nHistory and influence.\nThe ed text editor was one of the first three key elements of the Unix operating system\u2014assembler, editor, and shell\u2014developed by Ken Thompson in August 1969 on a PDP-7 at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. Many features of ed came from the qed text editor developed at Thompson's alma mater University of California, Berkeley. Thompson was very familiar with qed, and had reimplemented it on the CTSS and Multics systems. Thompson's versions of qed were notable as the first to implement regular expressions. Regular expressions are also implemented in ed, though their implementation is considerably less general than that in qed.\nDennis M. Ritchie produced what Doug McIlroy later described as the \"definitive\" ed, and aspects of ed went on to influence ex, which in turn spawned vi. The non-interactive Unix command grep was inspired by a common special use of qed and later ed, where the command codice_1 performs a global regular expression search and prints the lines containing matches. The Unix stream editor, sed implemented many of the scripting features of qed that were not supported by ed on Unix.\nFeatures.\nFeatures of ed include:\nKnown for its terseness, ed, compatible with teletype terminals like Teletype Model 33, gives almost no visual feedback, and has been called (by Peter H. Salus) \"the most user-hostile editor ever created\", even when compared to the contemporary (and notoriously complex) TECO. For example, the message that ed will produce in case of error, \"and\" when it wants to make sure the user wishes to quit without saving, is \"?\". It does not report the current filename or line number, or even display the results of a change to the text, unless requested. Older versions (c. 1981) did not even ask for confirmation when a quit command was issued without the user saving changes. This terseness was appropriate in the early versions of Unix, when consoles were teletypes, modems were slow, and memory was precious. As computer technology improved and these constraints were loosened, editors with more visual feedback became the norm.\nIn current practice, ed is rarely used interactively, but does find use in some shell scripts. For interactive use, ed was subsumed by the sam, vi and Emacs editors in the 1980s. ed can be found on virtually every version of Unix and Linux available, and as such is useful for people who have to work with multiple versions of Unix. On Unix-based operating systems, some utilities like SQL*Plus run ed as the editor if the EDITOR and VISUAL environment variables are not defined. If something goes wrong, ed is sometimes the only editor available. This is often the only time when it is used interactively.\nThe version of ed provided by GNU has a few switches to enhance the feedback. Using codice_2 provides a simple prompt and enables more useful feedback messages. The codice_3 switch is defined in POSIX since XPG2 (1987).\nThe ed commands are often imitated in other line-based editors. For example, CP/M's ED, EDLIN in early MS-DOS versions and 32-bit versions of Windows NT has a somewhat similar syntax, and text editors in many MUDs (LPMud and descendants, for example) use ed-like syntax. These editors, however, are typically more limited in function.\nExample.\nHere is an example transcript of an ed session. For clarity, commands and text typed by the user are in normal face, and output from ed is emphasized.\n a\n ed is the standard Unix text editor.\n This is line number two.\n 2i&lt;br&gt;\n ,l\n ed is the standard Unix text editor.$\n This is line number two.$\n w text.txt\n 63\n ,l\n ed is the standard Unix text editor.$\n This is line number three.$\n w text.txt\n 65\n q\nThe end result is a simple text file codice_4 containing the following text:\n ed is the standard Unix text editor.&lt;br&gt;\n This is line number three.\nStarted with an empty file, the codice_5 command appends text (all ed commands are single letters). The command puts ed in \"insert mode\", inserting the characters that follow and is terminated by a single dot on a line. The two lines that are entered before the dot end up in the file buffer. The codice_6 command also goes into insert mode, and will insert the entered text (a single empty line in our case) before line two. All commands may be prefixed by a line number to operate on that line.\nIn the line codice_7, the lowercase L stands for the list command. The command is prefixed by a range, in this case codice_8 which is a shortcut for codice_9. A range is two line numbers separated by a comma (codice_10 means the last line). In return, ed lists all lines, from first to last. These lines are ended with dollar signs, so that white space at the end of lines is clearly visible.\nOnce the empty line is inserted in line 2, the line which reads \"This is line number two.\" is now actually the third line. This error is corrected with , a substitution command. The codice_11 will apply it to the correct line; following the command is the text to be replaced, and then the replacement. Listing all lines with codice_7 the line is shown now to be correct.\ncodice_13 writes the buffer to the file codice_4 making ed respond with \"65\", the number of characters written to the file. codice_15 will end an ed session.\nCultural references.\nThe GNU Project has numerous jokes around ed hosted on its website. In addition, the glibc documentation notes an error code called with its description (errorstr) merely a single question mark, noting \"the experienced user will know what is wrong.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nShell and Utilities Reference, The Single UNIX Specification, Version 5 from The Open Group"}

Although superseded in MS-DOS 5.0 and later by the full-screen MS-DOS Editor, and by Notepad in Microsoft Windows, it continued to be included in the 32-bit versions of Microsoft operating systems up to Windows Server 2008 and Windows 10.\nHistory.\nEdlin was created by Tim Paterson in two weeks in 1980, for Seattle Computer Products's 86-DOS (QDOS) based on the CP/M context editor \"ED\", itself distantly inspired by the DEC PDP-10 TOPS-10 EDIT text editor.\nMicrosoft acquired 86-DOS and, after some further development, sold it as MS-DOS, so Edlin was included in v1.0\u2013v5.0 of MS-DOS. From MS-DOS 6 onwards, the only editor included was the new full-screen MS-DOS Editor. \nWindows 95, 98 and ME ran on top of an embedded version of DOS, which reports itself as MS-DOS 7. As a successor to MS-DOS 6, this did not include Edlin. \nHowever, Edlin is included in the 32-bit versions of Windows NT and its derivatives\u2014up to and including Windows 10\u2014because the NTVDM's DOS support in those operating systems is based on MS-DOS version 5.0. However, unlike most other external DOS commands, it has not been transformed into a native Win32 program. It also does not support long filenames, which were not added to MS-DOS and Windows until long after Edlin was written.\nThe FreeDOS version was developed by Gregory Pietsch.\nUsage.\nThere are only a few commands. The short list can be found by entering a ? at the edlin prompt.\nWhen a file is open, typing L lists the contents (e.g., codice_1 lists lines 1 through 6). Each line is displayed with a line number in front of it.\n *1,6L\n 1: Edlin: The only text editor in early versions of DOS.\n 2:\n 3: Back in the day, I remember seeing web pages\n 4: branded with a logo at the bottom:\n 5: \"This page created in edlin.\"\n 6: The things that some people put themselves through. ;-)\nThe currently selected line has an *. To replace the contents of any line, the line number is entered and any text entered replaces the original. While editing a line pressing Ctrl-C cancels any changes. The * marker remains on that line.\nEntering I (optionally preceded with a line number) inserts one or more lines before the * line or the line given. When finished entering lines, Ctrl-C returns to the edlin command prompt.\n *6I\n 6:*(...or similar)\n 7:*^C \n *7D\n *L\n 1: Edlin: The only text editor in early versions of DOS.\n 2:\n 3: Back in the day, I remember seeing web pages\n 4: branded with a logo at the bottom:\n 5: \"This page created in edlin.\"\n 6: (...or similar)\ni - Inserts lines of text.\nD - deletes the specified line, again optionally starting with the number of a line, or a range of lines. E.g.: codice_2 deletes lines 2 through 4. In the above example, line 7 was deleted.\nR - is used to replace all occurrences of a piece of text in a given range of lines, for example, to replace a spelling error. Including the ? prompts for each change. E.g.: To replace 'prit' with 'print' and to prompt for each change: codice_3 (the ^Z represents pressing CTRL-Z). It is case-sensitive.\nS - searches for given text. It is used in the same way as replace, but without the replacement text. A search for 'apple' in the first 20 lines of a file is typed codice_4 (no space, unless that is part of the search) followed by a press of enter. For each match, it asks if it is the correct one, and accepts n or y (or Enter).\nP - displays a listing of a range of lines. If no range is specified, P displays the complete file from the * to the end.

It descended from the code used with punched cards and the corresponding six-bit binary-coded decimal code used with most of IBM's computer peripherals of the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is supported by various non-IBM platforms, such as Fujitsu-Siemens' BS2000/OSD, OS-IV, MSP, and MSP-EX, the SDS Sigma series, Unisys VS/9, Unisys MCP and ICL VME.\nHistory.\nEBCDIC was devised in 1963 and 1964 by IBM and was announced with the release of the IBM System/360 line of mainframe computers. It is an eight-bit character encoding, developed separately from the seven-bit ASCII encoding scheme. It was created to extend the existing Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) Interchange Code, or BCDIC, which itself was devised as an efficient means of encoding the two \"zone\" and \"number\" punches on punched cards into six bits. The distinct encoding of 's' and 'S' (using position 2 instead of 1) was maintained from punched cards where it was desirable not to have hole punches too close to each other to ensure the integrity of the physical card.\nWhile IBM was a chief proponent of the ASCII standardization committee, the company did not have time to prepare ASCII peripherals (such as card punch machines) to ship with its System/360 computers, so the company settled on EBCDIC. The System/360 became wildly successful, together with clones such as RCA Spectra 70, ICL System 4, and Fujitsu FACOM, thus so did EBCDIC.\nAll IBM's mainframe operating systems, and its IBM i operating system for midrange computers, use EBCDIC as their inherent encoding (with toleration for ASCII, for example, ISPF in z/OS can browse and edit both EBCDIC and ASCII encoded files). Software can translate to and from encodings, and modern mainframes (such as IBM Z) include processor instructions, at the hardware level, to accelerate translation between character sets. Modern z/OS compilers for the C and C++ languages on IBM Z mainframes, and earlier OS/390 C and C++ compilers on IBM System/390 mainframes, support a POSIX-compatible execution environment that makes use of ASCII by default.\nNot all operating systems running on IBM hardware use EBCDIC; IBM AIX, Linux on IBM Z, and Linux on Power all use ASCII, as do all operating systems that run on the IBM Personal Computer and its successors.\nCompatibility with ASCII.\nThere were numerous difficulties to writing software that would work in both ASCII and EBCDIC.\nCode page layout.\nThere are hundreds of EBCDIC code pages based on the original EBCDIC character encoding; there are a variety of EBCDIC code pages intended for use in different parts of the world, including code pages for non-Latin scripts such as Chinese, Japanese (e.g., EBCDIC 930, JEF, and KEIS), Korean, and Greek (EBCDIC 875). There is also a huge number of variations with the letters swapped around for no discernible reason.\nThe table below shows the \"invariant subset\" of EBCDIC, which are characters that \"should\" have the same assignments on all EBCDIC code pages that use the Latin alphabet. (This includes most of the ISO/IEC 646 invariant repertoire, except the exclamation mark.) It also shows (in gray) missing ASCII and EBCDIC punctuation, located where they are in Code Page 37 (one of the code page variants of EBCDIC). The blank cells are filled with region-specific characters in the variants, but the characters in gray are often swapped around or replaced as well. Like ASCII, the invariant subset works only for languages using only the ISO basic Latin alphabet, such as English.\nDefinitions of non-ASCII EBCDIC controls.\nFollowing are the definitions of EBCDIC control characters which either do not map onto the ASCII control characters, or have additional uses. When mapped to Unicode, these are mostly mapped to C1 control character codepoints in a manner specified by IBM's Character Data Representation Architecture (CDRA).\nAlthough the default mapping of New Line (NL) corresponds to the ISO/IEC 6429 Next Line character (NEL, U+0085, the behaviour of which is also specified, but not required, in Unicode Annex 14), most of these C1-mapped controls match neither those in the ISO/IEC 6429 C1 set, nor those in other registered C1 control sets such as ISO 6630. Although this effectively makes the non-ASCII EBCDIC controls a unique C1 control set, they are not among the C1 control sets registered in the ISO-IR registry, meaning that they do not have an assigned control set designation sequence (as specified by ISO/IEC 2022, and optionally permitted in ISO/IEC 10646 (Unicode)).\nBesides U+0085 (Next Line), the Unicode Standard does not prescribe an interpretation of C1 control characters, leaving their interpretation to higher level protocols (it suggests, but does not require, their ISO/IEC 6429 interpretations in the absence of use for other purposes), so this mapping is permissible in, but not specified by, Unicode.\nCode pages with Latin-1 character sets.\nThe following code pages have the full Latin-1 character set (ISO/IEC 8859-1). The first column gives the original code page number. The second column gives the number of the code page updated with the euro sign (\u20ac) replacing the universal currency sign (\u00a4) (or in the case of EBCDIC 924, with the set changed to match ISO 8859-15)\nDifferent countries have different code pages because these code pages originated as code pages with country-specific character repertoires, and were later expanded to contain the entire ISO 8859-1 repertoire, meaning that a given ISO 8859-1 character may have different code point values in different code pages. They are known as Country Extended Code Pages (CECPs).\nCriticism and humor.\nOpen-source software advocate and software developer Eric S. Raymond writes in his \"Jargon File\" that EBCDIC was loathed by hackers, by which he meant members of a subculture of enthusiastic programmers. What is known as vendor lock-in today, is jokingly criticized in The Jargon File with the following definition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; EBCDIC: /eb\u00b4s@\u00b7dik/, /eb\u00b4see`dik/, /eb\u00b4k@\u00b7dik/, n.\n[abbreviation, Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code] An alleged character set used on IBM dinosaurs. It exists in at least six mutually incompatible versions, all featuring such delights as non-contiguous letter sequences and the absence of several ASCII punctuation characters fairly important for modern computer languages (exactly which characters are absent varies according to which version of EBCDIC you're looking at). IBM adapted EBCDIC from punched card code in the early 1960s and promulgated it as a customer-control tactic (see \"https://\"), spurning the already established ASCII standard. Today, IBM claims to be an open-systems company, but IBM's own description of the EBCDIC variants and how to convert between them is still internally classified top-secret, burn-before-reading. Hackers blanch at the very \"name\" of EBCDIC and consider it a manifestation of purest evil.\nEBCDIC design was the source of many jokes. One such joke, found in the Unix fortune file of 4.3BSD Reno (1990) went:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; \"Professor: \"So the American government went to IBM to come up with an encryption standard, and they came up with\u2014\"Student: \"EBCDIC!\"\"\nReferences to the EBCDIC character set are made in the 1979 computer game series \"Zork\".

{"id": "9775", "revid": "49473253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9775", "title": "Endoplasmic reticulum", "text": "Cell organelle that processes proteins\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a part of a transportation system of the eukaryotic cell, and has many other important functions such as protein folding. The word endoplasmic means \"within the cytoplasm\", and reticulum is Latin for \"little net\". It is a type of organelle made up of two subunits \u2013 rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). The endoplasmic reticulum is found in most eukaryotic cells and forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs known as cisternae (in the RER), and tubular structures in the SER. The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane. The endoplasmic reticulum is not found in red blood cells, or spermatozoa.\nThere are two types of ER that share many of the same proteins and engage in certain common activities such as the synthesis of certain lipids and cholesterol. Different types of cells contain different ratios of the two types of ER depending on the activities of the cell. RER is found mainly toward the nucleus of the cell and SER towards the cell membrane or plasma membrane of the cell.\nThe outer (cytosolic) face of the RER is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis. The RER is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes. The SER lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid synthesis but not metabolism, the production of steroid hormones, and detoxification. The SER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells.\nThe ER was observed by light microscopy by Charles Garnier in 1897, who coined the term \"ergastoplasm\". The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen by electron microscopy in 1945 by Keith R. Porter, Albert Claude, and Ernest F. Fullam.\nStructure.\nThe general structure of the endoplasmic reticulum is a network of membranes called cisternae. These sac-like structures are held together by the cytoskeleton. The phospholipid membrane encloses the cisternal space (or lumen), which is continuous with the perinuclear space but separate from the cytosol. The functions of the endoplasmic reticulum can be summarized as the synthesis and export of proteins and membrane lipids, but varies between ER and cell type and cell function. The quantity of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum in a cell can slowly interchange from one type to the other, depending on the changing metabolic activities of the cell. Transformation can include embedding of new proteins in membrane as well as structural changes. Changes in protein content may occur without noticeable structural changes.\nRough endoplasmic reticulum.\nThe surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (often abbreviated \"RER\" or \"rough ER\"; also called \"granular endoplasmic reticulum\") is studded with protein-manufacturing ribosomes giving it a \"rough\" appearance (hence its name). The binding site of the ribosome on the rough endoplasmic reticulum is the translocon. However, the ribosomes are not a stable part of this organelle's structure as they are constantly being bound and released from the membrane. A ribosome only binds to the RER once a specific protein-nucleic acid complex forms in the cytosol. This special complex forms when a free ribosome begins translating the mRNA of a protein destined for the secretory pathway. The first 5\u201330 amino acids polymerized encode a signal peptide, a molecular message that is recognized and bound by a signal recognition particle (SRP). Translation pauses and the ribosome complex binds to the RER translocon where translation continues with the nascent (new) protein forming into the RER lumen and/or membrane. The protein is processed in the ER lumen by an enzyme (a signal peptidase), which removes the signal peptide. Ribosomes at this point may be released back into the cytosol; however, non-translating ribosomes are also known to stay associated with translocons.\nThe membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is in the form of large double-membrane sheets that are located near, and continuous with, the outer layer of the nuclear envelope. The double membrane sheets are stacked and connected through several right- or left-handed helical ramps, the \"Terasaki ramps\", giving rise to a structure resembling a parking garage. Although there is no continuous membrane between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, membrane-bound transport vesicles shuttle proteins between these two compartments. Vesicles are surrounded by coating proteins called COPI and COPII. COPII targets vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and COPI marks them to be brought back to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The rough endoplasmic reticulum works in concert with the Golgi complex to target new proteins to their proper destinations. The second method of transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum involves areas called membrane contact sites, where the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and other organelles are held closely together, allowing the transfer of lipids and other small molecules.\nThe rough endoplasmic reticulum is key in multiple functions:\nThe RER has ribosomes while the SER does not.\nSmooth endoplasmic reticulum.\nIn most cells the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (abbreviated SER) is scarce. Instead there are areas where the ER is partly smooth and partly rough: the transitional ER. The transitional ER gets its name because it contains ER exit sites, areas where the transport vesicles, which contain lipids and proteins made in the ER, detach from the ER and start moving to the Golgi apparatus. Specialized cells can have a lot of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions. It synthesizes lipids, phospholipids, and steroids. Cells which secrete these products, such as those in the testes, ovaries, and sebaceous glands have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum. It also carries out the metabolism of carbohydrates, detoxification of natural metabolism products and of alcohol and drugs, attachment of receptors on cell membrane proteins, and steroid metabolism. In muscle cells, it regulates calcium ion concentration. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is found in a variety of cell types (both animal and plant), and it serves different functions in each. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum also contains the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, a step in gluconeogenesis. It is connected to the nuclear envelope and consists of tubules that are located near the cell periphery. These tubes sometimes branch forming a network that is reticular in appearance. In some cells, there are dilated areas like the sacs of rough endoplasmic reticulum. The network of smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for an increased surface area to be devoted to the action or storage of key enzymes and the products of these enzymes.\nSarcoplasmic reticulum.\nThe sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), from the Greek \u03c3\u03ac\u03c1\u03be \"sarx\" (\"flesh\"), is smooth ER found in muscle cells. The only structural difference between this organelle and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the composition of proteins they have, both bound to their membranes and drifting within the confines of their lumens. This fundamental difference is indicative of their functions: The endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes molecules, while the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions and pumps them out into the sarcoplasm when the muscle fiber is stimulated. After their release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, calcium ions interact with contractile proteins that utilize ATP to shorten the muscle fiber. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in excitation-contraction coupling.\nFunctions.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and the transport of synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Rough endoplasmic reticulum is also involved in protein synthesis. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several endoplasmic reticulum chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylprolyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus \u2013 unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection or the over-expression of proteins can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading to an increase in unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential cause of damage in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.\nProtein transport.\nSecretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, are moved across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Proteins that are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum throughout the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the endoplasmic reticulum are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum is also part of a protein sorting pathway. It is, in essence, the transportation system of the eukaryotic cell. The majority of its resident proteins are retained within it through a retention motif. This motif is composed of four amino acids at the end of the protein sequence. The most common retention sequences are KDEL for lumen-located proteins and KKXX for transmembrane proteins. However, variations of KDEL and KKXX do occur, and other sequences can also give rise to endoplasmic reticulum retention. It is not known whether such variation can lead to sub-ER localizations. There are three KDEL (1, 2 and 3) receptors in mammalian cells, and they have a very high degree of sequence identity. The functional differences between these receptors remain to be established.\nBioenergetics regulation of ER ATP supply by a CaATiER mechanism.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum does not harbor an ATP-regeneration machinery, and therefore requires ATP import from mitochondria. The imported ATP is vital for the ER to carry out its house keeping cellular functions, such as for protein folding and trafficking.\nThe ER ATP transporter, SLC35B1/AXER, was recently cloned and characterized, and the mitochondria supply ATP to the ER through a \"Ca2+-antagonized transport into the ER\" (\"CaATiER\") mechanism. The \"CaATiER\" mechanism shows sensitivity to cytosolic Ca2+ ranging from high nM to low \u03bcM range, with the Ca2+-sensing element yet to be identified and validated.\nClinical significance.\nIncreased and supraphysiological ER stress in pancreatic \u03b2 cells disrupts normal insulin secretion, leading to hyperinsulinemia and consequently peripheral insulin resistance associated with obesity in humans. Human clinical trials also suggested a causal link between obesity-induced increase in insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance.\nAbnormalities in XBP1 lead to a heightened endoplasmic reticulum stress response and subsequently causes a higher susceptibility for inflammatory processes that may even contribute to Alzheimer's disease. In the colon, XBP1 anomalies have been linked to the inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease.\nThe unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response related to the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR is activated in response to an accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR functions to restore normal function of the cell by halting protein translation, degrading misfolded proteins, and activating the signaling pathways that lead to increasing the production of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding. Sustained overactivation of the UPR has been implicated in prion diseases as well as several other neurodegenerative diseases and the inhibition of the UPR could become a treatment for those diseases.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Roosevelt on February 19, 1942. \"This order authorized the forced removal of all persons deemed a threat to national security from the West Coast to 'relocation centers' further inland\u2014resulting in the incarceration of Japanese Americans.\" Two-thirds of the 125,000 people displaced were U.S. citizens.\nNotably, far more Americans of Asian descent were forcibly interned than Americans of European descent, both in total and as a share of their relative populations. German and Italian Americans who were sent to internment camps during the war were sent under the provisions of Presidential Proclamation 2526 and the Alien Enemy Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798.\nTranscript of Executive Order 9066.\nThe text of Executive Order 9066 was as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Executive Order No. 9066\nExecutive Order\nAuthorizing the Secretary of War to Prescribe Military Areas\nWhereas the successful prosecution of the war requires every possible protection against espionage and against sabotage to national-defense material, national-defense premises, and national-defense utilities as defined in Section 4, Act of April 20, 1918, 40 Stat. 533, as amended by the Act of November 30, 1940, 54 Stat. 1220, and the Act of August 21, 1941, 55 Stat. 655 (U.S.C., Title 50, Sec. 104);\nNow, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, I hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of War, and the Military Commanders whom he may from time to time designate, whenever he or any designated Commander deems such action necessary or desirable, to prescribe military areas in such places and of such extent as he or the appropriate Military Commander may determine, from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may impose in his discretion. The Secretary of War is hereby authorized to provide for residents of any such area who are excluded therefrom, such transportation, food, shelter, and other accommodations as may be necessary, in the judgment of the Secretary of War or the said Military Commander, and until other arrangements are made, to accomplish the purpose of this order. The designation of military areas in any region or locality shall supersede designations of prohibited and restricted areas by the Attorney General under the Proclamations of December 7 and 8, 1941, and shall supersede the responsibility and authority of the Attorney General under the said Proclamations in respect of such prohibited and restricted areas.\nI hereby further authorize and direct the commissioner of War and the Military department Commanders to take such other steps as he or the appropriate Military personnel Commander may deem advisable to enforce compliance with the restrictions applicable to each Military area here in above authorized to be designated, including the use of Federal troops and other Federal Agencies, with authority to accept assistance of state and local agencies.\nI hereby further authorize and direct all Executive Departments, independent establishments and other Federal Agencies, to assist the Secretary of War or the said Military Commanders in carrying out this Executive Order, including the furnishing of medical aid, hospitalization, food, clothing, transportation, use of land, shelter, and other supplies, equipment, utilities, facilities, and services.\nThis order shall not be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the authority heretofore granted under Executive Order No. 8972, dated December 12, 1941, nor shall it be construed as limiting or modifying the duty and responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with respect to the investigation of alleged acts of sabotage or the duty and responsibility of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice under the Proclamations of December 7 and 8, 1941, prescribing regulations for the conduct and control of alien enemies, except as such duty and responsibility is superseded by the designation of military areas hereunder.\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\nThe White House,\nFebruary 19, 1942.\nBackground to the Order.\nOriginating from a proclamation of war that was signed on the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, December 7, 1941, and given the rising anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, Executive Order 9066 was later enacted on February 19, 1942 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to strictly regulate the actions of Japanese Americans in the United States. At this point, Japanese Americans were barred from attaining American citizenship, despite having lived in the United States for generations. This proclamation would eventually lead to strict travel restrictions in the form of curfews for all people of Japanese ancestry, regardless of citizenship status, something which uniquely applied to Japanese Americans.\nThe Order was consistent with Roosevelt's long-time racial views toward Japanese Americans. During the 1920s, for example, he had written articles in the \"Macon Telegraph\" opposing white-Japanese intermarriage for fostering \"the mingling of Asiatic blood with European or American blood\" and praising California's ban on land ownership by the first-generation Japanese. In 1936, while president he privately wrote that, in regard to contacts between Japanese sailors and the local Japanese American population in the event of war, \"every Japanese citizen or non-citizen on the Island of Oahu who meets these Japanese ships or has any connection with their officers or men should be secretly but definitely identified and his or her name placed on a special list of those who would be the first to be placed in a concentration camp.\" In addition, during the crucial period after Pearl Harbor the president had failed to speak out for the rights of Japanese Americans despite the urgings of advisors such as John Franklin Carter. During the same period, Roosevelt rejected the recommendations of Attorney General Francis Biddle and other top advisors, who opposed the incarceration of Japanese Americans.\nExclusion under the Order.\nThe text of Roosevelt's order did not use the terms \"Japanese\" or \"Japanese Americans,\" instead giving officials broad power to exclude \"any or all persons\" from a designated area. (The lack of a specific mention of Japanese or Japanese Americans also characterized Public Law 77-503, which Roosevelt signed on March 21, 1942, to enforce the order.) Nevertheless, EO 9066 was intended to be applied almost solely to persons of Japanese descent. Notably, in a 1943 letter, Attorney General Francis Biddle reminded Roosevelt that \"You signed the original Executive Order permitting the exclusions so the Army could handle the Japs. It was never intended to apply to Italians and Germans.\"\nPublic Law 77-50 was approved (after only an hour of discussion in the Senate and thirty minutes in the House) in order to provide for the enforcement of the executive order. Authored by War Department official Karl Bendetsen\u2014who would later be promoted to Director of the Wartime Civilian Control Administration and oversee the incarceration of Japanese Americans\u2014the law made violations of military orders a misdemeanor punishable by up to $5,000 in fines and one year in prison.\nUsing a broad interpretation of EO 9066, Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt issued orders declaring certain areas of the western United States as zones of exclusion under the Executive Order. In contrast to EO 9066, the text of these orders specified \"all people of Japanese ancestry.\" As a result, approximately 112,000 men, women, and children of Japanese ancestry were evicted from the West Coast of the continental United States and held in American relocation camps and other confinement sites across the country.\nRoosevelt hoped to establish concentration camps for Japanese Americans in Hawaii even after he signed Executive Order 9066. On February 26, 1942, he informed Secretary of the Navy Knox that he had \"long felt most of the Japanese should be removed from Oahu to one of the other islands.\" Nevertheless, the tremendous cost, including the diversion of ships from the front lines, as well as the quiet resistance of the local military commander General Delos Emmons, made this proposal impractical, resulting in Japanese Americans in Hawaii never being incarcerated \"en masse\". Although the Japanese-American population in Hawaii was nearly 40% of the population of the territory and Hawaii would have been first in line for a Japanese attack, only a few thousand people were temporarily detained there. This fact supported the government's eventual conclusion that the mass removal of ethnic Japanese from the West Coast was motivated by reasons other than \"military necessity.\"\nJapanese Americans and other Asians in the U.S. had suffered for decades from prejudice and racially motivated fears. Racially discriminatory laws prevented Asian Americans from owning land, voting, testifying against whites in court, and set up other restrictions. Additionally, the FBI, Office of Naval Intelligence and Military Intelligence Division had been conducting surveillance on Japanese-American communities in Hawaii and the continental U.S. from the early 1930s. In early 1941, President Roosevelt secretly commissioned a study to assess the possibility that Japanese Americans would pose a threat to U.S. security. The report, submitted one month before the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, predicted that in the event of war, \"There will be no armed uprising of Japanese\" in the United States. \"For the most part,\" the Munson Report said, \"the local Japanese are loyal to the United States or, at worst, hope that by remaining quiet they can avoid concentration camps or irresponsible mobs.\" A second investigation started in 1940, written by Naval Intelligence officer Kenneth Ringle and submitted in January 1942, likewise found no evidence of fifth column activity and urged against mass incarceration. Both were ignored by military and political leaders.\nOver two-thirds of the people of Japanese ethnicity who were incarcerated were American citizens; many of the rest had lived in the country between 20 and 40 years. As a result, most Japanese Americans, particularly the first generation born in the United States (the \"Nisei\"), identified as loyal to the United States of America. In addition, no Japanese-American citizen or Japanese national residing in the United States was ever found guilty of sabotage or espionage.\nThere were 10 of these internment camps across the United States, euphemistically called \"relocation centers\". There were two in Arkansas, two in Arizona, two in California, one in Idaho, one in Utah, one in Wyoming, and one in Colorado.\nWorld War II camps under the Order.\nSecretary of War Henry L. Stimson was responsible for assisting relocated people with transport, food, shelter, and other accommodations and delegated Colonel Karl Bendetsen to administer the removal of West Coast Japanese. Over the spring of 1942, General John L. DeWitt issued Western Defense Command orders for Japanese Americans to present themselves for removal. The \"evacuees\" were taken first to temporary assembly centers, requisitioned fairgrounds and horse racing tracks where living quarters were often converted livestock stalls. As construction on the more permanent and isolated War Relocation Authority camps was completed, the population was transferred by truck or train. These accommodations consisted of tar paper-walled frame buildings in parts of the country with bitter winters and often hot summers. The camps were guarded by armed soldiers and fenced with barbed wire (security measures not shown in published photographs of the camps). Camps held up to 18,000 people, and were small cities, with medical care, food, and education provided by the government. Adults were offered \"camp jobs\" with wages of $12 to $19 per month, and many camp services such as medical care and education were provided by the camp inmates themselves.\nNot only was there limited room for living but, \"Living in cramped barracks with minimal privacy and inadequate facilities. The camp's location in Utah's desert meant extreme temperatures and harsh weather, making daily life even more challenging.\" Based on the evidence listed, it is proven that these camps held poor living conditions for those relocated. On top of that children had to undergo education in these barracks as well as buildings for religion, all of these conditions add to the unpleasant way of life.\nOpposition.\nAccording to a poll conducted in March 1942, majorities of Americans believed that the internment of Japanese Americans, regardless of citizenship, was appropriate. Because of the widespread support for the order, public opposition to it was minimal. Still, there were efforts made by prominent individuals to either stop or mitigate the effects of the order.\nNorman Thomas, chairman of the Socialist Party of America, was a vocal critic of the order and worked to defend the rights of Japanese Americans. During the period of internment, he remained in contact with people in the camps, as well as various people and organizations involved in preserving the civil rights of Japanese Americans. In July 1942, Thomas published \"Democracy and Japanese Americans\", discussing the conditions inside the camps and the legality of the order. In late 1943, Thomas stated of the Japanese internment that \"Congress and the President have created a dangerous precedent by adopting wholesale the totalitarian theories of justice by discrimination on the basis of racial affiliation.\"\nEleanor Roosevelt, who publicly stood behind the president, expressed concern in private about the necessity of the camps. She generally advocated for a more moderate approach to interring spies, and publicly stated the laws of the United States should apply equally to all citizens, regardless of race or nationality.\nTermination, apology, and redress.\nIn 1943 and 1944, Roosevelt did not release those incarcerated in the camps despite the urgings of Attorney General Francis Biddle and Secretary of Interior Harold L. Ickes. Ickes blamed the president's failure to act on his need to win California in a potentially close election. In December 1944, Roosevelt suspended the Executive Order after the Supreme Court decision \"Ex parte Endo\". Detainees were released, often to resettlement facilities and temporary housing, and the camps were shut down by 1946.\nOn February 19, 1976, President Gerald Ford signed a proclamation formally terminating Executive Order 9066 and apologizing for the internment, stated: \"We now know what we should have known then\u2014not only was that evacuation wrong but Japanese Americans were and are loyal Americans. On the battlefield and at home the names of Japanese Americans have been and continue to be written in history for the sacrifices and the contributions they have made to the well-being and to the security of this, our common Nation.\"\nIn 1980, President Jimmy Carter signed legislation to create the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC). The CWRIC was appointed to conduct an official governmental study of Executive Order 9066, related wartime orders, and their effects on Japanese Americans in the West and Alaska Natives in the Pribilof Islands.\nIn December 1982, the CWRIC issued its findings in \"Personal Justice Denied\", concluding that the incarceration of Japanese Americans had not been justified by military necessity. The report determined that the decision to incarcerate was based on \"race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership\". The Commission recommended legislative remedies consisting of an official Government apology and redress payments of $20,000 to each of the survivors; a public education fund was set up to help ensure that this would not happen again (Pub. L.\u00a0).\nOn August 10, 1988, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, based on the CWRIC recommendations, was signed into law by Ronald Reagan. On November 21, 1989, George H. W. Bush signed an appropriation bill authorizing payments to be paid out between 1990 and 1998. In 1990, surviving internees began to receive individual redress payments and a letter of apology. This bill applied to the Japanese Americans and to members of the Aleut people inhabiting the strategic Aleutian islands in Alaska who had also been relocated.\nLife after the camps.\nIn the years after the war, the interned Japanese Americans had to rebuild their lives after having suffered heavy personal losses. United States citizens and long-time residents who had been incarcerated lost their liberties. Many also lost their homes, businesses, property, and savings. Individuals born in Japan were not allowed to become naturalized US citizens until after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which canceled the Immigration Act of 1924 and reinstated the legality of immigration from Japan into the US.\nMany Japanese Americans hoped they would be going back to their homes, but soon realized that all of their possessions that they could carry with them were seized by the government. In place of their homes, the Federal government provided trailers in some areas for returning Japanese Americans. The populous Asian American community prior to the incarceration drastically decreased as many felt there was no life to go back to, choosing to start over somewhere else. With the residual effects of being incarcerated without committing a crime, the Japanese American community experienced strong trauma and continuing racism from their fellow Americans. Though they did receive redress of $20,000 per surviving incarcerate, many Japanese Americans feared increased xenophobia and a minimizing of the trauma that the Japanese community endured during the WWII incarceration. Managing the wrongs committed to their community, Japanese Americans slowly managed to overcome their community's criminalization and incarceration and came to recognize February 19, the day President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, as a National Day of Remembrance for Americans to reflect on the events that took place.\nCourt challenges.\nKorematsu v. United States.\nAfter the signing of Executive Order 9066 in February 1942, all Japanese Americans were required to be removed from their homes and moved into military camps as a matter of national security. Fred Korematsu, 23 at the time, was someone who elected not to comply, unlike his parents who left their home and flower nursery behind. Instead, Korematsu had plastic surgery to alter the appearance of his eyes and changed his name to Clyde Sarah, claiming Spanish and Hawaiian heritage. Six months later, on May 30, Korematsu was arrested for violating the order, leading to a trial in a San Francisco Federal Court. His case was presented by the American Civil Liberties Union, which attempted to challenge whether this order was constitutional or not. After losing the case, Korematsu appealed the decision all the way to the Supreme Court, where in a 6\u20133 decision, the order remained for reason of \"military necessity.\"\nHirabayashi v. United States.\nIncluded in FDR's order was a curfew starting at 8pm and ended at 6 am for all those of Japanese descent. University of Washington student, Gordon Hirabayashi, refused to abide by the order in an act of civil disobedience, resulting in his arrest. Similar to Korematsu's case, it was appealed and up to the Supreme Court. It was held by the Supreme Court in a unanimous decision that his arrest was constitutional on the basis of military necessity. He was sentenced six months in prison as a result of his civil disobedience.\nYasui v. United States.\nEarning his JD in 1939 from the University of Oregon, Minoru Yasui was the first Japanese American attorney admitted to the state of Oregon's bar. He began working at a consulate in Chicago for the Japanese government, but resigned shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Returning to Oregon, where he was born, he tried to join the US Army but was denied. He was arrested in December 1941 for violating the military curfew, leading to his arrest and freezing of his assets. Looking to test the constitutionality of the curfew, Yasui turned himself into the police station at 11pm, five hours past the curfew. Yasui was found guilty of violating this curfew and was fined $5000 for not being a US citizen, despite being born in Oregon. He served a one-year prison sentence. Yasui appealed his case up to the Supreme Court, where it was held that the curfew was constitutional based on military necessity.\nReopening and justice.\nIn 1983, Peter Irons and Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga discovered crucial evidence that allowed for them to petition to reopen the Korematsu case. The evidence was a copy of Lieutenant Commander K.D. Ringle's original report by the US Navy, which had not been destroyed. The report was in response to the question of Japanese loyalty to the US. It was stated in the report that Japanese Americans did not truly pose a threat to the US government, showing that the passage of Executive Order 9066 was entirely based on the false pretense that Japanese Americans were \"enemy aliens.\" This new found evidence was a document that failed to be destroyed by the US government which included government intelligence agencies citing that Japanese Americans posed no military threat. The cases of Korematsu, Hirabayashi, and Yasui were reopened and overturned on the basis of government misconduct on November 10, 1983. In 2010, the state of California passed a bill that would name January 30 Fred Korematsu Day, making this the first day to be named after an Asian American. \"Korematsu v. United States\" was officially overturned in 2018.\nLegacy.\nFebruary 19, the anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066, is now the Day of Remembrance, an annual commemoration of the unjust incarceration of the Japanese-American community. In 2017, the Smithsonian launched an exhibit about these events with artwork by Roger Shimomura. It provides context and interprets the treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II. In February 2022, for the 80th anniversary of the signing of the order, supporters lobbied to pass the Amache National Historic Site Act historical designation for the Granada War Relocation Center in Colorado.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His 1893 work \"The Scream\" has become one of the most iconic and acclaimed images in all of Western art.\nHis childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania (Oslo), Munch began to live a bohemian life under the influence of the nihilist Hans J\u00e6ger, who urged him to paint his own emotional and psychological state ('soul painting'); from this emerged his distinctive style.\nTravel brought new influences and outlets. In Paris, he learned much from Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, especially their use of color. In Berlin, he met the Swedish dramatist August Strindberg, whom he painted, as he embarked on a major series of paintings he would later call \"The Frieze of Life\", depicting a series of deeply-felt themes such as love, anxiety, jealousy and betrayal, steeped in atmosphere.\n\"The Scream\" was conceived in Kristiania. According to Munch, he was out walking at sunset, when he 'heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature'. The painting's agonized face is widely identified with the \"angst\" of the modern person. Between 1893 and 1910, he made two painted versions and two in pastels, as well as a number of prints. One of the pastels would eventually command the fourth highest nominal price paid for a painting at auction.\nAs his fame and wealth grew, his emotional state remained insecure. He briefly considered marriage, but could not commit himself. A mental breakdown in 1908 forced him to give up heavy drinking, and he was cheered by his increasing acceptance by the people of Kristiania and exposure in the city's museums. His later years were spent working in peace and privacy. Although his works were banned in Nazi-occupied Europe, most of them survived World War II, securing him a legacy.\nLife.\nChildhood.\nEdvard Munch was born in a farmhouse in the village of \u00c5dalsbruk in L\u00f8ten, Norway, to Laura Catherine Bj\u00f8lstad and Christian Munch, the son of a priest. Christian was a doctor and medical officer who married Laura, a woman half his age, in 1861. Edvard had an elder sister, Johanne Sophie, and three younger siblings: Peter Andreas, Laura Catherine, and Inger Marie. Laura was artistically talented and may have encouraged Edvard and Sophie. Edvard was related to the painter Jacob Munch and the historian Peter Andreas Munch.\nThe family moved to Oslo (then called Christiania and renamed Kristiania in 1877) in 1864 when Christian Munch was appointed medical officer at Akershus Fortress. In 1868 Edvard's mother died of tuberculosis. Munch's favourite sister, Johanne Sophie, also died of tuberculosis, at the age of 15, in 1877. After their mother's death, the Munch siblings were raised by their father and by their aunt Karen. Often ill for much of the winters and kept out of school, Edvard would draw to keep himself occupied. He was tutored by his school mates and his aunt. Christian Munch also instructed his son in history and literature, and entertained the children with vivid ghost-stories and the tales of the American writer Edgar Allan Poe.\nAs Edvard remembered it, Christian's positive behavior towards his children was overshadowed by his morbid pietism. Munch wrote, \"My father was temperamentally nervous and obsessively religious\u2014to the point of psychoneurosis. From him I inherited the seeds of madness. The angels of fear, sorrow, and death stood by my side since the day I was born.\" Christian reprimanded his children by telling them that their mother was looking down from heaven and grieving over their misbehavior. The father\u2019s obsessions, Edvard's poor health, and the vivid ghost stories helped inspire his macabre visions and nightmares; he felt that death was constantly approaching. One of Munch's younger sisters, Laura, was diagnosed with mental illness at an early age. Of the five siblings, only Andreas married, but he died a few months after the wedding. Munch would later write, \"I inherited two of mankind's most frightful enemies\u2014the heritage of consumption and insanity\".\nChristian Munch's military pay was very low, and his attempts to develop a private side practice failed, keeping his family in genteel but perennial poverty. They moved frequently from one cheap flat to another. Munch's early drawings and watercolors depicted these interiors, and the individual objects, such as medicine bottles and drawing implements, plus some landscapes. By his teens, art dominated Munch's interests. At 13, Munch had his first exposure to other artists at the newly formed Art Association, where he admired the work of the Norwegian landscape school. He returned to copy the paintings, and soon he began to paint in oils.\nMental health.\nDue in part to the mental health struggles and incarceration in an institution of his sister, Laura Catherine, and in part to then-prevailing beliefs in hereditary insanity, Edvard Munch often expressed his fear that he would become insane. Critics of his art also accused him of insanity, deploying this term in a purely abusive sense. When his painting \"The Sick Child\" was first displayed in Oslo in 1886, Gustav Wentzel and other young Realists encircled Munch and accused him of being a \"madman\"; another critic Johan Scharffenberg stated that because Munch derived from an \"insane family\" his art was also \"insane.\" He is claimed by some to have had borderline personality disorder, a mental health disorder characterized by fear of abandonment, chronic feelings of emptiness, impulsive behavior, and various other symptoms. Munch also displayed alcoholism, a trait often associated with impulsivity in BPD.\nStudies and influences.\nIn 1879, Munch enrolled in a technical college to study engineering, where he excelled in physics, chemistry and mathematics. He learned scaled and perspective drawing, but frequent illnesses interrupted his studies. The following year, much to his father's disappointment, Munch left the college determined to become a painter. His father viewed art as an \"unholy trade\", and his neighbors reacted bitterly and sent him anonymous letters. In contrast to his father's rabid pietism, Munch adopted an undogmatic stance towards art. He wrote his goal in his diary: \"In my art I attempt to explain life and its meaning to myself.\"\nIn 1881, Munch enrolled at the Royal School of Art and Design of Kristiania, one of whose founders was his distant relative Jacob Munch. His teachers were the sculptor Julius Middelthun and the naturalistic painter Christian Krohg. That year, Munch demonstrated his quick absorption of his figure training at the academy in his first portraits, including one of his father and his first self-portrait. In 1883, Munch took part in his first public exhibition and shared a studio with other students. His full-length portrait of Karl Jensen-Hjell, a notorious bohemian-about-town, earned a critic's dismissive response: \"It is impressionism carried to the extreme. It is a travesty of art.\" Munch's nude paintings from this period survive only in sketches, except for \"Standing Nude\" (1887). They may have been confiscated by his father.\nImpressionism inspired Munch from a young age. During these early years, he experimented with many styles, including Naturalism and Impressionism. Some early works are reminiscent of Manet. Many of these attempts brought him unfavorable criticism from the press and garnered him constant rebukes by his father, who nonetheless provided him with small sums for living expenses. At one point, however, Munch's father, perhaps swayed by the negative opinion of Munch's cousin Edvard Diriks (an established, traditional painter), destroyed at least one painting (likely a nude) and refused to advance any more money for art supplies.\nMunch also received his father's ire for his relationship with Hans J\u00e6ger, the local nihilist who lived by the code \"a passion to destroy is also a creative passion\" and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom. Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. \"My ideas developed under the influence of the bohemians or rather under Hans J\u00e6ger. Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of Strindberg and the Germans ... but that is wrong. They had already been formed by then.\" At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of his circle. He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called \"The City of Free Love\".\nAfter numerous experiments, Munch concluded that the Impressionist idiom did not allow sufficient expression. He found it superficial and too akin to scientific experimentation. He felt a need to go deeper and explore situations brimming with emotional content and expressive energy. Under J\u00e6ger's commandment that Munch should \"write his life\", meaning that Munch should explore his own emotional and psychological state, the young artist began a period of reflection and self-examination, recording his thoughts in his \"soul's diary\". This deeper perspective helped move him to a new view of his art. He wrote that his painting \"The Sick Child\" (1886), based on his sister's death, was his first \"soul painting\", his first break from Impressionism. The painting received a negative response from critics and from his family, and caused another \"violent outburst of moral indignation\" from the community.\nOnly his friend Christian Krohg defended him:\nHe paints, or rather regards, things in a way that is different from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule \"not complete\", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.\nMunch continued to employ a variety of brushstroke techniques and color palettes throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, as he struggled to define his style. His idiom continued to veer between naturalistic, as seen in \"Portrait of Hans J\u00e6ger\", and impressionistic, as in \"Rue Lafayette\". His \"Inger on the Beach\" (1889), which caused another storm of confusion and controversy, hints at the simplified forms, heavy outlines, sharp contrasts, and emotional content of his mature style to come. He began to carefully calculate his compositions to create tension and emotion. While stylistically influenced by the Post-Impressionists, what evolved was a subject matter which was symbolist in content, depicting a state of mind rather than an external reality. In 1889, Munch presented his first one-man show of nearly all his works to date. The recognition it received led to a two-year state scholarship to study in Paris under French painter L\u00e9on Bonnat.\nMunch seems to have been an early critic of photography as an art form, and remarked that it \"will never compete with the brush and the palette, until such time as photographs can be taken in Heaven or Hell!\"\nMunch's younger sister Laura was the subject of his 1899 interior \"Melancholy: Laura\". Amanda O'Neill says of the work, \"In this heated claustrophobic scene Munch not only portrays Laura's tragedy, but his own dread of the madness he might have inherited.\"\nParis.\nMunch arrived in Paris during the festivities of the Exposition Universelle (1889) and roomed with two fellow Norwegian artists. His picture \"Morning\" (1884) was displayed at the Norwegian pavilion. He spent his mornings at Bonnat's busy studio (which included female models) and afternoons at the exhibition, galleries, and museums (where students were expected to make copies as a way of learning technique and observation). Munch recorded little enthusiasm for Bonnat's drawing lessons\u2014\"It tires and bores me\u2014it's numbing\"\u2014but enjoyed the master's commentary during museum trips.\nMunch was enthralled by the vast display of modern European art, including the works of three artists who would prove influential: Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\u2014all notable for how they used color to convey emotion. Munch was particularly inspired by Gauguin's \"reaction against realism\" and his credo that \"art was human work and not an imitation of Nature\", a belief earlier stated by Whistler. As one of his Berlin friends said later of Munch, \"he need not make his way to Tahiti to see and experience the primitive in human nature. He carries his own Tahiti within him.\" Influenced by Gauguin, as well as the etchings of German artist Max Klinger, Munch experimented with prints as a medium to create graphic versions of his works. In 1896 he created his first woodcuts\u2014a medium that proved ideal to Munch's symbolic imagery. Together with his contemporary Nikolai Astrup, Munch is considered an innovator of the woodcut medium in Norway.\nIn December 1889 his father died, leaving Munch's family destitute. He returned home and arranged a large loan from a wealthy Norwegian collector when wealthy relatives failed to help, and assumed financial responsibility for his family from then on. Christian's death depressed him and he was plagued by suicidal thoughts: \"I live with the dead\u2014my mother, my sister, my grandfather, my father...Kill yourself and then it's over. Why live?\" Munch's paintings of the following year included sketchy tavern scenes and a series of bright cityscapes in which he experimented with the pointillist style of Georges Seurat.\nBerlin.\nBy 1892, Munch had formulated his own characteristic, and original, synthetist style, as seen in \"Melancholy\" (1891), in which color is the symbol-laden element. Considered by the artist and journalist Christian Krohg as the first symbolist painting by a Norwegian artist, \"Melancholy\" was exhibited in 1891 at the Autumn Exhibition in Oslo. In 1892, Adelsteen Normann, on behalf of the Union of Berlin Artists, invited Munch to exhibit at its November exhibition, the society's first one-man exhibition. However, his paintings evoked bitter controversy (dubbed \"The Munch Affair\"), and after one week the exhibition closed. Munch was pleased with the \"great commotion\", and wrote in a letter: \"Never have I had such an amusing time\u2014it's incredible that something as innocent as painting should have created such a stir.\"\nIn Berlin, Munch became involved in an international circle of writers, artists and critics, including the Swedish dramatist and leading intellectual August Strindberg, whom he painted in 1892. He also met Danish writer and painter Holger Drachmann, whom he painted in 1898. Drachmann was 17 years Munch's senior and a drinking companion at Zum schwarzen Ferkel (At the Black Piglet) in 1893\u201394. In 1894 Drachmann wrote of Munch: \"He struggles hard. Good luck with your struggles, lonely Norwegian.\"\nDuring his four years in Berlin, Munch sketched out most of the ideas that would be comprised in his major work, \"The Frieze of Life\", first designed for book illustration but later expressed in paintings. He sold little, but made some income from charging entrance fees to view his controversial paintings. Munch began allowing the appearance of drips in his paintings, as first subtly seen in the painted version of \"At the Deathbed\" (1895). This effect resulted from the use of highly diluted paint and the deliberate inclusion of drips. Initially, this effect was visible at the edges of his work, but later, the drips became more central, as seen in \"By the Deathbed\" (1915). The effect of running paint was later adopted by many artists.\nHis other paintings, including casino scenes, show a simplification of form and detail which marked his early mature style. Munch also began to favor a shallow pictorial space and a minimal backdrop for his frontal figures. Since poses were chosen to produce the most convincing images of states of mind and psychological conditions, as in \"Ashes\", the figures impart a monumental, static quality. Munch's figures appear to play roles on a theatre stage (\"Death in the Sick-Room\"), whose pantomime of fixed postures signify various emotions; since each character embodies a single psychological dimension, as in \"The Scream\", Munch's men and women began to appear more symbolic than realistic. He wrote, \"No longer should interiors be painted, people reading and women knitting: there would be living people, breathing and feeling, suffering and loving.\"\n\"The Scream\".\n\"The Scream\" exists in four versions: two pastels (1893 and 1895) and two paintings (1893 and 1910). There are also several lithographs of \"The Scream\" (1895 and later).\nThe 1895 pastel sold at auction on 2 May 2012 for US$119,922,500, including commission. It is the most colorful of the versions and is distinctive for the downward-looking stance of one of its background figures. It is also the only version not held by a Norwegian museum.\nThe 1893 version was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo in 1994 and was recovered. The 1910 painting was stolen in 2004 from the Munch Museum in Oslo, but recovered in 2006 with limited damage.\n\"The Scream\" is Munch's most famous work, and one of the most recognizable paintings in all art. It has been widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man. Painted with broad bands of garish color and highly simplified forms, and employing a high viewpoint, it reduces the agonized figure to a garbed skull in the throes of an emotional crisis.\nWith this painting, Munch met his stated goal of \"the study of the soul, that is to say the study of my own self\". Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: \"I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature.\" He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, \"for several years I was almost mad... You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit\u2014nature was screaming in my blood... After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again.\"\nIn 2003, comparing the painting with other great works, art historian Martha Tedeschi wrote:\n\"Whistler's Mother\", Wood's \"American Gothic\", Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" and Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\" have all achieved something that most paintings\u2014regardless of their art historical importance, beauty, or monetary value\u2014have not: they communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer. These few works have successfully made the transition from the elite realm of the museum visitor to the enormous venue of popular culture.\n\"Frieze of Life \u2013 A Poem about Life, Love and Death\".\nIn December 1893, Unter den Linden in Berlin was the location of an exhibition of Munch's work, showing, among other pieces, six paintings entitled \"Study for a Series: Love\". This began a cycle he later called the \"Frieze of Life \u2013 A Poem about Life, Love and Death\". \"Frieze of Life\" motifs, such as \"The Storm\" and \"Moonlight\", are steeped in atmosphere. Other motifs illuminate the nocturnal side of love, such as \"Rose and Amelie\" and \"Love and Pain\". In \"Death in the Sickroom\", the subject is the death of his sister Sophie, which he re-worked in many future variations. The dramatic focus of the painting, portraying his entire family, is dispersed in the separate and disconnected figures of sorrow. In 1894, he enlarged the spectrum of motifs by adding \"Anxiety\", \"Ashes\", \"Madonna\" and \"Women in Three Stages\" (from innocence to old age).\nAround the start of the 20th century, Munch worked to finish the \"Frieze\". He painted a number of pictures, several of them in bigger format and to some extent featuring the Art Nouveau aesthetics of the time. He made a wooden frame with carved reliefs for the large painting \"Metabolism\" (1898), initially called \"Adam and Eve\". This work reveals Munch's pre-occupation with the \"fall of man\" and his pessimistic philosophy of love. Motifs such as \"The Empty Cross\" and \"Golgotha\" (both c.\u20091900) reflect a metaphysical orientation, and also reflect Munch's pietistic upbringing. The entire \"Frieze\" was shown for the first time at the secessionist exhibition in Berlin in 1902.\n\"The Frieze of Life\" themes recur throughout Munch's work but he especially focused on them in the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, he tapped the depths of his feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as \"The Sick Child\" (1885), \"Love and Pain\" (retitled \"Vampire\"; 1893\u201394), \"Ashes\" (1894), and \"The Bridge\". The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see \"Puberty\" and \"Love and Pain\") or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see \"Separation\", \"Jealousy\", and \"Ashes\").\nMunch often uses shadows and rings of color around his figures to emphasize an aura of fear, menace, anxiety, or sexual intensity. These paintings have been interpreted as reflections of the artist's sexual anxieties, though it could also be argued that they represent his turbulent relationship with love itself and his general pessimism regarding human existence. Many of these sketches and paintings were done in several versions, such as \"Madonna\", \"Hands\" and \"Puberty\", and also transcribed as wood-block prints and lithographs. Munch hated to part with his paintings because he thought of his work as a single body of expression. So to capitalize on his production and make some income, he turned to graphic arts to reproduce many of his paintings, including those in this series. Munch admitted to the personal goals of his work but he also offered his art to a wider purpose, \"My art is really a voluntary confession and an attempt to explain to myself my relationship with life\u2014it is, therefore, actually a sort of egoism, but I am constantly hoping that through this I can help others achieve clarity.\"\nWhile attracting strongly negative reactions, in the 1890s Munch began to receive some understanding of his artistic goals, as one critic wrote, \"With ruthless contempt for form, clarity, elegance, wholeness, and realism, he paints with intuitive strength of talent the most subtle visions of the soul.\" One of his great supporters in Berlin was Walther Rathenau, later the German foreign minister, who strongly contributed to his success.\nLandscapes and Nature.\nDespite over half of his painted works being landscapes, Munch is rarely seen as a landscape artist. However, Munch had a fixation on several elements of nature that resulted in recurrent motifs throughout his work. The shoreline and the forest are both significant settings of Munch's work. A focus on Munch's use of nature to convey emotion is the topic of \"Edvard Munch: Trembling Earth\" at the Clark Art Institute.\nParis, Berlin and Kristiania.\nIn 1896, Munch moved to Paris, where he focused on graphic representations of his \"Frieze of Life\" themes. He further developed his woodcut and lithographic technique. Munch's \"Self-Portrait with Skeleton Arm\" (1895) is done with an etching needle-and-ink method also used by Paul Klee. Munch also produced multi-colored versions of \"The Sick Child\", concerning tuberculosis, which sold well, as well as several nudes and multiple versions of \"Kiss\" (1892). In May 1896, Siegfried Bing held an exhibition of Munch's work inside Bing's Maison de l'Art Nouveau. The exhibition displayed 60 works, including \"The Kiss, The Scream, Madonna, The Sick Child, The Death Chamber, and The Day After.\" Bing's exhibition helped to introduce Munch to a French audience. Still, many of the Parisian critics still considered Munch's work \"violent and brutal\" even if his exhibitions received serious attention and good attendance. His financial situation improved considerably and, in 1897, Munch bought himself a summer house facing the fjords of Kristiania, a small fisherman's cabin built in the late 18th century, in the small town of \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand in Norway. He dubbed this home the \"Happy House\" and returned here almost every summer for the next 20 years. It was this place he missed when he was abroad and when he felt depressed and exhausted. \"To walk in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand is like walking among my paintings\u2014I get so inspired to paint when I am here\".\nIn 1897 Munch returned to Kristiania, where he also received grudging acceptance\u2014one critic wrote, \"A fair number of these pictures have been exhibited before. In my opinion these improve on acquaintance.\" In 1899, Munch began an intimate relationship with Tulla Larsen, a \"liberated\" upper-class woman. They traveled to Italy together and upon returning, Munch began another fertile period in his art, which included landscapes and his final painting in \"The Frieze of Life\" series, \"The Dance of Life\" (1899). Larsen was eager for marriage, but Munch was not. His drinking and poor health reinforced his fears, as he wrote in the third person: \"Ever since he was a child he had hated marriage. His sick and nervous home had given him the feeling that he had no right to get married.\" Munch almost gave in to Tulla, but fled from her in 1900, also turning away from her considerable fortune, and moved to Berlin. His \"Girls on the Jetty\", created in 18 different versions, demonstrated the theme of feminine youth without negative connotations. In 1902, he displayed his works thematically at the hall of the Berlin Secession, producing \"a symphonic effect\u2014it made a great stir\u2014a lot of antagonism\u2014and a lot of approval.\" The Berlin critics were beginning to appreciate Munch's work even though the public still found his work alien and strange.\nThe good press coverage gained Munch the attention of influential patrons Albert Kollman and Max Linde. He described the turn of events in his diary, \"After 20 years of struggle and misery forces of good finally come to my aid in Germany\u2014and a bright door opens up for me.\" However, despite this positive change, Munch's self-destructive and erratic behavior led him first to a violent quarrel with another artist, then to an accidental shooting in the presence of Tulla Larsen, who had returned for a brief reconciliation, which injured two of his fingers. Munch later sawed a self-portrait depicting him and Larsen in half as a consequence of the shooting and subsequent events. She finally left him and married a younger colleague of Munch. Munch took this as a betrayal, and he dwelled on the humiliation for some time to come, channeling some of the bitterness into new paintings. His paintings \"Still Life (The Murderess)\" and \"The Death of Marat I\", done in 1906\u201307, clearly reference the shooting incident and the emotional after-effects.\nIn 1903\u201304, Munch exhibited in Paris where the coming Fauvists, famous for their boldly false colors, likely saw his works and might have found inspiration in them. When the Fauves held their own exhibit in 1906, Munch was invited and displayed his works with theirs. After studying the sculpture of Rodin, Munch may have experimented with plasticine as an aid to design, but he produced little sculpture. During this time, Munch received many commissions for portraits and prints which improved his usually precarious financial condition. In 1906, he painted the screen for an Ibsen play in the small Kammerspiele Theatre located in Berlin's Deutsches Theater, in which the \"Frieze of Life\" was hung. The theatre's director Max Reinhardt later sold it; it is now in the Berlin Nationalgalerie. After an earlier period of landscapes, in 1907 he turned his attention again to human figures and situations.\nBreakdown and recovery.\nIn the autumn of 1908, Munch's anxiety, compounded by excessive drinking and brawling, had become acute. As he later wrote, \"My condition was verging on madness\u2014it was touch and go.\" Subject to hallucinations and feelings of persecution, he entered the clinic of Daniel Jacobson. The therapy Munch received for the next eight months included diet and \"electrification\" (a treatment then fashionable for nervous conditions, not to be confused with electroconvulsive therapy). Munch's stay in hospital stabilized his personality, and after returning to Norway in 1909, his work became more colorful and less pessimistic. Further brightening his mood, the general public of Kristiania finally warmed to his work, and museums began to purchase his paintings. He was made a Knight of the Royal Order of St. Olav \"for services in art\". His first American exhibit was in 1912 in New York.\nAs part of his recovery, Jacobson advised Munch to only socialize with good friends and avoid drinking in public. Munch followed this advice and in the process produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons\u2014honest portrayals devoid of flattery. He also created landscapes and scenes of people at work and play, using a new optimistic style\u2014broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black\u2014with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.\nThe outbreak of World War I found Munch with divided loyalties, as he stated, \"All my friends are German but it is France I love.\" Given his poor health history, during 1918 Munch felt himself lucky to have survived a bout of the Spanish flu, the worldwide pandemic of that year. In the 1930s, his German patrons, many Jewish, lost their fortunes and some their lives during the rise of the Nazi movement. Munch found Norwegian printers to substitute for the Germans who had been printing his graphic work.\nLater years.\nMunch spent most of his last two decades in solitude at his nearly self-sufficient estate in Ekely, at Sk\u00f8yen, Oslo. Many of his late paintings celebrate farm life, including several in which he used his work horse \"Rousseau\" as a model. Without any effort, Munch attracted a steady stream of female models, whom he painted as the subjects of numerous nude paintings. He likely had sexual relationships with some of them. Munch occasionally left his home to paint murals on commission, including those done for the Freia chocolate factory.\nTo the end of his life, Munch continued to paint unsparing self-portraits, adding to his self-searching cycle of his life and his unflinching series of takes on his emotional and physical states. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Nazis labeled Munch's work \"degenerate art\" (along with that of Picasso, Klee, Matisse, Gauguin and many other modern artists) and removed his 82 works from German museums. Adolf Hitler announced in 1937, \"For all we care, those pre-historic Stone Age culture barbarians and art-stutterers can return to the caves of their ancestors and there can apply their primitive international scratching.\"\nIn 1940, the Germans invaded Norway and the Nazi party took over the government. Munch was 76 years old. With nearly an entire collection of his art in the second floor of his house, Munch lived in fear of a Nazi confiscation. Seventy-one of the paintings previously taken by the Nazis had been returned to Norway through purchase by collectors (the other 11 were never recovered), including \"The Scream\" and \"The Sick Child\", and they too were hidden from the Nazis.\nDeath.\nOn the afternoon of 19 December 1943, a fire in an ammunition store at Filipstad triggered a series of explosions in Oslo, killing around 115 people and severely damaging 400 buildings. Munch, whose house was partially damaged by the explosions, witnessed how the resulting conflagration unusually illuminated the night sky which he captured in his painting \"Explosion\". In observing and painting the scene on a cold, wet night, the 80 year old artist succumbed to a respiratory illness, which led to his death on 23 January 1944 in his house at Ekely.\nShortly after Munch's death several men, including Fritz Jenssen, the NS-mayor of Oslo, arrived at his Ekely house to offer his family a state funeral. His family refused this offer, but to no avail - the Nazis insisted. Despite Munch's wish for a private cremation with nobody present, his funeral was hijacked by the Nazis and turned it into a propaganda opportunity.\nDuring Munch's life Nazis struggled to appropriate him as a heroic figure within the Germanic cultural sphere, but in death he became easy prey for Josef Terboven and the NS. Two days after Munch's death the NS-newspaper \"Fritt Folk\" printed an obituary poem by Knut Hamsun on the front page, and dedicated almost the entirety of page two to Munch. They made use of Munch to spread Nazi ideology, and among other things, proclaimed that \"Edvard Munch was a shooting star of the Norse race, a representative of our peoples best qualities.\" Three days after Munch's death, Vidkun Quisling could on behalf of the state, boast in the newspapers that they would be paying for Edvard Munch's funeral.\nMunch's funeral took place on 31 January 1944 in Oslo. His casket was surrounded in a well of flowers and wreaths, with two enormous wreaths decorated with swastikas placed prominently on either side of his casket. These wreathes were personally signed by Terboven, Quisling, and the NS leader for Public Information and Propaganda Georg Wilhelm M\u00fcller. Between the coverage of Edvard Munch's death in newspapers and his Nazi-orchestrated state funeral, the Nazis were successful in creating the impression that Munch supported Nazi ideologies and methods. This led many Norwegians to question whether or not Munch harboured Nazi sympathies.\nThe city of Oslo bought Edvard Munch's Ekely estate from his heirs in 1946; the house was demolished in May 1960.\nLegacy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;From my rotting body,\nflowers shall grow\nand I am in them\nand that is eternity.&lt;/poem&gt;\nEdvard Munch\nWhen Munch died, his remaining works were bequeathed to the city of Oslo, which built the Munch Museum at T\u00f8yen (it opened in 1963). The museum holds a collection of approximately 1,100 paintings, 4,500 drawings, and 18,000 prints, the broadest collection of his works in the world. The Munch Museum serves as Munch's official estate; it has been active in responding to copyright infringements as well as clearing copyright for the work, such as the appearance of Munch's \"The Scream\" in a 2006 M&amp;M's advertising campaign. The U.S. copyright representative for the Munch Museum and the Estate of Edvard Munch is the Artists Rights Society.\nMunch's art was highly personalized and he did little teaching. His \"private\" symbolism was far more personal than that of other Symbolist painters such as Gustave Moreau and James Ensor. Munch was still highly influential, particularly with the German Expressionists, who followed his philosophy, \"I do not believe in the art which is not the compulsive result of Man's urge to open his heart.\" Many of his paintings, including \"The Scream\", have universal appeal in addition to their highly personal meaning.\nMunch's works are now represented in numerous major museums and galleries in Norway and abroad. His cabin, \"the Happy House\", was given to the municipality of \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand in 1944; it serves as a small Munch Museum. The inventory has been maintained exactly as he left it.\nOne version of \"The Scream\" was stolen from the National Gallery in 1994. In 2004, another version of \"The Scream\", along with one of \"Madonna\", was stolen from the Munch Museum in a daring daylight robbery. These were all eventually recovered, but the paintings stolen in the 2004 robbery were extensively damaged. They have been meticulously restored and are on display again. Three Munch works were stolen from the Hotel Refsnes Gods in 2005; they were shortly recovered, although one of the works was damaged during the robbery.\nIn October 2006, the color woodcut of Munch's mofif, \"Two Human Beings. The Lonely Ones\" (\"To mennesker. De ensomme\"), set a new record for his prints when it was sold at an auction in Oslo for 8.1\u00a0million kroner (US$1.27\u00a0million ). It also set a record for the highest price paid in auction in Norway. On 3 November 2008, the painting \"Vampire\" set a new record for his paintings when it was sold for US$38,162,000 () at Sotheby's New York.\nMunch's image appeared on the Norwegian 1,000-kroner note (Series VII; valid from 2001 to 2020), along with pictures inspired by his artwork.\nFrom July 31 - November 28, 2010, the National Gallery of Art exhibited Munch\u2019s prints in \"Edvard Munch: Master Prints\". The catalog was edited by Elizabeth Prelinger \nIn February 2012, a major Munch exhibition, \"Edvard Munch. The Modern Eye\", opened at the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt; the exhibition was opened by Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway.\nIn May 2012, \"The Scream\" sold for US$119.9\u00a0million (), and is the second most expensive artwork ever sold at an open auction. (It was surpassed in November 2013 by \"Three Studies of Lucian Freud\", which sold for US$142.4\u00a0million).\nIn 2013, four of Munch's paintings were depicted in a series of stamps by the Norwegian postal service, to commemorate in 2014 the 150th anniversary of his birth.\nFrom May 19 - August 11, 2013, the National Gallery of Art exhibited \"Edvard Munch: A 150th Anniversary Tribute\".\nIn 2016 the Neue Galerie, New York City, hosted the exhibition, \"Munch and Expressionism\", which \u201c\u2026examined Edvard Munch\u2019s influence on his German and Austrian contemporaries.\u201d\nOn 14 November 2016 a version of Munch's \"The Girls on the Bridge\" sold for US$54.5\u00a0million () at Sotheby's, New York, making it the second highest price achieved for one of his paintings.\nIn 2017, \"Edvard Munch: Between the Clock and the Bed\", was an exhibition of Munch\u2019s work created over his career, including 16 self-portraits.\u00a0 It was organized by San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (exhibited June 24\u2013October 9, 2017), The Met Breuer, New York (exhibited November 15, 2017 \u2013 February 4, 2018), and the Munch Museum, Oslo (exhibit May 12\u2013September 9, 2018).\u00a0 The catalog of the same name was edited by Gary Garrels, Jon-Ove Steihaug and Sheena Wagstaff. \u00a0\nFrom September 3, 2017 - January 28, 2018, the National Gallery of Art exhibited Munch\u2019s prints in \u201c\"Edvard Munch: Color in Context\".\u201d\nIn April 2019 the British Museum hosted the exhibition, \"Edvard Munch: Love and Angst\", comprising 83 artworks and including a rare original print of \"The Scream\".\nIn May 2022 the Courtauld Gallery hosted the exhibition, \"Edvard Munch. Masterpieces from Bergen\", showcasing 18 paintings from Norwegian industrialist Rasmus Meyer's collection.\nIn June 2023 the Clark Art Institute hosted the exhibition \"Edvard Munch: Trembling Earth\". It was the first exhibit in the United States to focus on how Munch used nature to convey deeper meaning in his painting. \"Trembling Earth\" featured more than 75 works, many from the Munch Museum's collection, and over 40 paintings and prints from rarely seen private collections.\nIn September 2023, the Berlinische Galerie Museum for Modern Art hosted an exhibition \"Edvard Munch. Magic of the North\" in collaboration with the Munch Museum. The exhibition included around 80 works by Edvard Munch, supplemented by works by other artists who shaped the idea of the north and the modern art scene on the Spree in Berlin at the end of the 19th century.\nIn November 2023, the Museum Barberini in Potsdam also hosted an exhibition \"Edvard Munch: Trembling Earth\" in collaboration with the Munch Museum. The exhibition overlapped the Berlinische Galerie exhibition by eight weeks; both exhibitions were under the joint patronage of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and His Majesty King Harald V of Norway. The exhibition included more than 110 loans from other institutions.\nIn 2024, the Yale University Art Gallery hosted \"Munch and Kirchner: Anxiety and Expression\" which examined the prints of both artists and \u201c\u2026how these artists suffered from\u2014and attempted to cope with\u2014the anxieties of their age.\u201d\u00a0 The exhibit was accompanied by Freyda Spira, with contributions from Allison Morehead, Catherine Woodard, and Nelson Blitz \nIn May 2025, Harvard Art Museum hosted \"Edvard Munch: Technically Speaking\". The exhibition features both paintings and prints, many donated by Philip A. and Lynn G. Strauss. As a s result of their gift, Harvard's collection is the largest collection of Munch's works in the United States.\nUniversity Aula.\nIn 1911 the final competition for the decoration of the large walls of the University of Oslo Aula (assembly hall) was held between Munch and Emanuel Vigeland. The episode is known as the \"Aula controversy\". In 1914 Munch was finally commissioned to decorate the Aula and the work was completed in 1916. This major work in Norwegian monumental painting includes 11 paintings covering . \"The Sun\", \"History\" and \"Alma Mater\" are the key works in this sequence. Munch declared: \"I wanted the decorations to form a complete and independent world of ideas, and I wanted their visual expression to be both distinctively Norwegian and universally human\". In 2014 it was suggested that the Aula paintings have a value of at least 500\u00a0million kroner (approx $111 million USD in 2025).\nLooted art controversies.\nIn 2007, Munch's \"Summer Night at the Beach\" was returned to the granddaughter of Alma Mahler, who was forced to flee the Nazis with her Jewish husband in March 1938, after Hitler's annexation of Austria. In 2008 the Basel Fine Arts Museum rejected a claim for Munch's \"Madonna, a\" lithograph of a nude in black, red and blue\",\" from the heirs of the Jewish collector Curt Glaser. In 2012 Berlin's Kupferstichkabinett restituted three drawings by Munch to the heirs of Glaser, a Jewish collector forced into exile by the Nazis. In 2012, a claim for \"The Scream\" from the heirs of Hugo Simon was rejected as it went to auction. In 2023 Munch's \"Dance on the Beach\" was the object of an accord between the Glaser heirs and the heirs of Thomas Olsen, a Norwegian shipowner and Munch's neighbour and collector.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9781", "revid": "1126265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9781", "title": "Extended Industry Standard Architecture", "text": "Bus standard for IBM PC compatible computers\nThe Extended Industry Standard Architecture (frequently known by the acronym EISA and pronounced \"eee-suh\") is a bus standard for IBM PC compatible computers. It was announced in September 1988 by a consortium of PC clone vendors (the \"Gang of Nine\") as an alternative to IBM's proprietary Micro Channel architecture (MCA) in its PS/2 series.\nIn comparison with the AT bus, which the \"Gang of Nine\" retroactively renamed to the ISA bus to avoid infringing IBM's trademark on its PC/AT computer, EISA is extended to 32 bits and allows more than one CPU to share the bus. The bus mastering support is also enhanced to provide access to 4\u00a0GB of memory. Unlike MCA, EISA can accept older ISA cards \u2013 the lines and slots for EISA are a superset of ISA.\nEISA was much favoured by manufacturers due to the proprietary nature of MCA, and even IBM produced some machines supporting it. It was somewhat expensive to implement (though not as much as MCA), so it never became particularly popular in desktop PCs. However, it was reasonably successful in the server market, as it was better suited to bandwidth-intensive tasks such as disk access or networking. Most EISA cards produced were either SCSI or NIC cards. EISA was also available on some non-IBM-compatible machines such as the DEC AlphaServer, , SGI Indigo2 and MIPS Magnum.\nBy the time there was a strong market need for a bus of these speeds and capabilities for desktop computers, the VESA Local Bus and later PCI filled this niche, and EISA vanished into obscurity.\nHistory.\nThe original IBM PC included five 8-bit slots, running at the system clock speed of 4.77\u00a0MHz. The PC/AT, introduced in 1984, had three 8-bit slots and five 16-bit slots, all running at the system clock speed of 6\u00a0MHz in the earlier models and 8\u00a0MHz in the last version of the computer. The 16-bit slots were a superset of the 8-bit configuration, so \"most\" 8-bit cards were able to plug into a 16-bit slot (some cards used a \"skirt\" design that physically interfered with the extended portion of the slot) and continue to run in 8-bit mode. One of the key reasons for the success of the IBM PC (and the PC clones that followed it) was the active ecosystem of third-party expansion cards available for the machines. IBM was restricted from patenting the bus and widely published the bus specifications.\nAs the PC-clone industry continued to build momentum in the mid- to late-1980s, several problems with the bus began to be apparent. First, because the \"AT slot\" (as it was known at the time) was not managed by any central standards group, there was nothing to prevent a manufacturer from \"pushing\" the standard. One of the most common issues was that as PC clones became more common, PC manufacturers began increasing the processor speed to maintain a competitive advantage. Unfortunately, because the ISA bus was originally locked to the processor clock, this meant that some 286 machines had ISA buses that ran at 10, 12, or even 16\u00a0MHz. In fact, the first systems to clock the ISA bus at 8\u00a0MHz were the turbo Intel 8088 clones that clocked the processors at 8\u00a0MHz. This caused many issues with incompatibility, where a true IBM-compatible third-party card (designed for an 8\u00a0MHz or 4.77\u00a0MHz bus) might not work reliably or at all in a higher-clocked system. Most PC makers eventually decoupled the bus clock from the system clock, but there was still no standards body to \"police\" the industry.\nAs companies like Dell modified the AT bus design, Phoenix Technologies in 1986 proposed a 32-bit extension to the AT bus in 1986, but leading clone vendor Compaq refused to cooperate. The AT architecture was so well entrenched that no single clone manufacturer had the leverage to create a standardized alternative, and there was no compelling reason for them to cooperate on a new standard. Because of this, when the first 386-based system (the Compaq Deskpro 386) was sold in 1986, it still supported 16-bit slots. Other 386 PCs followed suit, and the AT (later ISA) bus remained a part of most systems even into the late 1990s.\nMeanwhile, IBM began to worry that it was losing control of the industry it had created. In 1987, IBM released the PS/2 line of computers, most of which included the MCA bus. MCA included numerous enhancements over the 16-bit AT bus, including bus mastering, burst mode, software-configurable resources, and 32-bit capabilities. However, in an effort to reassert its dominant role, IBM patented the bus and placed stringent licensing and royalty policies on its use. A few manufacturers did produce licensed MCA machines (most notably, NCR), but overall the industry balked at IBM's restrictions.\nSteve Gibson proposed that clone makers adopt NuBus. After first stating that the AT bus was sufficient for customers, a group of companies led by Compaq (the \"Gang of Nine\") developed a new bus instead. This new bus was named the Extended (or Enhanced) Industry Standard Architecture, or \"EISA\", while the older AT bus had already been renamed Industry Standard Architecture, or \"ISA\". This provided virtually all of the technical advantages of MCA, while remaining compatible with existing 8-bit and 16-bit cards, and (most enticing to system and card makers) minimal licensing cost.\nCompaq developed EISA and persuaded others in the \"Gang of Nine\" to support it by licensing the technology for free. Just before announcing EISA, Compaq declined a last-minute offer by IBM to receive exclusive cooperation on MCA in return for abandoning EISA. \nThe EISA bus slot is a two-level staggered pin system, with the upper part of the slot corresponding to the standard ISA bus pin layout. The additional features of the EISA bus are implemented on the lower part of the slot connector, using thin traces inserted into the insulating gap of the upper / ISA card card edge connector. Additionally, the lower part of the bus has five keying notches, so an ISA card with unusually long traces cannot accidentally extend down into the lower part of the slot.\nOne of the benefits to come out of the EISA standard was a final codification of the standard to which ISA slots and cards should be held (in particular, clock speed was fixed at an industry standard of 8.33\u00a0MHz). Thus, even systems that didn't use the EISA bus gained the advantage of having the ISA standardized, which contributed to its longevity.\nThe Gang of Nine.\nThe Gang of Nine was the informal name given to the consortium of personal computer manufacturing companies, led by Compaq, that announced the EISA bus. The nine companies together had more than 33% market share for all PCs in 1987, compared to IBM's 27%. The \"Gang of Nine\" had an even larger share of the market for 80386-based computers, with 43% compared to IBM's 16%. Compaq was among the first clone makers after the IBM PC's debut in 1981, and had 28% of the 80386 market. Rival members generally acknowledged Compaq's leadership, with one stating in 1989 that within the \"Gang of Nine\" \"when you have 10 people sit down before a table to write a letter to the president, someone has to write the letter. Compaq is sitting down at the typewriter\". The members were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTechnical data.\nAlthough the MCA bus had a slight performance advantage over EISA (bus speed of 10\u00a0MHz, compared to 8.33\u00a0MHz), EISA contained almost all of the technological benefits that MCA boasted, including bus mastering, burst mode, software-configurable resources, and 32-bit data/address buses. These brought EISA nearly to par with MCA from a performance standpoint, and EISA easily defeated MCA in industry support.\nEISA replaced the tedious jumper configuration common with ISA cards with software-based configuration. Every EISA system shipped with an EISA configuration utility; this was usually a slightly customized version of the standard utilities written by the EISA chipset makers. The user would boot into this utility, either from floppy disk or on a dedicated hard-drive partition. The utility software would detect all EISA cards in the system and could configure any hardware resources (interrupts, memory ports, etc.) on any EISA card (each EISA card would include a disk with information that described the available options on the card) or on the EISA system motherboard. The user could also enter information about ISA cards in the system, allowing the utility to automatically reconfigure EISA cards to avoid resource conflicts.\nThe EISA had support for plug and play with special manufacturer drivers; however it was not widely used on desktop PCs.\nThe EISA had support for interrupt sharing, as well as 32-bit DMA.\nSimilarly, Windows 95, with its Plug-and-Play capability, was not able to change the configuration of EISA cards, but it could detect the cards, read their configuration, and reconfigure Plug-and-Play hardware to avoid resource conflicts. Windows 95 would also automatically attempt to install appropriate drivers for detected EISA cards.\nIndustry acceptance.\nIntel introduced its first EISA chipset (and also their first chipset in the modern sense of the word) as the 82350 in September 1989. Intel introduced a lower-cost variant as the 82350DT, announced in April 1991; it began shipping in June of that year.\nThe first EISA computer announced was the HP Vectra 486 in October 1989. The first EISA computers to hit the market were the Compaq Deskpro 486 and the SystemPro. The SystemPro, being one of the first PC-style systems designed as a network server, was built from the ground up to take full advantage of the EISA bus. It included such features as multiprocessing, hardware RAID, and bus-mastering network cards.\nOlivetti included EISA in its Olivetti NetStrada 7000 (CONDOR) product which embraced multiple bus architectures, its Adaptec RAID Controller occupied an EISA slot that could be accessed by up to 4 of its Pentium Pro 200 CPUs concurrently. \nAfter not making it clear for its first year that the company would license Micro Channel at all, IBM had lost market share because of slow PS/2 sales and customers' reluctance to use MCA. It debuted the AT bus-based PS/2 Model 30 286 in Manhattan at the same time as the EISA announcement elsewhere in the city, 17 months after telling customers that the AT bus was obsolete. Resentment of IBM's behavior contributed to the EISA coalition's formation.\nThe Gang of Nine's success with EISA was nonetheless uncertain. Some customers wished that a 32-bit bus had been available years earlier, and thought that IBM's rivals should now adopt MCA, for which almost 400 expansion cards were available by the time that EISA was introduced. Dell was a notable clone maker that did not join the Gang of Nine. A small number of other manufacturers, including Apricot, Dell, Research Machines, Tandy Corporation, and Olivetti adopted MCA, but only for part of their PC range. NCR Corporation adopted Micro Channel comprehensively - they designed and built high-performance personal computer, workstation and server platforms supporting it, including their own Micro Channel architecture-based logic componentry, including SCSI, graphics, networking, and audio.\nMany manufacturers, including those in the Gang of Nine, researched the possibility of using MCA. For example, Compaq actually produced prototype DeskPro systems using the bus. However, these were never put into production, and when it was clear that MCA had lost, Compaq allowed its MCA license to expire (the license actually cost relatively little; the primary costs associated with MCA, and at which the industry revolted, were royalties to be paid per system shipped).\nOn the other hand, when it became clear to IBM that Micro Channel was dying, IBM actually licensed EISA for use in a few server systems. As a final jab at their competitor, Compaq (leader of the EISA consortium) didn't cash the first check sent by IBM for the EISA license. Instead, the check was framed and put on display in the company museum at Compaq's main campus in Houston, Texas.\nEISA itself did not last a decade, being eventually superseded by PCI. However, EISA's legacy was the backwards-compatible standard that ensured that existing software and peripherals would continue to be compatible, as opposed to IBM's MCA bus which would have made these all obsolete. This backwards-compatibility trend for other technological achievements made possible the PC boom of the 1990s, followed by the worldwide adoption of the Internet, and eventually mobile computing in smartphones and tablets.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1999 it was licensed to Living Room Games, which produced the \"Second Edition\". It was licensed to RedBrick in 2003, who released the Classic Edition in 2005 and the game's Third Edition in 2009 (the latter through Mongoose Publishing's Flaming Cobra imprint). The license is now held by FASA Games, Inc. (from FASA), who have released the Fourth Edition, with updated mechanics and an advanced metaplot timeline. Vagrant Workshop released the \"Age of Legend\" edition in 2016 using alternative rules-lite mechanics.\nThe game is similar to fantasy games like \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", but draws more inspiration from games like \"RuneQuest\". The rules of the game are tightly bound to the underlying magical metaphysics, with the goal of creating a rich, logical fantasy world. Like many role-playing games from the nineties, \"Earthdawn\" focuses much of its detail on its setting, a province called Barsaive. It was also originally written as a prequel to \"Shadowrun\", mirroring its setting of returning magic with one where magic has just recently dropped from its peak. However, after \"Shadowrun\" was licensed out to a different publisher, the ties between the two were deliberately severed.\nHistory.\nBetween 1993 and 1999, FASA released over 20 gaming supplements for \"Earthdawn\", and several novels and short-story anthologies. In late 1999, FASA granted Living Room Games a licensing agreement to produce new material for the game.\nThe second edition did not alter the setting, though it did update the timeline to include events that took place in Barsaive. There were a few changes to the rules in the second edition; some classes were slightly different or altered abilities from the original. The changes were meant to allow for more rounded characters and better balance of play. Living Room Games' last publication was in 2005 and they no longer have an \"Earthdawn\" license.\nIn 2003 a license was granted to RedBrick, who released the original FASA books in PDF form, and developed their own edition based on the FASA products. They published the \"Earthdawn Classic Player's Compendium\" and the \"Earthdawn Classic Gamemaster's Compendium\" which are compatible with the original FASA publications. Each book has 524 pages and summarizes much of what FASA published; game mechanics, setting, narrations, and stories. Errata was incorporated into the text and provided rules clarifications.\nWhile RedBrick tried to remain faithful to FASA's vision and visual style, they revised almost everything and introduced new material to fill the gaps. RedBrick published new \"Earthdawn\" novels in 2007. In 2009, RedBrick announced the third edition of the game, and published it through Mongoose Publishing's Flaming Cobra imprint. The first two books were released in July 2009. In 2012, RedBrick announced the return of the \"Earthdawn\" license to FASA Games, Inc.\nIn 2014, FASA announced the Earthdawn fourth edition and launched a successful Kickstarter to support the project. The fourth edition is described as a reworking of the game mechanics, with redundancies eliminated, and a simpler success level system. The game world is advanced five years, past the end of the Barsaive-Thera War. The first Fourth Edition title\u2014the Player's Guide\u2014was released in early 2015. In 2014, FASA gave permission for Impact Miniatures to return the original Heartbreaker Hobbies &amp; Games Official Earthdawn Miniatures range to production. In order to fund this, Impact Miniatures launched a successful Kickstarter project.\nIn 2016, Vagrant Workshop released the \"Age of Legend\" edition using a permutation of the rules-lite mechanics of the \"Freeform Universal\" RPG system. With its rules-lite mechanics the \"Age of Legend\" edition is marketed as being \"ideal for one-shots, convention games, and introductory games \u2014 even for kids!\"\nSetting.\nIn Barsaive, magic, like many things in nature, goes through cycles. As the magic level rises, it allows alien creatures called Horrors to cross from their distant, otherworldly dimension into our own. The Horrors come in an almost infinite variety\u2014from simple eating machines that devour all they encounter, to incredibly intelligent and cunning foes that feed off the negative emotions they inspire in their prey.\nIn the distant past of \"Earthdawn\"'s setting, an elf scholar discovered that the time of the Horrors was approaching, and founded the Eternal Library in order to discover a way to defeat them \u2014 or at the very least, survive them. The community that grew up around the library developed wards and protections against the Horrors, which they traded to other lands and eventually became the powerful Theran Empire, an extremely magically advanced civilization and the main antagonist of the \"Earthdawn\" setting.\nThe peoples of the world built kaers, underground towns and cities, which they sealed with the Theran wards to wait out the time of the Horrors, which was called the Scourge. Theran wizards and politicians warned many of the outlying nations around Thera of the coming of the Horrors, offering the protection of the kaers to those who would pledge their loyalty to the Empire. Most of these nations agreed at first though some became unwilling to fulfill their end of the bargain after the end of the Scourge, wanting to have nothing to do with the bureaucratic nation run on political conflict and powered by slavery. After four hundred years of hiding, the Scourge ended, and the people emerged to a world changed by the Horrors. The player characters explore this new world, discovering lost secrets of the past, and fighting Horrors that remain.\nThe primary setting of Earthdawn is Barsaive, a former province of the Theran Empire. Barsaive is a region of city-states, independent from the Therans since the dwarven Kingdom of Throal led a rebellion against their former overlords. The Theran presence in Barsaive has been limited to a small part of south-western Barsaive, located around the magical fortress of Sky Point and the city of Vivane.\nThe setting of Earthdawn is the same world as \"Shadowrun\" (i.e. a fictionalized version of Earth), but takes place millennia earlier. The map of Barsaive and its neighboring regions established that most of the game takes place where Ukraine and Russia are in our world. However, the topography other than coastlines and major rivers is quite different, and the only apparent reference to the real world besides the map may be the Blood Wood, known as \"Wyrm Wood\" before the Scourge and similar in location and extent to the Chernobyl (Ukrainian for \"wormwood\") zone of alienation. Note should be made that game world links between \"Earthdawn\" and \"Shadowrun\" were deliberately broken by the publisher when the \"Shadowrun\" property was licensed out, in order to avoid the necessity for coordination between publishing companies. FASA has announced since then, that there are no plans to return \"Shadowrun\" to in-house publication, nor to restore the links between the game worlds.\nThree Earthdawn supplements cover territories outside Barsaive. \"The Theran Empire\" book (First Edition) covers the Theran Empire and its provinces (which roughly correspond to the territories of the Roman Empire, plus colonies in America and India). \"Cathay: The Five Kingdoms\" (Third Edition) covers the lands of Cathay (Far East).\"Vasgothia\" (Fourth Edition) covers the Theran Province in more detail than originally presented in First Edition (Germany). \nRaces.\nKnown as Namegivers, the setting of \"Earthdawn\" features several fantasy races for characters and NPCs:\nGame mechanics.\n\"Earthdawn\" has a unique approach to skill tests. Players wanting to perform an action determine their level or \"step\" for the skill, talent, or ability to be used. This step can then be looked up in a list of dice to be thrown; it is the next-highest integer of the average roll of the dice(s) in question. For example, two six-sided dice will on average yield a result of 7 (due to the bonus dice mechanic it is 8.4, thus the step number 8 means that 2d6 will be rolled. The consequence is that each such dice roll has a 50% chance of yielding a result at least as high as the corresponding step number.\nThe result of each die is added (dice which reach their maximum value are thrown again, adding each maximum to the tally, along with the final result below maximum) and compared to a value decided by the game master/storyteller according to the difficulty of the task. This approach means it is always technically possible to succeed with a low step number, yet leaves room for failure on high step numbers. This will sometimes make combat last longer than in other games. As per the above, the difficulty value where the odds of success are perfectly even is identical to the step number.\nThe third edition changed this by removing d4s and d20s from the system. Steps 6 through 12 (as listed above) form the basis of a 7-Step cycle. To add 7 Steps from then on, simply add 1d12.\nThe fourth edition change this by making Steps 8 through 18 form the basis of an 11-Step cycle. To form Steps 19\u201329, add 1d20. To form Steps 30\u201341, add 2d20, and so on.\nThe \"Age of Legend\" edition departed from the Step System mechanics of previous Earthdawn editions and instead uses a permutation of the rules-lite mechanics of the \"Freeform Universal\" RPG system by Nathan Russell. In the \"Age of Legend\" permutation a six-sided die (\"d6\") is used with \"\"but...\" and \"and...\" situational modifiers added to four of the six die faces, and conditionally up to six additional Fudge dice of two differing colors which can alter the initial result of the main d6 die. (Alternatively, the \"Age of Legend\" edition can be played with just seven standard d6 dice, ideally of three differing colors.) Dice rolls in the \"Age of Legend\" edition answer closed yes\u2013no questions, with the default question being \"Do you get what you want?\" subsequent to a character's attempt to elicit a desired outcome.\nReception.\nStewart Wieck reviewed \"Earthdawn\" in \"White Wolf\" #37 (July/Aug. 1993), rating it a 3 out of 5 and stated that \"Earthdawn\" is a solid game, but the 'innovations' seem like unnecessary complications. The world is fun, but not fresh. This is not the fantasy game to leave your current campaign for unless you want to bank on the ever-fulfilled FASA promise - an extensive line of support material, much of which will be very good and will undoubtedly add a lot to the game.\"\nChris W. McCubbin reviewed \"Earthdawn\" in \"Pyramid\" #3 (Sept./Oct. 1993), and stated that \"Although it never becomes bogged down in cliches and avoids outmoded concepts, \"Earthdawn\" is, at heart, a very traditional heroic fantasy RPG.\"\nIn the February 1994 edition of \"Dragon\" (Issue 202), Rick Swan liked the high production values \"highlighted by striking illustrations and FASA\u2019s usual state-of-the-art graphics\", and found that \"Thanks to clear writing and sensible organization... it's an easy read.\" But Swan also found the game setting insubstantial compared to others. \"Despite workable rules and a clever setting, \"Earthdawn\" is more frosting than cake, with little of substance to distinguish it from the competition.\" Nevertheless, he found himself drawn to the game. \"In a greasy pizza, let\u2019s-not-take-this-too-seriously kind of way, \"Earthdawn\" holds its own.\"\nIn a 1996 reader poll conducted by \"Arcane\" magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, \"Earthdawn\" was ranked 24th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \"Very good indeed. \"Earthdawn\" combined traditional fantasy with \"Call of Cthulhu\"-style horror and a detailed background to create an evocative and interesting setting. Combined with a clear, well-designed rules system and an impressive range of supporting supplements and adventures, this is an excellent fantasy game. It's also of special interest to fans of \"Shadowrun\", because it describes the past of the same gameworld.\"\nIn 1999 \"Pyramid\" magazine named \"Earthdawn\" as one of \"The Millennium's Most Underrated Games\". Editor Scott Haring noted (referring to the FASA edition) that \"\"Earthdawn\" had an original, inventive magic system (no mean trick given the hundreds of fantasy RPGs that came before), and a game world that gave you the classic \"monsters and dungeons\" sort of RPG experience, but made sense doing it.\"\nIn Issue 12 of the Australian game magazine \"Australian Realms\", Malcolm Adler thought the rules would satisfy both new and experienced players: \"The rules are written in a simple enough form and with plenty of examples so that a new gamer should not get lost. For more experienced gamers there is enough depth in the system to keep the average player happy.\" Adler liked the ability of gamemasters to go in new directions, saying, \"One of the biggest positives on Earthdawn's side is the continual encouragement to do with it what you will.\" Adler concluded, \"My opinion is that the game is going to be big. I suspect the second biggest RPG in the market is about to arrive. Consequently you owe it to yourself to check it out when it becomes available in August. Give it a good look over and then make your own judgement.\"\nIn his 2023 book \"Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground\", RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, \"In a fantasy world, one of the most difficult tasks is conveying that sense of the fantastic. The design of \"Earthdawn\", through its careful presentation in both art and text, gives players the necessary details to bring to life a world of wonders as easily as they might conjure a game set in the real world. Once there, players can go forth and forge their own legends.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Technical standards for EDI exist to facilitate parties transacting such instruments without having to make special arrangements. \nEDI has existed at least since the early 1970s, and there are many EDI standards (including X12, EDIFACT, ODETTE, etc.), some of which address the needs of specific industries or regions. It also refers specifically to a family of standards. In 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology defined electronic data interchange as \"the computer-to-computer interchange of a standardized format for data exchange. EDI implies a sequence of messages between two parties, either of whom may serve as originator or recipient. The formatted data representing the documents may be transmitted from originator to recipient via telecommunications or physically transported on electronic storage media.\" It distinguished mere electronic communication or data exchange, specifying that \"in EDI, the usual processing of received messages is by computer only. Human intervention in the processing of a received message is typically intended only for error conditions, for quality review, and for special situations. For example, the transmission of binary or textual data is not EDI as defined here unless the data are treated as one or more data elements of an EDI message and are not normally intended for human interpretation as part of online data processing.\" In short, EDI can be defined as the transfer of structured data, by agreed message standards, from one computer system to another without human intervention.\nHistory.\nLike many other early information technologies, EDI was inspired by developments in military logistics. The complexity of the 1948 Berlin airlift required the development of concepts and methods to exchange, sometimes over a 300 baud teletype modem, vast quantities of data and information about transported goods. These initial concepts later shaped the first TDCC (Transportation Data Coordinating Committee) standards in the US. Among the first integrated systems using EDI were Freight Control Systems. One such real-time system was the London Airport Cargo EDP Scheme (LACES) at Heathrow Airport, London, UK, in 1971. Implementing the direct trader input (DTI) method, it allowed forwarding agents to enter information directly into the customs processing system, reducing the time for clearance. The increase of maritime traffic and problems at customs similar to those experienced at Heathrow Airport led to the implementation of DTI systems in individual ports or groups of ports in the 1980s.\nStandards.\nEDI provides a technical basis for automated commercial \"conversations\" between two entities, either internal or external. The term EDI encompasses the entire electronic data interchange process, including the transmission, message flow, document format, and software used to interpret the documents. However, EDI standards describe the rigorous format of electronic documents, and the EDI standards were designed, initially in the automotive industry, to be independent of communication and software technologies.\nEDI documents generally contain the same information that would normally be found in a paper document used for the same organizational function. For example, an EDI 940 ship-from-warehouse order is used by a manufacturer to tell a warehouse to ship a product to a retailer. It typically has a 'ship-to' address, a 'bill-to' address, and a list of product numbers (usually a UPC) and quantities. Another example is the set of messages between sellers and buyers, such as request for quotation (RFQ), bid in response to RFQ, purchase order, purchase order acknowledgement, shipping notice, receiving advice, invoice, and payment advice. However, EDI is not confined to just business data related to trade but encompasses all fields such as medicine (e.g., patient records and laboratory results), transport (e.g., container and modal information), engineering and construction, etc. In some cases, EDI will be used to create a new business information flow (that was not a paper flow before). This is the case in the Advanced Shipment Notification (ASN) which was designed to inform the receiver of a shipment, the goods to be received and how the goods are packaged. This is further complemented with the shipment's use of the shipping labels containing a GS1-128 barcode referencing the shipment's tracking number.\nSome major sets of EDI standards:\nMany of these standards first appeared in the early to mid-1980s. The standards prescribe the formats, character sets, and data elements used in the exchange of business documents and forms. The complete X12 Document List includes all major business documents, including purchase orders and invoices.\nThe EDI standard prescribes mandatory and optional information for a particular document and gives the rules for the structure of the document. The standards are like building codes. Just as two kitchens can be built \"to code\" but look completely different, two EDI documents can follow the same standard and contain different sets of information. For example, a food company may indicate a product's expiration date while a clothing manufacturer would choose to send colour and size information.\nTransmission protocols.\nEDI can be transmitted using any methodology agreed to by the sender and recipient, but as more trading partners began using the Internet for transmission, standardized protocols have emerged.\nThis includes various technologies such as:\nWhen some people compared the synchronous protocol 2400 bit/s modems, CLEO devices, and value-added networks used to transmit EDI documents to transmitting via the Internet, they equated the non-Internet technologies with EDI and predicted erroneously that EDI itself would be replaced along with the non-Internet technologies. In most cases, these non-internet transmission methods are simply being replaced by Internet protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, telnet, and e-mail, but the EDI documents themselves still remain.\nIn 2002, the IETF published RFC 3335, offering a standardized, secure method of transferring EDI data via e-mail. On July 12, 2005, an IETF working group ratified RFC4130 for MIME-based HTTP EDIINT (a.k.a. AS2) transfers, and the IETF has prepared a similar RFC for FTP transfers (a.k.a. AS3). EDI via web services (a.k.a. AS4) has also been standardized by the OASIS standards body. While some EDI transmission has moved to these newer protocols, the providers of value-added networks remain active.\nInternet.\nAs more organizations connected to the Internet, eventually most or all EDI was pushed onto it. Initially, this was through ad hoc conventions, such as unencrypted FTP of ASCII text files to a certain folder on a certain host, permitted only from certain IP addresses. However, the IETF has published several informational documents (the \"Applicability Statements\"; see below under Protocols) describing ways to use standard internet protocols for EDI.\nAs of 2002, Walmart has pushed AS2 for EDI. Because of its significant presence in the global supply chain, AS2 has become a commonly adopted approach for EDI.\nSpecifications.\nOrganizations that send or receive documents from each other are referred to as \"trading partners\" in EDI terminology. The trading partners agree on the specific information to be transmitted and how it should be used. This is done in human-readable specifications (also called Message Implementation Guidelines). While the standards are analogous to building codes, the specifications are analogous to blueprints. (The specification may also be called a \"mapping,\" but the term mapping is typically reserved for specific machine-readable instructions given to the translation software.) Larger trading \"hubs\" have existing Message Implementation Guidelines which mirror their business processes for processing EDI and they are usually unwilling to modify their EDI business practices to meet the needs of their trading partners. Often in a large company, these EDI guidelines will be written to be generic enough to be used by different branches or divisions and therefore will contain information not needed for a particular business document exchange. For other large companies, they may create separate EDI guidelines for each branch/division.\nTransmission: Direct EDI and VANs.\nTrading partners are free to use any method for the transmission of documents (as described above in the Transmission protocols section). Further, they can either interact directly or through an intermediary.\nDirect EDI: peer-to-peer.\nTrading partners can connect directly to each other. For example, an automotive manufacturer might maintain a modem-pool that all of its hundreds of suppliers are required to dial into to perform EDI. However, if a supplier does business with several manufacturers, it may need to acquire a different modem (or VPN device, etc.) and different software for each one.\nAs EDI and web technology have evolved, new EDI software technologies have emerged to facilitate direct (also known as point-to-point) EDI between trading partners. Modern EDI software can facilitate exchanges using any number of different file transmission protocols and EDI document standards, reducing costs and barriers to entry.\nValue-added networks.\nTo address the limitations in peer-to-peer adoption of EDI, VANs (value-added networks) were established decades ago. A VAN acts as a regional post office. It receives transactions, examines the 'from' and the 'to' information, and routes the transaction to the final recipient. VANs may provide a number of additional services, e.g. retransmitting documents, providing third party audit information, acting as a gateway for different transmission methods, and handling telecommunications support. Because of these and other services VANs provide, businesses frequently use a VAN even when both trading partners are using Internet-based protocols. Healthcare clearinghouses perform many of the same functions as a VAN, but have additional legal restrictions.\nVANs may be operated by various entities:\nCosts, trade-offs and implementation.\nIt is important to note that there are key trade-offs between VANs and Direct EDI, and in many instances, organizations exchanging EDI documents can in fact use both in concert, for different aspects of their EDI implementations. For example, in the U.S., the majority of EDI document exchanges use AS2, so a direct EDI setup for AS2 may make sense for a U.S.-based organization. But adding OFTP2 capabilities to communicate with a European partner may be difficult, so a VAN might make sense to handle those specific transactions, while direct EDI is used for the AS2 transactions.\nIn many ways, a VAN acts as a service provider, simplifying much of the setup for organizations looking to initiate EDI. Due to the fact that many organizations first starting out with EDI often do so to meet a customer or partner requirement and therefore lack in-house EDI expertise, a VAN can be a valuable asset.\nHowever, VANs may come with high costs. VANs typically charge a per-document or even per-line-item transaction fee to process EDI transactions as a service on behalf of their customers. This is the predominant reason why many organizations also implement an EDI software solution or eventually migrate to one for some or all of their EDI.\nOn the other hand, implementing EDI software can be a challenging process, depending on the complexity of the use case, technologies involved and availability of EDI expertise. In addition, there are ongoing maintenance requirements and updates to consider. For example, EDI mapping is one of the most challenging EDI management tasks. Companies must develop and maintain EDI maps for each of their trading partners (and sometimes multiple EDI maps for each trading partner based on their order fulfilment requirements).\nInterpreting data.\n\"EDI translation software\" provides the interface between internal systems and the EDI format sent/received. For an \"inbound\" document, the EDI solution will receive the file (either via a value-added network or directly using protocols such as FTP or AS2), take the received EDI file (commonly referred to as an \"envelope\"), and validate that the trading partner who is sending the file is a valid trading partner, that the structure of the file meets the EDI standards, and that the individual fields of information conform to the agreed-upon standards. Typically, the translator will either create a file of either fixed length, variable length or XML tagged format or \"print\" the received EDI document (for non-integrated EDI environments). The next step is to convert/transform the file that the translator creates into a format that can be imported into a company's back-end business systems, applications or ERP. This can be accomplished by using a custom program, an integrated proprietary \"mapper\" or an integrated standards-based graphical \"mapper,\" using a standard data transformation language such as XSLT. The final step is to import the transformed file (or database) into the company's back-end system.\nFor an \"outbound\" document, the process for integrated EDI is to export a file (or read a database) from a company's information systems and transform the file to the appropriate format for the translator. The translation software will then \"validate\" the EDI file sent to ensure that it meets the standard agreed upon by the trading partners, convert the file into \"EDI\" format (adding the appropriate identifiers and control structures) and send the file to the trading partner (using the appropriate communications protocol).\nAnother critical component of any EDI translation software is a complete \"audit\" of all the steps to move business documents between trading partners. The audit ensures that any transaction (which in reality is a business document) can be tracked to ensure that they are not lost. In the case of a retailer sending a purchase order to a supplier, if the purchase order is \"lost\" anywhere in the business process, the effect is devastating to both businesses. To the supplier, they do not fulfil the order as they have not received it thereby losing business and damaging the business relationship with their retail client. For the retailer, they have a stock outage and the effect is lost sales, reduced customer service and ultimately lower profits.\nIn EDI terminology, \"inbound\" and \"outbound\" refer to the direction of transmission of an EDI document in relation to a particular system, not the direction of merchandise, money or other things represented by the document. For example, an EDI document that tells a warehouse to perform an outbound shipment is an inbound document in relation to the warehouse computer system. It is an outbound document in relation to the manufacturer or dealer that transmitted the document.\nBenefits.\nEDI and other similar technologies save costs for businesses by providing an alternative to, or replacement for, information flows which would require a great deal of human interaction and paper documents. Even when paper documents are maintained in parallel with EDI exchange, e.g. printed shipping manifests, electronic exchange and the use of data from that exchange reduces the handling costs of sorting, distributing, organizing, and searching paper documents. EDI and similar technologies allow a company to take advantage of the benefits of storing and manipulating data electronically without the cost of manual entry. Another advantage of EDI is the opportunity to reduce or eliminate manual data entry errors, such as shipping and billing errors, because EDI eliminates the need to re-key documents on the destination side. One very important advantage of EDI over paper documents is the speed at which the trading partner receives and incorporates the information into their system greatly reducing cycle times. For this reason, EDI can be an important component of a just-in-time production system.\nA study published in 1996 by Kenneth Kahn and John T. Mentzer observed the use of EDI alliances among companies linked within a supply network, where EDI facilitated more transparent information sharing than had been customary among businesses who only shared information of a \"need-to-know\" basis. They anticipated the potential for EDI to encompass all the players within a marketing channel with benefits at each stage in the chain. \nAccording to a 2008 Aberdeen Group report, \"A Comparison of Supplier Enablement around the World\", only 34% of purchase orders were then transmitted electronically in North America. In EMEA, 36% of orders were transmitted electronically and in APAC, 41% of orders are transmitted electronically. The report also stated that the average paper requisition to order costs a company $ in North America, $ in EMEA and $ in APAC. With an EDI requisition to order, costs are reduced to $ in North America, $ in EMEA and $ in APAC.\nBarriers to implementation.\nThere are a few barriers to adopting electronic data interchange. One of the most significant barriers is the accompanying business process change. Existing business processes built around paper handling may not be suited for EDI and would require changes to accommodate automated processing of business documents. For example, a business may receive the bulk of their goods by 1 or 2-day shipping and all of their invoices by mail. The existing process may, therefore, assume that goods are typically received before the invoice. With EDI, the invoice will typically be sent when the goods ship and will, therefore, require a process that handles large numbers of invoices whose corresponding goods have not yet been received.\nAnother significant barrier is the cost in time and money in the initial setup. The preliminary expenses and time that arise from the implementation, customization and training can be costly. It is important to select the correct level of integration to match the business requirement. For a business with relatively few transactions with EDI-based partners, it may make sense for businesses to implement inexpensive \"rip and read\" solutions, where the EDI format is printed out in human-readable form, and people \u2014 rather than computers \u2014 respond to the transaction. Another alternative is outsourced EDI solutions provided by EDI \"Service Bureaus\". For other businesses, the implementation of an integrated EDI solution may be necessary as increases in trading volumes brought on by EDI force them to re-implement their order processing business processes.\nThe key hindrance to a successful implementation of EDI is the perception many businesses have of the nature of EDI. Many view EDI from the technical perspective that EDI is a data format; it would be more accurate to take the business view that EDI is a system for exchanging business documents with external entities, and integrating the data from those documents into the company's internal systems. Successful implementations of EDI take into account the effect externally generated information will have on their internal systems and validate the business information received. For example, allowing a supplier to update a retailer's accounts payable system without appropriate checks and balances would put the company at significant risk. Businesses new to the implementation of EDI must understand the underlying business process and apply proper judgment.\nAcknowledgement.\nThere are several mechanisms used in EDI for acknowledgement, i.e. notifying the sender that an incoming transaction was received and handled by the recipient:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the absence of a breathable Earthlike atmosphere, the astronaut is completely reliant on a space suit for environmental support. EVA includes spacewalks and lunar or planetary surface exploration (commonly known from 1969 to 1972 as moonwalks). In a stand-up EVA (SEVA), an astronaut stands through an open hatch but does not fully leave the spacecraft. EVAs have been conducted by the Soviet Union/Russia, the United States, and China; astronauts from Canada, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, and the European Space Agency have also participated in EVAs conducted by those nations. \nOn March 18, 1965, Alexei Leonov became the first human to perform a spacewalk, exiting the Voskhod 2 capsule for 12 minutes and 9 seconds. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first human to perform a moonwalk, outside his lunar lander on Apollo 11 for 2 hours and 31 minutes. In 1984, Svetlana Savitskaya became the first woman to perform a spacewalk, conducting EVA outside the Salyut 7 space station for 3 hours and 35 minutes. On the last three Moon missions, astronauts also performed deep-space EVAs on the return to Earth, to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft. American Astronauts Pete Conrad, Joseph Kerwin, and Paul Weitz also used EVA in 1973 to repair launch damage to Skylab, the United States' first space station.\nEVAs may be either tethered (the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft; oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an umbilical cable; no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft), or untethered. Untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), and on a flight test in 1994 of the Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue (SAFER), a safety device worn on tethered U.S. EVAs.\nDevelopment history.\nNASA planners invented the term \"extravehicular activity\" (abbreviated with the acronym EVA) in the early 1960s for the Apollo program to land humans on the Moon, because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect lunar material samples and deploy scientific experiments. To support this, and other Apollo objectives, the Gemini program was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-person Earth orbiting spacecraft. However, the Soviet Union was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in crewed spaceflight, so the Soviet Communist Party, led by Nikita Khrushchev, ordered the conversion of its single-pilot Vostok capsule into a two- or three-person craft named Voskhod, in order to compete with Gemini and Apollo. The Soviets were able to launch two Voskhod capsules before U.S. was able to launch its first crewed Gemini.\nThe Voskhod's avionics required cooling by cabin air to prevent any kind of overheating, therefore an airlock was required for the spacewalking cosmonaut to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized. Unusually, and by contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the American and Soviet space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an EVA. The Soviet (now Russian) definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in vacuum. An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least their head outside the spacecraft. The U.S. has changed its EVA definition since.\nFirst instance.\nThe first EVA was performed on March 18, 1965, by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, who spent 12 minutes and 9 seconds outside the Voskhod 2 spacecraft. Carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes' worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen, Leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his tether. After the flight, he claimed this was easy, but his space suit ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space, stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.\nAt the end of his space walk, the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem: Leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock, in diameter and long. He improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways. He could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit, risking \"the bends\". This added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum, and he was overheated by from the exertion. It would be almost four years before the Soviets tried another EVA. They misrepresented to the press how difficult Leonov found it to work in weightlessness and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the Cold War.\nProject Gemini.\nThe first American spacewalk was performed on June 3, 1965, by Ed White from the second crewed Gemini flight, Gemini IV, for 21 minutes. White was tethered to the spacecraft, and his oxygen was supplied through a umbilical, which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation. He was the first to control his motion in space with a Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit, which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds. White found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around, contrary to Leonov's claim. However, a defect in the capsule's hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch, which delayed the start of the EVA and put White and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to Earth alive.\nNo EVAs were planned on the next three Gemini flights. The next EVA was planned to be made by David Scott on Gemini VIII, but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the EVA could be conducted. Astronauts on the next three Gemini flights (Eugene Cernan, Michael Collins, and Richard Gordon), performed several EVAs, but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating. Cernan attempted but failed to test an Air Force Astronaut Maneuvering Unit which included a self-contained oxygen system.\nOn November 13, 1966, Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin became the first to successfully work in space without tiring during Gemini XII, the last Gemini mission. Aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes, in addition to two stand-up EVAs in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes. Aldrin's interest in scuba diving inspired the use of underwater EVA training to simulate weightlessness, which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.\nFirst crew transfer.\nOn January 16, 1969, Soviet cosmonauts Aleksei Yeliseyev and Yevgeny Khrunov transferred from Soyuz 5 to Soyuz 4, which were docked together. This was the second Soviet EVA, and it would be almost another nine years before the Soviets performed their third.\nApollo missions.\nAmerican astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin performed the first EVA on the lunar surface on July 21, 1969 (UTC), after landing their Apollo 11 Lunar Module spacecraft. This first Moon walk, using self-contained portable life support systems, lasted 2 hours and 36 minutes. A total of fifteen Moon walks were performed among six Apollo crews, including Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, Alan Bean, Alan Shepard, Edgar Mitchell, David Scott, James Irwin, John Young, Charles Duke, Eugene Cernan, and Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt. Cernan was the last Apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the Moon.\nApollo 15 command module pilot Al Worden made an EVA on August 5, 1971, on the return trip from the Moon, to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the service module. He was assisted by Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin standing up in the Command Module hatch. This procedure was repeated by Ken Mattingly and Charles Duke on Apollo 16, and by Ronald Evans and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17.\nPost-Apollo.\nThe first EVA repairs of a spacecraft were made by Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, Joseph Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz on May 26, June 7, and June 19, 1973, on the Skylab 2 mission. They rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged Skylab space station by freeing a stuck solar panel, deploying a solar heating shield, and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay. The Skylab 2 crew made three EVAs, and a total of ten EVAs were made by the three Skylab crews. They found that activities in weightlessness required about 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 times longer than on Earth because many astronauts suffered spacesickness early in their flights.\nAfter Skylab, no more EVAs were made by the United States until the advent of the Space Shuttle program in the early 1980s. In this period, the Soviets resumed EVAs, making four from the Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 space stations between December 20, 1977, and July 30, 1982.\nWhen the United States resumed EVAs on April 7, 1983, astronauts started using an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft. STS-6 was the first Space Shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted. Also, for the first time, American astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the Soviets. Accordingly, the American definition of EVA start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the EMU to battery power.\nNumerous EVAs were conducted during the assembly of the ISS, often using the Quest Joint Airlock, designed to support both U.S. EMUs, and Russian Orlan space suits.\nBy China.\nChina became the third country to independently carry out an EVA on September 27, 2008, during the Shenzhou 7 mission. Chinese taikonaut Zhai Zhigang completed a 22-minute spacewalk wearing the Chinese-developed Feitian space suit, with taikonaut Liu Boming wearing the Russian-derived Orlan space suit assisting him in the process. Zhai completely exited the craft, while Liu stood by at the airlock, straddling the portal.\nSince 2021, China has carried out several more EVAs lasting several hours for the construction of the Tiangong space station. In December 2024 China's Cai Xuzhe and Song Lingdong set the current record for the longest EVA at 9 hours and six minutes. \nBy SpaceX.\nAmerican company SpaceX conducted the first private sector-financed EVA on September 12, 2024. Entrepreneur Jared Isaacman and SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis briefly ventured outside a Dragon capsule, for a stand-up EVA (SEVA) during the Polaris Dawn mission to conduct spacesuit mobility testing. The other two crew members were exposed to the vacuum of space in the capsule, but did not leave it. SpaceX plans to launch at least two more missions involving an EVA, including one that involves SpaceX's still-in-development Starship launch vehicle.\nCommemoration.\nThe first spacewalk, made by Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, was commemorated in 1965 with several Eastern Bloc stamps (see Alexei Leonov#Stamps). Since the Soviet Union did not publish details of the Voskhod spacecraft at the time, the spaceship depiction in the stamps was purely fictional.\nThe U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp in 1967 commemorating Ed White's first American spacewalk. The engraved image has an accurate depiction of the Gemini IV spacecraft and White's space suit.\nDesignations.\nNASA \"spacewalkers\" during the Space Shuttle program were designated as EV-1, EV-2, EV-3 and EV-4 (assigned to mission specialists for each mission, if applicable).\nCamp-out procedure.\nFor EVAs from the International Space Station, NASA employed a \"camp-out\" procedure to reduce the risk of decompression sickness. This was first tested by the Expedition 12 crew. During a camp-out, astronauts sleep overnight in the airlock prior to an EVA, lowering the air pressure to , compared to the normal station pressure of . Spending a night at the lower air pressure helps flush nitrogen from the body, thereby preventing \"the bends\". More recently astronauts have been using the In-Suit Light Exercise protocol rather than camp-out to prevent decompression sickness.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Their successful lawsuit was the subject of the Oscar-winning film, \"Erin Brockovich\" (2000), starring Julia Roberts as Brockovich and Albert Finney as Masry.\nSince then, Brockovich has become a media personality, hosting the TV series \"Challenge America with Erin Brockovich\" on ABC and \"Final Justice\" on Zone Reality, and became president of Brockovich Research &amp; Consulting. She also works as a consultant for the New York law firm of Weitz &amp; Luxenberg, which has a focus on personal injury claims for asbestos exposure, and Shine Lawyers in Australia. She worked as a consultant for the now-defunct California law firm Girardi &amp; Keese.\nEarly life.\nErin Pattee Brockovich was born in Lawrence, Kansas, the daughter of Betty Jo (n\u00e9e O'Neal; 1923\u20132008), a journalist, and Frank Pattee (1924\u20132011), an industrial engineer and football player. She has two brothers, Frank Jr. and Thomas (1954\u20131992), and a sister, Jodie. She graduated from Lawrence High School, then attended Kansas State University, in Manhattan, Kansas, and graduated with an Associate in Applied Arts Degree from Wade College in Dallas, Texas.\nPacific Gas &amp; Electric litigation.\nIn 1993, Brockovich spoke out against PG&amp;E after finding widespread unexplained illness in the town of Hinkley, California. She became instrumental in suing the utility company on behalf of the town.\nThe case (\"Anderson, et al. v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric,\" file BCV 00300) alleged contamination of drinking water with hexavalent chromium (also written as \"chromium 6\", \"chromium VI\", \"Cr-VI\" or \"Cr-6\") in the town. At the center of the case was the Hinkley compressor station, built in 1952 as a part of a natural-gas pipeline connecting to the San Francisco Bay Area. Between 1952 and 1966, PG&amp;E used hexavalent chromium in a cooling tower system to fight corrosion. The waste water was discharged to unlined ponds at the site, and some of the waste water percolated into the groundwater, affecting an area of approximately near the plant. The Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) put the PG&amp;E site under its regulations in 1968.\nThe case was settled in 1996 for $333 million &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;), the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in United States history to that date. Masry &amp; Vititoe, the law firm for which Brockovich was a legal clerk, received $133.6 million &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;) of that settlement, and Brockovich received $2.5 million &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;) as part of her fee.\nOther litigation.\nWorking with Edward L. Masry, a lawyer based in Thousand Oaks, California, Brockovich went on to participate in other anti-pollution lawsuits. One suit accused the Whitman Corporation of chromium contamination in Willits, California. Another, which listed 1,200 plaintiffs, alleged contamination near PG&amp;E's Kettleman Hills compressor station in Kings County, California, along the same pipeline as the Hinkley site. The Kettleman suit was settled for $335 million in 2006 &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;).\nIn 2003, after experiencing problems with mold contamination in her own home in the Conejo Valley, Brockovich received settlements of $430,000 &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;) from two parties, and an undisclosed amount from a third party, to settle her lawsuit alleging toxic mold in her Agoura Hills, California, home. Brockovich then became a prominent activist and educator in the area as well.\nBrockovich and Masry filed suit against the Beverly Hills Unified School District in 2003, in which the district was accused of harming the health and safety of its students by allowing a contractor to operate a cluster of oil wells on campus. Brockovich and Masry alleged that 300 cancer cases were linked to the oil wells. Subsequent testing and epidemiological investigation failed to corroborate a substantial link, and Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Wendell Mortimer granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs. In May 2007, the school district announced that it was to be paid $450,000 as reimbursement for legal expenses.\nBrockovich assisted in the filing of a lawsuit against Prime Tanning Corp. of St. Joseph, Missouri, in April 2009. The lawsuit claims that waste sludge from the production of leather, containing high levels of hexavalent chromium, was distributed to farmers in northwest Missouri to use as fertilizer on their fields. It is believed to be a potential cause of an abnormally high number of brain tumors around the town of Cameron, Missouri. Prior to the lawsuit, the site was investigated by the EPA and at the time, the agency found \"no detections of total chromium\", and added, \"we would like to get any specific information from this law firm as soon as we can so we can evaluate it, and we intend to ask for that directly.\" The EPA, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Missouri Department of Health and a state epidemiologist had been investigating what residents believed were a high number of brain tumors in the area \u2014 more than 70 since 1996. The epidemiologist had stated the numbers did not seem abnormally high.\nIn June 2009, Brockovich began investigating a case of contaminated water in Midland, Texas. \"Significant amounts\" of hexavalent chromium were found in the water of more than 40 homes in the area, some of which have now been fitted with state-monitored filters on their water supply. Brockovich said: \"The only difference between here and Hinkley is that I saw higher levels here than I saw in Hinkley.\"\nIn 2012, Brockovich became involved in the case of 14 students from LeRoy, New York, who began reporting perplexing medical symptoms, including tics and speech difficulties. Brockovich believed environmental pollution from the 1970 Lehigh Valley Railroad derailment was the cause and conducted testing in the area. Brockovich was supposed to return to LeRoy to present her findings, but never did; in the meantime, the students' doctors determined the cause was mass psychogenic illness, and that the media exposure was exacerbating the symptoms. No environmental causes were found after repeat testing, and the students improved once the media attention died down.\nIn early 2016, Brockovich became involved in potential litigation against Southern California Gas for the Aliso Canyon gas leak, a large methane leak from its underground storage facility near the community of Porter Ranch, north of Los Angeles.\nIn early 2023, within hours of the Feb. 3 Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, Brockovich started getting calls for assistance from the community about the toxic chemical fires. She has been interviewed on various news outlets, from independent media to national networks. A few weeks later, Brockovich traveled to East Palestine, where she was interviewed by local media, and appeared at one of several high-profile town hall meetings on Friday night, Feb. 24th. At the meeting, Brockovich and an attorney highlighted decades of toxic chemical train derailments. Among Brockovich's many concerns is the potential groundwater contamination after chemicals were, as she describes it, dumped in a big hole in the ground and burned off. A recurring theme of her appearances is that the nation has, for decades, in the name of profits over people, failed to undertake infrastructure improvements, enact tighter regulations, and adequately protect the health, safety and welfare of communities from long-term bodily harm and environmental damage. Brockovich continues to cite the Hinkley case and Flint water crisis, as well as the 2013 Lac-Megantic, Canada oil train catastrophe.\nMovies and television.\nBrockovich's work in bringing litigation against Pacific Gas &amp; Electric was the focus of the 2000 feature film \"Erin Brockovich\", starring Julia Roberts in the title role. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Screenplay. Roberts won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Erin Brockovich. Brockovich herself had a cameo role as a waitress named Julia. She and Isla Fisher had deleted cameo roles in The Simpsons Movie, where they voiced consultants.\nBrockovich had a more extensive role in the 2012 documentary \"Last Call at the Oasis\", which focused on not only water pollution but also the overall state of water scarcity as it relates to water policy in the United States.\nOn April 8, 2021, \"Rebel\", a television series which creator Krista Vernoff loosely based on Brockovich's life, premiered on ABC.\nBooks and articles.\nBrockovich's first book, \"Take It from Me: Life's a Struggle But You Can Win\" (), was published in 2001. A second book, \"Superman's Not Coming\", was released on August 25, 2020.\nIn 2021, Brockovich wrote about hormone-disrupting chemicals (such as PFAS) eroding human fertility at an alarming rate.\nOn February 8, 2022, Brockovich wrote an article talking about the case of Steven Donziger, a lawyer who won an $18 billion judgment against Chevron before being jailed for contempt of court after refusing to turn his phone and computer over to Chevron's legal team.\nOn July 30 2024, a guest essay penned by Brockovich entitled \"What's at Stake in November\" appeared in the opinion section of \"The New York Times\". In the essay, she warns that the United States Supreme Court decision in \"Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\" \"weakens the ability of regulatory agencies to do their jobs protecting the public\u2019s health from problems such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances\", thus opening the door for corporations to challenge long-standing United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations previously upheld solely by \"Chevron\" deference. The piece also refers to Project 2025 and concludes with Brockovich's opinion that if Donald Trump wins the 2024 United States presidential election, \"Americans\u2019 health will be at risk\" due to corporations and other local authorities either challenging or altogether ignoring weakly enforced environmental protection regulations.\nPersonal life.\nBrockovich has three children: a son, Matthew, and a daughter, Katie, with her first husband Shawn Brown, and a daughter, Elizabeth, with her second husband Steven Brockovich. Her third husband was actor and country-musician DJ, Eric L. Ellis. As of 2016, Brockovich resides in Agoura Hills, California, in a house she purchased in 1996 with her US$2.5 million bonus after the Hinkley settlement. Brockovich is dyslexic.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Electric charge can be \"positive\" or \"negative\". Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral. Early knowledge of how charged substances interact is now called classical electrodynamics, and is still accurate for problems that do not require consideration of quantum effects.\nIn an isolated system, the total charge stays the same - the amount of positive charge minus the amount of negative charge does not change over time. Electric charge is carried by subatomic particles. In ordinary matter, negative charge is carried by electrons, and positive charge is carried by the protons in the nuclei of atoms. If there are more electrons than protons in a piece of matter, it will have a negative charge, if there are fewer it will have a positive charge, and if there are equal numbers it will be neutral. Charge is \"quantized\": it comes in integer multiples of individual small units called the elementary charge, \"e\", about , which is the smallest charge that can exist freely. Particles called quarks have smaller charges, multiples of \"e\", but they are found only combined in particles that have a charge that is an integer multiple of \"e\". In the Standard Model, charge is an absolutely conserved quantum number. The proton has a charge of +\"e\", and the electron has a charge of \u2212\"e\".\nToday, a negative charge is defined as the charge carried by an electron and a positive charge is that carried by a proton. Before these particles were discovered, a positive charge was defined by Benjamin Franklin as the charge acquired by a glass rod when it is rubbed with a silk cloth.\nElectric charges produce electric fields. A moving charge also produces a magnetic field. The interaction of electric charges with an electromagnetic field (a combination of an electric and a magnetic field) is the source of the electromagnetic (or Lorentz) force, which is one of the four fundamental interactions in physics. The study of photon-mediated interactions among charged particles is called quantum electrodynamics.\nThe SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C) named after French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb. In electrical engineering it is also common to use the ampere-hour (A\u22c5h). In physics and chemistry it is common to use the elementary charge (\"e\") as a unit. Chemistry also uses the Faraday constant, which is the charge of one mole of elementary charges.\nOverview.\nCharge is the fundamental property of matter that exhibits electrostatic attraction or repulsion in the presence of other matter with charge. Electric charge is a characteristic property of many subatomic particles. The charges of free-standing particles are integer multiples of the elementary charge \"e\"; we say that electric charge is \"quantized\". Michael Faraday, in his electrolysis experiments, was the first to note the discrete nature of electric charge. Robert Millikan's oil drop experiment demonstrated this fact directly, and measured the elementary charge. It has been discovered that one type of particle, quarks, have fractional charges of either \u2212 or +, but it is believed they always occur in multiples of integral charge; free-standing quarks have never been observed.\nBy convention, the charge of an electron is negative, \"\u2212e\", while that of a proton is positive, \"+e\". Charged particles whose charges have the same sign repel one another, and particles whose charges have different signs attract. Coulomb's law quantifies the electrostatic force between two particles by asserting that the force is proportional to the product of their charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The charge of an antiparticle equals that of the corresponding particle, but with opposite sign.\nThe electric charge of a macroscopic object is the sum of the electric charges of the particles that it is made up of. This charge is often small, because matter is made of atoms, and atoms typically have equal numbers of protons and electrons, in which case their charges cancel out, yielding a net charge of zero, thus making the atom neutral.\nAn \"ion\" is an atom (or group of atoms) that has lost one or more electrons, giving it a net positive charge (cation), or that has gained one or more electrons, giving it a net negative charge (anion). \"Monatomic ions\" are formed from single atoms, while \"polyatomic ions\" are formed from two or more atoms that have been bonded together, in each case yielding an ion with a positive or negative net charge.\nDuring the formation of macroscopic objects, constituent atoms and ions usually combine to form structures composed of neutral \"ionic compounds\" electrically bound to neutral atoms. Thus macroscopic objects tend toward being neutral overall, but macroscopic objects are rarely perfectly net neutral.\nSometimes macroscopic objects contain ions distributed throughout the material, rigidly bound in place, giving an overall net positive or negative charge to the object. Also, macroscopic objects made of conductive elements can more or less easily (depending on the element) take on or give off electrons, and then maintain a net negative or positive charge indefinitely. When the net electric charge of an object is non-zero and motionless, the phenomenon is known as static electricity. This can easily be produced by rubbing two dissimilar materials together, such as rubbing amber with fur or glass with silk. In this way, non-conductive materials can be charged to a significant degree, either positively or negatively. Charge taken from one material is moved to the other material, leaving an opposite charge of the same magnitude behind. The law of \"conservation of charge\" always applies, giving the object from which a negative charge is taken a positive charge of the same magnitude, and vice versa.\nEven when an object's net charge is zero, the charge can be distributed non-uniformly in the object (e.g., due to an external electromagnetic field, or bound polar molecules). In such cases, the object is said to be polarized. The charge due to polarization is known as bound charge, while the charge on an object produced by electrons gained or lost from outside the object is called \"free charge\". The motion of electrons in conductive metals in a specific direction is known as electric current.\nUnit.\nThe SI unit of quantity of electric charge is the coulomb (symbol: C). The coulomb is defined as the quantity of charge that passes through the cross section of an electrical conductor carrying one ampere for one second. This unit was proposed in 1946 and ratified in 1948. The lowercase symbol \"q\" is often used to denote a quantity of electric charge. The quantity of electric charge can be directly measured with an electrometer, or indirectly measured with a ballistic galvanometer.\nThe elementary charge is defined as a fundamental constant in the SI. The value for elementary charge, when expressed in SI units, is exactly .\nAfter discovering the quantized character of charge, in 1891, George Stoney proposed the unit 'electron' for this fundamental unit of electrical charge. J. J. Thomson subsequently discovered the particle that we now call the electron in 1897. The unit is today referred to as elementary charge, fundamental unit of charge, or simply denoted \"e\", with the charge of an electron being \u2212\"e\". The charge of an isolated system should be a multiple of the elementary charge \"e\", even if at large scales charge seems to behave as a continuous quantity. In some contexts it is meaningful to speak of fractions of an elementary charge; for example, in the fractional quantum Hall effect.\nThe unit faraday is sometimes used in electrochemistry. One faraday is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of elementary charges, i.e. .\nHistory.\nFrom ancient times, people were familiar with four types of phenomena that today would all be explained using the concept of electric charge: (a) lightning, (b) the torpedo fish (or electric ray), (c) St Elmo's Fire, and (d) that amber rubbed with fur would attract small, light objects. The first account of the amber effect is often attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Thales of Miletus, who lived from c. 624 to c. 546 BC, but there are doubts about whether Thales left any writings; his account about amber is known from an account from early 200s. This account can be taken as evidence that the phenomenon was known since at least c. 600 BC, but Thales explained this phenomenon as evidence for inanimate objects having a soul. In other words, there was no indication of any conception of electric charge. More generally, the ancient Greeks did not understand the connections among these four kinds of phenomena. The Greeks observed that the charged amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair. They also found that if they rubbed the amber for long enough, they could even get an electric spark to jump, but there is also a claim that no mention of electric sparks appeared until late 17th century. This property derives from the triboelectric effect.\nIn late 1100s, the substance jet, a compacted form of coal, was noted to have an amber effect, and in the middle of the 1500s, Girolamo Fracastoro, discovered that diamond also showed this effect. Some efforts were made by Fracastoro and others, especially Gerolamo Cardano to develop explanations for this phenomenon.\nIn contrast to astronomy, mechanics, and optics, which had been studied quantitatively since antiquity, the start of ongoing qualitative and quantitative research into electrical phenomena can be marked with the publication of \"De Magnete\" by the English scientist William Gilbert in 1600. In this book, there was a small section where Gilbert returned to the amber effect (as he called it) in addressing many of the earlier theories, and coined the Neo-Latin word \"electrica\" (from (\u0113lektron), the Greek word for \"amber\"). The Latin word was translated into English as electrics. Gilbert is also credited with the term \"electrical\", while the term \"electricity\" came later, first attributed to Sir Thomas Browne in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica from 1646. (For more linguistic details see Etymology of electricity.) Gilbert hypothesized that this amber effect could be explained by an effluvium (a small stream of particles that flows from the electric object, without diminishing its bulk or weight) that acts on other objects. This idea of a material electrical effluvium was influential in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was a precursor to ideas developed in the 18th century about \"electric fluid\" (Dufay, Nollet, Franklin) and \"electric charge\".\nAround 1663 Otto von Guericke invented what was probably the first electrostatic generator, but he did not recognize it primarily as an electrical device and only conducted minimal electrical experiments with it. Other European pioneers were Robert Boyle, who in 1675 published the first book in English that was devoted solely to electrical phenomena. His work was largely a repetition of Gilbert's studies, but he also identified several more \"electrics\", and noted mutual attraction between two bodies.\nIn 1729 Stephen Gray was experimenting with static electricity, which he generated using a glass tube. He noticed that a cork, used to protect the tube from dust and moisture, also became electrified (charged). Further experiments (e.g., extending the cork by putting thin sticks into it) showed\u2014for the first time\u2014that electrical effluvia (as Gray called it) could be transmitted (conducted) over a distance. Gray managed to transmit charge with twine (765 feet) and wire (865 feet). Through these experiments, Gray discovered the importance of different materials, which facilitated or hindered the conduction of electrical effluvia. John Theophilus Desaguliers, who repeated many of Gray's experiments, is credited with coining the terms conductors and insulators to refer to the effects of different materials in these experiments. Gray also discovered electrical induction (i.e., where charge could be transmitted from one object to another without any direct physical contact). For example, he showed that by bringing a charged glass tube close to, but not touching, a lump of lead that was sustained by a thread, it was possible to make the lead become electrified (e.g., to attract and repel brass filings). He attempted to explain this phenomenon with the idea of electrical effluvia.\nGray's discoveries introduced an important shift in the historical development of knowledge about electric charge. The fact that electrical effluvia could be transferred from one object to another, opened the theoretical possibility that this property was not inseparably connected to the bodies that were electrified by rubbing. In 1733 Charles Fran\u00e7ois de Cisternay du Fay, inspired by Gray's work, made a series of experiments (reported in \"M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences\"), showing that more or less all substances could be 'electrified' by rubbing, except for metals and fluids and proposed that electricity comes in two varieties that cancel each other, which he expressed in terms of a two-fluid theory. When glass was rubbed with silk, du Fay said that the glass was charged with \"vitreous electricity\", and, when amber was rubbed with fur, the amber was charged with \"resinous electricity\". In contemporary understanding, positive charge is now defined as the charge of a glass rod after being rubbed with a silk cloth, but it is arbitrary which type of charge is called positive and which is called negative. Another important two-fluid theory from this time was proposed by Jean-Antoine Nollet (1745).\nUp until about 1745, the main explanation for electrical attraction and repulsion was the idea that electrified bodies gave off an effluvium.\nBenjamin Franklin started electrical experiments in late 1746, and by 1750 had developed a one-fluid theory of electricity, based on an experiment that showed that a rubbed glass received the same, but opposite, charge strength as the cloth used to rub the glass. Franklin imagined electricity as being a type of invisible fluid present in all matter and coined the term charge itself (as well as battery and some others); for example, he believed that it was the glass in a Leyden jar that held the accumulated charge. He posited that rubbing insulating surfaces together caused this fluid to change location, and that a flow of this fluid constitutes an electric current. He also posited that when matter contained an excess of the fluid it was positively charged and when it had a deficit it was negatively charged. He identified the term positive with vitreous electricity and negative with resinous electricity after performing an experiment with a glass tube he had received from his overseas colleague Peter Collinson. The experiment had participant A charge the glass tube and participant B receive a shock to the knuckle from the charged tube. Franklin identified participant B to be positively charged after having been shocked by the tube. There is some ambiguity about whether William Watson independently arrived at the same one-fluid explanation around the same time (1747). Watson, after seeing Franklin's letter to Collinson, claims that he had presented the same explanation as Franklin in spring 1747. Franklin had studied some of Watson's works prior to making his own experiments and analysis, which was probably significant for Franklin's own theorizing. One physicist suggests that Watson first proposed a one-fluid theory, which Franklin then elaborated further and more influentially. A historian of science argues that Watson missed a subtle difference between his ideas and Franklin's, so that Watson misinterpreted his ideas as being similar to Franklin's. In any case, there was no animosity between Watson and Franklin, and the Franklin model of electrical action, formulated in early 1747, eventually became widely accepted at that time. After Franklin's work, effluvia-based explanations were rarely put forward.\nIt is now known that the Franklin model was fundamentally correct. There is only one kind of electrical charge, and only one variable is required to keep track of the amount of charge.\nUntil 1800 it was only possible to study conduction of electric charge by using an electrostatic discharge. In 1800 Alessandro Volta was the first to show that charge could be maintained in continuous motion through a closed path.\nIn 1833, Michael Faraday sought to remove any doubt that electricity is identical, regardless of the source by which it is produced. He discussed a variety of known forms, which he characterized as common electricity (e.g., static electricity, piezoelectricity, magnetic induction), voltaic electricity (e.g., electric current from a voltaic pile), and animal electricity (e.g., bioelectricity).\nIn 1838, Faraday raised a question about whether electricity was a fluid or fluids or a property of matter, like gravity. He investigated whether matter could be charged with one kind of charge independently of the other. He came to the conclusion that electric charge was a relation between two or more bodies, because he could not charge one body without having an opposite charge in another body.\nIn 1838, Faraday also put forth a theoretical explanation of electric force, while expressing neutrality about whether it originates from one, two, or no fluids. He focused on the idea that the normal state of particles is to be nonpolarized, and that when polarized, they seek to return to their natural, nonpolarized state.\nIn developing a field theory approach to electrodynamics (starting in the mid-1850s), James Clerk Maxwell stops considering electric charge as a special substance that accumulates in objects, and starts to understand electric charge as a consequence of the transformation of energy in the field. This pre-quantum understanding considered magnitude of electric charge to be a continuous quantity, even at the microscopic level.\nRole of charge in static electricity.\nStatic electricity refers to the electric charge of an object and the related electrostatic discharge when two objects are brought together that are not at equilibrium. An electrostatic discharge creates a change in the charge of each of the two objects.\nElectrification by sliding.\nWhen a piece of glass and a piece of resin\u2014neither of which exhibit any electrical properties\u2014are rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces in contact, they still exhibit no electrical properties. When separated, they attract each other.\nA second piece of glass rubbed with a second piece of resin, then separated and suspended near the former pieces of glass and resin causes these phenomena:\nThis attraction and repulsion is an \"electrical phenomenon\", and the bodies that exhibit them are said to be \"electrified\", or \"electrically charged\". Bodies may be electrified in many other ways, as well as by sliding. The electrical properties of the two pieces of glass are similar to each other but opposite to those of the two pieces of resin: The glass attracts what the resin repels and repels what the resin attracts.\nIf a body electrified in any manner whatsoever behaves as the glass does, that is, if it repels the glass and attracts the resin, the body is said to be \"vitreously\" electrified, and if it attracts the glass and repels the resin it is said to be \"resinously\" electrified. All electrified bodies are either vitreously or resinously electrified.\nAn established convention in the scientific community defines vitreous electrification as positive, and resinous electrification as negative. The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify our indicating them by opposite signs, but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must be considered as a matter of arbitrary convention\u2014just as it is a matter of convention in mathematical diagram to reckon positive distances towards the right hand.\nRole of charge in electric current.\nElectric current is the flow of electric charge through an object. The most common charge carriers are the positively charged proton and the negatively charged electron. The movement of any of these charged particles constitutes an electric current. In many situations, it suffices to speak of the \"conventional current\" without regard to whether it is carried by positive charges moving in the direction of the conventional current or by negative charges moving in the opposite direction. This macroscopic viewpoint is an approximation that simplifies electromagnetic concepts and calculations.\nAt the opposite extreme, if one looks at the microscopic situation, one sees there are many ways of carrying an electric current, including: a flow of electrons; a flow of electron holes that act like positive particles; and both negative and positive particles (ions or other charged particles) flowing in opposite directions in an electrolytic solution or a plasma.\nThe direction of the conventional current in most metallic wires is opposite to the drift velocity of the actual charge carriers; i.e., the electrons.\nConservation of electric charge.\nThe total electric charge of an isolated system remains constant regardless of changes within the system itself. This law is inherent to all processes known to physics and can be derived in a local form from gauge invariance of the wave function. The conservation of charge results in the charge-current continuity equation. More generally, the rate of change in charge density \"\u03c1\" within a volume of integration \"V\" is equal to the area integral over the current density J through the closed surface \"S\" = \u2202\"V\", which is in turn equal to the net current \"I\":\n formula_1 formula_2 formula_3\nThus, the conservation of electric charge, as expressed by the continuity equation, gives the result:\n formula_4\nThe charge transferred between times formula_5 and formula_6 is obtained by integrating both sides:\n formula_7\nwhere \"I\" is the net outward current through a closed surface and \"q\" is the electric charge contained within the volume defined by the surface.\nRelativistic invariance.\nAside from the properties described in articles about electromagnetism, electric charge is a relativistic invariant. This means that any particle that has electric charge \"q\" has the same electric charge regardless of how fast it is travelling. This property has been experimentally verified by showing that the electric charge of one helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons bound together in a nucleus and moving around at high speeds) is the same as that of two deuterium nuclei (one proton and one neutron bound together, but moving much more slowly than they would if they were in a helium nucleus).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Owned by the U.S. government, Ellis Island was once the busiest immigrant inspection and processing station in the United States. From 1892 to 1954, nearly 12 million immigrants arriving at the Port of New York and New Jersey were processed there; as many as two-fifths of Americans may be descended from these immigrants. It has been part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument since 1965 and is accessible to the public only by ferry. The north side of the island is a national museum of immigration, while the south side of the island, including the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, is open to the public through guided tours.\nThe name derives from Samuel Ellis, a Welshman who bought the island in 1774. In the 19th century, Ellis Island was the site of Fort Gibson and later became a naval magazine. The first inspection station opened in 1892 and was destroyed by fire in 1897. The second station opened in 1900 and housed facilities for medical quarantines and processing immigrants. After 1924, Ellis Island was used primarily as a detention center for migrants. During both World War I and World War II, its facilities were also used by the U.S. military to detain prisoners of war. After the immigration station's closure, the buildings languished for several years until they were partially reopened in 1976. The main building and adjacent structures were completely renovated into a museum in 1990.\nThe island was expanded by land reclamation between the late 1890s and the 1930s and, at one point, consisted of three islands numbered 1, 2, and 3. Jurisdictional disputes between the states of New Jersey and New York persisted until the 1998 U.S. Supreme Court ruling \"New Jersey v. New York\". The Supreme Court ruled that, while most of the island is in New Jersey, the natural portion of the island (on the northern end) is an exclave of New York. The northern half of Ellis Island comprises the former Island 1 and includes the main building, several ancillary structures, and the Wall of Honor. The hospital structures on the island's southern half occupy the former sites of islands 2 and 3, and there is a ferry building between Ellis Island's northern and southern halves. Historically, immigrants were subjected to medical and primary inspections, and they could be detained or deported. The island is commemorated through the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, and it has received several federal, state, and municipal landmark designations.\nGeography and access.\nEllis Island is in New York Harbor, east of Liberty State Park and north of Liberty Island. While most of the island is in Jersey City, New Jersey, a small section is an exclave of New York City. The island has a land area of , much of which is from land reclamation. The natural island and contiguous areas comprise within New York, and are located on the northern portion of the present-day island. The artificial land is part of New Jersey. The island has been owned and administered by the federal government of the United States since 1808 and operated by the National Park Service since 1965.\nLand expansion.\nInitially, much of the Upper New York Bay's western shore consisted of large tidal flats with vast oyster beds, which were a major source of food for the Lenape. Ellis Island was one of three \"Oyster Islands,\" the other two being Liberty Island and the now-subsumed Black Tom Island. In the late 19th century, the federal government began expanding the island by land reclamation to accommodate its immigration station, and the expansions continued until 1934.\nThe National Park Service cites the fill as supposedly having been acquired from the ballast of ships, as well as material excavated from the first line of the New York City Subway; however, \"The New York Times\" writes that there is no evidence of subway fill being transported to the island. It also may have come from the railyards of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey. It eventually obliterated the oyster beds, engulfed one of the Oyster Islands, and brought the shoreline much closer to the others.\nThe current island is shaped like a \"C\", with two landmasses of equal size on the northeastern and southwestern sides, separated by what was formerly a ferry pier. It was originally three separate islands. The current north side, formerly called island 1, contains the original island and the fill around it. The current south side was composed of island 2, created in 1899, and island 3, created in 1906. Two eastward-facing ferry docks separated the three numbered landmasses.\nThe fill was retained with a system of wood piles and cribbing, and later encased with more than 7,700 linear feet of concrete and granite sea wall. It was placed atop either wood piles, cribbing, or submerged bags of concrete. In the 1920s, the second ferry basin between islands 2 and 3 was infilled to create the great lawn, forming the current south side of Ellis Island. As part of the project, a concrete and granite seawall was built to connect the tip of these landmasses.\nState sovereignty dispute.\nThe circumstances which led to an exclave of New York being located within New Jersey began in the colonial era, after the British takeover of New Netherland in 1664. A clause in the colonial land grant outlined the territory that the proprietors of New Jersey would receive as being \"westward of Long Island, and Manhitas Island and bounded on the east part by the main sea, and part by Hudson's river.\"\nAs early as 1804, attempts were made to resolve the status of the state line. The government of New York City claimed the right to regulate trade on all waters. This was contested in \"Gibbons v. Ogden\", which decided that the regulation of interstate commerce fell under the authority of the federal government, thus influencing competition in the newly developing steam ferry service in New York Harbor. In 1830, New Jersey planned to bring suit to clarify the border, but the case was never heard. The matter was resolved with a compact between the states, ratified by U.S. Congress in 1834. This set the boundary line at the middle of the Hudson River and New York Harbor; however, New York was guaranteed \"exclusive jurisdiction of and over all the waters of Hudson River lying west of Manhattan and to the south of the mouth of Spuytenduyvil Creek; and of and over the lands covered by the said waters, to the low-water mark on the New Jersey shore.\" This was later confirmed in other cases by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nNew Jersey contended that the artificial portions of the island were part of New Jersey, since they were outside New York's border. In 1956, after the closure of the U.S. immigration station two years prior, the Mayor of Jersey City Bernard J. Berry commandeered a U.S. Coast Guard cutter and led a contingent of New Jersey officials on an expedition to claim the island.\nJurisdictional disputes reemerged in the 1980s with the renovation of Ellis Island, and then again in the 1990s with the proposed redevelopment of the south side. New Jersey sued in 1997. The lawsuit was escalated to the Supreme Court, which ruled in \"New Jersey v. New York\". 523 U.S. 767 (1998) The border was redrawn using geographic information science data: It was decided that of the land fill area are territory of New Jersey and that , including the original island, are territory of New York. This caused some initial confusion, as some buildings straddled the interstate border. The ruling had no effect on the status of Liberty Island.\nAlthough the island remained under federal ownership after the lawsuit, New Jersey and New York agreed to share jurisdiction over the land itself. Neither state took any fiscal or physical responsibility for the maintenance, preservation, or improvement of any of the historic properties, and each state has jurisdiction over its respective land areas. Jersey City and New York City then gave separate tax lot numbers to their respective claims.\nPublic access.\nTwo ferry slips are located on the northern side of the basin that bisects Ellis Island. No charge is made for entrance to the Statue of Liberty National Monument, but there is a cost for the ferry service. A concession was granted in 2007 to Statue Cruises to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities, replacing Circle Line, which had operated the service since 1953. The ferries travel from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and the Battery in Lower Manhattan. Save Ellis Isand offers guided public tours of the south side as part of the \"Hard Hat Tour\".\nA bridge to Liberty State Park was built in 1986 for transporting materials and personnel during the island's late-1980s restoration. Originally slated to be torn down in 1992, it remained after construction was complete. It is not open to the public. The city of New York and the island's private ferry operator have opposed proposals to use it or replace it with a pedestrian bridge, and a 1995 proposal for a new pedestrian bridge to New Jersey was voted down in the United States House of Representatives. The bridge is not strong enough to be classified as a permanent bridge, and any action to convert it into a pedestrian passageway would require renovations.\nHistory.\nPrecolonial and colonial use.\nThe present-day Ellis Island was created by retreating glaciers at the end of the Wisconsin glaciation about 15,000 years ago. The island was described as a \"hummock along a plain fronting the west side of the Hudson River estuary,\" and when the glaciers melted, the water of the Upper New York Bay surrounded the mass. The native Mohegan name for the island was \"Kioshk\", meaning \"Gull Island\", in reference to Ellis Island's former large population of seagulls. Kioshk was composed mostly of marshy, brackish lowlands that disappeared underwater at high tide. The Native American tribes who lived nearby are presumed to have been hunter-gatherers who used the island to hunt for fish and oysters, as well as to build transient hunting and fishing communities there. It is unlikely that the Native Americans established permanent settlements on Kioshk, since the island would have been submerged at high tide.\nIn 1630, the Dutch bought Kioshk as a gift for Michael Reyniersz Pauw, who had helped found New Netherland. When the Dutch settled the area as part of New Netherland, the three islands in Upper New York Bay\u2014Liberty, Black Tom, and Ellis Islands\u2014were given the name Oyster Islands, alluding to the large oyster population nearby. The present-day Ellis Island was thus called \"Little Oyster Island\", a name that persisted through at least the early 1700s. During the early colonial period a sometime Maryland merchant named Isaac Bedloe purchased the island. Little Oyster Island was then sold to Captain William Dyre c.\u20091674, then to Thomas Lloyd on April 23, 1686. The island was then sold several more times, including to Enoch and Mary Story. During colonial times, Little Oyster Island became a popular spot for hosting oyster roasts, picnics, and clambakes because of its rich oyster beds. Evidence of recreational uses on the island was visible by the mid-18th century with the addition of commercial buildings to the northeast shore.\nBy the 1760s, Little Oyster Island became a public execution site for pirates, with executions occurring at one tree in particular, the \"Gibbet Tree\". However, there is scant evidence that this was common practice. Little Oyster Island was acquired by Samuel Ellis, a colonial New Yorker and merchant from Wrexham, Wales, in 1774; the island was ultimately named for him. He unsuccessfully attempted to sell the island nine years later. Ellis died in 1794, and as per his will, the ownership of Ellis Island passed to his daughter Catherine Westervelt's unborn son, who was also named Samuel. When the junior Samuel died shortly after birth, ownership passed to the senior Samuel's other two daughters, Elizabeth Ryerson and Rachel Cooder.\nMilitary use and Fort Gibson.\nEllis Island was also used by the military for almost 80 years. By the mid-1790s, as a result of the United States' increased military tensions with Britain and France, a U.S. congressional committee drew a map of possible locations for the First System of fortifications to protect major American urban centers such as New York Harbor.A small part of Ellis Island from \"the soil from high to low waters mark around Ellis's Island\" was owned by the city. On April 21, 1794, the city deeded that land to the state for public defense purposes. The following year, the state allotted $100,000 for fortifications on Bedloe's, Ellis, and Governors Islands, as well as the construction of Castle Garden (now Castle Clinton) along the Battery on Manhattan island. Batteries and magazines were built on Ellis Island in preparation for a war. A jetty was added to the northwestern extremity of the island, possibly from soil excavated from an inlet at the northeastern corner; the inlet was infilled by 1813. Though the military threat never materialized, further preparations were made in the late 1790s, when the Quasi War sparked fears of war with France; these new preparations were supervised by Ebenezer Stevens. The military conflict also failed to occur, and by 1805, the fort had become rundown.\nStevens, who observed that the Ellis family still owned most of the island, suggested selling off the land to the federal government. Samuel Ryerson, one of Samuel Ellis's grandsons, deeded the island to John A. Berry in 1806. The remaining portion of the island was acquired by condemnation the next year, and it was ceded to the United States on June 30, 1808, for $10,000. Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, placed in charge of New York Harbor defenses in the early 1800s, proposed several new fortifications around the harbor as part of the Second System of fortifications. The new fortifications included increased firepower and improved weaponry. The War Department established a circular stone 14-gun battery, a mortar battery (possibly of six mortars), magazine, and barracks. The fort was initially called Crown Fort, but by the end of the War of 1812 the battery was named Fort Gibson, in honor of Colonel James Gibson of the 4th Regiment of Riflemen, who was killed in the war during the Siege of Fort Erie. The fort was not used in combat during the war, and instead served as a barracks for the 11th Regiment, as well as a jail for British prisoners of war.\nImmediately after the end of the War of 1812, Fort Gibson was largely used as a recruiting depot. The fort went into decline due to under-use, and it was being jointly administered by the U.S. Army and Navy by the mid-1830s. Around this time, in 1834, the extant portions of Ellis Island was declared to be an exclave of New York within the waters of New Jersey. The era of joint administration was short-lived: the Army took over the fort's administration in 1841, demoted the fort to an artillery battery, and stopped garrisoning the fort, leaving a small Navy guard outside the magazine. By 1854, Battery Gibson contained an 11-gun battery, three naval magazines, a short railroad line, and several auxiliary structures such as a cookhouse, gun carriage house, and officers' quarters. The Army continued to maintain the fort until 1860, when it abandoned the weapons at Battery Gibson. The artillery magazine was expanded in 1861, during the American Civil War, and part of the parapet was removed.\nAt the end of the Civil War, the fort declined again, this time to an extent that the weaponry was rendered unusable. Through the 1870s, the Navy built additional buildings for its artillery magazine on Ellis Island, eventually constructing 11 buildings in total. Complaints about the island's magazines started to form, and by the 1870s, \"The New York Sun\" was publishing \"alarming reports\" about the magazines. The guns were ordered removed in 1881, and the island passed under the complete control of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance.\nFirst immigration station.\nThe Army had unsuccessfully attempted to use Ellis Island \"for the convalescence for immigrants\" as early as 1847. Across New York Harbor, Castle Clinton had been used as an immigration station since 1855, processing more than eight million immigrants during that time. The individual states had their own varying immigration laws until 1875, but the federal government regarded Castle Clinton as having \"varied charges of mismanagement, abuse of immigrants, and evasion of the laws\", and as such, wanted it to be completely replaced. The federal government assumed control of immigration in early 1890 and commissioned a study to determine the best place for the new immigration station in New York Harbor. Among members of the United States Congress, there were disputes about whether to build the station on Ellis, Governors, or Liberty Islands. Initially, Liberty Island was selected as the site for the immigration station, but due to opposition for immigration stations on both Liberty and Governors Islands, the committee eventually decided to build the station on Ellis Island. Since Castle Clinton's lease was about to expire, Congress approved a bill to build an immigration station on Ellis Island.\nOn April 11, 1890, the federal government ordered the magazine at Ellis Island be torn down to make way for the U.S.'s first federal immigration station at the site. The Department of the Treasury, which was in charge of constructing federal buildings in the U.S., officially took control of the island that May 24. Congress initially allotted $75,000 () to construct the station and later doubled that appropriation. While the building was under construction, the Barge Office at the Battery was used for immigrant processing. During construction, most of the old Battery Gibson buildings were demolished, and Ellis Island's land size was almost doubled to . The main structure was a two-story structure of Georgia Pine, which was described in \"Harper's Weekly\" as \"a latterday watering place hotel\" measuring . Its outbuildings included a hospital, detention building, laundry building, and utility plant that were all made of wood. Some of the former stone magazine structures were reused for utilities and offices. Additionally, a ferry slip with breakwater was built to the south of Ellis Island. Following further expansion, the island measured by the end of 1892.\nThe station opened on January 1, 1892, and its first immigrant was Annie Moore, a 17-year-old girl from Cork, Ireland, who was traveling with her two brothers to meet their parents in the U.S. On the first day, almost 700 immigrants passed over the docks. Over the next year, over 400,000 immigrants were processed at the station. The processing procedure included a series of medical and mental inspection lines, and through this process, some 1% of potential immigrants were deported. Additional building improvements took place throughout the mid-1890s, and Ellis Island was expanded to by 1896. The last improvements, which entailed the installation of underwater telephone and telegraph cables to Governors Island, were completed in early June 1897. On June 15, 1897, the wooden structures on Ellis Island were razed in a fire of unknown origin. While there were no casualties, the wooden buildings had completely burned down after two hours, and all immigration records from 1855 had been destroyed. Over five years of operation, the station had processed 1.5\u00a0million immigrants.\nSecond immigration station.\nDesign and construction.\nFollowing the fire, passenger arrivals were again processed at the Barge Office, which was soon unable to handle the large volume of immigrants. Within three days of the fire, the federal government made plans to build a new, fireproof immigration station. Legislation to rebuild the station was approved on June 30, 1897, and appropriations were made in mid-July. By September, the Treasury's Supervising Architect, James Knox Taylor, opened an architecture competition to rebuild the immigration station. The competition was the second to be conducted under the Tarsney Act of 1893, which had permitted private architects to design federal buildings, rather than government architects in the Supervising Architect's office. The contest rules specified that a \"main building with annexes\" and a \"hospital building\", both made of fireproof materials, should be part of each nomination. Furthermore, the buildings had to be able to host a daily average of 1,000 and maximum of 4,000 immigrants.Several prominent architectural firms filed proposals, and by December, it was announced that Edward Lippincott Tilton and William A. Boring had won the competition. Tilton and Boring's plan called for four new structures: a main building in the French Renaissance style, as well as the kitchen/laundry building, powerhouse, and the main hospital building. The plan also included the creation of a new island called island 2, upon which the hospital would be built, south of the existing island (now Ellis Island's north side). A construction contract was awarded to the R. H. Hood Company in August 1898, with the expectation that construction would be completed within a year, but the project encountered delays because of various obstacles and disagreements between the federal government and the Hood Company. A separate contract to build the island 2 had to be approved by the War Department because it was in New Jersey's waters; that contract was completed in December 1898. The construction costs ultimately totaled $1.5\u00a0million.\nEarly expansions.\nThe new immigration station opened on December 17, 1900, without ceremony. On that day, 2,251 immigrants were processed. Almost immediately, additional projects commenced to improve the main structure, including an entrance canopy, baggage conveyor, and railroad ticket office. The kitchen/laundry and powerhouse started construction in May 1900 and were completed by the end of 1901. A ferry house was also built between islands 1 and 2 c.\u20091901. The hospital, originally slated to be opened in 1899, was not completed until November 1901, mainly due to various funding delays and construction disputes. The facilities proved barely able to handle the flood of immigrants that arrived, and as early as 1903, immigrants had to remain in their transatlantic boats for several days due to inspection backlogs. Several wooden buildings were erected by 1903, including waiting rooms and a 700-bed barracks, and by 1904, over a million dollars' worth of improvements were proposed. The hospital was expanded from 125 to 250 beds in February 1907, and a new psychopathic ward debuted in November of the same year. Also constructed was an administration building adjacent to the hospital.\nImmigration commissioner William Williams made substantial changes to Ellis Island's operations, and during his tenure from 1902 to 1905 and 1909\u20131913, Ellis Island processed its peak number of immigrants. Williams also made changes to the island's appearance, adding plants and grading paths upon the once-barren landscape of Ellis Island. Under Williams's supervision, a third island was built to accommodate a proposed contagious-diseases ward, separated from existing facilities by of water. Island 3, as it was called, was located to the south of island 2 and separated from that island by a now-infilled ferry basin. The government bought the underwater area for island 3 from New Jersey in 1904, and a contract was awarded in April 1905. The islands were all connected via a cribwalk on their western sides (later covered with wood canopy), giving Ellis Island an overall \"E\"-shape. Upon the completion of island 3 in 1906, Ellis Island covered . A baggage and dormitory building was completed c.\u20091908\u20131909, and the main hospital was expanded in 1909. Alterations were made to the registry building and dormitories as well, but even this was insufficient to accommodate the high volume of immigrants. In 1911, Williams alleged that Congress had allocated too little for improvements to Ellis Island, even though the improvement budget that year was $868,000.\nAdditional improvements and routine maintenance work were completed in the early 1910s. A greenhouse was built in 1910, and the contagious-diseases ward on island 3 opened the following June. In addition, the incinerator was replaced in 1911, and a recreation center operated by the American Red Cross was also built on island 2 by 1915. These facilities generally followed the design set by Tilton and Boring. When the Black Tom explosion occurred on Black Tom Island in 1916, the complex suffered moderate damage; though all immigrants were evacuated safely, the main building's roof collapsed, and windows were broken. The main building's roof was replaced with a Guastavino-tiled arched ceiling by 1918. The immigration station was temporarily closed during World War I in 1917\u20131919, during which the facilities were used as a jail for suspected enemy combatants, and later as a treatment center for wounded American soldiers. Immigration inspections were conducted aboard ships or at docks. During the war, immigration processing at Ellis Island declined by 97%, from 878,000 immigrants per year in 1914 to 26,000 per year in 1919.\nEllis Island's immigration station was reopened in 1920, and processing had rebounded to 560,000 immigrants per year by 1921. There were still ample complaints about the inadequate condition of Ellis Island's facilities. However, despite a request for $5.6\u00a0million in appropriations in 1921, aid was slow to materialize, and initial improvement work was restricted to smaller projects such as the infilling of the basin between islands 2 and 3. Other improvements included rearranging features such as staircases to improve pedestrian flow. These projects were supported by president Calvin Coolidge, who in 1924 requested that Congress approve $300,000 in appropriations for the island. The allocations were not received until the late 1920s.\nConversion to detention center.\nWith the passing of the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, the number of immigrants being allowed into the United States declined greatly, ending the era of mass immigration. Following the Immigration Act of 1924, strict immigration quotas were enacted, and Ellis Island was downgraded from a primary inspection center to an immigrant-detention center, hosting only those that were to be detained or deported (see ). Final inspections were now instead conducted on board ships in New York Harbor. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 further decreased immigration, as people were now discouraged from immigrating to the U.S. Because of the resulting decline in patient counts, the hospital closed in 1930.\nEdward Corsi, who himself was an immigrant, became Ellis Island commissioner in 1931 and commenced an improvement program for the island. The initial improvements were utilitarian, focusing on such aspects as sewage, incineration, and power generation. In 1933, a federal committee led by the Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, was established to determine what operations and facilities needed improvement. The committee's report, released in 1934, suggested the construction of a new class-segregated immigration building, recreation center, ferry house, verandas, and doctors/nurses' quarters, as well as the installation of a new seawall around the island. These works were undertaken using Public Works Administration funding and Works Progress Administration labor, and were completed by the late 1930s. As part of the project, the surgeon's house and recreation center were demolished, and Edward Laning commissioned some murals for the island's buildings. Other improvements included the demolition of the greenhouse, the completion of the infilling of the basin between islands 2 and 3, and various landscaping activities such as the installation of walkways and plants. However, because of the steep decline in immigration, the immigration building went underused for several years, and it started to deteriorate.\nWith the start of World War II in 1939, Ellis Island was again used by the military, this time being used as a United States Coast Guard base. As during World War I, the facilities were used to detain enemy soldiers in addition to immigrants, and the hospital was used for treating injured American soldiers. So many combatants were detained at Ellis Island that administrative offices were moved to mainland Manhattan in 1943, and Ellis Island was used solely for detainment.\nBy 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, there were proposals to close Ellis Island due to the massive expenses needed for the upkeep of a relatively small detention center. The hospital was closed in 1950\u20131951 by the United States Public Health Service, and by the early 1950s, there were only 30 to 40 detainees left on the island. The island's closure was announced in mid-1954, when the federal government announced that it would construct a replacement facility on Manhattan. Ellis Island closed on November 12, 1954, with the departure of its last detainee, Norwegian merchant seaman Arne Pettersen, who had been arrested for overstaying his shore leave. At the time, it was estimated that the government would save $900,000 a year from closing the island. The ferryboat \"Ellis Island\", which had operated since 1904, stopped operating two weeks later.\nPost-closure.\nInitial redevelopment plans.\nAfter the immigration station closed, the buildings fell into disrepair and were abandoned, and the General Services Administration (GSA) took over the island in March 1955. The GSA wanted to sell off the island as \"surplus property\" and contemplated several options, including selling the island back to the city of New York or auctioning it to a private buyer. In 1959, real estate developer Sol Atlas unsuccessfully bid for the island, with plans to turn it into a $55\u00a0million resort with a hotel, marina, music shell, tennis courts, swimming pools, and skating rinks. The same year, Frank Lloyd Wright designed the $100\u00a0million \"Key Project\", which included housing, hotels, and large domes along the edges. However, Wright died before presenting the project. Other attempts at redeveloping the site, including a college, a retirement home, an alcoholics' rehabilitation center, and a world trade center were all unsuccessful. In 1963, the Jersey City Council voted to rezone the island's area within New Jersey for high-rise residential, monument/museum, or recreational use, though the new zoning ordinance banned \"Coney Island\"-style amusement parks.\nIn June 1964, the National Park Service published a report that proposed making Ellis Island part of a national monument. This idea was approved by Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall in October 1964. Ellis Island was added to the Statue of Liberty National Monument on May 11, 1965, and that August, President Lyndon B. Johnson approved the redevelopment of the island as a museum and park.\nThe initial master plan for the redevelopment of Ellis Island, designed by Philip Johnson, called for the construction of the Wall, a large \"stadium\"-shaped monument to replace the structures on the island's northwest side, while preserving the main building and hospital. However, no appropriations were immediately made, other than a $250,000 allocation for emergency repairs in 1967. By the late 1960s, the abandoned buildings were deteriorating severely. Johnson's plan was never implemented due to public opposition and a lack of funds. Another master plan was proposed in 1968, which called for the rehabilitation of the island's northern side and the demolition of all buildings, including the hospital, on the southern side. The Jersey City Jobs Corpsmen started rehabilitating part of Ellis Island the same year, in accordance with this plan. This was soon halted indefinitely because of a lack of funding. In 1970, a squatters' club called the National Economic Growth and Reconstruction Organization (NEGRO) started refurbishing buildings as part of a plan to turn the island into an addiction rehabilitation center, but were evicted after less than two weeks. NEGRO's permit to renovate the island were ultimately terminated in 1973.\nRestoration and reopening of north side.\nIn the 1970s, the NPS started restoring the island by repairing seawalls, eliminating weeds, and building a new ferry dock. Simultaneously, Peter Sammartino launched the Restore Ellis Island Committee to raise awareness and money for repairs. The north side of the island, comprising the main building and surrounding structures, was rehabilitated and partially reopened for public tours in May 1976. The plant was left unrepaired to show the visitors the extent of the deterioration. The NPS limited visits to 130 visitors per boat, or less than 75,000 visitors a year. Initially, only parts of three buildings were open to visitors. Further repairs were stymied by a lack of funding, and by 1982, the NPS was turning to private sources for funds.\nIn May 1982, President Ronald Reagan announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty\u2013Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca with former President Gerald Ford as honorary chairman, to raise the funds needed to complete the work. The plan for Ellis Island was to cost $128\u00a0million, and by the time work commenced in 1984, about $40\u00a0million had been raised. Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty\u2013Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group eventually raised more than $350\u00a0million in donations for the renovations of both the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Initial restoration plans included renovating the main building, baggage and dormitory building, and the hospital, as well as possibly adding a bandshell, restaurant, and exhibits. Two firms, Notter Finegold &amp; Alexander and Beyer Blinder Belle, designed the renovation. In advance of the renovation, public tours ceased in 1984, and work started the following year. As part of the restoration, the powerhouse was renovated, while the incinerator, greenhouse, and water towers were removed. The kitchen/laundry and baggage/dormitory buildings were restored to their original condition while the main building was restored to its 1918\u20131924 appearance.\nThe main building opened as a museum on September 10, 1990. Further improvements were made after the north side's renovation was completed. The Wall of Honor, a monument to raise money for the restoration, was completed in 1990 and reconstructed starting in 1993. A research facility with online database, the American Family Immigration History Center, was opened in April 2001. Subsequently, the ferry building was restored for $6.4\u00a0million and reopened in 2007. The north side was temporarily closed after being damaged in Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, though the island and part of the museum reopened exactly a year later, after major renovations.\nIn March 2020, the island was closed temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it reopened in August 2020, initially with strict capacity limits. A$100\u00a0million renovation of the Ellis Island museum began in early 2024; the changes included a three-story exhibition space and a new \"discovery center\". The NPS also announced plans to spend $17.7\u00a0million on renovating the museum buildings. Save Ellis Island, a nonprofit organization based in New Jersey, concurrently advocated for the preservation of the hospital buildings on the island's southern end. By 2023, Save Ellis Island had raised $70\u00a0million toward the buildings' renovation.\nStructures.\nThe current complex was designed by Edward Lippincott Tilton and William A. Boring, who performed the commission under the direction of the Supervising Architect for the U.S. Treasury, James Knox Taylor. Boring was responsible for the majority of the buildings. Tilton and Boring's plan, submitted in 1898, called for structures to be located on both the northern and southern portions of Ellis Island. The plan stipulated a large main building, a powerhouse, and a new baggage/dormitory and kitchen building on the north side of Ellis Island; a hospital on the south side; and a ferry dock with covered walkways at the head of the ferry basin, on the west side of the island. The plan roughly corresponds to what was ultimately built.\nNorth side.\nThe northern half of Ellis Island is composed of the former island 1. Only the areas associated with the original island, including much of the main building, are in New York; the remaining area is in New Jersey.\nMain building.\nThe present three-story main structure was designed in French Renaissance style. It is made of a steel frame, with a facade of red brick in Flemish bond ornamented with limestone trim. The structure is located above the mean waterline to prevent flooding. The building was initially composed of a three-story center section with two-story east and west wings, though the third stories of each wing were completed in the early 1910s. Atop the corners of the building's central section are four towers capped by cupolas of copper cladding. Some 160 rooms were included within the original design to separate the different functions of the building. Namely, the first floor was initially designed to handle baggage, detention, offices, storage and waiting rooms; the second floor, primary inspection; and the third floor, dormitories. However, in practice, these spaces generally served multiple functions throughout the immigration station's operating history. At opening, it was estimated that the main building could inspect 5,000 immigrants per day. The main building's design was highly acclaimed; at the 1900 Paris Exposition, it received a gold medal, and other architectural publications such as the \"Architectural Record\" lauded the design.\nThe first floor contained detention rooms, social service offices, and waiting rooms on its west wing, a use that remained relatively unchanged. The central space was initially a baggage room until 1907, but was subsequently subdivided and later re-combined into a single records room. The first floor's east wing also contained a railroad waiting room and medical offices, though much of the wing was later converted to record rooms. A railroad ticket office annex was added to the north side of the first floor in 1905\u20131906. The south elevation of the first floor contains the current immigration museum's main entrance, approached by a slightly sloped passageway covered by a glass canopy. Though the canopy was added in the 1980s, it evokes the design of an earlier glass canopy on the site that existed from 1902 to 1932.\nA registry room, with a ceiling, is located on the central section of the second floor. The room was used for primary inspections. Initially, there were handrails within the registry room that separated the primary inspection into several queues, but c. 1911 these were replaced with benches. A staircase from the first floor formerly rose into the middle of the registry room, but this was also removed around 1911. When the room's roof collapsed during the Black Tom explosion of 1916, the current Guastavino-tiled arched ceiling was installed, and the asphalt floor was replaced with red Ludowici tile. There are three large arched openings each on the northern and southern walls, filled-in with grilles of metal-and-glass. The southern elevation retains its original double-height arches, while the lower sections of the arches on the northern elevations were modified to make way for the railroad ticket office. On all four sides of the room, above the level of the third floor, is a clerestory of semicircular windows. The east wing of the second floor was used for administrative offices, while the west wing housed the special inquiry and deportation divisions, as well as dormitories.\nOn the third floor is a balcony surrounding the entire registry room. There were also dormitories for 600 people on the third floor. Between 1914 and 1918, several rooms were added to the third floor. These rooms included offices as well as an assembly room that were later converted to detention.\nThe remnants of Fort Gibson still exist outside the main building. Two portions are visible to the public, including the remnants of the lower walls around the fort.\nKitchen and laundry.\nThe kitchen and laundry structure is a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442-story structure located west of the main building. It is made of a steel frame and terracotta blocks, with a granite base and a facade of brick in Flemish bond. Originally designed as two separate structures, it was redesigned in 1899 as a single structure with kitchen-restaurant and laundry-bathhouse components, and was subsequently completed in 1901. A &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442-story ice plant on the northern elevation was built between 1903 and 1908, and was converted into a ticket office in 1935. It has a facade of brick in English and stretcher bond. Today, the kitchen and laundry contains NPS offices as well as the museum's \"Peopling of America\" exhibit.\nThe building has a central portion with a narrow gable roof, as well as pavilions on the western and eastern sides with hip roofs; the roof tiling was formerly of slate and currently of Ludowici terracotta. The larger eastern pavilion, which contained the laundry-bathhouse, had hipped dormers. The exterior-facing window and door openings contain limestone features on the facade, while the top of the building has a modillioned copper cornice. Formerly, there was also a two-story porch on the southern elevation. Multiple enclosed passageways connect the kitchen and laundry to adjacent structures.\nBakery and carpentry shop.\nThe bakery and carpentry shop is a two-story structure located west of the kitchen and laundry building. It is roughly rectangular and oriented north\u2013south. It is made of a steel frame with a granite base, a flat roof, and a facade of brick in Flemish bond. The building was constructed in 1914\u20131915 to replace the separate wooden bakery and carpentry shop buildings, as well as two sheds and a frame waiting room. There are no exterior entrances, and the only access is via the kitchen and laundry. The first floor generally contained oven rooms, baking areas and storage while the second floor contained the carpentry shop.\nBaggage and dormitory.\nThe baggage and dormitory structure is a three-story structure located north of the main building. It is made of a steel frame and terracotta blocks, with a limestone base and a facade of brick in Flemish bond. Completed as a two-story structure c.\u20091908\u20131909, the baggage and dormitory building replaced a 700-bed wooden barracks nearby that operated between 1903 and 1911. The baggage and dormitory initially had baggage collection on its first floor, dormitories and detention rooms on its second floor, and a tiled garden on its roof. The building received a third story, and a two-story annex to the north side, in 1913\u20131914. Initially, the third floor included additional dormitory space while the annex provided detainees with outdoor porch space. A detainee dining room on the first floor was expanded in 1951.\nThe building is mostly rectangular except for its northern annex and contains an interior courtyard, skylighted at the second floor. On its facade the first story has rectangular windows in arched window openings while the second and third stories have rectangular windows and window openings. There are cornices below the second and third stories. The annex contains wide window openings with narrow brick piers outside them. The roof's northwest corner contains a one-story extension. Multiple wings connect the baggage and laundry to its adjacent buildings.\nPowerhouse.\nThe powerhouse of Ellis Island is a two-story structure located north of the kitchen and laundry building and west of the baggage and dormitory building. It is roughly rectangular and oriented north\u2013south. Like the kitchen and laundry, it was completed in 1901. It is made of a steel frame with a granite base, a facade of brick in Flemish bond, and decorative bluestone and limestone elements. The hip roof contains dormers and is covered with terracotta tiling. A brick smokestack rises from ground level.\nFormerly, the powerhouse provided almost all power for Ellis Island. A coal trestle at the northwest end was used to transport coal for power generation from 1901 to 1932, when the powerhouse started using fuel oil. The powerhouse also generated steam for the island. After the immigration station closed, the powerhouse deteriorated and was left unrepaired until the 1980s renovation. The powerhouse is no longer operational; instead, the island receives power from 13,200-volt cables that lead from a Public Service Electric &amp; Gas substation in Liberty State Park. The powerhouse contains sewage pumps that can dispose of up to to the Jersey City Sewage Authority sewage system. A central heating plant was installed during the 1980s renovation.\nSouth side.\nThe southern side of Ellis Island, located across the ferry basin from the northern side, is composed of island 2 (created in 1899) and island 3 (created in 1906). The entire southern side of the island is in New Jersey, and the majority of the site is occupied by the hospital buildings. A central corridor runs southward from the ferry building on the west side of the island. Two additional corridors split eastward down the centers of islands 2 and 3.\nIsland 2.\nIsland 2 comprises the northern part of Ellis Island's southern portion. The structures share the same design: a brick facade in Flemish bond, quoins, and limestone ornamentation. All structures were internally connected via covered passageways.The laundry-hospital outbuilding is south of the ferry terminal, and was constructed in 1900\u20131901 along with the now-demolished surgeon's house. The structure is one and a half stories tall with a hip roof and skylights facing to the north and south. Repaired repeatedly throughout its history, the laundry-outbuilding was last restored in 2002. It had linen, laundry, and disinfecting rooms; a boiler room; a morgue with autopsy room; and quarters for the laundry staff on the second floor.\nTo the east is the psychopathic ward, a two-story building erected 1906\u20131907. The building is the only structure in the hospital complex to have a flat roof, and formerly also had a porch to its south. It housed 25 to 30 beds and was intended for the temporary treatment of immigrants suspected of being insane or having mental disorders, pending their deportation, hospitalization, or commitment to sanatoria. Male and female patients were segregated, and there were also a dayroom, veranda, nurse's office, and small pantry on each floor. In 1952 the psychopathic ward was converted into a Coast Guard brig.\nThe main building is directly east of the psychopathic ward. It is composed of three similarly designed structures: from west to east, they are Hospital Building No. 1 (built 1900\u20131901), the Administration Building (1905\u20131907), and Hospital Building No. 2 (1908\u20131909). The 3.5-story building no. 1 is shaped like an inverted \"C\" with two 2.5-story rectangular wings facing southward; the wings contain two-story-tall porches. The administration building is smaller but also 3.5 stories. The 3.5-story building no. 2 is similar to building no. 1, but also has a three-story porch at the south elevation of the central pavilion. All three buildings have stone-stoop entrances on their north facades and courtyards on their south.\nRecreation hall.\nThe recreation hall and one of the island's two recreation shelters are located between islands 2 and 3 on the western side of Ellis Island, at the head of the former ferry basin between the two landmasses. Built in 1937 in the Colonial Revival style, the structures replaced an earlier recreation building at the northeast corner of island 2.\nThe recreation hall is a two-story building with a limestone base, a facade of brick in Flemish bond, a gable roof, and terracotta ornamentation. The first floor contained recreational facilities, while the second floor was used mostly for offices. It contains wings on the north, south, and west. The recreation shelter, a one-story brick pavilion, is located directly to the east. A second shelter of similar design was located adjacent to the power plant on the island's north side.\nIsland 3.\nAs part of the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, the contagious disease hospital comprised 17 pavilions, connected with a central connecting corridor. Each pavilion contained separate hospital functions that could be sealed off from each other. Most of the structures were completed in 1911. The pavilions included eight measles wards, three isolation wards, a power house/sterilizer/autopsy theater, mortuary, laboratory, administration building, kitchen, and staff house. All structures were designed by James Knox Taylor in the Italian Renaissance style and are distinguished by red-tiled Ludowici hip roofs, roughcast walls of stucco, and ornamentation of brick and limestone.\nThe office building and laboratory is a 2.5-story structure located at the west end of island 3. It housed doctors' offices and a dispensary on the first floor, along with a laboratory and pharmacists' quarters on the second floor. In 1924, the first floor offices were converted into male nurses' quarters. A one-story morgue is located east of the office building, and was converted to the \"Animal House\" circa 1919.\nAn L-shaped powerhouse and laundry building, built in 1908, is also located on the west side of island 3. It has a square north wing with boiler, coal, and pump rooms, as well as a rectangular south wing with laundry and disinfection rooms, staff kitchen, and staff pantry. The powerhouse and laundry also had a distinctive yellow-brick smokestack. Part of the building was converted into a morgue and autopsy room in the 1930s.\nTo the east are the eight measles pavilions (also known as wards A-H), built in phases from 1906 to 1909 and located near the center of island 3. There are four pavilions each to the west and east of island 3's administration building. All of the pavilions are identical, two-story rectangular structures. Each pavilion floor had a spacious open ward with large windows on three sides and independent ventilation ducts. A hall leading to the connecting corridor was flanked by bathrooms, nurses' duty room, offices, and a serving kitchen.\nThe administration building is a 3.5-story structure located on the north side of island 3's connecting corridor, in the center of the landmass. It included reception rooms, offices, and a staff kitchen on the first floor; nurses' quarters and operating rooms on the second floor; and additional staff quarters on the third floor. A one-story kitchen with a smokestack is located opposite the administration building to the south.\nThe eastern end of island 3 contained three isolation pavilions (wards I-K) and a staff building. The isolation pavilions were intended for patients for more serious diseases, including scarlet fever, diphtheria, and a combination of either of these diseases with measles and whooping cough. Each pavilion is a 1.5-story rectangular structure. Wards I and K are located to the south of the connecting corridor while ward J is located to the north; originally, all three pavilions were freestanding structures, but covered ways were built between wards I and K and the center corridor in 1914. There were also nurses' quarters in each attic. The staff building. located at the extreme east end of island 3's connecting corridor, is a 2.5-story building for high-ranking hospital staff. Living and dining rooms, a kitchen, and a library were located on the first floor while bedrooms were located on the second floor.\nFerry building.\nThe ferry building is at the western end of the ferry basin, within New Jersey. The current structure was built in 1936 and is the third ferry landing to occupy the site. It is made of a steel-and-concrete frame with a facade of red brick in Flemish bond, and limestone and terracotta ornamentation, in the Moderne architectural style. The building's central pavilion is mostly one story tall, except for a two-story central section that is covered by a hip roof with cupola. Two rectangular wings are located to the north and south and are oriented east\u2013west. The south wing was originally reserved for U.S. Customs while the north wing contained a lunchroom and restrooms. A wooden dock extends east from the ferry building. The ferry building is connected to the kitchen and laundry to the north, and the hospital to the south, via covered walkways. The structure was completely restored in 2007.\nImmigration procedures.\nBy the time Ellis Island's immigration station closed, almost 12 million immigrants had been processed by the U.S. Bureau of Immigration. It is estimated that 10.5\u00a0million immigrants departed for points across the United States from the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal nearby. Others would have used one of the other terminals along the North River/Hudson River at that time. At the time of closure, it was estimated that closer to 20 million immigrants had been processed or detained at Ellis Island.\nImmigrants did not need a passport, visa, or any other document to enter the country. Transportation companies were in charge of all checks; if the entry was denied, the company was fined $100 per each deported passenger, and covered the costs of their deportation. Initial immigration policy provided for the admission of most immigrants to the United States, other than those with mental or physical disabilities, or a moral, racial, religious, or economic reason for exclusion. At first, the majority of immigrants arriving were Northern and Western Europeans, with the largest numbers coming from the German Empire, the Russian Empire and Finland, the United Kingdom, and Italy. Eventually, these groups of peoples slowed in the rates that they were coming in, and immigrants came in from Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, The Middle East, and North Africa, including Jews. These people immigrated for a variety of reasons including escaping political and economic oppression, as well as persecution, destitution, and violence. Often among these groups were Swedes, Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Croats, Serbs, Slovaks, Italians, Greeks, Turks, Armenians, Syrians, Lebanese, and Egyptians.\nImmigration through Ellis Island peaked in the first decade of the 20th century. Between 1905 and 1914, an average of one million immigrants per year arrived in the United States. Immigration officials reviewed about 5,000 immigrants per day during peak times at Ellis Island. Two-thirds of those individuals emigrated from Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, Central Europe, The Middle East, and North Africa. The peak year for immigration at Ellis Island was 1907, with 1,004,756 immigrants processed, and the all-time daily high occurred on April 17 of that year, when 11,747 immigrants arrived. Following the Immigration Act of 1924, which both greatly reduced immigration and allowed processing overseas, Ellis Island was only used by those who had problems with their immigration paperwork, as well as displaced persons and war refugees. This affected both nationwide and regional immigration processing: only 2.34 million immigrants passed through the Port of New York from 1925 to 1954, compared to the 12 million immigrants processed from 1900 to 1924. Average annual immigration through the Port of New York from 1892 to 1924 typically numbered in the hundreds of thousands, though after 1924, annual immigration through the port was usually in the tens of thousands.\nAccording to a 2025 estimate from \"Reason\" magazine, two out of every five Americans may be descended from someone who passed through Ellis Island. Other estimates posit that as many as 100 million Americans, as of 2019, are descendants of an immigrant who passed through Ellis Island moving to the United States from another country.\nInspections.\nMedical inspection.\nBeginning in the 1890s, initial medical inspections were conducted by steamship companies at the European ports of embarkation; further examinations and vaccinations occurred on board ship during the voyage to New York. On arrival at the port of New York, ships halted at the New York state quarantine station near the Narrows. Those with serious contagious diseases (such as cholera and typhus) were quarantined at Hoffman Island or Swinburne Island, two artificial islands off the shore of Staten Island to the south. The islands ceased to be used for quarantine by the 1920s due to the decline in inspections at Ellis Island. For the vast majority of passengers, since most transatlantic ships could not dock at Ellis Island due to shallow water, the ships unloaded at Manhattan first, and steerage passengers were then taken to Ellis Island for processing. First- and second-class passengers, and American passengers of any class, typically bypassed the Ellis Island processing altogether.\nTo support the activities of the United States Bureau of Immigration, the United States Public Health Service operated an extensive medical service. The medical force at Ellis Island started operating when the first immigration station opened in 1892, and was suspended when the station burned down in 1897. Between 1897 and 1902, medical inspections took place both at other facilities in New York City and on ships in the New York Harbor. A second hospital called U.S. Marine Hospital Number 43 or the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital was built in 1902 and operated through 1930. Uniformed military surgeons staffed the medical division, which was active in the hospital wards, the Battery's Barge Office, and Ellis Island's Main Building. Immigrants were brought to the island via barge from their transatlantic ships.\nA \"line inspection\" was conducted in the main building. In the line inspection, the immigrants were split into several single-file lines, and inspectors first checked for any visible physical disabilities. Each immigrant was inspected by two inspectors: one to catch any initial physical disabilities, and another to check for any other ailments that the first inspector did not notice. The doctors then observed immigrants as they walked, to determine any irregularities in their gait. Immigrants were asked to drop their baggage and walk up the stairs to the second floor.\nThe line inspection at Ellis Island was unique because of the volume of people it processed, and as such, used several unconventional methods of medical examination. For example, after an initial check for physical disabilities, inspectors used special forceps or the buttonhook to examine immigrants for signs of eye diseases such as trachoma. Following each examination, inspectors used chalk to draw symbols on immigrants who were suspected to be sick. Some immigrants supposedly wiped the chalk marks off surreptitiously or inverted their clothes to avoid medical detention. Chalk-marked immigrants and those with suspected mental disabilities were then sent to rooms for further inspection, according to a 1917 account.\nThe symbols used for chalk markings were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPrimary inspection.\nOnce immigrants had completed and passed the medical examination, they were sent to the Registry Room to undergo what was called primary inspection. This consisted of interrogations conducted by U.S. Immigrant Inspectors to determine if each newcomer was eligible for admission. In addition, any medical certificates issued by physicians were taken into account. Aside from the U.S. immigrant inspectors, the Bureau of Immigration work force included interpreters, watchmen, matrons, clerks and stenographers. According to a reconstruction of immigration processes in 1907, immigrants who passed the initial inspections spent two to five hours at Ellis Island to do these interviews. Arrivals were asked a couple dozen questions, including name, occupation, and the amount of money they carried. The government wanted to determine whether new arrivals would be self-sufficient upon arrival, and on average, wanted the immigrants to have between $18 and $25 (worth between $ and $ as of 2024). Some immigrants were also given literacy tests in their native languages, though children under 16 were exempt. The determination of admissibility was relatively arbitrary and determined by the individual inspector.\nU.S. Immigrant Inspectors used some other symbols or marks as they interrogated immigrants in the Registry Room to determine whether to admit or detain them, including:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThose who were cleared were given a medical certificate or an affidavit. According to a 1912 account by physician Alfred C. Reed, immigrants were medically cleared only after three on-duty physicians signed an affidavit. Those with visible illnesses were deported or held in the island's hospital. Those who were admitted often met with relatives and friends at the Kissing Post, a wooden column outside the registry room.\nBetween 1891 and 1930, Ellis Island reviewed over 25 million attempted immigrants, of which 700,000 were given certificates of disability or disease and of these 79,000 were barred from entry. Approximately 4.4% of immigrants between 1909 and 1930 were classified as disabled or diseased, and one percent of immigrants were deported yearly due to medical causes. The proportion of \"diseased\" increased to 8.0% during the Spanish flu of 1918\u20131919. More than 3,000 attempted immigrants died in the island's hospital. Some unskilled workers were deemed \"likely to become a public charge\" and so were rejected; about 2% of immigrants were deported. Immigrants could also be excluded if they were disabled and previously rejected; if they were Chinese, regardless of their citizenship status; or if they were contract laborers, stowaways, and workaways. However, immigrants were exempt from deportation if they had close family ties to a U.S. permanent resident or citizen, or if they were seamen. Ellis Island was sometimes known as the \"Island of Tears\" or \"Heartbreak Island\" for these deportees. If immigrants were rejected, appeals could be made to a three-member board of inquiry.\nMass detentions and deportations.\nEllis Island's use as a detention center dates from World War I, when it was used to house those who were suspected of being enemy soldiers. During the war, six classes of \"enemy aliens\" were established, including officers and crewmen from interned ships; three classes of Germans; and suspected spies. After the American entry into World War I, about 1,100 German and Austrian naval officers and crewmen in the Ports of New York and New London were seized and held in Ellis Island's baggage and dormitory building. A commodious stockade was built for the seized officers. A 1917 \"New York Times\" article depicted the conditions of the detention center as being relatively hospitable.\nAnti-immigrant sentiments developed in the U.S. during and after World War I, especially toward Southern and Eastern Europeans who were entering the country in large numbers. Following the Immigration Act of 1924, primary inspection was moved to New York Harbor, and Ellis Island only hosted immigrants that were to be detained or deported. After the passage of the 1924 act, the Immigration Service established multiple classes of people who were said to be \"deportable\". This included immigrants who entered in violation of previous exclusion acts; Chinese immigrants in violation of the 1924 act; those convicted of felonies or other \"crimes of moral turpitude\"; and those involved in prostitution.\nDuring and immediately following World War II, Ellis Island was used to hold German merchant mariners and \"enemy aliens\"\u2014Axis nationals detained for fear of spying, sabotage, and other fifth column activity. When the U.S. entered the war in December 1941, Ellis Island held 279 Japanese, 248 Germans, and 81 Italians removed from the East Coast. Unlike other wartime immigration detention stations, Ellis Island was designated as a permanent holding facility and was used to hold foreign nationals throughout the war. A total of 7,000 Germans, Italians and Japanese were ultimately detained at Ellis Island.\nThe Internal Security Act of 1950 barred members of communist or fascist organizations from immigrating to the United States. Two notable communists known to have been imprisoned on Ellis Island include Billy Strachan, a pioneer of black civil rights in Britain, and Ferdinand Smith who co-founded the first desegregated union in the history of the United States. Ellis Island saw detention peak at 1,500, but by 1952, after changes to immigration laws and policies, only 30 to 40 detainees remained. One of the last detainees was the Indonesian Aceh separatist Hasan di Tiro who declared himself the leader of the rebellious Darul Islam movement, lost his Indonesian citizenship, and was held on Ellis Island for illegal immigration.\nEugenic influence.\nWhen immigration through Ellis Island peaked, eugenic ideals gained broad popularity, making a heavy impact on immigration to the United States by way of exclusion of disabled and \"morally defective\" people. Eugenicists of the late 19th and early 20th century believed human reproductive selection should be carried out by the state as a collective decision. For many eugenicists, this was considered a patriotic duty as they held an interest in creating a greater national race. Henry Fairfield Osborn's opening words to the \"New York Evening Journal\" in 1911 were, \"As a biologist as well as a patriot...,\" on the subject on advocating for tighter inspections of immigrants of the United States.\nEugenic selection occurred on two distinguishable levels:\nAt the time, it was a broadly popular idea that immigration policies had ought to be based on eugenics principles in order to help create a \"superior race\" in America. To do this, defective persons needed to be screened by immigration officials and denied entry on the basis of their disability.\nDuring the line inspection process, ailments were marked using chalk. There were three types of illness that were screened for:\nThe people with moral or mental disability, who were of higher concern to officials and under the law, were required to be excluded from entry to the United States. Persons with a physical disability were under higher inspection and could be turned away on the basis of their defect. This exclusionary practice of admission came in part from the eugenicist belief that defects are hereditary, especially those of a moral and mental nature, though these are often outwardly signified by physical deformity as well. As Chicago surgeon Eugene S. Talbot wrote in 1898, \"crime is hereditary, a tendency which is, in most cases, associated with bodily defects.\" Likewise, George Lydston, a medicine and criminal anthropology professor, wrote in 1906 that people with \"defective physique\" were not just criminally associated but that defectiveness was a primary factor \"in the causation of crime.\"\nLeadership.\nWithin the U.S. Bureau of Immigration, there were fifteen commissioners assigned to oversee immigration procedures at the Port of New York, and thus, operations at Ellis Island. The twelve commissioners through 1940 were political appointees selected by the U.S. president; the political parties listed are those of the president who appointed each commissioner. One man, William Williams, served twice as commissioner.\nThe final three commissioners held a non-partisan position of \"district director\". The district directors were:\nName-change myth.\nAccording to popular legend, immigrants were unwillingly or unknowingly given new names (especially last names or surnames), though this claim is not supported by substantive evidence. Rather, immigration officials simply used the names from the manifests of steamship companies, which served as the only immigration records for those entering the United States. Records show that immigration officials often actually corrected mistakes in immigrants' names, since inspectors knew three languages on average and each worker was usually assigned to process immigrants who spoke the same languages.\nMany immigrant families Americanized their surnames afterward, either immediately following the immigration process or gradually after assimilating into American culture. Because the average family changed their surname five years after immigration, the Naturalization Act of 1906 required documentation of name changes. The myth of name changes at Ellis Island still persists, likely because of the perception of the immigration center as a formidable port of arrival, and because it is used in popular books and movies such as \"The Godfather Part II\".\nCurrent use.\nThe island is administered by the National Park Service, though fire protection and medical services are also provided by the Jersey City Fire Department. In extreme medical emergencies, there is also a helicopter for medical evacuations.\nEllis Island National Museum of Immigration.\nThe Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration opened on September 10, 1990, replacing the American Museum of Immigration on Liberty Island, which closed in 1991. The museum contains several exhibits across three floors of the main building, with a first-floor expansion into the kitchen-laundry building. The first floor houses the main lobby within the baggage room, the Family Immigration History Center, \"Peopling of America\", and \"New Eras of Immigration\". The second floor includes the registry room, the hearing room, \"Through America's Gate\", and \"Peak Immigration Years\". The third floor contains a dormitory room, \"Restoring a Landmark\", \"Silent Voices\", \"Treasures from Home\", and \"Ellis Island Chronicles\", as well as rotating exhibits. There are also three theaters used for film and live performances. The third floor contains a library, reading room, and \"oral history center\", while the theaters are located on the first and second floors. There are auditoriums on all floors. On the ground floor is a gift shop and bookstore, as well as a booth for audio tours.\nIn 2008, by act of Congress and despite opposition from the NPS, the museum's library was officially renamed the Bob Hope Memorial Library in honor of one of the station's most famous immigrants, comedian Bob Hope. On May 20, 2015, the Ellis Island Immigration Museum was officially renamed the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration, coinciding with the opening of the new Peopling of America galleries in the first floor of the kitchen-laundry building. The expansion tells the entire story of American immigration, including before and after the periods that Ellis Island processed immigrants.\nWall of Honor.\nThe Wall of Honor outside the main building contains a list of 775,000 names inscribed on 770 panels, including slaves, Native Americans, and immigrants that were not processed on the island. The Wall of Honor originated in the late 1980s as a means to pay for Ellis Island's renovation, and initially included 75,000 names. The wall originally opened in 1990 and consisted of copper panels. Shortly afterward it was reconstructed in two phases: a circular portion that started in 1993, and a linear portion that was built between 1998 and 2001. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation requires potential honorees to pay a fee for inscription. By 2019, the wall was mostly full and only five panels remained to be inscribed.\nNPS provides several educational opportunities, including self-guided tours and immersive, role-playing activities. These educational programs and resources cater to over 650,000 students per year and aim to promote discussion while fostering a climate of tolerance and understanding.\nSouth side.\nThe south side of the island, home to the Ellis Island Immigrant Hospital, is abandoned and remains unrenovated. Disagreements over its proposed use have precluded any development on the south side for several decades. The NPS held a competition for proposals to redevelop the south side in 1981 and ultimately selected a plan for a conference center and a 250-to-300-room Sheraton hotel on the site of the hospital. In 1985, while restoration of the north side of Ellis Island was underway, Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel convened a long-inactive federal commission to determine how the south side of Ellis Island should be used. Though the hotel proposal was dropped in 1986 for lack of funds, the NPS allowed developer William Hubbard to redevelop the south side as a convention center, though Hubbard was not able to find investors. The south side was proposed for possible future development even through the late 1990s.\nSave Ellis Island led preservation efforts of the south side of the island. The ferry building remains only partially accessible to the general public. As part of the National Park Service's Centennial Initiative, the south side of the island was to be the target of a project to restore the 28 buildings that have not yet been rehabilitated.\nIn 2014, Save Ellis Island started offering guided public tours of the south side as part of the \"Hard Hat Tour\", which charges an additional fee that is used to support the organization's preservation efforts. The south side also includes \"Unframed \u2013 Ellis Island\", an art installation by the French street artist JR, which includes murals of figures who would have occupied each of the respective hospital buildings.\nCultural impact.\nCommemorations.\nThe Ellis Island Medal of Honor is awarded annually to American citizens, both native-born and naturalized. According to the award's sponsors, the medal is given to those who \"have distinguished themselves within their own ethnic groups while exemplifying the values of the American way of life.\" Past medalists include seven U.S. presidents, several world leaders, several Nobel Prize winners, and other leaders and pioneers. The USPS issued an Ellis Island commemorative stamp on February 3, 1998, as part of the Celebrate the Century stamp sheet series.\nHistorical designations.\nEllis Island has been part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, which also includes the Statue of Liberty and Liberty Island, since 1965. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1966. Ellis Island has also been on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places since 1971. The main building's interior was made a New York City designated landmark in 1993, and the entire island was made a New York City historic district at the same time. In addition, it was placed on UNESCO's list of tentative World Heritage Sites in 2017.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n \nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOther archives.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nChildren's books.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9808", "revid": "199747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9808", "title": "Euripides", "text": "5th-century BC Athenian playwright\nEuripides (; , ; c.\u2009480\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009406 BC) was a Greek tragedian of classical Athens. Along with Aeschylus and Sophocles, he is one of the three authors of Greek tragedy for whom any plays have survived in full. Some ancient scholars attributed ninety-five plays to him, but the \"Suda\" says it was ninety-two at most. Nineteen plays attributed to Euripides have survived more or less complete, although one of these (\"Rhesus\") is often considered not to be genuinely his work. Many fragments (some of them substantial) survive from most of his other plays. More of his plays have survived intact than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together, partly because his popularity grew as theirs declined: he became, in the Hellenistic Age, a cornerstone of ancient literary education, along with Homer, Demosthenes, and Menander.\nEuripides is identified with theatrical innovations that have profoundly influenced drama down to modern times, especially in the representation of traditional, mythical heroes as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. This new approach led him to pioneer developments that later writers adapted to comedy, some of which are characteristic of romance. He was referred to by Aristotle as \"the most tragic of poets\", probably in reference to a perceived preference for unhappy endings, but Aristotle's remark is seen by Bernard Knox as having wider relevance, since \"in his representation of human suffering Euripides pushes to the limits of what an audience can stand; some of his scenes are almost unbearable.\" Focusing on the inner lives and motives of his characters in a way previously unknown, Euripides was \"the creator of ... that cage which is the theatre of Shakespeare's \"Othello\", Racine's \"Ph\u00e8dre\", of Ibsen and Strindberg,\" in which \"imprisoned men and women destroy each other by the intensity of their loves and hates\". But he was also the literary ancestor of comic dramatists as diverse as Menander and George Bernard Shaw.\nIn the comedies of his contemporary Aristophanes, Euripides is lampooned for his intellectualism. Modern scholars have varied greatly in their views of Euripides, with some regarding him as an iconoclastic intellectual, and others seeing him as a more traditional playwright. Euripides's portrayal of women has attracted particular interest in modern times, on account of the perceptiveness and sympathy with which Euripides depicts women and the difficulties facing them in Greek society, especially in his \"Medea\".\nLife.\nTraditional accounts of the author's life are found in many commentaries, and include details such as these: He was born on Salamis Island around 480 BC, with parents Cleito (mother) and Mnesarchus (father), a retailer from the deme of Phlya. On receiving an oracle that his son was fated to win \"crowns of victory\", Mnesarchus insisted that the boy should train for a career in athletics. But the boy was destined for a career on the stage (where he was to win only five victories, one of these posthumously). He served for a short time as both dancer and torch-bearer at the rites of Apollo Zosterius. His education was not confined to athletics, studying also painting and philosophy under the masters Prodicus and Anaxagoras. He had two disastrous marriages, and both his wives\u2014Melite and Choerine (the latter bearing him three sons)\u2014were unfaithful. He became a recluse, making a home for himself in a cave on Salamis (the Cave of Euripides, where a cult of the playwright developed after his death). \"There he built an impressive library and pursued daily communion with the sea and sky\". The details of his death are uncertain. It was traditionally held that he retired to the \"rustic court\" of King Archelaus in Macedonia, where he died in 406 BC. Some modern scholars however claim that in reality Euripides may have never visited Macedonia at all, or if he did, he might have been drawn there by King Archelaus with incentives that were also offered to other artists.\nSuch biographical details derive almost entirely from three unreliable sources:\nThe next three sections expand on the claims of each of these sources, respectively.\nA fabled life.\nEuripides was the youngest in a group of three great tragedians, who were almost contemporaries: his first play was staged thirteen years after Sophocles's debut, and three years after Aeschylus's \"Oresteia\". The identity of the trio is neatly underscored by a patriotic account of their roles during Greece's great victory over Persia at the Battle of Salamis: Aeschylus fought there, Sophocles was just old enough to celebrate the victory in a boys' chorus, and Euripides was born on the very day of the battle. The apocryphal account, that he composed his works in a cave on Salamis island, was a late tradition, probably symbolizing the isolation of an intellectual ahead of his time. Much of his life, and his whole career, coincided with the struggle between Athens and Sparta for hegemony in Greece, but he did not live to see the final defeat of his city. It is said that he died in Macedonia after being attacked by the Molossian hounds of King Archelaus, and that his cenotaph near Piraeus was struck by lightning\u2014signs of his unique powers, whether for good or ill (according to one modern scholar, his death might have been caused instead by the harsh Macedonian winter). In an account by Plutarch, the catastrophic failure of the Sicilian expedition led Athenians to trade renditions of Euripides's lyrics to their enemies in return for food and drink (\"Life of Nicias\" 29). Plutarch also provides the story that the victorious Spartan generals, having planned the demolition of Athens and the enslavement of its people, grew merciful after being entertained at a banquet by lyrics from Euripides's play \"Electra\": \"they felt that it would be a barbarous act to annihilate a city which produced such men\" (\"Life of Lysander\").\nA comic life.\nTragic poets were often mocked by comic poets during the dramatic festivals Dionysia and Lenaia, and Euripides was travestied more than most. Aristophanes scripted him as a character in at least three plays: \"The Acharnians\", \"Thesmophoriazusae\" and \"The Frogs\". But Aristophanes also borrowed, rather than merely satirized, some of the tragedian's methods; he was himself ridiculed by Cratinus, another comic poet, as: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014Cratinus F 342\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014Storey\nAccording to another comic poet, Teleclides, the plays of Euripides were co-authored by the philosopher Socrates:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014Teleclides, F41-42\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014Storey\nAristophanes alleged that the co-author was a celebrated actor, Cephisophon, who also shared the tragedian's house and his wife, while Socrates taught an entire school of quibblers like Euripides:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014Aristophanes, \"Frogs\" [1490\u201399]\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014Henderson\nIn \"The Frogs\", written when Euripides and Aeschylus were dead, Aristophanes has the god Dionysus venturing down to Hades in search of a good poet to bring back to Athens. After a debate between the shades of Aeschylus and Euripides, the god brings Aeschylus back to life, as more useful to Athens, for his wisdom, rejecting Euripides as merely clever. Such comic 'evidence' suggests that Athenians admired Euripides even while they mistrusted his intellectualism, at least during the long war with Sparta. Aeschylus had written his own epitaph commemorating his life as a warrior fighting for Athens against Persia, without any mention of his success as a playwright; and Sophocles was celebrated by his contemporaries for his social gifts, and contributions to public life as a state official; but there are no records of Euripides's public life except as a dramatist\u2014he could well have been \"a brooding and bookish recluse\". He is presented as such in \"The Acharnians\", where Aristophanes shows him to be living morosely in a precarious house, surrounded by the tattered costumes of his disreputable characters (and yet Agathon, another tragic poet, is discovered in a later play, \"Thesmophoriazusae\", to be living in circumstances almost as bizarre). Euripides's mother was a humble vendor of vegetables, according to the comic tradition, yet his plays indicate that he had a liberal education and hence a privileged background.\nA tragedian's life.\nEuripides first competed in the City Dionysia, the famous Athenian dramatic festival, in 455 BC, one year after the death of Aeschylus; and did not win first prize until 441 BC. His final competition in Athens was in 408 BC. \"The Bacchae\" and \"Iphigenia in Aulis\" were performed in 405 BC, and first prize was awarded posthumously. He won first prize only five times.\nHis plays, and those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, indicate a difference in outlook between the three\u2014a generation gap probably due to the Sophistic enlightenment in the middle decades of the 5th century: Aeschylus still looked back to the archaic period, Sophocles was in transition between periods, and Euripides was fully imbued with the new spirit of the classical age. When Euripides's plays are sequenced in time, they also reveal that his outlook might have changed, providing a \"spiritual biography\", along these lines:\nHowever, about 80% of his plays have been lost, and even the extant plays do not present a fully consistent picture of his 'spiritual' development (for example, \"Iphigenia in Aulis\" is dated with the 'despairing' \"Bacchae\", yet it contains elements that became typical of New Comedy). In the \"Bacchae\", he restores the chorus and messenger speech to their traditional role in the tragic plot, and the play appears to be the culmination of a regressive or archaizing tendency in his later works (for which see Chronology below). Believed to have been composed in the wilds of Macedonia, \"Bacchae\" also dramatizes a primitive side to Greek religion, and some modern scholars have interpreted this particular play biographically, therefore, as:\nOne of his earliest extant plays, \"Medea\", includes a speech that he seems to have written in defence of himself as an intellectual ahead of his time (spoken by Medea):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u03c3\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b9 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u1f70 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u1f70&lt;br&gt;\u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c7\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u1f50 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c6\u03c5\u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9\u00b7&lt;br&gt;\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03b4\u1fbf \u03b1\u1f56 \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd&lt;br&gt;\u03ba\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03b5\u1f76\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bb\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc7.&lt;br&gt;\u1f10\u03b3\u1f7c \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f74 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd\u1ff6 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 [298\u2013302].&lt;br&gt;If you bring novel wisdom to fools, you will be regarded as useless, not wise; and if the city regards you as greater than those with a reputation for cleverness, you will be thought vexatious. I myself am a sharer in this lot.\nWork.\nAthenian tragedy in performance during Euripides's lifetime was a public contest between playwrights. The state funded it and awarded prizes. The language was metrical, spoken and sung. The performance area included a circular floor (called orchestra) where the chorus could dance, a space for actors (three speaking actors in Euripides's time), a backdrop or skene, and some special effects: an ekkyklema (used to bring the skene's \"indoors\" outdoors) and a mechane (used to lift actors in the air, as in deus ex machina). With the introduction of the third actor (attributed to Aeschylus by Themistius; to Sophocles by Aristotle), acting also began to be regarded as a skill worth prizes, requiring a long apprenticeship in the chorus. Euripides and other playwrights accordingly composed more and more arias for accomplished actors to sing, and this tendency became more marked in his later plays: tragedy was a \"living and ever-changing genre\" (cf. previous section, and Chronology; a list of his plays is below).\nEuripides was distinguished by a series of philosophical and artistic positions that he seems to profess, as well as by the great attention he placed on the concept of freedom, which he articulated in various ways throughout his works. In general, he was interested in the \"issues related to the constitutive polarities of Athenian ideology\", that is to say, the oppositions between women and men, slaves and free people, foreigners and Greeks, among others. In this regard, the playwright presented slavery, the foundation of Athenian society, as a product of force and therefore fundamentally unjust. He also sought to place the audience \"inside his characters by deep sympathy\". The playwright was engaged in a \"constant search for truth and realism\", which drove him to treat women or marital subjects with interest. In this context, Euripides developed detailed female characters with real personalities. This phenomenon is so prevalent that women make up almost all of his characters who think and philosophize. \nThe comic poet Aristophanes is the earliest known critic to characterize Euripides as a spokesman for destructive, new ideas associated with declining standards in both society and tragedy (see Reception for more). But fifth-century tragedy was a social gathering for \"carrying out quite publicly the maintenance and development of mental infrastructure\", and it offered spectators a \"platform for an utterly unique form of institutionalized discussion\". The dramatist's role was not only to entertain but also educate fellow citizens\u2014he was expected to have a message. Traditional myth provided the subject matter, but the dramatist was meant to be innovative, which led to novel characterizations of heroic figures and use of the mythical past as a tool for discussing present issues. The difference between Euripides and his older colleagues was one of degree: his characters talked about the present more controversially and pointedly than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, sometimes even challenging the democratic order. Thus, for example, Odysseus is represented in \"Hecuba\" (lines 131\u201332) as \"agile-minded, sweet-talking, demos-pleasing\", i.e. similar to the war-time demagogues that were active in Athens during the Peloponnesian War. Speakers in the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles sometimes distinguish between slaves who are servile by nature and those servile by circumstance, but Euripides's speakers go further, positing an individual's mental, rather than social or physical, state as a true indication of worth. For example, in \"Hippolytus\", a love-sick queen rationalizes her position and, reflecting on adultery, arrives at this comment on intrinsic merit:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u1f10\u03ba \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd&lt;br&gt;\u03c4\u03cc\u03b4\u1fbf \u1f26\u03c1\u03be\u03b5 \u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9 \u03b3\u03af\u03b3\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u00b7&lt;br&gt;\u1f45\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03c7\u03c1\u1f70 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b4\u03bf\u03ba\u1fc7,&lt;br&gt;\u1f26 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03b3\u1fbf \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac. &lt;br&gt;[...] \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03cc \u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u1fbf \u1f01\u03bc\u03b9\u03bb\u03bb\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b2\u03af\u1ff3,&lt;br&gt;\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd \u03ba\u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u1f74\u03bd \u1f45\u03c4\u1ff3 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u1fc7 [409\u2013427].&lt;br&gt;This contagion began for the female sex with the nobility. For when those of noble station resolve on base acts, surely the base-born will regard such acts as good. [...] One thing only, they say, competes in value with life, the possession of a heart blameless and good.\nEuripides's characters resembled contemporary Athenians rather than heroic figures of myth.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For achieving his end Euripides' regular strategy is a very simple one: retaining the old stories and the great names, as his theatre required, he imagines his people as contemporaries subjected to contemporary kinds of pressures, and examines their motivations, conduct and fate in the light of contemporary problems, usages and ideals.\u2014\u200a\nAs mouthpieces for contemporary issues, they \"all seem to have had at least an elementary course in public speaking\". The dialogue often contrasts so strongly with the mythical and heroic setting that it can seem like Euripides aimed at parody. For example, in \"The Trojan Women\", the heroine's rationalized prayer elicits comment from Menelaus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u0395\u039a\u0391\u0392\u0397: [...] \u0396\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, \u03b5\u1f34\u03c4\u1fbf \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03ba\u03b7 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f34\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd,&lt;br&gt;\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b7\u03c5\u03be\u03ac\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5\u00b7 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b4\u03b9\u1fbf \u1f00\u03c8\u03cc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5&lt;br&gt;\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b8\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u1fbf \u1f04\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2.&lt;br&gt;\u039c\u0395\u039d\u0395\u039b\u0391\u039f\u03a3: \u03c4\u03af \u03b4\u1fbf \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd; \u03b5\u1f50\u03c7\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f61\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u1ff6\u03bd [886\u2013889].&lt;br&gt;Hecuba: [...] Zeus, whether you are the necessity of nature or the mind of mortal men, I address you in prayer! For proceeding on a silent path you direct all mortal affairs toward justice!&lt;br&gt;Menelaus: What does this mean? How strange your prayer to the gods is!\nAthenian citizens were familiar with rhetoric in the assembly and law courts, and some scholars believe that Euripides was more interested in his characters as speakers with cases to argue than as characters with lifelike personalities. They are self-conscious about speaking formally, and their rhetoric is shown to be flawed, as if Euripides were exploring the problematical nature of language and communication: \"For speech points in three different directions at once, to the speaker, to the person addressed, to the features in the world it describes, and each of these directions can be felt as skewed\". For example, in the quotation above, Hecuba presents herself as a sophisticated intellectual describing a rationalized cosmos, but the speech is ill-suited to her audience, the unsophisticated listener Menelaus, and is found to not suit the cosmos either (her grandson is murdered by the Greeks). In \"Hippolytus\", speeches appear verbose and ungainly, as if to underscore the limitations of language.\nLike Euripides, both Aeschylus and Sophocles created comic effects, contrasting the heroic with the mundane, but they employed minor supporting characters for that purpose. Euripides was more insistent, using major characters as well. His comic touches can be thought to intensify the overall tragic effect, and his realism, which often threatens to make his heroes look ridiculous, marks a world of debased heroism: \"The loss of intellectual and moral substance becomes a central tragic statement\". Psychological reversals are common and sometimes happen so suddenly that inconsistency in characterization is an issue for many critics, such as Aristotle, who cited \"Iphigenia in Aulis\" as an example (\"Poetics\" 1454a32). For others, psychological inconsistency is not a stumbling block to good drama: \"Euripides is in pursuit of a larger insight: he aims to set forth the two modes, emotional and rational, with which human beings confront their own mortality.\" Some think unpredictable behaviour realistic in tragedy: \"everywhere in Euripides a preoccupation with individual psychology and its irrational aspects is evident...In his hands tragedy for the first time probed the inner recesses of the human soul and let \"passions spin the plot\".\" The tension between reason and passion is symbolized by his characters' relationship with the gods: For example, Hecuba's prayer is answered not by Zeus, nor by the law of reason, but by Menelaus, as if speaking for the old gods. And the perhaps most famous example is in \"Bacchae\" where the god Dionysus savages his own converts. When the gods do appear (in eight of the extant plays), they appear \"lifeless and mechanical\". Sometimes condemned by critics as an unimaginative way to end a story, the spectacle of a \"god\" making a judgement or announcement from a theatrical crane might actually have been intended to provoke scepticism about the religious and heroic dimension of his plays. Similarly, his plays often begin in a banal manner that undermines theatrical illusion. Unlike Sophocles, who established the setting and background of his plays in the introductory dialogue, Euripides used a monologue in which a divinity or human character simply tells the audience all it needs to know to understand what follows, and provided 'cues' for the audience reaction to key moments in his plays through the part of the chorus.\nAeschylus and Sophocles were innovative, but Euripides had arrived at a position in the \"ever-changing genre\" where he could easily move between tragic, comic, romantic, and political effects. This versatility appears in individual plays and also over the course of his career. Potential for comedy lay in his use of 'contemporary' characters, in his sophisticated tone, his relatively informal Greek (see In Greek below), and in his ingenious use of plots centred on motifs that later became standard in Menander's New Comedy (for example the 'recognition scene'). Other tragedians also used recognition scenes, but they were heroic in emphasis, as in Aeschylus's \"The Libation Bearers\", which Euripides parodied in \"Electra\" (Euripides was unique among the tragedians in incorporating theatrical criticism in his plays). Traditional myth with its exotic settings, heroic adventures, and epic battles offered potential for romantic melodrama as well as for political comments on a war theme, so that his plays are an extraordinary mix of elements. \"The Trojan Women\", for example, is a powerfully disturbing play on the theme of war's horrors, apparently critical of Athenian imperialism (it was composed in the aftermath of the Melian massacre and during the preparations for the Sicilian Expedition), yet it features the comic exchange between Menelaus and Hecuba quoted above, and the chorus considers Athens, the \"blessed land of Theus\", to be a desirable refuge\u2014such complexity and ambiguity are typical both of his \"patriotic\" and \"anti-war\" plays.\nTragic poets in the fifth century competed against one another at the City Dionysia, each with a tetralogy of three tragedies and a satyr play. The few extant fragments of satyr plays attributed to Aeschylus and Sophocles indicate that these were a loosely structured, simple, and jovial form of entertainment. But in \"Cyclops\" (the only complete satyr-play that survives), Euripides structured the entertainment more like a tragedy and introduced a note of critical irony typical of his other work. His genre-bending inventiveness is shown above all in \"Alcestis\", a blend of tragic and satyric elements. This fourth play in his tetralogy for 438 BC (i.e., it occupied the position conventionally reserved for satyr plays) is a \"tragedy\", featuring Heracles as a satyric hero in conventional satyr-play scenes: an arrival, a banquet, a victory over an ogre (in this case, death), a happy ending, a feast, and a departure for new adventures. Most of the big innovations in tragedy were made by Aeschylus and Sophocles, but \"Euripides made innovations on a smaller scale that have impressed some critics as cumulatively leading to a radical change of direction\".\nEuripides is also known for his use of irony. Many Greek tragedians make use of dramatic irony to bring out the emotion and realism of their characters or plays, but Euripides uses irony to foreshadow events and occasionally amuse his audience. For example, in his play \"Heracles\", Heracles comments that all men love their children and wish to see them grow. The irony here is that Heracles will be driven into madness by Hera and will kill his children. Similarly, in \"Helen\", Theoclymenus remarks how happy he is that his sister has the gift of prophecy and will warn him of any plots or tricks against him (the audience already knows that she has betrayed him). In this instance, Euripides uses irony not only for foreshadowing but also for comic effect\u2014which few tragedians did. Likewise, in the \"Bacchae\", Pentheus's first threat to the god Dionysus is that if Pentheus catches him in his city, he will 'chop off his head', whereas it is Pentheus who is beheaded at the end of the play.\nLanguage.\nThe spoken language of the Euripidean plays is not fundamentally different in style from that of Aeschylus or Sophocles: it employs poetic meters, a rarefied vocabulary, fullness of expression, complex syntax, and ornamental figures, all aimed at representing an elevated style. But its rhythms are somewhat freer, and more natural, than that of his predecessors, and the vocabulary has been expanded to allow for intellectual and psychological subtleties. Euripides has been hailed as a great lyric poet. In \"Medea\", for example, he composed for his city, Athens, \"the noblest of her songs of praise\". His lyrical skills are not just confined to individual poems: \"A play of Euripides is a musical whole...one song echoes motifs from the preceding song, while introducing new ones.\" For some critics, the lyrics often seem dislocated from the action, but the extent and significance of this is \"a matter of scholarly debate\". See Chronology for details about his style.\nReception.\nEuripides was so widely read in the antique education that only Homer surpassed him. But the breadth of reception drew mixed responses. He aroused, and continues to arouse, strong opinions for and against his work:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was a problem to his contemporaries and he is one still; over the course of centuries since his plays were first produced he has been hailed or indicted under a bewildering variety of labels. He has been described as 'the poet of the Greek enlightenment' and also as 'Euripides the irrationalist'; as a religious sceptic if not an atheist, but on the other hand, as a believer in divine providence and the ultimate justice of divine dispensation. He has been seen as a profound explorer of human psychology and also a rhetorical poet who subordinated consistency of character to verbal effect; as a misogynist and a feminist; as a realist who brought tragic action down to the level of everyday life and as a romantic poet who chose unusual myths and exotic settings. He wrote plays which have been widely understood as patriotic pieces supporting Athens's war against Sparta and others which many have taken as the work of the anti-war dramatist \"par excellence,\" even as attacks on Athenian imperialism. He has been recognized as the precursor of New Comedy and also what Aristotle called him: 'the most tragic of poets' (\"Poetics\" 1453a30). And not one of these descriptions is entirely false. \u2014 Bernard Knox\nAeschylus gained thirteen victories as a dramatist; Sophocles at least twenty; Euripides only four in his lifetime; and this has often been taken as indication of the latter's unpopularity. But a first place might not have been the main criterion for success (the system of selecting judges appears to have been flawed), and merely being chosen to compete was a mark of distinction. Moreover, to have been singled out by Aristophanes for so much comic attention is proof of popular interest in his work. Sophocles was appreciative enough of the younger poet to be influenced by him, as is evident in his later plays \"Philoctetes\" and \"Oedipus at Colonus\". According to Plutarch, Euripides had been very well received in Sicily, to the extent that after the failure of the Sicilian Expedition, many Athenian captives were released, simply for being able to teach their captors whatever fragments they could remember of his work. Less than a hundred years later, Aristotle developed an almost \"biological' theory of the development of tragedy in Athens: the art form grew under the influence of Aeschylus, matured in the hands of Sophocles, then began its precipitous decline with Euripides. However, \"his plays continued to be applauded even after those of Aeschylus and Sophocles had come to seem remote and irrelevant\"; they became school classics in the Hellenistic period (as mentioned in the introduction) and, due to Seneca's adaptation of his work for Roman audiences, \"it was Euripides, not Aeschylus or Sophocles, whose tragic muse presided over the rebirth of tragedy in Renaissance Europe.\"\nIn the seventeenth century, Racine expressed admiration for Sophocles, but was more influenced by Euripides (\"Iphigenia in Aulis\" and \"Hippolytus\" were the models for his plays \"Iphig\u00e9nie\" and \"Ph\u00e8dre\"). Euripides's reputation was to take a beating in the early 19th century, when Friedrich Schlegel and his brother August Wilhelm Schlegel championed Aristotle's 'biological' model of theatre history, identifying Euripides with the moral, political, and artistic degeneration of Athens. August Wilhelm's Vienna lectures on dramatic art and literature went through four editions between 1809 and 1846; and, in them, he opined that Euripides \"not only destroyed the external order of tragedy but missed its entire meaning\". This view influenced Friedrich Nietzsche, who seems, however, not to have known the Euripidean plays well. But literary figures, such as the poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning, could study and admire the Schlegels, while still appreciating Euripides as \"our Euripides the human\" (\"Wine of Cyprus\" stanza 12). Classicists such as Arthur Verrall and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff reacted against the views of the Schlegels and Nietzsche, constructing arguments sympathetic to Euripides, which involved Wilamowitz in this restatement of Greek tragedy as a genre: \"A [Greek] tragedy does not have to end 'tragically' or be 'tragic'. The only requirement is a serious treatment.\" In the English-speaking world, the pacifist Gilbert Murray played an important role in popularizing Euripides, influenced perhaps by his anti-war plays. Today, as in the time of Euripides, traditional assumptions are constantly under challenge, and audiences therefore have a natural affinity with the Euripidean outlook, which seems nearer to ours, for example, than the Elizabethan. As stated above, however, opinions continue to diverge, so that modern readers might actually \"seem to feel a special affinity with Sophocles\"; one recent critic might dismiss the debates in Euripides's plays as \"self-indulgent digression for the sake of rhetorical display\"; and one spring to the defence: \"His plays are remarkable for their range of tones and the gleeful inventiveness, which morose critics call cynical artificiality, of their construction.\"\nTexts.\nTransmission.\nThe textual transmission of the plays, from the 5th century BC, when they were first written, until the era of the printing press, was a largely haphazard process. Much of Euripides's work was lost or corrupted; but the period also included triumphs by scholars and copyists, thanks to whom much was recovered and preserved. Summaries of the transmission are often found in modern scholarly editions of the plays, three of which are used as sources for this summary.\nThe plays of Euripides, like those of Aeschylus and Sophocles, circulated in written form. But literary conventions that we take for granted today had not been invented: there was no spacing between words; no consistency in punctuation, nor elisions; no marks for breathings and accents (guides to pronunciation, and word recognition); no convention to denote change of speaker; no stage directions; and verse was written straight across the page, like prose. Possibly, those who bought texts supplied their own interpretative markings. Papyri discoveries have indicated, for example, that a change in speakers was loosely denoted with a variety of signs, such as equivalents of the modern dash, colon, and full-stop. The absence of modern literary conventions (which aid comprehension), was an early and persistent source of errors, affecting transmission. Errors were also introduced when Athens replaced its old Attic alphabet with the Ionian alphabet, a change sanctioned by law in 403\u2013402 BC, adding a new complication to the task of copying. Many more errors came from the tendency of actors to interpolate words and sentences, producing so many corruptions and variations that a law was proposed by Lycurgus of Athens in 330 BC \"that the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides should be written down and preserved in a public office; and that the town clerk should read the text over with the actors; and that all performances which did not comply with this regulation should be illegal.\" The law was soon disregarded, and actors continued to make changes until about 200 BC, after which the habit ceased. It was about then that Aristophanes of Byzantium compiled an edition of all the extant plays of Euripides, collated from pre-Alexandrian texts, furnished with introductions and accompanied by a commentary that was \"published\" separately. This became the \"standard edition\" for the future, and it featured some of the literary conventions that modern readers expect: there was still no spacing between words; little or no punctuation; and no stage directions; but abbreviated names denoted changes of speaker; lyrics were broken into \"cola\" and \"strophai\", or lines and stanzas; and a system of accentuation was introduced.\nAfter this creation of a standard edition, the text was fairly safe from errors, besides slight and gradual corruption introduced with tedious copying. Many of these trivial errors occurred in the Byzantine period, following a change in script (from uncial to minuscule). Many of these errors were \"homophonic\" errors, the equivalent (for instance) of substituting \"right\" for \"write\" in English: there were many opportunities for Byzantine scribes to make errors of this sort, since \u03b7, \u03b9, \u03bf\u03b9 and \u03b5\u03b9 were pronounced similarly in the Byzantine period.\nAround 200 AD, ten of the plays of Euripides began to be circulated in a select edition, possibly for use in schools, with some commentaries or scholia recorded in the margins. Similar editions had appeared for Aeschylus and Sophocles\u2014the only plays of theirs that survive today. In Euripides's case, however, a further nine plays have also survived, compiled in alphabetical order as if from a set of his collected works, without any scholia attached. These \"alphabetical\" plays were combined with the \"select\" edition by some unknown Byzantine scholar, bringing together the nineteen plays that survive today. The \"select\" plays are found in many medieval manuscripts, but only two manuscripts preserve the \"Alphabetical\" plays. These two manuscripts are usually denoted as L and P, after the Laurentian Library at Florence, and the Bibliotheca Palatina in the Vatican, where they are stored. It is believed that P derived its texts of all the \"alphabetical\" plays and of some (but not all) \"select\" plays from copies of an ancestor of L. P contains all the extant plays of Euripides, but \"Trojan Woman\" and the latter part of \"Bacchae\" are missing from L. (For a list of the \"select\" and \"alphabetical\" plays, see Extant plays below.)\nIn addition to the medieval manuscripts, there are some papyri preserving fragments from Euripides's work. These papyrus fragments are often recovered only with modern technology. In June 2005, for example, classicists at the University of Oxford worked on a joint project with Brigham Young University, using multi-spectral imaging technology to retrieve previously illegible writing (see References). Some of this work employed infrared technology\u2014previously used for satellite imaging\u2014to detect previously unknown material by Euripides, in fragments of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, a collection of ancient manuscripts held by the university.\nIt is from such materials that modern scholars try to piece together copies of the original plays. Sometimes the picture is almost lost. Thus, for example, two extant plays, \"The Phoenician Women\" and \"Iphigenia in Aulis\", are significantly corrupted by interpolations (the latter possibly being completed post mortem by the poet's son); and the very authorship of \"Rhesus\" is a matter of dispute. In fact, the very existence of the Alphabet plays, or rather the absence of an equivalent edition for Sophocles and Aeschylus, could distort our notions of distinctive Euripidean qualities\u2014most of his least \"tragic\" plays are in the Alphabet edition; and, possibly, the other two tragedians would appear just as genre-bending as this \"restless experimenter\", if we possessed more than their \"select\" editions.\nChronology.\nOriginal production dates for some of Euripides's plays are known from ancient records, such as lists of prize-winners at the Dionysia; and approximations are obtained for the remainder by various means. Both the playwright and his work were travestied by comic poets such as Aristophanes, the known dates of whose own plays can serve as a terminus ad quem for those of Euripides (though the gap can be considerable: twenty-seven years separate \"Telephus\", known to have been produced in 438 BC, from its parody in \"Thesmophoriazusae\" in 411 BC.). References in Euripides's plays to contemporary events provide a terminus a quo, though sometimes the references might even precede a datable event (e.g. lines 1074\u201389 in \"Ion\" describe a procession to Eleusis, which was probably written before the Spartans occupied it during the Peloponnesian War). Other indications of dating are obtained by stylometry.\nGreek tragedy comprised lyric and dialogue, the latter mostly in iambic trimeter (three pairs of iambic feet per line). Euripides sometimes 'resolved' the two syllables of the iamb (\u02d8\u00af) into three syllables (\u02d8\u02d8\u02d8), and this tendency increased so steadily over time that the number of resolved feet in a play can indicate an approximate date of composition (see Extant plays below for one scholar's list of resolutions per hundred trimeters). Associated with this increase in resolutions was an increasing vocabulary, often involving prefixes to refine meanings, allowing the language to assume a more natural rhythm, while also becoming ever more capable of psychological and philosophical subtlety.\nThe trochaic tetrameter catalectic\u2014four pairs of trochees per line, with the final syllable omitted\u2014was identified by Aristotle as the original meter of tragic dialogue (\"Poetics\" 1449a21). Euripides employs it here and there in his later plays, but seems not to have used it in his early plays at all, with \"The Trojan Women\" being the earliest appearance of it in an extant play\u2014it is symptomatic of an archaizing tendency in his later works.\nThe later plays also feature extensive use of stichomythia (i.e. a series of one-liners). The longest such scene comprises one hundred and five lines in \"Ion\" (lines 264\u2013369). By contrast, Aeschylus never exceeds twenty lines of stichomythia, while Sophocles's longest such scene (\"Electra\", 1176\u20131226) is fifty lines long, and that is interrupted several times by antilabe.\nEuripides's use of lyrics in sung parts shows the influence of Timotheus of Miletus in the later plays\u2014the individual singer gained prominence, and was given additional scope to demonstrate his virtuosity in lyrical duets, as well as replacing some of the chorus's functions with monodies. At the same time, choral odes began to take on something of the form of dithyrambs reminiscent of the poetry of Bacchylides, featuring elaborate treatment of myths. Sometimes these later choral odes seem to have only a tenuous connection with the plot, linked to the action only in their mood. The \"Bacchae\", however, shows a reversion to old forms, possibly as a deliberate archaic effect, or because there were no virtuoso choristers in Macedonia (where it is said to have been written).\nExtant plays.\nKey:\nDate indicates date of first production.\nPrize indicates a place known to have been awarded in festival competition.\nLineage: S denotes plays surviving from a 'Select' or 'School' edition, A plays surviving from an 'Alphabetical' edition\u2014see Transmission above for details.\nResolutions: Number of resolved feet per 100 trimeters, Ceadel's list\u2014see Chronology above for details.\nGenre: Generic orientation (see 'Transmission' section) with additional notes in brackets.\nLost and fragmentary plays.\nThe following plays have come down to us in fragmentary form, if at all. They are known through quotations in other works (sometimes as little as a single line); pieces of papyrus; partial copies in manuscript; part of a collection of hypotheses (or summaries); and through being parodied in the works of Aristophanes. Some of the fragments, such as those of \"Hypsipyle\", are extensive enough to allow tentative reconstructions to be proposed.\nA two-volume selection from the fragments, with facing-page translation, introductions, and notes, was published by Collard, Cropp, Lee, and Gibert; as were two Loeb Classical Library volumes derived from them; and there are critical studies in T. B. L.

She also co-authored a book of poetry with her sisters Charlotte and Anne entitled \"Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell\".\nEmily was the fifth of six Bront\u00eb siblings, four of whom survived into adulthood. Her mother died when she was three, leaving the children in the care of their aunt, Elizabeth Branwell. Apart from brief intervals at school, Emily was mostly taught at home by her father, Patrick Bront\u00eb, who was the curate of Haworth. She was very close to her siblings, especially her younger sister Anne, and together they wrote little books and journals depicting imaginary worlds. She was described by her sister Charlotte as solitary, strong-willed and nonconforming, with a keen love of nature and animals.\nApart from a brief period at school, and another as a student and teacher in Brussels with her sister Charlotte, Emily spent most of her life at home in Haworth, helping the family servant with chores, playing the piano and teaching herself from books.\nHer work was originally published under the pen name Ellis Bell. It was not generally admired at the time, and many critics felt that the characters in \"Wuthering Heights\" were coarse and immoral. In spite of this, the novel is now considered to be a classic of English literature. Emily Bront\u00eb died in 1848, aged 30, a year after its publication.\nEarly life.\nEmily Bront\u00eb was born on 30 July 1818 to Maria Branwell, the daughter of a wealthy Penzance merchant and property owner, and Patrick Bront\u00eb, a curate from an impoverished Irish family. The Bront\u00eb family lived in Market Street, in Thornton, a village on the outskirts of Bradford, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Their house is now open to the public and is known as the Bront\u00eb Birthplace.Emily was the fifth of six siblings, preceded by Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte and Branwell. In 1820, Anne, the last Bront\u00eb child, was born. Soon after Anne's birth, the family moved away to the village of Haworth, in the Pennines, where Patrick Bront\u00eb took employment as perpetual curate. Haworth was a small community with an unusually high early mortality rate. In 1850, Benjamin Herschel Babbage reported deeply insanitary conditions, including contamination to the village water supply from the overcrowded graveyard nearby. This is believed to have had a serious impact on the health of Emily and her siblings.\nCowan Bridge school.\nOn 15 September 1821, Maria Branwell died, after a long illness which her nurse believed to have been uterine cancer. Her sister, Elizabeth Branwell, had joined the household to nurse her, and made the move permanent to care for the three-year-old Emily and her siblings. Elizabeth Branwell was not especially maternal, taking her meals alone, as did Patrick Bront\u00eb. She is portrayed as a stern disciplinarian in Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, but Nick Holland states in his biography of her that she also had an affectionate and supportive side.\nIn 1824, Emily and her three elder sisters were sent to the newly-opened Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge. At her admission, the school register said of Emily that she \"reads very prettily, and works a little\". At six years old, she was the youngest student, and the superintendent described her as \"quite the pet nursling of the school\". The children suffered severe privations at Cowan Bridge, including poor and insufficient food, unsanitary conditions, harsh discipline and frequent outbreaks of infectious disease such as typhoid and tuberculosis. In 1825, following an outbreak of typhoid fever, Maria and Elizabeth both fell ill, and were sent home, where they died of tuberculosis within three months of one other. After this, Charlotte and Emily were brought back to Haworth by their father. The children were subsequently educated at home, and were cared for by their aunt Elizabeth Branwell, who had given up her plans to return to Penzance, and the house servant, Tabby Ackroyd.\nEarly influences.\nThe Bront\u00eb children were encouraged by their father and aunt to develop their literary talents and to take an interest in politics and current affairs. Girls were not allowed access to the public library, but Branwell borrowed books which he shared with his sisters, and Patrick Bront\u00eb had a large personal library, to which he allowed his children access. Thus Emily and her siblings read a wide range of published material, including books, periodicals and magazines. Favourites included: Aesop's \"Fables\", the \"Arabian Nights\", Walter Scott's \"Tales of a Grandfather\" and \"Blackwood's Magazine,\" as well as Oliver Goldsmith's \"A History of England\" and J. Goldsmith's \"A Grammar of General Geography\". In 1833 or 1834 Patrick Bront\u00eb bought a piano, and Emily became proficient in its use. The Bront\u00eb children were also tutored in drawing and painting, as well as in Latin and Classics. They were familiar with the work of Thomas Bewick and John Martin, the engravings of William Finden, and illustrations from \"The Literary Souvenir.\" Twenty-nine drawings and paintings by Emily are known to have survived, including a watercolour painting of her dog, Keeper.\nIn spite of his desire for his children to receive as comprehensive an education as possible, Patrick Bront\u00eb himself was cold and emotionally distant, and exhibited a number of marked eccentricities, such as carrying a loaded gun at all times and imposing a number of idiosyncratic personal rules on the household. Elizabeth Gaskell's biography of Charlotte depicts him as prone to violent rages, once cutting up a dress belonging to his wife because he felt it encouraged vanity, and forbidding his children to eat meat in case it made them too dependent on their physical comfort, although Patrick himself denied this, and Gaskell's account is now generally considered to have been an exaggeration. He had retained an Irish accent, which the siblings shared as children, and this contributed to the perception that they were outsiders, never quite fitting into the Yorkshire community. A local woman later told Elizabeth Gaskell that the Bront\u00eb children had no friends in the village, and on one occasion when they were invited to a party, showed no knowledge of the games played by their peers. Left to their own devices, the siblings were unusually close, and remained so, especially Emily and Anne, who were described by a family friend, Ellen Nussey, as being \"like twins\".\nJuvenilia.\nInspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell Bront\u00eb had received as a gift from his father, the children began to write stories, which they set in the complex imaginary worlds of Glass Town and Angria. These stories, which became increasingly detailed, were initially populated by these soldiers (referred to by the children as \"The Young Men\", or \"the Twelves\") as well as their real-life heroes, the Duke of Wellington and his sons, Charles and Arthur Wellesley. The siblings created tiny books for the soldiers to \"read\", some of which are on display at the Bront\u00eb Parsonage in Haworth, and, in December 1827 they produced a novel, \"Glass Town.\" Little of Emily's work from this period survives, except for poems spoken by characters.When Emily was thirteen, she and Anne withdrew from participation in the Angria story and began a new one about Gondal, a fictional island whose myths and legends were to preoccupy the two sisters throughout their lives. With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne's lists of Gondal's characters and place names, Emily and Anne's Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some \"diary papers\", written by Emily in her twenties, which describe current events in Gondal. The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image of the Scottish Highlander, a sort of British version of the \"noble savage\". The tales of Gondal also feature a queen called Augusta Geraldine Almeda, whose character bears some similarities with that of Catherine Earnshaw in \"Wuthering Heights\". Similar themes of romanticism and noble savagery are apparent across the Bront\u00ebs' juvenilia, including in Branwell's \"The Life of Alexander Percy\", which tells the story of an all-consuming, death-defying, and ultimately self-destructive love, and which some believe may have been one of the inspirations for \"Wuthering Heights\".\nAdulthood.\nAttempted teaching career.\nAt seventeen, Emily joined the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte was a teacher. This was the first time Emily had attended school since her few months at Cowan Bridge. At this time, the girls' objective was to obtain sufficient education to open a small school of their own. Emily struggled to adapt to life at Roe Head and left after only a few months, with Anne taking her place. Later, Charlotte ascribed this to Emily's extreme homesickness and resistance to the routine and discipline of the school, stating that she feared Emily would have died if she had not been allowed home.In September 1838, when she was twenty, Emily became a teacher at Law Hill School, in the Yorkshire town of Halifax. Her health suffered under the stress of the seventeen-hour workday, and she did not warm to her pupils, stating that she preferred the company of the house dog. She did, however, continue writing, and produced several poems during this time. She returned home to Haworth in April 1839, helping the family's servant with the cooking, ironing, and cleaning. She taught herself German from books and played the piano, becoming an accomplished pianist, as well as continuing to expand her Gondal stories. These survive as a series of poems, many of which reflect her interest in the tragic, Byronic figures that precede the creation of Heathcliff.\nBrussels.\nIn 1842, when she was twenty-four, Emily accompanied Charlotte to study at the Heger Pensionnat, a girls' boarding school in Brussels, where Charlotte hoped to spend six months improving her French, Italian and German. Charlotte's further plan was for them to seek employment abroad, although she only shared this plan with Emily. Their tuition and travel expenses had been paid by their Aunt Branwell, and some friends of the family, the Jenkinses, had promised to look out for their well-being. The Jenkins family were initially welcoming but soon ceased to invite the sisters, finding Charlotte to be socially awkward and Emily monosyllabic.\nNor did Charlotte and Emily fit in easily at the school: they were considerably older than their peers, they struggled with lessons that were held in French, and they were in a very small minority of Protestants in the Pensionnat. Unlike Charlotte, who made an effort to be accepted, and changed her style of dress to fit in better with her peers, Emily was not happy in Brussels and was mocked by the other students for her refusal to adopt Belgian fashions. A fellow-student, Laetitia Wheelwright, said of her:\nI simply disliked her from the first; her tallish, ungainly, ill-dressed figure ... always answering our jokes with 'I wish to be as God made me'. \nConstantin Heger, who was in charge of the academy, thought highly of Emily, later telling Mrs Gaskell that he rated her intellect as \"something even higher\" than Charlotte's, saying:She should have been a man \u2013 a great navigator. Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.Fewer than a dozen of Emily's French essays survive from this period, most of which are compositions based on existing literary works selected by Constantin Heger. The two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had become so competent in French that Madame Heger, the wife of Constantin Heger, proposed that they both stay another half-year. According to Charlotte, she even offered to dismiss the English master so that Charlotte could take his place. By this time, Emily had become a competent pianist and teacher, and it was suggested that she might stay on to teach music. In this way, the sisters would be able to continue their education at the Pensionnat without paying for their board or tuition. Emily's first students in Brussels were the three young daughters of a local family, the Wheelwrights. The family liked Charlotte, but disliked Emily intensely. Laetitia Wheelwright later said that this was because Emily refused to teach the small children during her own school hours, thereby monopolizing their play time. In spite of this, Emily seems to have been happier during this period, and even made a friend; a sixteen-year-old Belgian student, Louise de Bassompierre, to whom Emily gifted a signed drawing.\nUnfortunately, the sudden illness and death of their aunt, Elizabeth Branwell, forced the sisters' return to Haworth. A letter from Constantin Heger to Patrick Bront\u00eb, appealing for the girls to remain, reveals that Emily was about to receive music lessons from a celebrated teacher, and was finally overcoming her social awkwardness. In spite of this, she remained in Haworth to take over the running of the household, while Charlotte returned to Brussels without her. In 1844, on Charlotte's return, the sisters attempted to open a school at the Parsonage, but the venture failed when they proved unable to attract students to the remote area.\nPoetry publications.\nIn February 1844, Emily began going through all the poems she had written, recopying them into two notebooks. One notebook was labelled \"Gondal Poems\"; the other was unlabelled. Scholars such as Fannie Ratchford and Derek Roper have attempted to piece together a Gondal storyline and chronology from these poems. In the autumn of 1845, Charlotte discovered the notebooks and insisted that the poems be published. Emily, furious at the invasion of her privacy, at first refused but, according to Charlotte, relented when Anne brought out her own manuscripts and revealed that she too had been writing poems in secret. Around this time, Emily wrote one of her most famous poems, \"No coward soul is mine\". Some literary critics have speculated that it is a poem about Anne Bront\u00eb, while others see it as a response to the violation of her privacy. Charlotte later claimed that it was Emily's final poem, but this is inaccurate. Although it was the last poem to be transcribed into Emily's fair copy notebook, she continued to write poetry, but channelled most of her creative energy into prose.\nIn 1846, the sisters' poems were published, at their own expense, by a small London publisher called Aylott &amp; Jones. The poems appeared together in one volume, entitled \"Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell\". On the insistence of Emily and Anne, the Bront\u00eb sisters adopted pseudonyms for publication, preserving their initials: thus Charlotte was \"Currer Bell\", Emily was \"Ellis Bell\" and Anne was \"Acton Bell\". Charlotte wrote in the 'Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell' that their \"ambiguous choice\" was \"dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because... we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice\". Charlotte contributed nineteen poems, and Emily and Anne each contributed twenty-one, with Emily making adjustments to some of her contributions to conceal their Gondal origins.\nAlthough the sisters were told several months after publication that only two copies of the book had sold, they were not discouraged (of their two readers, one was impressed enough to request their autographs). A reviewer in \"The Athenaeum\" praised Ellis Bell's work for its music and power, singling out those poems as the best in the book: \"Ellis possesses a fine, quaint spirit and an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here attempted\", and \"The Critic\" reviewer recognised \"the presence of more genius than it was supposed this utilitarian age had devoted to the loftier exercises of the intellect.\" Following Charlotte's unsuccessful attempts to generate further interest in the poems, she sent copies of the book to celebrated poets such as William Wordsworth, Alfred Tennyson, Hartley Coleridge, Thomas de Quincey and Ebenezer Elliot. She then announced to Aylott &amp; Jones that \"C, E &amp; A Bell are now preparing for the Press a work of fiction - consisting of three distinct and unconnected tales which may be published either together as work of 3 vols of the ordinary novel-size, or separately as single vols.\" The three novels to which she referred were \"The Professor\", \"Wuthering Heights\" and \"Agnes Grey.\"\n\"Wuthering Heights\".\nEmily Bront\u00eb's \"Wuthering Heights\" was first published in London by Thomas Cautley Newby, shortly after the publication and immediate success in October 1847 of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\", which was published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. Thomas Newby, who had been very slow to deal with Emily and Anne, finally saw the advantage of using the family connection, and published \"Wuthering Heights\" in December 1847. The novel appeared as the first two volumes of a three-volume set that also included Anne Bront\u00eb's \"Agnes Grey\". The authors were named as Ellis and Acton Bell; Emily's real name did not appear until after her death in 1850, when it was printed on the title page of an edited commercial edition.\nThe novel, a Gothic story of doomed love, hate, revenge and the supernatural, deals with the relationships of various couples in and around the farmhouse of the title. In spite of its Yorkshire setting, the novel owes much to Emily's Gondal writings, as well as to Walter Scott's \"Rob Roy\". Critics were puzzled by the novel's unusual structure, and its violence and passion led the Victorian public and many early reviewers to assume that it had been written by a man. According to Juliet Gardiner, \"the vivid sexual passion and power of its language and imagery impressed, bewildered and appalled reviewers.\" The literary critic Thomas Joudrey further contextualises this reaction: \"Expecting in the wake of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" to be swept up in an earnest Bildungsroman, they were instead shocked and confounded by a tale of unchecked primal passions, replete with savage cruelty and outright barbarism.\" One of the novel's first critics, writing in January 1848 for the periodical \"Atlas\", described all the characters in the novel as being: \"utterly hateful or thoroughly contemptible\", and an anonymous reviewer in \"The Examiner\" wrote:This is a strange book. It is not without evidences of considerable power: but, as a whole, it is wild, confused, disjointed, and improbable; and the people who make up the drama, which is tragic enough in its consequences, are savages ruder than those who lived before the days of Homer. Some even went as far as to dispute the novel's authorship. Emily herself had insisted on maintaining her pseudonym to protect her privacy, and when, after her death, she was named by Charlotte as the author of \"Wuthering Heights\", two of Branwell Bront\u00eb's friends claimed that Branwell was the true author of the novel. An anonymous article followed in \"People's Magazine\" expressing incredulity that such a work could have been written by \"a timid and retiring female\".\nAlthough a letter from her publisher addressed to Ellis Bell indicates that Emily had begun to write a second novel, the manuscript has never been found. It has been suggested either that it was destroyed, or that the letter was intended for Anne Bront\u00eb, who was already writing \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\".\nPersonality and character.\nUnlike Charlotte, who left a wealth of correspondence, very few of Emily's letters have survived. This, combined with her solitary nature, has made her a challenge for biographers to assess.\nCharlotte's representation of Emily.\nAccording to Lucasta Miller's analysis of Bront\u00eb biographies, Charlotte \"took on the role of Emily's first mythographer.\" Stevie Davies writes about what she calls \"Charlotte's smoke-screen\", and argues that Charlotte was shocked by Emily, and may even have doubted her sister's sanity. She was in awe of Emily's genius \u2013 at one point referring to her as \"a giant\" and \"a baby god\", but seems never to have fully understood her work, describing her in the introduction to \"Wuthering Heights\" as: \"a native and nursling of the moors\", who \"did not know what she had done\". After Emily's death, Charlotte reshaped her character, history and even some of her poems, in a way that she hoped might be more acceptable to the public, representing Emily as a kind of noble savage of the Yorkshire moors, \"stronger than a man, simpler than a child\". In the \"Preface\" to the Second Edition of \"Wuthering Heights\" in 1850, she writes:My sister's disposition was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her tendency to seclusion; except to go to church or take a walk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely exchanged a word.\nFriends.\nWith the exception of Ellen Nussey and Louise de Bassompierre, Emily's fellow student in Brussels, there is no record of Emily having had friends outside her family. There is no evidence that Emily was ever in love, or that the passionate relationships depicted in \"Wuthering Heights\" were based on personal experience. Emily's closest friend was her sister Anne. Inseparable in childhood, they shared their own fantasy world, Gondal, right up into adulthood.\nGaskell's biography of Charlotte.\nElizabeth Gaskell's biography, \"The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb\", was the first, most influential source of information about Emily. In it Gaskell describes Emily as unusually tall and slim, often wearing a purple dress, and exercising an 'unconscious tyranny' over her sisters, who nicknamed her 'the Major'. She also recounts a number of anecdotes which represent Emily as unpredictable, even violent on occasion, including one of Emily's violently punishing her dog Keeper for climbing with muddy paws on one of the beds in the Parsonage, after which she comforted and bathed him. However, as Charlotte was Gaskell's primary source of information, the biography is not considered to be an impartial account, especially as Gaskell did not visit Haworth until after Emily's death, and admits to disliking what she knew of Emily.\nIndependence and strength of will.\nEmily is often described as strong-willed and independent: Constantin Heger speaks of her 'powerful reason' and 'strong, imperious will'. Winifred Gerin's biography describes her as a physically intrepid woman who carried a gun and who once, when bitten by a dog, cauterized the wound herself with a hot iron, to avoid worrying her sisters. (This story has been called into question by some biographers and scholars.) In \"Queens of Literature of the Victorian Era\" (1886), Eva Hope summarises Emily's character as: 'a peculiar mixture of timidity and Spartan-like courage'. According to Norma Crandall, her \"warm, human aspect\" was \"usually revealed only in her love of nature and of animals\". \"The Literary News\" (1883) states: \"[Emily] loved the solemn moors, she loved all wild, free creatures and things\".\nAutism and anorexia.\nEmily's solitary and introverted nature has caused speculation regarding her neurology. Juliet Barker writes in her biography of the Bront\u00ebs, that: \"Emily ... was so absorbed in herself and her literary creations that she had little time for the genuine suffering of her family\". The biographer Claire Harman has speculated that Emily's adherence to routine, along with her anger management issues, her aversion to social situations and her attachment to her home may all indicate that she had a form of autism. Although she seemingly enjoyed cooking and helping out in the kitchen, John Sutherland mentions her 'obstinate fasting', and the biographer Katherine Frank suggests that Emily may have suffered from anorexia.\nDeath.\nEmily's brother Branwell died, probably of tuberculosis, on Sunday, 24 September 1848, following a long descent into alcoholism and drug addiction. At his funeral, a week later, Emily caught a severe cold that quickly developed into an inflammation of the lungs and may have accelerated an existing condition such as tuberculosis. It has been suggested that Emily's health had been weakened by insanitary conditions at home, where water was contaminated by runoff from the church's graveyard. Though her condition worsened steadily, Emily rejected medical help, saying that she would have \"no poisoning doctor\" near her. On the morning of 19 December 1848, Charlotte, fearing for her sister, wrote:She grows daily weaker. The physician's opinion was expressed too obscurely to be of use \u2013 he sent some medicine which she would not take. Moments so dark as these I have never known \u2013 I pray for God's support to us all.At noon, Emily's condition had worsened. With her last audible words, she said to Charlotte, \"If you will send for a doctor, I will see him now\", but it was too late. She died that same day at about two in the afternoon. According to Mary Robinson, an early biographer, Emily died on the sofa in the living room at the Parsonage, which she had adopted as a bed. A letter from Charlotte to William Smith Williams, describes Emily's dog, Keeper, lying by her deathbed. Emily died less than three months after Branwell's death, which led Martha Brown, a housemaid, to declare that \"Miss Emily died of a broken heart for love of her brother\". Emily had grown so thin that her coffin measured only 16 inches (40 centimetres) wide. The carpenter said he had never made a narrower one for an adult. Her remains were interred in the family vault in St Michael and All Angels' Church, Haworth. In 2024, the memorial at Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey was altered to correct the misspelling of the family name (from Bronte to Bront\u00eb).\nLegacy.\nLiterary impact.\nAlthough Emily's work was not widely appreciated at the time of its publication, \"Wuthering Heights\" has subsequently become an English literary classic, and is described in John Sutherland's \"Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction\" as the \"twentieth century's favourite nineteenth-century novel\". In 2007 it topped a \"Guardian\" poll of the nation's favourite love stories. Emily's poems, too, have reached a global audience. The opening line of \"No coward soul is mine\" is popular on mugs and key rings, and even as a tattoo.\nAuthors who have been inspired by Emily Bront\u00eb include: Anne Rice, Sylvia Plath, Jacqueline Wilson, Joanne Harris, Margaret Atwood, Kate Mosse, Dorothy Koomson and Lucy Powrie (who is now the chair of the Bront\u00eb Society). In 2018, to celebrate Emily Bront\u00eb's bicentenary year, The Borough Press published a collection of short stories entitled \"I Am Heathcliff\", edited by Kate Mosse, and featuring stories by Leila Aboulela, Hanan Al-Shaykh, Joanna Cannon, Alison Case, Juno Dawson, Louise Doughty, Sophie Hannah, Anna James, Erin Kelly, Dorothy Koomson, Grace McCleen, Lisa McInerney, Laurie Penny, Nikesh Shukla, Michael Stewart and Louisa Young.\nAdaptations.\n\"Wuthering Heights\" has been adapted many times, both in the UK and elsewhere, for radio, film, stage and television. The earliest adaptation of the novel was a silent film in 1920, directed by A. V. Bramble. Actors who have portrayed Catherine Earnshaw include Juliette Binoche, Rosemary Harris and Merle Oberon, and actors who have played Heathcliff include Ralph Fiennes, Laurence Olivier and Tom Hardy. In 2025, Emma Rice premiered a stage musical adaptation of \"Wuthering Heights\" in Sydney, starring John Leader as Heathcliff. In 2025 it was announced that a new film adaptation was in production, directed by Emerald Fennell and starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi.\nBiographical depictions.\nNumerous adaptations also exist depicting the sisters and their lives. The 1946 film \"Devotion\" was a highly fictionalized account of the lives of the Bront\u00eb sisters. In the 1973 Yorkshire Television series \"The Bront\u00ebs of Haworth\", written by Christopher Fry, Emily is played by Rosemary McHale. In the 2019 film \"How to Build a Girl\", Emily and Charlotte Bront\u00eb are among the historical figures in Johanna's wall collage. In the 2022 film \"Emily\", written and directed by Frances O'Connor, Emma Mackey plays the role of Emily Bront\u00eb before the publication of \"Wuthering Heights\". The film mixes known biographical details with imagined situations and relationships.\nIn 2017, Catherynne Valente wrote \"The Glass House Game\", which reimagines the Bront\u00eb siblings as characters in their own version of C. S. Lewis' Narnia books. In 2020, graphic novelist Isabel Greenberg adapted \"Glass Town\" into a graphic novel that combines the Bront\u00ebs' early fiction with memoir.\nMusic.\nA 1967 BBC adaptation of Emily's novel was the original inspiration for the debut single, \"Wuthering Heights\", by the UK singer-songwriter Kate Bush, released in January 1978. In 1996, the singer-songwriter Cliff Richard brought out \"Heathcliff\", a stage musical based on the character, in which he himself played the lead. In 2019 the English folk group The Unthanks released \"Lines\", three short albums, which include settings of Bront\u00eb's poems to music. Recording took place at the Bront\u00ebs' home, using their own Regency era piano played by Adrian McNally. Norwegian composer Ola Gjeilo set selected Emily Bront\u00eb poems to music with SATB chorus, string orchestra, and piano, a work commissioned and premiered by the San Francisco Choral Society in a series of concerts in Oakland and San Francisco. In the 1940s the composer Bernard Herrmann wrote an opera based on \"Wuthering Heights\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It does not represent all marine species, just those that are readily fossilized. The labels of the traditional \"Big Five\" extinction events and the more recently recognised Capitanian mass extinction event are clickable links. The two extinction events occurring in the Cambrian (far left) are very large in percentage magnitude, but small in absolute numbers of known taxa due to the relative scarcity of fossil-producing life at that time. \"()\"\nAn extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp fall in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the background extinction rate and the rate of speciation. \nEstimates of the number of major mass extinctions in the last 540\u00a0million years range from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from disagreement as to what constitutes a \"major\" extinction event, and the data chosen to measure past diversity.\nThe \"Big Five\" mass extinction events.\nIn a landmark paper published in 1982, Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup identified five particular geological intervals with excessive diversity loss. They were originally identified as outliers on a general trend of decreasing extinction rates during the Phanerozoic, but as more stringent statistical tests have been applied to the accumulating data, it has been established that in the current Phanerozoic Eon, multicellular animal life has experienced at least five major and many minor mass extinctions. The \"Big Five\" cannot be so clearly defined, but rather appear to represent the largest (or some of the largest) of a relatively smooth continuum of extinction events.\nThe \"Big Five\" of the Phanerozoic Eon were anciently preceded by the presumed far more extensive mass extinction of microbial life during the Great Oxidation Event (also known as the Oxygen Catastrophe) early in the Proterozoic Eon. At the end of the Ediacaran and just before the Cambrian explosion, yet another Proterozoic extinction event (of unknown magnitude) is speculated to have ushered in the Phanerozoic. Several events in the Cambrian and early Ordovician meet or exceed the \"Big Five\" in proportional severity, though overall diversity was rather low until the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE). Sepkoski and Raup (1982) initially tracked absolute (rather than proportional) extinction, so their biodiversity estimates overlooked events prior to the GOBE.\n1. Late Ordovician mass extinction, 445\u2013444\u00a0Ma.\nEnd Ordovician or O\u2013S, just prior to and at the Ordovician\u2013Silurian transition. Two events occurred that killed off 27% of all families, 57% of all genera and 85% of all species. Together they are ranked by many scientists as the second-largest of the five major extinctions in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct.\nIn May\u00a02020, studies suggested that the causes of the mass extinction were global warming, related to volcanism, and anoxia, and not, as considered earlier, cooling and glaciation. However, this is at odds with numerous previous studies, which have indicated global cooling as the primary driver. Most recently, the deposition of volcanic ash has been suggested to be the trigger for reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxide leading to the glaciation and anoxia observed in the geological record.\n2. Late Devonian mass extinction, 372\u2013359\u00a0Ma.\nThe Late Devonian extinctions were a series of events that occupied much of the Late Devonian up to the Devonian\u2013Carboniferous transition. The Late Devonian was an interval of high diversity loss, concentrated into two extinction events. Scientists have linked both events to anoxic conditions in the water.\nThe larger extinction was the Kellwasser Event (Frasnian-Famennian, or F-F, 372\u00a0Ma), an extinction event at the end of the Frasnian, about midway through the Late Devonian. This extinction annihilated coral reefs and numerous tropical benthic (seabed-living) animals such as jawless fish, brachiopods, and trilobites. Many scientists believe that the Kellwasser event resulted from land nutrients being carried into the ocean by rivers. These nutrients caused massive algal blooms. As the algae died and decomposed, they consumed dissolved oxygen in the water column, leading to anoxic conditions which eventually caused the extinctions.\nThe other major piece of the Devonian extinction was the Hangenberg Event (Devonian-Carboniferous, or D-C, 359\u00a0Ma), which brought an end to the Devonian as a whole. This extinction wiped out the armored placoderm fish and nearly led to the extinction of the newly evolved ammonoids. \nTogether, the Kellwasser event and the Hangenberg event eliminated about 19% of all families, 50% of all genera and at least 70% of all species. Sepkoski and Raup (1982) did not initially consider the Late Devonian extinction interval (Givetian, Frasnian, and Famennian stages) to be statistically significant. Regardless, later studies have affirmed the strong ecological impacts of the Kellwasser and Hangenberg Events.\n3. Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event, 252\u00a0Ma.\nThe End Permian extinction or the \"Great Dying\" occurred at the Permian\u2013Triassic transition. It was the Phanerozoic Eon's largest extinction: 53% of marine families died, 84% of marine genera, about 81% of all marine species and an estimated 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. This is also the largest known extinction event for insects. A highly successful group of marine arthropods, the trilobites, became extinct. The evidence regarding plants is less clear, but new taxa became dominant after the extinction.\nThe \"Great Dying\" had enormous evolutionary significance: on land, it ended the primacy of early synapsids. The recovery of vertebrates took 30\u00a0million years, but the vacant niches created the opportunity for archosaurs to become ascendant. In the seas, the percentage of animals that were sessile (unable to move about) dropped from 67% to 50%. The whole late Permian was a difficult time, at least for marine life, even before the P\u2013T boundary extinction. More recent research has indicated that the End-Capitanian extinction event that preceded the \"Great Dying\" likely constitutes a separate event from the P\u2013T extinction; if so, it would be larger than some of the \"Big Five\" extinction events. \nThe extinction's impact on land ecosystems may have been less severe than once believed. Fossil pollen and spores indicate minimal or short-lived disruption for some plant communities. A 2025 study in present-day China showed a thriving ecosystem just 75,000\u00a0years after the event, pointing to faster recovery. Some scientists argue there may have been no mass extinction on land at all, a view supported by findings in plants, insects, and four-limbed vertebrates.\n4. Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event, 201.3\u00a0Ma.\nThe End Triassic extinction marks the Triassic\u2013Jurassic transition. About 23% of all families, 48% of all genera (20% of marine families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species became extinct. In the seas, ceratite ammonoids and conodonts died out while reef-builders and other major marine groups were hit hard. Many archosauromorphs, most therapsids, and nearly all of the large temnospondyl amphibians were eliminated, leaving dinosaurs with little terrestrial competition. Pterosaurs and crocodylomorphs were the only other surviving archosaurs, while non-archosaurian diapsids continued to dominate marine environments. A few temnospondyls (such as \"Koolasuchus\") survived as late as the Cretaceous in Australia.\n5. Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, \u00a0Ma.\nThe End Cretaceous extinction, or the K\u2013Pg extinction (formerly K\u2013T extinction) occurred at the Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) \u2013 Paleogene (Danian) transition. The event was formerly called the Cretaceous-Tertiary or K\u2013T extinction or K\u2013T boundary; it is now officially named the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene (or K\u2013Pg) extinction event.\nAbout 17% of all families, 50% of all genera and 75% of all species became extinct. In the seas all the ammonites, plesiosaurs, and mosasaurs disappeared and the percentage of sessile animals was reduced to about 33%. All known non-avian dinosaurs became extinct during that time. The boundary event was severe with a significant amount of variability in the rate of extinction between and among different clades. Mammals, descended from the synapsids, and birds, a side-branch of the theropod dinosaurs, emerged as the two predominant clades of terrestrial tetrapods.\nDespite the common presentation focusing only on these five events, no measure of extinction shows any definite line separating them from the many other Phanerozoic extinction events that appear only slightly lesser catastrophes; further, using different methods of calculating an extinction's impact can lead to other events featuring in the top five.\nFossil records of older events are more difficult to interpret. This is because:\nIt has been suggested that the apparent variations in marine biodiversity may actually be an artifact, with abundance estimates directly related to quantity of rock available for sampling from different time periods. However, statistical analysis shows that this can only account for 50% of the observed pattern, and other evidence such as fungal spikes (geologically rapid increase in fungal abundance) provides reassurance that most widely accepted extinction events are real. A quantification of the rock exposure of Western Europe indicates that many of the minor events for which a biological explanation has been sought are most readily explained by sampling bias.\nSixth mass extinction.\nResearch completed after the seminal 1982 paper (Sepkoski and Raup) has concluded that a sixth mass extinction event due to human activities is currently underway.\nExtinctions have occurred at over 1,000\u00a0times the background extinction rate since 1900, and the rate is increasing. The mass extinction is a result of human activity (an ecocide) driven by population growth, economic growth, and overconsumption of the Earth's natural resources. The 2019 global biodiversity assessment by IPBES asserts that out of an estimated 8\u00a0million species, 1\u00a0million plant and animal species are currently threatened with extinction. The WWF suggested in late 2021 that over a million species could go extinct within a decade in the \"largest mass extinction event since the end of the dinosaur age\". A 2023 study published in \"PNAS\" concluded that at least 73\u00a0genera of animals have gone extinct since 1500. If humans had never existed, it would have taken 18,000\u00a0years for the same genera to have disappeared naturally, the report states.\nExtinctions by severity.\nExtinction events can be tracked by several methods, including geological change, ecological impact, extinction vs. origination (speciation) rates, and most commonly diversity loss among taxonomic units. Most early papers used families as the unit of taxonomy, based on compendiums of marine animal families by Sepkoski\u00a0(1982, 1992). Later papers by Sepkoski and other authors switched to genera, which are more precise than families and less prone to taxonomic bias or incomplete sampling relative to species. These are several major papers estimating loss or ecological impact from fifteen commonly-discussed extinction events. Different methods used by these papers are described in the following section. The \"Big Five\" mass extinctions are bolded.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;a Graphed but not discussed by , considered continuous with the Late Devonian mass extinction&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;b At the time considered continuous with the end-Permian mass extinction&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;c Includes late Norian time slices&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;d Diversity loss of both pulses calculated together&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;e Pulses extend over adjacent time slices, calculated separately&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;f Considered ecologically significant, but not analyzed directly&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;g Excluded due to a lack of consensus on Late Triassic chronology\nThe study of major extinction events.\nBreakthrough studies in the 1980s\u20131990s.\nFor much of the 20th century, the study of mass extinctions was hampered by insufficient data. Mass extinctions, though acknowledged, were considered mysterious exceptions to the prevailing gradualistic view of prehistory, where slow evolutionary trends define faunal changes. The first breakthrough was published in 1980 by a team led by Luis Alvarez, who discovered trace metal evidence for an asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous period. The Alvarez hypothesis for the end-Cretaceous extinction gave mass extinctions, and catastrophic explanations, newfound popular and scientific attention.\nAnother landmark study came in 1982, when a paper written by David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski was published in the journal \"Science\". This paper, originating from a compendium of extinct marine animal families developed by Sepkoski, identified five peaks of marine family extinctions that stand out among a backdrop of decreasing extinction rates through time. Four of these peaks were statistically significant: the Ashgillian (end-Ordovician), Late Permian, Norian (end-Triassic), and Maastrichtian (end-Cretaceous). The remaining peak was a broad interval of high extinction smeared over the later half of the Devonian, with its apex in the Frasnian stage.\nThrough the 1980s, Raup and Sepkoski continued to elaborate and build upon their extinction and origination data, defining a high-resolution biodiversity curve (the \"Sepkoski curve\") and successive evolutionary faunas with their own patterns of diversification and extinction. Though these interpretations formed a strong basis for subsequent studies of mass extinctions, Raup and Sepkoski also proposed a more controversial idea in 1984: a 26-million-year periodic pattern to mass extinctions. Two teams of astronomers linked this to a hypothetical brown dwarf in the distant reaches of the Solar System, inventing the \"Nemesis hypothesis\", which has been strongly disputed by other astronomers.\nAround the same time, Sepkoski began to devise a compendium of marine animal genera, which would allow researchers to explore extinction at a finer taxonomic resolution. He began to publish preliminary results of this in-progress study as early as 1986, in a paper that identified 29 extinction intervals of note. By 1992, he also updated his 1982 family compendium, finding minimal changes to the diversity curve despite a decade of new data. In 1996, Sepkoski published another paper that tracked marine genera extinction (in terms of net diversity loss) by stage, similar to his previous work on family extinctions. The paper filtered its sample in three ways: all genera (the entire unfiltered sample size), multiple-interval genera (only those found in more than one stage), and \"well-preserved\" genera (excluding those from groups with poor or understudied fossil records). Diversity trends in marine animal families were also revised based on his 1992 update.\nRevived interest in mass extinctions led many other authors to re-evaluate geological events in the context of their effects on life. A 1995 paper by Michael Benton tracked extinction and origination rates among both marine and continental (freshwater &amp; terrestrial) families, identifying 22 extinction intervals and no periodic pattern. Overview books by O.H. Walliser (1996) and A. Hallam and P.B. Wignall (1997) summarized the new extinction research of the previous two decades. One chapter in the former source lists over 60 geological events that could conceivably be considered global extinctions of varying sizes. These texts, and other widely circulated publications in the 1990s, helped to establish the popular image of mass extinctions as a \"big five\" alongside many smaller extinctions through prehistory.\nNew data on genera: Sepkoski's compendium.\nSepkoski died in 1999, but his marine genera compendium was posthumously published in 2002. This prompted a new wave of studies into the dynamics of mass extinctions. These papers utilized the compendium to track \"origination rates\" parallel to extinction rates in the context of geological stages or substages. A review and re-analysis of Sepkoski's data by identified 18\u00a0distinct mass extinction intervals, including 4\u00a0large extinctions in the Cambrian. These fit Sepkoski's definition of extinction, as short substages with large diversity loss and overall high extinction rates relative to their surroundings.\n considered each of the \"Big Five\" extinction intervals to have a different pattern in the relationship between origination and extinction trends. Moreover, background extinction rates were broadly variable and could be separated into more severe and less severe time intervals: Background extinctions were least severe relative to the origination rate in the middle Ordovician \u2013 early Silurian, late Carboniferous \u2013 Permian, and Jurassic \u2013 recent. This argues that the late Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous extinctions were statistically significant outliers in biodiversity trends, while the late Devonian and end Triassic extinctions occurred in time periods that were already stressed by relatively high extinction and low origination.\nComputer models run by determined that abrupt pulses of extinction fit the pattern of prehistoric biodiversity much better than a gradual and continuous background extinction rate with smooth peaks and troughs. This strongly supports the utility of rapid, frequent mass extinctions as a major driver of diversity changes. Pulsed origination events are also supported, though to a lesser degree that is largely dependent on pulsed extinctions.\nSimilarly, used extinction and origination data to investigate turnover rates and extinction responses among different evolutionary faunas and taxonomic groups. In contrast to previous authors, his diversity simulations show support for an overall exponential rate of biodiversity growth through the entire Phanerozoic.\nTackling biases in the fossil record.\nAs data continued to accumulate, some authors began to re-evaluate Sepkoski's sample using methods meant to account for sampling biases. As early as 1982, a paper by Phillip W. Signor and Jere H. Lipps noted that the true sharpness of extinctions was diluted by the incompleteness of the fossil record. This phenomenon, later called the Signor-Lipps effect, notes that a species' true extinction must occur after its last fossil, and that origination must occur before its first fossil. Thus, species that appear to die out just prior to an abrupt extinction event may instead be a victim of the event, despite an apparent gradual decline looking at the fossil record alone. A model by Foote (2007) found that many geological stages had artificially inflated extinction rates due to Signor-Lipps \"backsmearing\" from later stages with extinction events.\nOther biases include the difficulty in assessing taxa with high turnover rates or restricted occurrences, which cannot be directly assessed due to a lack of fine-scale temporal resolution. Many paleontologists opt to assess diversity trends by randomized sampling and rarefaction of fossil abundances rather than raw temporal range data, in order to account for all of these biases. But that solution is influenced by biases related to sample size. One major bias in particular is the \"Pull of the recent\", the fact that the fossil record (and thus known diversity) generally improves closer to the modern day. This means that biodiversity and abundance for older geological periods may be underestimated from raw data alone.\nAlroy (2010) attempted to circumvent sample size-related biases in diversity estimates using a method he called \"shareholder quorum subsampling\" (SQS). In this method, fossils are sampled from a \"collection\" (such as a time interval) to assess the relative diversity of that collection. Every time a new species (or other taxon) enters the sample, it brings over all other fossils belonging to that species in the collection (its \"share\" of the collection). For example, a skewed collection with half its fossils from one species will immediately reach a sample share of 50% if that species is the first to be sampled. This continues, adding up the sample shares until a \"coverage\" or \"quorum\" is reached, referring to a pre-set desired sum of share percentages. At that point, the number of species in the sample are counted. A collection with more species is expected to reach a sample quorum with more species, thus accurately comparing the relative diversity change between two collections without relying on the biases inherent to sample size.\nAlroy also elaborated on three-timer algorithms, which are meant to counteract biases in estimates of extinction and origination rates. A given taxon is a \"three-timer\" if it can be found before, after, and within a given time interval, and a \"two-timer\" if it overlaps with a time interval on one side. Counting \"three-timers\" and \"two-timers\" on either end of a time interval, and sampling time intervals in sequence, can together be combined into equations to predict extinction and origination with less bias. In subsequent papers, Alroy continued to refine his equations to improve lingering issues with precision and unusual samples.\nMcGhee et al. (2013), a paper that primarily focused on ecological effects of mass extinctions, also published new estimates of extinction severity based on Alroy's methods. Many extinctions were significantly more impactful under these new estimates, though some were less prominent.\nStanley (2016) was another paper that attempted to remove two common errors in previous estimates of extinction severity. The first error was the unjustified removal of \"singletons\", genera unique to only a single time slice. Their removal would mask the influence of groups with high turnover rates or lineages cut short early in their diversification. The second error was the difficulty in distinguishing background extinctions from brief mass extinction events within the same short time interval. To circumvent this issue, background rates of diversity change (extinction/origination) were estimated for stages or substages without mass extinctions, and then assumed to apply to subsequent stages with mass extinctions. For example, the Santonian and Campanian stages were each used to estimate diversity changes in the Maastrichtian prior to the K-Pg mass extinction. Subtracting background extinctions from extinction tallies had the effect of reducing the estimated severity of the six sampled mass extinction events. This effect was stronger for mass extinctions that occurred in periods with high rates of background extinction, like the Devonian.\nUncertainty in the Proterozoic and earlier eons.\nBecause most diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure via fossils, extinction events placed on-record are those that affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life. For this reason, well-documented extinction events are confined to the Phanerozoic eon \u2013 with the sole exception of the Oxygen Catastrophe in the Proterozoic \u2013 since before the Phanerozoic, all living organisms were either microbial, or if multicellular then soft-bodied. Perhaps due to the absence of a robust microbial fossil record, mass extinctions might only \"seem\" to be mainly a Phanerozoic phenomenon, with merely the \"observable\" extinction rates appearing low before large complex organisms with hard body parts arose.\nExtinction occurs at an uneven rate. Based on the fossil record, the background rate of extinctions on Earth is about two to five taxonomic families of marine animals every million years.\nThe Oxygen Catastrophe, which occurred around 2.45\u00a0billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic, is plausible as the first-ever major extinction event. It was perhaps also the worst-ever, in some sense, but with the Earth's ecology just before that time so poorly understood, and the concept of prokaryote genera so different from genera of complex life, that it would be difficult to meaningfully compare it to any of the \"Big Five\" even if Paleoproterozoic life were better known.\nSince the Cambrian explosion, five further major mass extinctions have significantly exceeded the background extinction rate. The most recent and best-known, the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately \u00a0Ma (million years ago), was a large-scale mass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period of time. In addition to the five major Phanerozoic mass extinctions, there are numerous lesser ones, and the ongoing mass extinction caused by human activity is sometimes called the sixth mass extinction.\nEvolutionary importance.\nMass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the newly dominant group is \"superior\" to the old but usually because an extinction event eliminates the old, dominant group and makes way for the new one, a process known as adaptive radiation.\nFor example, mammaliaformes (\"almost mammals\") and then mammals existed throughout the reign of the dinosaurs, but could not compete in the large terrestrial vertebrate niches that dinosaurs monopolized. The end-Cretaceous mass extinction removed the non-avian dinosaurs and made it possible for mammals to expand into the large terrestrial vertebrate niches. The dinosaurs themselves had been beneficiaries of a previous mass extinction, the end-Triassic, which eliminated most of their chief rivals, the crurotarsans. Similarly, within Synapsida, the replacement of taxa that originated in the earliest, Pennsylvanian and Cisuralian evolutionary radiation (often still called \"pelycosaurs\", though this is a paraphyletic group) by therapsids occurred around the Kungurian/Roadian transition, which is often called Olson's extinction (which may be a slow decline over 20 Ma rather than a dramatic, brief event).\nAnother point of view put forward in the Escalation hypothesis predicts that species in ecological niches with more organism-to-organism conflict will be less likely to survive extinctions. This is because the very traits that keep a species numerous and viable under fairly static conditions become a burden once population levels fall among competing organisms during the dynamics of an extinction event.\nFurthermore, many groups that survive mass extinctions do not recover in numbers or diversity, and many of these go into long-term decline, and these are often referred to as \"Dead Clades Walking\".\nHowever, clades that survive for a considerable period of time after a mass extinction, and that were reduced to only a few species, are likely to have experienced a rebound effect called the \"push of the past\".\nDarwin was firmly of the opinion that biotic interactions, such as competition for food and space \u2013 the 'struggle for existence' \u2013 were of considerably greater importance in promoting evolution and extinction than changes in the physical environment. He expressed this in \"The Origin of Species\":\n \"Species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting causes ... and the most import of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered ... physical conditions, namely the mutual relation of organism to organism \u2013 the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or extermination of others\".\nPatterns in frequency.\nVarious authors have suggested that extinction events occurred periodically, every 26 to 30\u00a0million years, or that diversity fluctuates episodically about every 62\u00a0million years. Various ideas, mostly regarding astronomical influences, attempt to explain the supposed pattern, including the presence of a hypothetical companion star to the Sun, oscillations in the galactic plane, or passage through the Milky Way's spiral arms. However, other authors have concluded that the data on marine mass extinctions do not fit with the idea that mass extinctions are periodic, or that ecosystems gradually build up to a point at which a mass extinction is inevitable. Many of the proposed correlations have been argued to be spurious or lacking statistical significance. Others have argued that there is strong evidence supporting periodicity in a variety of records, and additional evidence in the form of coincident periodic variation in nonbiological geochemical variables such as Strontium isotopes, flood basalts, anoxic events, orogenies, and evaporite deposition. One explanation for this proposed cycle is carbon storage and release by oceanic crust, which exchanges carbon between the atmosphere and mantle.\nAll genera\n\"Well-defined\" genera\nTrend line\n\"Big Five\" mass extinctions\nOther mass extinctions\nMillion years ago\nThousands of genera\nPhanerozoic biodiversity as shown by the fossil record\nMass extinctions are thought to result when a long-term stress is compounded by a short-term shock. Over the course of the Phanerozoic, individual taxa appear to have become less likely to suffer extinction, which may reflect more robust food webs, as well as fewer extinction-prone species, and other factors such as continental distribution. However, even after accounting for sampling bias, there does appear to be a gradual decrease in extinction and origination rates during the Phanerozoic. This may represent the fact that groups with higher turnover rates are more likely to become extinct by chance; or it may be an artefact of taxonomy: families tend to become more speciose, therefore less prone to extinction, over time; and larger taxonomic groups (by definition) appear earlier in geological time.\nIt has also been suggested that the oceans have gradually become more hospitable to life over the last 500\u00a0million years, and thus less vulnerable to mass extinctions, but susceptibility to extinction at a taxonomic level does not appear to make mass extinctions either more or less probable.\nCauses.\nThere is still debate about the causes of all mass extinctions. In general, large extinctions may result when a biosphere under long-term stress undergoes a short-term shock. An underlying mechanism appears to be present in the correlation of extinction and origination rates to diversity. High diversity leads to a persistent increase in extinction rate; low diversity to a persistent increase in origination rate. These presumably ecologically controlled relationships likely amplify smaller perturbations (asteroid impacts, etc.) to produce the global effects observed.\nIdentifying causes of specific mass extinctions.\nA good theory for a particular mass extinction should: \nIt may be necessary to consider combinations of causes. For example, the marine aspect of the end-Cretaceous extinction appears to have been caused by several processes that partially overlapped in time and may have had different levels of significance in different parts of the world.\nArens and West (2006) proposed a \"press / pulse\" model in which mass extinctions generally require two types of cause: long-term pressure on the eco-system (\"press\") and a sudden catastrophe (\"pulse\") towards the end of the period of pressure. Their statistical analysis of marine extinction rates throughout the Phanerozoic suggested that neither long-term pressure alone nor a catastrophe alone was sufficient to cause a significant increase in the extinction rate.\nMost widely supported explanations.\nMacLeod (2001) summarized the relationship between mass extinctions and events that are most often cited as causes of mass extinctions, using data from Courtillot, Jaeger &amp; Yang \"et al.\" (1996), Hallam (1992) and Grieve &amp; Pesonen (1992):\nThe most commonly suggested causes of mass extinctions are listed below.\nFlood basalt events.\nThe formation of large igneous provinces by flood basalt events could have:\nFlood basalt events occur as pulses of activity punctuated by dormant periods. As a result, they are likely to cause the climate to oscillate between cooling and warming, but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.\nFlood basalt events have been implicated as the cause of many major extinction events. It is speculated that massive volcanism caused or contributed to the Kellwasser Event, the End-Guadalupian Extinction Event, the End-Permian Extinction Event, the Smithian-Spathian Extinction, the Triassic-Jurassic Extinction Event, the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, the Cenomanian-Turonian Oceanic Anoxic Event, the Cretaceous-Palaeogene Extinction Event, and the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. The correlation between gigantic volcanic events expressed in the large igneous provinces and mass extinctions was shown for the last 260 million years. Recently such possible correlation was extended across the whole Phanerozoic Eon.\nSea-level fall.\nThese are often clearly marked by worldwide sequences of contemporaneous sediments that show all or part of a transition from sea-bed to tidal zone to beach to dry land \u2013 and where there is no evidence that the rocks in the relevant areas were raised by geological processes such as orogeny. Sea-level falls could reduce the continental shelf area (the most productive part of the oceans) sufficiently to cause a marine mass extinction, and could disrupt weather patterns enough to cause extinctions on land. But sea-level falls are very probably the result of other events, such as sustained global cooling or the sinking of the mid-ocean ridges.\nSea-level falls are associated with most of the mass extinctions, including all of the \"Big Five\"\u2014End-Ordovician, Late Devonian, End-Permian, End-Triassic, and End-Cretaceous, along with the more recently recognised Capitanian mass extinction of comparable severity to the Big Five.\nA 2008 study, published in the journal \"Nature\", established a relationship between the speed of mass extinction events and changes in sea level and sediment. The study suggests changes in ocean environments related to sea level exert a driving influence on rates of extinction, and generally determine the composition of life in the oceans.\nExtraterrestrial threats.\nImpact events.\nThe impact of a sufficiently large asteroid or comet could have caused food chains to collapse both on land and at sea by producing dust and particulate aerosols and thus inhibiting photosynthesis. Impacts on sulfur-rich rocks could have emitted sulfur oxides precipitating as poisonous acid rain, contributing further to the collapse of food chains. Such impacts could also have caused megatsunamis and/or global forest fires.\nMost paleontologists now agree that an asteroid did hit the Earth about 66\u00a0Ma, but there is lingering dispute whether the impact was the sole cause of the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. Nonetheless, in October 2019, researchers reported that the Cretaceous Chicxulub asteroid impact that resulted in the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs 66\u00a0Ma, also rapidly acidified the oceans, producing ecological collapse and long-lasting effects on the climate, and was a key reason for end-Cretaceous mass extinction.\nThe Permian-Triassic extinction event has also been hypothesised to have been caused by an asteroid impact that formed the Araguainha crater due to the estimated date of the crater's formation overlapping with the end-Permian extinction event. However, this hypothesis has been widely challenged, with the impact hypothesis being rejected by most researchers.\nAccording to the Shiva hypothesis, the Earth is subject to increased asteroid impacts about once every 27\u00a0million years because of the Sun's passage through the plane of the Milky Way galaxy, thus causing extinction events at 27\u00a0million year intervals. Some evidence for this hypothesis has emerged in both marine and non-marine contexts. Alternatively, the Sun's passage through the higher density spiral arms of the galaxy could coincide with mass extinction on Earth, perhaps due to increased impact events. However, a reanalysis of the effects of the Sun's transit through the spiral structure based on maps of the spiral structure of the Milky Way in CO molecular line emission has failed to find a correlation.\nA nearby nova, supernova or gamma ray burst.\nA nearby gamma-ray burst (less than 6000 light-years away) would be powerful enough to destroy the Earth's ozone layer, leaving organisms vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Gamma ray bursts are fairly rare, occurring only a few times in a given galaxy per million years.\nIt has been suggested that a gamma ray burst caused the End-Ordovician extinction, while a supernova has been proposed as the cause of the Hangenberg event. A supernova within 25 light-years would strip Earth of its atmosphere. Today there is in the Solar System's neighbourhood no critical star capable to produce a supernova dangerous to life on Earth.\nGlobal cooling.\nSustained and significant global cooling could kill many polar and temperate species and force others to migrate towards the equator; reduce the area available for tropical species; often make the Earth's climate more arid on average, mainly by locking up more of the planet's water in ice and snow. The glaciation cycles of the current ice age are believed to have had only a very mild impact on biodiversity, so the mere existence of a significant cooling is not sufficient on its own to explain a mass extinction.\nIt has been suggested that global cooling caused or contributed to the End-Ordovician, Permian\u2013Triassic, Late Devonian extinctions, and possibly others. Sustained global cooling is distinguished from the temporary climatic effects of flood basalt events or impacts.\nGlobal warming.\nThis would have the opposite effects: expand the area available for tropical species; kill temperate species or force them to migrate towards the poles; possibly cause severe extinctions of polar species; often make the Earth's climate wetter on average, mainly by melting ice and snow and thus increasing the volume of the water cycle. It might also cause anoxic events in the oceans (see below).\nGlobal warming as a cause of mass extinction is supported by several recent studies.\nThe most dramatic example of sustained warming is the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions. It has also been suggested to have caused the Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event, during which 20% of all marine families became extinct. Furthermore, the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event has been suggested to have been caused by warming.\nClathrate gun hypothesis.\nClathrates are composites in which a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another. Methane clathrates (in which water molecules are the cage) form on continental shelves. These clathrates are likely to break up rapidly and release the methane if the temperature rises quickly or the pressure on them drops quickly \u2013 for example in response to sudden global warming or a sudden drop in sea level or even earthquakes. Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, so a methane eruption (\"clathrate gun\") could cause rapid global warming or make it much more severe if the eruption was itself caused by global warming.\nThe most likely signature of such a methane eruption would be a sudden decrease in the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 in sediments, since methane clathrates are low in carbon-13; but the change would have to be very large, as other events can also reduce the percentage of carbon-13.\nIt has been suggested that \"clathrate gun\" methane eruptions were involved in the end-Permian extinction (\"the Great Dying\") and in the Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum, which was associated with one of the smaller mass extinctions.\nAnoxic events.\nAnoxic events are situations in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen. Their causes are complex and controversial, but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming, mostly caused by sustained massive volcanism.\nIt has been suggested that anoxic events caused or contributed to the Ordovician\u2013Silurian, late Devonian, Capitanian, Permian\u2013Triassic, and Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinctions, as well as a number of lesser extinctions (such as the Ireviken, Lundgreni, Mulde, Lau, Smithian-Spathian, Toarcian, and Cenomanian\u2013Turonian events). On the other hand, there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-Cretaceous that indicate anoxic events but are not associated with mass extinctions.\nThe bio-availability of essential trace elements (in particular selenium) to potentially lethal lows has been shown to coincide with, and likely have contributed to, at least three mass extinction events in the oceans, that is, at the end of the Ordovician, during the Middle and Late Devonian, and at the end of the Triassic. During periods of low oxygen concentrations very soluble selenate (Se6+) is converted into much less soluble selenide (Se2-), elemental Se and organo-selenium complexes. Bio-availability of selenium during these extinction events dropped to about 1% of the current oceanic concentration, a level that has been proven lethal to many extant organisms.\nBritish oceanologist and atmospheric scientist Andrew Watson explained that, while the Holocene epoch exhibits many processes reminiscent of those that have contributed to past anoxic events, full-scale ocean anoxia would take \"thousands of years to develop\".\nHydrogen sulfide emissions from the seas.\nKump, Pavlov and Arthur (2005) have proposed that during the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event the warming also upset the oceanic balance between photosynthesising plankton and deep-water sulfate-reducing bacteria, causing massive emissions of hydrogen sulfide, which poisoned life on both land and sea and severely weakened the ozone layer, exposing much of the life that still remained to fatal levels of UV radiation.\nOceanic overturn.\nOceanic overturn is a disruption of thermo-haline circulation that lets surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing anoxic deep water to the surface and therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms that inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning or the end of a glaciation, although an overturn at the start of a glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of anoxic water.\nUnlike other oceanic catastrophes such as regressions (sea-level falls) and anoxic events, overturns do not leave easily identified \"signatures\" in rocks and are theoretical consequences of researchers' conclusions about other climatic and marine events.\nIt has been suggested that oceanic overturn caused or contributed to the late Devonian and Permian\u2013Triassic extinctions.\nGeomagnetic reversal.\nOne theory is that periods of increased geomagnetic reversals will weaken Earth's magnetic field long enough to expose the atmosphere to the solar winds, causing oxygen ions to escape the atmosphere in a rate increased by 3\u20134 orders, resulting in a disastrous decrease in oxygen.\nPlate tectonics.\nMovement of the continents into some configurations can cause or contribute to extinctions in several ways: by initiating or ending ice ages; by changing ocean and wind currents and thus altering climate; by opening seaways or land bridges that expose previously isolated species to competition for which they are poorly adapted (for example, the extinction of most of South America's native ungulates and all of its large metatherians after the creation of a land bridge between North and South America). Occasionally continental drift creates a super-continent that includes the vast majority of Earth's land area, which in addition to the effects listed above is likely to reduce the total area of continental shelf (the most species-rich part of the ocean) and produce a vast, arid continental interior that may have extreme seasonal variations.\nAnother theory is that the creation of the super-continent Pangaea contributed to the End-Permian mass extinction. Pangaea was almost fully formed at the transition from mid-Permian to late-Permian, and the \"Marine genus diversity\" diagram at the top of this article shows a level of extinction starting at that time, which might have qualified for inclusion in the \"Big Five\" if it were not overshadowed by the \"Great Dying\" at the end of the Permian.\nHuman activities.\nScientists have been concerned that human activities could cause more plants and animals to become extinct than any point in the past. Along with human-made changes in climate (see above), some of these extinctions could be caused by overhunting, overfishing, invasive species, or habitat loss. A study published in May 2017 in \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\" argued that a \"biological annihilation\" akin to a sixth mass extinction event is underway as a result of anthropogenic causes, such as over-population and over-consumption. The study suggested that as much as 50% of the number of animal individuals that once lived on Earth were already extinct, threatening the basis for human existence too.\nOther hypotheses.\nMany other hypotheses have been proposed, such as the spread of a new disease, or simple out-competition following an especially successful biological innovation. But all have been rejected, usually for one of the following reasons: they require events or processes for which there is no evidence; they assume mechanisms that are contrary to the available evidence; they are based on other theories that have been rejected or superseded.\nFuture biosphere extinction/sterilization.\nThe eventual warming and expanding of the Sun, combined with the eventual decline of atmospheric carbon dioxide, could actually cause an even greater mass extinction, having the potential to wipe out even microbes (in other words, the Earth would be completely sterilized): rising global temperatures caused by the expanding Sun would gradually increase the rate of weathering, which would in turn remove more and more CO2 from the atmosphere. When CO2 levels get too low (perhaps at 50 ppm), most plant life will die out, although simpler plants like grasses and mosses can survive much longer, until CO2 levels drop to 10 ppm.\nWith all photosynthetic organisms gone, atmospheric oxygen can no longer be replenished, and it is eventually removed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, perhaps from volcanic eruptions. Eventually the loss of oxygen will cause all remaining aerobic life to die out via asphyxiation, leaving behind only simple anaerobic prokaryotes. When the Sun becomes 10% brighter in about a billion years, Earth will suffer a moist greenhouse effect resulting in its oceans boiling away, while the Earth's liquid outer core cools due to the inner core's expansion and causes the Earth's magnetic field to shut down. In the absence of a magnetic field, charged particles from the Sun will deplete the atmosphere and further increase the Earth's temperature to an average of around 420 K (147\u00a0\u00b0C, 296\u00a0\u00b0F) in 2.8 billion years, causing the last remaining life on Earth to die out. This is the most extreme instance of a climate-caused extinction event. Since this will only happen late in the Sun's life, it would represent the final mass extinction in Earth's history (albeit a very long extinction event).\nEffects and recovery.\nThe effects of mass extinction events varied widely. After a major extinction event, usually only weedy species survive due to their ability to live in diverse habitats. Later, species diversify and occupy empty niches. Generally, it takes millions of years for biodiversity to recover after extinction events. In the most severe mass extinctions it may take 15 to 30 million years.\nThe worst Phanerozoic event, the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction, devastated life on Earth, killing over 90% of species. Life seemed to recover quickly after the P-T extinction, but this was mostly in the form of disaster taxa, such as the hardy \"Lystrosaurus\". The most recent research indicates that the specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems, with high biodiversity, complex food webs and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. It is thought that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction that inhibited recovery, as well as prolonged environmental stress that continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, four to six million years after the extinction;\nand some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30 million years after the P-T extinction, that is, in the late Triassic. Subsequent to the P-T extinction, there was an increase in provincialization, with species occupying smaller ranges \u2013 perhaps removing incumbents from niches and setting the stage for an eventual rediversification.\nThe effects of mass extinctions on plants are somewhat harder to quantify, given the biases inherent in the plant fossil record. Some mass extinctions (such as the end-Permian) were equally catastrophic for plants, whereas others, such as the end-Devonian, did not affect the flora.\nIn media.\nThe term extinction-level event (ELE) has been used in media. The 1998 film \"Deep Impact\" describes a potential comet strike of Earth as an ELE.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Smith", "text": "Food engineer and science-fiction author (1890\u20131965)\nEdward Elmer Smith (May 2, 1890 \u2013 August 31, 1965) was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and science-fiction author, best known for the \"Lensman\" and \"Skylark\" series. He is sometimes called the father of space opera.\nBiography.\nFamily and education.\nEdward Elmer Smith was born in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, on May 2, 1890, to Fred Jay Smith and Caroline Mills Smith, both staunch Presbyterians of British ancestry. His mother was a teacher born in Michigan in February 1855; his father was a sailor, born in Maine in January 1855 to an English father. They moved to Spokane, Washington, the winter after Edward Elmer was born, where Mr. Smith was working as a contractor in 1900. In 1902, the family moved to Seneaquoteen, near the Pend Oreille River, in Kootenai County, Idaho. He had four siblings, Rachel M. born September 1882, Daniel M. born January 1884, Mary Elizabeth born February 1886 (all of whom were born in Michigan), and Walter E. born July 1891 in Washington. In 1910, Fred and Caroline Smith and their son Walter were living in the Markham Precinct of Bonner County, Idaho; Fred is listed in census records as a farmer.\nSmith worked mainly as a manual laborer until he injured his wrist while fleeing from a fire at the age of 19. He attended the University of Idaho. (Many years later he would be installed in the 1984 Class of the University of Idaho Alumni Hall of Fame.) He entered its prep school in 1907, and graduated with two degrees in chemical engineering in 1914. He was president of the Chemistry Club, the Chess Club, and the Mandolin and Guitar Club, and captain of the Drill and Rifle Team; he also sang the bass lead in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. His undergraduate thesis was \"Some Clays of Idaho\", co-written with classmate Chester Fowler Smith, who died in California of tuberculosis the following year, after taking a teaching fellowship at Berkeley. Whether the two were related is not known.\nOn October 5, 1915, in Boise, Idaho he married Jeanne Craig MacDougall, the sister of his college roommate, Allen Scott (Scotty) MacDougall. (Her sister was named Clarissa MacLean MacDougall; the heroine of the \"Lensman\" novels would later be named Clarrissa MacDougall.) Jeanne MacDougall was born in Glasgow, Scotland; her parents were Donald Scott MacDougall, a violinist, and Jessica Craig MacLean. Her father had moved to Boise when the children were young, and later sent for his family; he died while they were en route in 1905. Jeanne's mother, who remarried businessman and retired politician John F. Kessler in 1914 worked at, and later owned, a boarding house on Ridenbaugh Street.\nThe Smiths had three children. Roderick N., born June 3, 1918, in the District of Columbia, was employed as a design engineer at Lockheed Aircraft. Verna Jean (later Verna Smith Trestrail), born August 25, 1920, in Michigan, was E. E. Smith's literary executor until her death in 1994. (Her son Kim Trestrail is now the executor.) Robert A. Heinlein in part dedicated his 1982 novel \"Friday\" to Verna. Clarissa M. (later Clarissa Wilcox), was born December 13, 1921, in Michigan.\nEarly chemical career and the beginning of \"Skylark\".\nAfter college, Smith was a junior chemist for the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., developing standards for butter and for oysters, while studying food chemistry at George Washington University. During World War I, he \"wanted to fly a Jenny biplane, but chemists were too scarce. (Or were Jennies too valuable?)\" He ended up being sent to the Commission for Relief in Belgium headed by Herbert Hoover.\nOne evening in 1915, the Smiths were visiting a former classmate from the University of Idaho, Dr. Carl Garby (1890\u20131928) who had also moved to Washington, D.C. He lived nearby in the Seaton Place Apartments with his wife, Lee Hawkins Garby. A long discussion about journeys into outer space ensued, and it was suggested that Smith should write down his ideas and speculations as a story about interstellar travel. Although he was interested, Smith believed after some thought that some romantic elements would be required and he was uncomfortable with that.\nLee Garby offered to take care of the love interest and the romantic dialogue, and Smith decided to give it a try. The sources of inspirations for the main characters in the novel were themselves; the \"Seatons\" and \"Cranes\" were based on the Smiths and Garbys, respectively. About one third of \"The Skylark of Space\" was completed by the end of 1916, when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it.\nSmith earned his master's degree in chemistry from the George Washington University in 1917, studying under Dr. Charles E. Munroe, whom Smith called \"probably the greatest high-explosives man yet to live\". Smith completed his PhD in chemical engineering in 1918, with a food engineering focus. His dissertation, \"The effect of bleaching with oxides of nitrogen upon the baking quality and commercial value of wheat flour\", was published in 1919.\nWriting \"Skylark\".\nIn 1919, Smith was hired as chief chemist for F. W. Stock &amp; Sons of Hillsdale, Michigan, at one time the largest family-owned mill east of the Mississippi, working on doughnut mixes.\nOne evening late in 1919, after moving to Michigan, Smith was looking after his child (presumably Roderick) while his wife attended a movie. He resumed work on \"The Skylark of Space\", finishing it in the spring of 1920. He submitted it to many book publishers and magazines, spending more in postage than he would eventually receive for its publication. Bob Davis, editor of \"Argosy\", sent an encouraging rejection letter in 1922, saying that he liked the novel personally, but that it was too far out for his readers. Finally, upon seeing the April 1927 issue of \"Amazing Stories\", he submitted it to that magazine. It was accepted, initially for $75, later raised to $125. It was published as a three-part serial in the August to October 1928 issues and it was such a success that associate editor Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published. (According to Warner, but no other source, Smith began work on the sequel, \"Skylark Three\", before the first book was accepted.)\nGarby, whose husband died in 1928, was not interested in further collaboration, so Smith began work on \"Skylark Three\" alone. It was published as another three-part serial, in the August to October 1930 issues of \"Amazing\", introduced as the cover story for August. This was as far as he had planned to take the \"Skylark\" series. It was praised in \"Amazing\"'s letter column, and he was paid \u00be\u00a2 per word, surpassing \"Amazing\"'s previous record of half a cent.\nNames used for publications.\nThe original magazine stories mostly have his name as \"Edward E. Smith, Ph.D.\". But more recent editions usually give his name as either \"E. E. Doc Smith\" or \"E. E. \"Doc\" Smith\".\nThe early 1930s: between \"Skylark\" and \"Lensman\".\nSmith then began work on what he intended as a new series, starting with \"Spacehounds of IPC,\" which he finished in the autumn of 1930. In this novel, he took pains to avoid the scientific impossibilities which had bothered some readers of the \"Skylark\" novels. Even in 1938, after he had written \"Galactic Patrol\", Smith considered it his finest work. He later said of it, \"This was really scientific fiction; not, like the Skylarks, pseudo-science\". Even at the end of his career, he considered it his only work of true science fiction. It was published in the July through September 1931 issues of \"Amazing,\" with Sloane making unauthorized changes. Fan letters in the magazine complained about the novel's containment within the Solar System, and Sloane sided with the readers. So when Harry Bates, editor of \"Astounding Stories\", offered Smith 2\u00a2/word\u2014payable on publication\u2014for his next story, he agreed. This meant that it could not be a sequel to \"Spacehounds.\"\nThis book would be \"Triplanetary\", \"in which scientific detail would not be bothered about, and in which his imagination would run riot.\" Indeed, characters within the story point out its psychological and scientific implausibilities, and sometimes even seem to suggest self-parody. At other times, they are conspicuously silent about obvious implausibilities. The January 1933 issue of \"Astounding\" announced that \"Triplanetary\" would appear in the March issue, and that issue's cover illustrated a scene from the story, but \"Astounding\"'s financial difficulties prevented the story from appearing. Smith then submitted the manuscript to \"Wonder Stories\", whose new editor, 17-year-old Charles D. Hornig, rejected it, later boasting about the rejection in a fanzine. He finally submitted it to \"Amazing\", which published it beginning in January 1934, but for only half a cent a word. Shortly after it was accepted, F. Orlin Tremaine, the new editor of the revived \"Astounding\", offered one cent a word for \"Triplanetary\". When he learned that he was too late, he suggested a third \"Skylark\" novel instead.\nIn the winter of 1933\u201334, Smith worked on \"The Skylark of Valeron\", but he felt that the story was getting out of control. He sent his first draft to Tremaine, with a distraught note asking for suggestions. Tremaine accepted the rough draft for $850, and announced it in the June 1934 issue, with a full-page editorial and a three-quarter-page advertisement. The novel was published in the August 1934 through February 1935 issues. \"Astounding\"'s circulation rose by 10,000 for the first issue, and its two main competitors, \"Amazing\" and \"Wonder Stories\", fell into financial difficulties, both skipping issues within a year.\nThe \"Lensman\" series.\nIn January 1936, a time period where he was already an established science-fiction writer, he took a job for salary plus profit-sharing as production manager at Dawn Donut Co. of Jackson, Michigan. This initially entailed almost a year's worth of 18-hour days and seven-day workweeks. Individuals who knew Smith confirmed that he had a role in developing mixes for doughnuts and other pastries, but the contention that he developed the first process for making powdered sugar adhere to doughnuts cannot be substantiated. Smith was reportedly dislocated from his job at Dawn Donuts by prewar rationing in early 1940.\nSmith had been contemplating writing a \"space-police novel\" since early 1927; once he had \"the Lensmen's universe fairly well set up\", he reviewed his science-fiction collection for \"cops-and-robbers\" stories. He cites Clinton Constantinescue's \"War of the Universe\" as a negative example, and Starzl and Williamson as positive ones. Tremaine responded extremely positively to a brief description of the idea.\nOnce Dawn Donuts became profitable in late 1936, Smith wrote an 85-page outline for what became the four core \"Lensman\" novels. In early 1937, Tremaine committed to buying them. Segmenting the story into four novels required considerable effort to avoid dangling loose ends. Smith cited Edgar Rice Burroughs as a negative example. After the outline was complete, he wrote a more detailed outline of \"Galactic Patrol\", plus a detailed graph of its structure, with \"peaks of emotional intensity and the valleys of characterization and background material.\" He notes, however, that he was never able to follow any of his outlines at all closely, as the \"characters get away from me and do exactly as they damn please.\" After completing the rough draft of \"Galactic Patrol\", he wrote the concluding chapter of the last book in the series, \"Children of the Lens.\" \"Galactic Patrol\" was published in the September 1937 through February 1938 issues of \"Astounding\". Unlike the revised book edition, it was not set in the same universe as \"Triplanetary\".\n\"Gray Lensman\", the fourth book in the series, appeared in \"Astounding\"'s October 1939 through January 1940 issues. \"Gray Lensman\" was extremely well received, as was its cover illustration. Campbell's editorial in the December issue suggested that the October issue was the best issue of \"Astounding\" ever, and \"Gray Lensman\" was first place in the Analytical Laboratory statistics \"by a lightyear\", with three runners-up in a distant tie for second place. The cover was also praised by readers in \"Brass Tacks\", and Campbell noted, \"We got a letter from E. E. Smith saying he and [cover artist] Hubert Rogers agreed on how Kinnison looked.\"\nSmith was the guest of honor at Chicon I, the second World Science Fiction Convention, held in Chicago over Labor Day weekend 1940, giving a speech on the importance of science fiction fandom entitled \"What Does This Convention Mean?\" He attended the convention's masquerade as C. L. Moore's Northwest Smith, and met fans living near him in Michigan, who would later form the Galactic Roamers, which previewed and advised him on his future work.\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Smith discovered he \"was one year over age for reinstatement\" into the US Army. Instead he worked on high explosives at the Kingsbury Ordnance Plant in La Port, Indiana, at first as a chemical engineer, but gradually worked his way up to chief. In late 1943 he became head of the Inspection Division, and was fired in early 1944.\nSmith spent the next few years working on \"light farm machinery and heavy tanks for Allis-Chalmers,\" after which he was hired as manager of the Cereal Mix Division of J. W. Allen &amp; Co., where he worked until his professional retirement in 1957.\nRetirement and late writing.\nAfter Smith retired, he and his wife lived in Clearwater, Florida in the fall and winter, driving the smaller of their two trailers to Seaside, Oregon, each April, often stopping at science fiction conventions on the way. (Smith did not like to fly.) In 1963, he was presented the inaugural First Fandom Hall of Fame award at the 21st World Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C. Some of his biography is captured in an essay by Robert A. Heinlein, which was reprinted in the collection \"Expanded Universe\" in 1980. A more detailed, although allegedly error-ridden biography is in Sam Moskowitz's \"Seekers of Tomorrow.\"\nRobert Heinlein and Smith were friends. (Heinlein dedicated his 1958 novel \"Methuselah's Children\" \"To Edward E. Smith, PhD\".) Heinlein reported that E. E. Smith perhaps took his \"unrealistic\" heroes from life, citing as an example the extreme competence of the hero of \"Spacehounds of IPC\". He reported that E. E. Smith was a large, blond, athletic, very intelligent, very gallant man, married to a remarkably beautiful, intelligent, red-haired woman named MacDougal (thus perhaps the prototypes of 'Kimball Kinnison' and 'Clarissa MacDougal'). In Heinlein's essay, he reports that he began to suspect Smith might be a sort of \"superman\" when he asked Smith for help in purchasing a car. Smith tested the car by driving it on a back road at illegally high speeds with their heads pressed tightly against the roof columns to listen for chassis squeaks by bone conduction\u2014a process apparently improvised on the spot.\nIn his nonseries novels written after his professional retirement, \"Galaxy Primes\", \"Subspace Explorers\", and \"Subspace Encounter\", E. E. Smith explores themes of telepathy and other mental abilities collectively called \"psionics\", and of the conflict between libertarian and socialistic/communistic influences in the colonization of other planets. \"Galaxy Primes\" was written after critics such as Groff Conklin and P. Schuyler Miller in the early '50s accused his fiction of being pass\u00e9, and he made an attempt to do something more in line with the concepts about which \"Astounding\" editor John W. Campbell encouraged his writers to make stories. Despite this, it was rejected by Campbell, and it was eventually published by \"Amazing Stories\" in 1959. His late story \"The Imperial Stars\" (1964), featuring a troupe of circus performers involved in sabotage in a galactic empire, recaptured some of the atmosphere from his earlier works and was intended as the first in a new series, with outlines of later parts rumored to still exist. In fact, the Imperial Stars characters and concepts were continued by author Stephen Goldin as the \"Family D'Alembert series\". While the book covers indicate the series was written by Smith and Goldin together, Goldin only ever had Smith's original novella to expand upon.\nThe fourth \"Skylark\" novel, \"Skylark DuQuesne\", ran in the June to October 1965 issues of \"If\", beginning once again as the cover story. Editor Frederik Pohl introduced it with a one-page summary of the previous stories, which were all at least 30 years old.\nLord Tedric.\nSmith published two novelettes entitled \"Tedric\" in \"Other Worlds Science Fiction Stories\" (1953) and \"Lord Tedric\" in \"Universe Science Fiction\" (1954). These were almost completely forgotten until after Smith's death. In 1975, a compendium of Smith's works was published, entitled \"The Best of E. E. \"Doc\" Smith\", containing these two short stories, excerpts from several of his major works, and another short story first published in \"Worlds of If\" in 1964 entitled \"The Imperial Stars\".\nIn Smith's original short stories, Tedric was a smith (both blacksmith and whitesmith) residing in a small town near a castle in a situation roughly equivalent to England of the 1200s. He received instruction in advanced metallurgy from a time-traveler who wanted to change the situation in his own time by modifying certain events of the past. From this instruction, he was able to build better suits of armor and help defeat the villains of the piece. Unlike Eklund's later novels based on these short stories, the original Tedric never left his own time or planet, and fought purely local enemies of his own time period.\nA few years later and 13 years after Smith's death, Verna Smith arranged with Gordon Eklund to publish another novel of the same name about the same fictional character, introducing it as \"a new series conceived by E. E. 'Doc' Smith\". Eklund later went on to publish the other novels in the series, one or two under the pseudonym \"E. E. 'Doc' Smith\" or \"E. E. Smith\". The protagonist possesses heroic qualities similar to those of the heroes in Smith's original novels and can communicate with an extra-dimensional race of beings known as the Scientists, whose archenemy is Fra Villion, a mysterious character described as a dark knight, skilled in whip-sword combat, and evil genius behind the creation of a planetoid-sized \"iron sphere\" armed with a weapon capable of destroying planets. As a result, Smith is believed by many to be the unacknowledged progenitor of themes that would appear in \"Star Wars\". In fact, however, these appear in the sequels written by others after Smith's death.\nCritical opinion.\nSmith's novels are generally considered to be classic space operas, and he is sometimes called the first of the three \"novas\" of 20th-century science fiction (with Stanley G. Weinbaum and Robert A. Heinlein as the second and third novas).\nHeinlein credited him for being his main influence:\nI have learned from many writers\u2014from Verne and Wells and Campbell and Sinclair Lewis, et al.\u2014but I have learned more from you than from any of the others and perhaps more than for all the others put together...\nSmith expressed a preference for inventing fictional technologies that were not strictly impossible (so far as the science of the day was aware) but highly unlikely: \"the more highly improbable a concept is\u2014short of being contrary to mathematics whose fundamental operations involve no neglect of infinitesimals\u2014the better I like it\" was his phrase.\n\"Lensman\" was one of five finalists when the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention judged Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" the Best All-Time Series.\nThe Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Smith in 2004.\nExtending the \"Lensman\" universe.\n\"Vortex Blasters\" (also known as \"Masters of the Vortex\") is set in the same universe as the \"Lensman\" novels. It is an extension to the main storyline which takes place between \"Galactic Patrol\" and \"Children of the Lens\", and introduces a different type of psionics from that used by the Lensmen. \"Spacehounds of IPC\" is not a part of the series, despite occasional erroneous statements to the contrary. (It is listed as a novel in the series in some paperback editions of the 1970s.)\nInfluence on science and the military.\nSmith was widely read by scientists and engineers from the 1930s into the 1970s. Literary precursors of ideas which arguably entered the military-scientific complex include SDI (\"Triplanetary\"), stealth (\"Gray Lensman\"), the OODA loop, C3-based warfare, and the AWACS (\"Gray Lensman\").\nAn inarguable influence was described in a June 11, 1947, letter to Smith from John W. Campbell (the editor of \"Astounding\", where much of the \"Lensman\" series was originally published). In it, Campbell relayed Captain Cal Laning's acknowledgment that he had used Smith's ideas for displaying the battlespace situation (called the \"tank\" in the stories) in the design of the United States Navy's ships' Combat Information Centers. \"The entire set-up was taken specifically, directly, and consciously from the \"Directrix\". In your story, you reached the situation the Navy was in\u2014more communication channels than integration techniques to handle it. You proposed such an integrating technique and proved how advantageous it could be. You, sir, were 100% right. As the Japanese Navy\u2014not the hypothetical Boskonian fleet\u2014learned at an appalling cost.\"\nOne underlying theme of the later \"Lensman\" novels was the difficulty in maintaining military secrecy\u2014as advanced capabilities are revealed, the opposing side can often duplicate them. This point was also discussed extensively by John Campbell in his letter to Smith. Also in the later \"Lensman\" novels, and particular after the \"Battle of Klovia\" broke the Boskonian's power base at the end of \"Second Stage Lensmen\", the Boskonian forces and particularly Kandron of Onlo reverted to terroristic tactics to attempt to demoralize Civilization, thus providing an early literary glimpse into this modern problem of both law enforcement and military response. The use of \"Vee-two\" gas by the pirates attacking the \"Hyperion\" in \"Triplanetary\" (in both magazine and book appearances) also suggests anticipation of the terrorist uses of poison gases. However, Smith lived through WWI, when the use of poison gas on troops was well known to the populace; extending the assumption that pirates might use it if they could obtain it was no great extension of the present-day knowledge.\nThe beginning of the story \"Skylark of Space\" describes in relative detail the protagonist's research into separation of platinum group residues, subsequent experiments involving electrolysis, and the discovery of a process evocative of cold fusion (over 50 years before Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann). He describes a nuclear process yielding large amounts of energy and producing only negligible radioactive waste\u2014which then goes on to form the basis of the adventures in the Skylark books. Smith's general description of the process of discovery is highly evocative of R\u00f6ntgen's descriptions of his discovery of the X-ray.\nAnother theme of the \"Skylark\" novels involves precursors of modern information technology. The humanoid aliens encountered in the first novel have developed a primitive technology called the \"mechanical educator\", which allows direct conversion of brain waves into intelligible thought for transmission to others or for electrical storage. By the third novel in the series, \"Skylark of Valeron\", this technology has grown into an \"Electronic Brain\" which is capable of computation on all \"bands\" of energy\u2014electromagnetism, gravity, and \"tachyonic\" energy and radiation bands included. This is itself derived from a discussion of reductionist atomic theory in the second novel, \"Skylark Three\", which brings to mind modern quark and sub-quark theories of elementary particle physics.\nLiterary influences.\nIn his 1947 essay \"The Epic of Space\", Smith listed (by last name only) authors he enjoyed reading: John W. Campbell, L. Sprague de Camp, Robert A. Heinlein, Murray Leinster, H. P. Lovecraft, and A. Merritt (specifically \"The Ship of Ishtar\", \"The Moon Pool\", \"The Snake Mother\", and \"Dwellers in the Mirage\", as well as the character John Kenton), C. L. Moore (specifically \"Jirel of Joiry\"), Roman Frederick Starzl, John Taine, A. E. van Vogt, Stanley G. Weinbaum (specifically \"Tweerl\"), and Jack Williamson. In a passage on his preparation for writing the \"Lensman\" novels, he notes that Clinton Constantinescu's \"War of the Universe\" was not a masterpiece, but says that Starzl and Williamson were masters; this suggests that Starzl's Interplanetary Flying Patrol may have been an influence on Smith's Triplanetary Patrol, later the \"Galactic Patrol\". The feeding of the Overlords of Delgon upon the life-force of their victims at the end of chapter five of \"Galactic Patrol\" seems a clear allusion to chapter 29 of \"The Moon Pool\", Merritt's account of the Taithu and the power of love in chapters 29 and 34 also bear some resemblance to the end of \"Children of the Lens.\" Smith also mentions Edgar Rice Burroughs, complaining about loose ends at the end of one of his novels.\nSmith acknowledges the help of the Galactic Roamers writers' workshop, plus E. Everett Evans, Ed Counts, an unnamed aeronautical engineer, Dr. James Enright, and Dr. Richard W. Dodson. Smith's daughter, Verna, lists the following authors as visitors to the Smith household in her youth: Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, Heinlein, Dave Kyle, Bob Tucker, Williamson, Pohl, Merritt, and the Galactic Roamers. Smith cites Bigelow's \"Theoretical Chemistry\u2013Fundamentals\" as a justification for the possibility of the inertialess drive. Also, an extended reference is made to Rudyard Kipling's \"Ballad of Boh Da Thone\" in \"Gray Lensman\" (chapter 22, \"Regeneration\", in a conversation between Kinnison and MacDougall). Again in \"Gray Lensman\", Smith quotes from Merritt's \"Dwellers in the Mirage\", even name-checking the author:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He could not even pray, with immortal Merritt's Dwayanu, \"Luka - turn your wheel so that I need not slay this woman!\"\nSam Moskowitz's biographical essay on Smith in \"Seekers of Tomorrow\" states that he regularly read \"Argosy\" magazine, and everything by H. G. Wells, Jules Verne, H. Rider Haggard, Edgar Allan Poe, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Moskowitz also notes that Smith's \"reading enthusiasms included poetry, philosophy, ancient and medieval history, and all of English literature\". (Smith's grandson notes that he spoke, and sang, German.) The influence of these is not readily apparent, except in the Roman section of \"Triplanetary\", and in the impeccable but convoluted grammar of Smith's narration. Some influence of 19th-century philosophy of language may be detectable in the account in \"Galactic Patrol\" of the Lens of Arisia as a universal translator, which is reminiscent of Frege's strong realism about \"Sinn\", that is, thought or sense.\nBoth Moskowitz and Smith's daughter Verna Smith Trestrail report that Smith had a troubled relationship with John Campbell, the editor of \"Astounding\". Smith's most successful works were published under Campbell, but the degree of influence is uncertain. The original outline for the \"Lensman\" series had been accepted by F. Orlin Tremaine, and Smith angered Campbell by showing loyalty to Tremaine at his new magazine, \"Comet\", when he sold him \"The Vortex Blaster\" in 1941. Campbell's announcement of \"Children of the Lens\", in 1947, was less than enthusiastic. Campbell later said that he published it only reluctantly, though he praised it privately, and bought little from Smith thereafter.\nFictional appearances.\nSmith himself appears as a character in the 2006 novel \"The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril\" by Paul Malmont. The novel describes friendship and rivalry among pulp writers of the 1930s. He also appears as \"Lensman Ted Smith\" in the 1980 novel \"The Number of the Beast\" and as \"Commander Ted Smith\" in the 1985 novel \"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\", both by Robert A. Heinlein. It is also suggested that he was one of the inspirations for Heinlein's character Lazarus Long. Christopher Nuttall incorporates a fictional quote from \u201cEdward E.

While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem that had been open for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra.\nGalois was a staunch Republican and was heavily involved in the political turmoil that surrounded the French Revolution of 1830. As a result of his political activism, he was arrested repeatedly, serving one jail sentence of several months. For reasons that remain obscure, shortly after his release from prison, Galois fought in a duel and died of the wounds he suffered.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nGalois was born on 25 October 1811 to Nicolas-Gabriel Galois and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde-Marie (n\u00e9e Demante). His father was a Republican and was head of Bourg-la-Reine's liberal party. His father became mayor of the village after Louis XVIII returned to the throne in 1814. His mother, the daughter of a jurist, was a fluent reader of Latin and classical literature and was responsible for her son's education for his first twelve years.\nIn October 1823, he entered the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand where his teacher Louis Paul \u00c9mile Richard recognized his brilliance. At the age of 14, he began to take a serious interest in mathematics.\nGalois found a copy of Adrien-Marie Legendre's \"\u00c9l\u00e9ments de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\", which, it is said, he read \"like a novel\" and mastered at the first reading. At 15, he was reading the original papers of Joseph-Louis Lagrange, such as the \"R\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9solution alg\u00e9brique des \u00e9quations\" which likely motivated his later work on equation theory, and \"Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul des fonctions\", work intended for professional mathematicians, yet his classwork remained uninspired and his teachers accused him of putting on the airs of a genius.\nBudding mathematician.\nIn 1828, Galois attempted the entrance examination for the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, the most prestigious institution for mathematics in France at the time, without the usual preparation in mathematics, and failed for lack of explanations on the oral examination. In that same year, he entered the \u00c9cole Normale (then known as l'\u00c9cole pr\u00e9paratoire), a far inferior institution for mathematical studies at that time, where he found some professors sympathetic to him.\nIn the following year Galois's first paper, on simple continued fractions, \nwas published. It was at around the same time that he began making fundamental discoveries in the theory of polynomial equations. He submitted two papers on this topic to the Academy of Sciences. Augustin-Louis Cauchy refereed these papers, but refused to accept them for publication for reasons that still remain unclear. However, in spite of many claims to the contrary, it is widely held that Cauchy recognized the importance of Galois's work, and that he merely suggested combining the two papers into one in order to enter it in the competition for the academy's Grand Prize in Mathematics. Cauchy, an eminent mathematician of the time though with political views that were diametrically opposed to those of Galois, considered Galois's work to be a likely winner.\nOn 28 July 1829, Galois's father died by suicide after a bitter political dispute with the village priest. A couple of days later, Galois made his second and last attempt to enter the Polytechnique and failed yet again. It is undisputed that Galois was more than qualified; accounts differ on why he failed. More plausible accounts state that Galois made too many logical leaps and baffled the incompetent examiner, which enraged Galois. The recent death of his father may have also influenced his behavior.\nHaving been denied admission to the \u00c9cole polytechnique, Galois took the Baccalaureate examinations in order to enter the \u00c9cole normale. He passed, receiving his degree on 29 December 1829. His examiner in mathematics reported, \"This pupil is sometimes obscure in expressing his ideas, but he is intelligent and shows a remarkable spirit of research.\"\nGalois submitted his memoir on equation theory several times, but it was never published in his lifetime. Though his first attempt was refused by Cauchy, in February 1830 following Cauchy's suggestion he submitted it to the academy's secretary Joseph Fourier, to be considered for the Grand Prix of the academy. Unfortunately, Fourier died soon after, and the memoir was lost. The prize would be awarded that year to Niels Henrik Abel posthumously and also to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Despite the lost memoir, Galois published three papers that year. One laid the foundations for Galois theory. The second was about the numerical resolution of equations (root finding in modern terminology). The third was an important one in number theory, in which the concept of a finite field was first articulated.\nPolitical firebrand.\nGalois lived during a time of political turmoil in France. Charles X had succeeded Louis XVIII in 1824, but in 1827 his faction suffered a major electoral setback and by 1830 the opposition liberal party became the majority. Charles, faced with political opposition from the chambers, staged a coup d'\u00e9tat, and issued his notorious July Ordinances, touching off the July Revolution which ended with Louis Philippe I becoming king. While their counterparts at the Polytechnique were making history in the streets, Galois, at the \u00c9cole Normale, was locked in by the school's director. Galois was incensed and wrote a blistering letter criticizing the director, which he submitted to the \"Gazette des \u00c9coles\", signing the letter with his full name. Although the \"Gazette\"'s editor omitted the signature for publication, Galois was expelled.\nAlthough his expulsion would have formally taken effect on 4 January 1831, Galois quit school immediately and joined the staunchly Republican artillery unit of the National Guard. He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations. Due to controversy surrounding the unit, soon after Galois became a member, on 31 December 1830, the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government. At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois's former unit were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government.\nIn April 1831, the officers were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as Alexandre Dumas. The proceedings grew riotous. At some point, Galois stood and proposed a toast in which he said, \"To Louis Philippe,\" with a dagger above his cup. The republicans at the banquet interpreted Galois's toast as a threat against the king's life and cheered. He was arrested the following day at his mother's house and held in detention at Sainte-P\u00e9lagie prison until 15 June 1831, when he had his trial. Galois's defense lawyer cleverly claimed that Galois actually said, \"To Louis-Philippe, \"if he betrays\",\" but that the qualifier was drowned out in the cheers. The prosecutor asked a few more questions, and perhaps influenced by Galois's youth, the jury acquitted him that same day.\nOn the following Bastille Day (14 July 1831), Galois was at the head of a protest, wearing the uniform of the disbanded artillery, and came heavily armed with several pistols, a loaded rifle, and a dagger. He was again arrested. During his stay in prison, Galois at one point drank alcohol for the first time at the goading of his fellow inmates. One of these inmates, Fran\u00e7ois-Vincent Raspail, recorded what Galois said while drunk in a letter from 25 July. Excerpted from the letter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And I tell you, I will die in a duel on the occasion of some coquette de bas \u00e9tage. Why? Because she will invite me to avenge her honor which another has compromised.&lt;br&gt;\nDo you know what I lack, my friend? I can confide it only to you: it is someone whom I can love and love only in spirit. I've lost my father and no one has ever replaced him, do you hear me...?\nRaspail continues that Galois, still in a delirium, attempted suicide, and that he would have succeeded if his fellow inmates had not forcibly stopped him. Months later, when Galois's trial occurred on 23 October, he was sentenced to six months in prison for illegally wearing a uniform. While in prison, he continued to develop his mathematical ideas. He was released on 29 April 1832.\nFinal days.\nGalois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the \u00c9cole Normale, although he continued to spend time in political activities. After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority. Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did on 17 January 1831. Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois's work \"incomprehensible\", declaring that \"[Galois's] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor\"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: \"We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.\" \nWhile Poisson's report was made before Galois's 14 July arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29\u00a0April 1832, after which he was somehow talked into a duel.\nGalois's fatal duel took place on 30 May. The true motives behind the duel are obscure. There has been much speculation about them. What is known is that, five days before his death, he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair.\nSome archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was St\u00e9phanie-F\u00e9licie Poterin du Motel, the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life. Fragments of letters from her, copied by Galois himself (with many portions, such as her name, either obliterated or deliberately omitted), are available. The letters hint that Poterin du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf. This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Galois's cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois \"found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fianc\u00e9, each of whom provoked the duel.\" Galois himself exclaimed: \"I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes.\" \nAs to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville, who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois's first arrest. However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved. It has been speculated that he was Poterin du Motel's \"supposed fianc\u00e9\" at the time (she ultimately married someone else), but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture. On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials \"L.D.\") that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois's Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges. Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.\nWhatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts. Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, \"This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind.\" However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated. In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the academy and other papers.\nEarly in the morning of 30 May 1832, he was shot in the abdomen, was abandoned by his opponents and his own seconds, and was found by a passing farmer. He died the following morning at ten o'clock in the H\u00f4pital Cochin (probably of peritonitis), after refusing the offices of a priest. His funeral ended in riots. There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral, but during the same time the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque's death and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June. Only Galois's younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois's death. Galois was 20 years old. His last words to his younger brother Alfred were:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Ne pleure pas, Alfred\u00a0! J'ai besoin de tout mon courage pour mourir \u00e0 vingt ans\u00a0!\"(Don't weep, Alfred! I need all my courage to die at twenty!)\nOn 2 June, \u00c9variste Galois was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse Cemetery whose exact location is unknown. In the cemetery of his native town \u2013 Bourg-la-Reine \u2013 a cenotaph in his honour was erected beside the graves of his relatives.\nIn 1842, Joseph Liouville began studying Galois's unpublished papers and acknowledged their value in 1843. It is not clear what happened in the ten years between 1832 and 1842 nor what eventually inspired Liouville to begin reading Galois's papers. Jesper L\u00fctzen explores this subject at some length in Chapter XIV \"Galois Theory\" of his book about Joseph Liouville without reaching any definitive conclusions.\nIt is certainly possible that mathematicians (including Liouville) did not want to publicize Galois's papers because Galois was a republican political activist who died 5 days before the June Rebellion, an unsuccessful anti-monarchist insurrection of Parisian republicans. In Galois's obituary, his friend Auguste Chevalier almost accused academicians at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique of having killed Galois since, if they had not rejected his work, he would have become a mathematician and would not have devoted himself to the republican political activism for which some believed he was killed. Given that France was still living in the shadow of the Reign of Terror and the Napoleonic era, Liouville might have waited until the political turmoil subsided (from the failed June Rebellion and its aftermath) before turning his attention to Galois's papers.\nLiouville finally published Galois's manuscripts in the October\u2013November 1846 issue of the \"Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es\". Galois's most famous contribution was a novel proof that there is no quintic formula \u2013 that is, that fifth and higher degree equations are not generally solvable by radicals. Although Niels Henrik Abel had already proved the impossibility of a \"quintic formula\" by radicals in 1824 and Paolo Ruffini had published a solution in 1799 that turned out to be flawed, Galois's methods led to deeper research into what is now called Galois Theory, which can be used to determine, for \"any\" polynomial equation, whether it has a solution by radicals.\nContributions to mathematics.\nFrom the closing lines of a letter from Galois to his friend Auguste Chevalier, dated 29 May 1832, two days before Galois's death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Tu prieras publiquement Jacobi ou Gauss de donner leur avis, non sur la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, mais sur l'importance des th\u00e9or\u00e8mes.\"\n\"Apr\u00e8s cela, il y aura, j'esp\u00e8re, des gens qui trouveront leur profit \u00e0 d\u00e9chiffrer tout ce g\u00e2chis.\"\nWithin the 60 or so pages of Galois's collected works are many important ideas that have had far-reaching consequences for nearly all branches of mathematics. \nHis work has been compared to that of Niels Henrik Abel (1802\u20131829), a contemporary mathematician who also died at a very young age, and much of their work had significant overlap.\nAlgebra.\nWhile many mathematicians before Galois gave consideration to what are now known as groups, he was the first one to use the word \"group\" (in French \"groupe\") in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as group theory. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a \"proper decomposition\" if the left and right cosets coincide, which leads to the notion of what today are known as normal subgroups. He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor) in essentially the same form as it is understood today.\nIn his last letter to Chevalier and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:\nGalois theory.\nGalois's most significant contribution to mathematics is his development of Galois theory. He realized that the algebraic solution to a polynomial equation is related to the structure of a group of permutations associated with the roots of the polynomial, the Galois group of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in radicals if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with abelian quotient, that is, its Galois group is solvable. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the theory of equations to which Galois originally applied it.\nAnalysis.\nGalois also made some contributions to the theory of Abelian integrals and continued fractions.\nAs written in his last letter, Galois passed from the study of elliptic functions to consideration of the integrals of the most general algebraic differentials, today called Abelian integrals. He classified these integrals into three categories.\nContinued fractions.\nIn his first paper in 1828, Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which represents a quadratic surd \"\u03b6\" is purely periodic if and only if \"\u03b6\" is a reduced surd, that is, formula_1 and its conjugate formula_2\nsatisfies formula_3.\nIn fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if \"\u03b6\" is a reduced quadratic surd and \"\u03b7\" is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for \"\u03b6\" and for (\u22121/\"\u03b7\") are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other. In symbols we have\nformula_4\nwhere \"\u03b6\" is any reduced quadratic surd, and \"\u03b7\" is its conjugate.\nFrom these two theorems of Galois a result already known to Lagrange can be deduced. If \"r\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a01 is a rational number that is not a perfect square, then\nformula_5\nIn particular, if \"n\" is any non-square positive integer, the regular continued fraction expansion of \u221a\"n\" contains a repeating block of length \"m\", in which the first \"m\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 partial denominators form a palindromic string.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9820", "revid": "474828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9820", "title": "Ennius", "text": "Roman writer and poet (c. 239 \u2013 c. 169 BC)\nQuintus Ennius (; c.\u2009239\u00a0\u2013 c.\u2009169 BCE) was a writer and poet who lived during the Roman Republic. He is often considered the father of Roman poetry. He was born in the small town of Rudiae, located near modern Lecce (ancient \"Calabria\", today Salento), a town founded by the Messapians, and could speak Greek as well as Latin and Oscan (his native language). Although only fragments of his works survive, his influence in Latin literature was significant, particularly in his use of Greek literary models.\nBiography.\nVery little is reliably known about the life of Ennius. His contemporaries hardly mentioned him and much that is related about him could have been embroidered from references to himself in his now fragmentary writings. Some lines of the \"Annales\", as well as ancient testimonies, for example, suggest that Ennius opened his epic with a recollection of a dream in which the ancient epic-writer Homer informed him that his spirit had been reborn into Ennius. It is true that the doctrine of the transmigration of souls once flourished in the areas of Italy settled by Greeks, but the statement might have been no more than a literary flourish. Ennius seems to have been given to making large claims, as in the report by Maurus Servius Honoratus that he claimed descent from Messapus, the legendary king of his native district. The partially Hellenised city of Rudiae (in modern Apulia), his place of birth, was certainly in the area settled by the Messapians. And this, he used to say, according to Aulus Gellius, had endowed him with a triple linguistic and cultural heritage, fancifully described as \"three hearts\u2026 Greek, Oscan and Latin\".\nThe public career of Ennius first really emerges in middle life, when he was serving in the army with the rank of centurion during the Second Punic War. While in Sardinia in the year 204 BCE, he is said to have attracted the attention of Cato the Elder and was taken by him to Rome. There he taught Greek and adapted Greek plays for a livelihood, and by his poetical compositions gained the friendship of some of the greatest men in Rome whose achievements he praised. Amongst these were Scipio Africanus and Fulvius Nobilior, whom he accompanied on his Aetolian campaign (189). Afterwards he made the capture of Ambracia, at which he was present, the subject of a play and of an episode in the \"Annales\". It was through the influence of Nobilior's son Quintus that Ennius subsequently obtained Roman citizenship. But he himself lived plainly and simply in the literary quarter on the Aventine Hill with the poet Caecilius Statius, a fellow adapter of Greek plays.\nAt about the age of 70 Ennius died, immediately after producing his tragedy \"Thyestes\". In the last book of his epic poem, in which he seems to have given various details of his personal history, he mentioned that he was in his 67th year at the date of its composition. He compared himself, in contemplation of the close of the great work of his life, to a gallant horse which, after having often won the prize at the Olympic Games, obtained his rest when weary with age. A similar feeling of pride at the completion of a great career is expressed in the memorial lines which he composed to be placed under his bust after death: \"Let no one weep for me, or celebrate my funeral with mourning; for I still live, as I pass to and fro through the mouths of men.\"\nLiterature.\nEnnius continued the nascent literary tradition by writing plays in Greek and Roman style (praetextae and palliatae), as well as his most famous work, a historical epic in hexameters called the \"Annales\". Other minor works include the \"Epicharmus\", \"Epigrammata\", the \"Euhemerus\", the \"Hedyphagetica\", \"Praecepta\"/\"Protrepticus\", \"Saturae\" (or \"Satires\"), \"Scipio\", and \"Sota\".\nThe \"Annales\".\nThe \"Annales\" was an epic poem in fifteen books, later expanded to eighteen, covering Roman history from the fall of Troy in 1184 BCE down to the censorship of Cato the Elder in 184 BCE. It was the first Latin poem to adopt the dactylic hexameter metre used in Greek epic and didactic poetry, leading it to become the standard metre for these genres in Latin poetry. The \"Annals\" became a school text for Roman schoolchildren, eventually supplanted by Virgil's \"Aeneid\". About 600 lines survive.\nMinor works.\nThe \"Epicharmus\" was inspired by the philosophical hypotheses developed by the Sicilian poet and philosopher Epicharmus of Kos, after which Ennius's work took its name. In the \"Epicharmus\", the poet describes a dream he had in which he died and was transported to some place of heavenly enlightenment. Here, he met Epicharmus, who explained the nature of the gods and taught Ennius the physics of the universe.\nThe \"Euhemerus\" presented a theological doctrine based on the ideas of Euhemerus of Messene, who argued that the gods of Olympus were not supernatural powers that interfere in the lives of humans, but rather heroes of old who after death were eventually regarded as deities due to their valor, bravery, or cultural impact (this belief is now known as euhemerism). Both Cicero and Lactantius write that the \"Euhemerus\" was a \"translat[ion] and a recount[ing]\" of Euhemerus's original work the \"Sacred History\", but it is unclear if this means Ennius simply translated the original from Greek into Latin, or added in his own elements. Most of what is preserved of this work comes to us from Lactantius, and these snippets suggest that the \"Euhemerus\" was a prose text.\nThe \"Hedyphagetica\" took much of its substance from the gastronomical epic of Archestratus of Gela. The extant portions of Ennius's poem discuss where a reader might find the best type of fish. Most of the fragments, replete with unique terms for fish and numerous place names, are corrupt or damaged. The \"Hedyphagetica\" is written in hexameters, but differs from the \"Annales\" in regards to \"metrical practices\"; this difference is largely due to each works' distinct subject matter.\nThe titles \"Praecepta\" and \"Protrepticus\" were likely used to refer to the same (possibly exhortatory) work. However, given this work's almost non-existent nature (only the word \"pannibus\"\u2014an \"unusual\" form of the word \"pannis\", meaning \"rags\"\u2014is preserved in the work of the Latin grammarian Charisius), this position is extremely difficult to verify.\nThe \"Saturae\" is a collection of about thirty lines from satirical poems\u2014making it the first extant instance of Roman satire. These lines are written in a variety of poetic metres. The poems in this collection \"were mostly concerned with practical wisdom, often driving home a lesson with the help of a fable.\"\nEnnius's \"Scipio\" was a work (possibly a panegyric poem) that apparently celebrated the life and deeds of Scipio Africanus. Hardly anything remains of this work, and what is preserved is embedded in the works of others. Unfortunately, \"no quotation of [\"Scipio\"] supplies a context\". Some have proposed that the work was written before the \"Annales\", and others have said that the work was written after Scipio's 201 BCE triumph that followed the Battle of Zama (202 BCE).\nThe \"Sota\" was a poem, potentially of some length, named after the Greek poet Sotades. The work, which followed a metre established by Sotades known as the \"Sotadeus\", concerned itself with a number of disparate topics and ideas.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9823", "revid": "37031437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9823", "title": "Eris (mythology)", "text": "Greek goddess of strife and discord\nIn Greek mythology, Eris () is the goddess and personification of strife and discord, particularly in war, and in the \"Iliad\" (where she is the \"sister\" of Ares the god of war). According to Hesiod she was the daughter of primordial Nyx (Night), and the mother of a long list of undesirable personified abstractions, such as Ponos (Toil), Limos (Famine), Algea (Pains) and Ate (Delusion). Eris initiated a quarrel between Hera, Athena and Aphrodite, which led to the Judgement of Paris and ultimately the Trojan War. Eris's Roman equivalent is Discordia. According to Hesiod, there was another Eris, separate and distinct from Eris the daughter of Nyx, who was beneficial to men.\nEtymology.\nThe name derives from the noun \"eris\", with stem \"erid-\", which means \"strife, discord\" and is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb \"to raise, stir, excite\" and the proper name have been suggested. R. S. P. Beekes sees no strong evidence for this relation and excludes the derivation from \"to prop, to support\" due to the name's original \u03b9- stem. Watkins suggested origin from a Proto-Indo-European root \"ere\"- meaning \"to separate, to adjoin\". The name gave several derivatives in Ancient Greek, including \"to fight\" and \"object of a quarrel\".\nFamily.\nIn Homer's \"Iliad\", Eris is described as the \"sister and comrade\" of Ares, though according to Geoffrey Kirk she is \"not fully personified\" here, and this genealogy is a \"purely \"ad hoc\" description\". Some scholars interpret this passage as indicating she is the daughter of Zeus and Hera, Ares' parents. However, according to Hesiod's \"Theogony\", Eris is the daughter of Nyx (Night), being among the many children Nyx produced without a partner. These siblings of Eris include personifications\u2014like Eris\u2014of several \"loathsome\" (\"\u03c3\u03c4\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2\") things, such as Moros (\"Doom\"), Thanatos (\"Death\"), the Moirai (\"Fates\"), Nemesis (\"Indignation\"), Apate (\"Deceit\"), and Geras (\"Old Age\").\nLike her mother Nyx, Hesiod has Eris as the mother\u2014with no father mentioned\u2014of many children (the only child of Nyx with offspring) who are also personifications representing various misfortunes and harmful things which, in Eris' case, might be thought to result from discord and strife. All of Eris' children are little more than allegorizations of the meanings of their names, with virtually no other identity. The following table lists the children of Eris, as given by Hesiod:\nJudgement of Paris.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEris plays a crucial role in one important myth. She was the initiator of the quarrel between the three Greek goddesses, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, resolved by the Judgement of Paris, which led to Paris' abduction of Helen of Troy and the outbreak of the Trojan War. As the story came to be told, all the gods were invited to the wedding of Peleus and Thetis except Eris. She came anyway but was refused admission. In anger, she threw a golden apple among the wedding guests inscribed with \"For the fairest\", which the three goddesses each claimed.\nHomer alludes to the Judgement of Paris, but with no mention of Eris. An account of the story, was told in the \"Cypria\", one of the poems in the Epic Cycle, which told the entire story of the Trojan War. The \"Cypria\" which is the first poem in the Cycle, describes events preceding those that occur in the \"Iliad\", the second poem in the Cycle. According to a prose summary of the now lost \"Cypria\", Eris, acting according to the plans of Zeus and Themis to bring about the Trojan War, instigates a \"nekios\" ('feud') between the three goddesses over \"beauty\" (presumably over who of the three was the most beautiful), while they were attending the wedding feast of Peleus and Thetis (who would become the parents of Achilles). To settle the dispute, Zeus orders the three goddesses to go to Mount Ida to be judged by Paris. Paris, having been offered Helen by Aphrodite in return for Paris choosing her, does so.\nThe fifth-century BC playwright Euripides, describes the Judgement of Paris several times with no mention of either Eris, or an apple. Later accounts include details, such as the golden Apple of Discord, which may or may not have come from the \"Cypria\". According to the \"Fabulae\" of Hyginus, composed somewhere between the first century BC and the late second century AD, all the gods had been invited to the wedding except Eris. Nevertheless, she came to the wedding feast, and when refused entrance, she threw an apple through the doorway, saying that it was for the \"fairest\", which started the quarrel. The satirist Lucian (fl. 2nd century AD) tells us that Eris's apple was \"solid gold\" and that it was inscribed: \"For the queen of Beauty\" ().\nStrife in war.\nEris personifies strife, particularly the strife associated with war. In Homer's \"Iliad\", Eris is described as being depicted on both Athena's battle aegis, and Achilles' shield, where she appears alongside other war-related personifications: Phobos (\"Rout\"), Alke (\"Valor\"), and Ioke (\"Assault\"), on the aegis, and Kydoimos (\"Tumult\"), and Ker (\"Fate\"), on the shield. Similarly, the Hesiodic \"Shield of Heracles\" has Eris depicted on Heracles' shield, also with Phobos, Kydoimos and Ker, as well as other war-related personifications: Proioxis (\"Pursuit\"), Palioxis (\"Rally\"), Homados (\"Tumult \"), Phonos (\"Murder\"), and Androktasia (\"Slaughter\"). Here Eris is described as flying over the head of Phobos (\"Fear\"):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the middle was Fear, made of adamant, unspeakable, glaring backward with eyes shining like fire. His mouth was full of white teeth, terrible, dreadful; and over his grim forehead flew terrible Strife, preparing for the battle-rout of men\u2014cruel one, she took away the mind and sense of any men who waged open war against Zeus\u2019 son [Heracles].\u2014\u200a\nEris also appears in several battle scenes in the \"Iliad\". However, unlike Apollo, Athena and several other of the Olympians, Eris does not participate in active combat, nor take sides in the war. Her role in the \"Iliad\" is that of \"the rouser of armies\", urging both armies to fight each other. In Book 4, she is one of the divinities (along with Ares, Athena, Deimos (\"Terror\"), and Phobos (\"Rout\") urging the armies to battle, with head lowered at first, but soon raised up to the heavens:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And the Trojans were urged on by Ares, and the Achaeans by flashing-eyed Athene, and Terror, and Rout, and Strife who rages incessantly, sister and comrade of man-slaying Ares; she first rears her crest only a little, but then her head is fixed in the heavens while her feet tread on earth. She it was who now cast evil strife into their midst as she went through the throng, making the groanings of men to increase.\u2014\u200a\nShe also appears in this \"rouser of armies\" role in Book 5, and again in Book 11, where Zeus sends Eris to rouse the Greek army by shouting: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Zeus sent Strife to the swift ships of the Achaeans, gruesome Strife, holding in her hands a portent of war. And she stood by Odysseus\u2019 black ship, huge of hull, that was in the middle so that a shout could reach to either end, both to the huts of Aias, son of Telamon, and to those of Achilles; for these had drawn up their shapely ships at the furthermost ends, trusting in their valor and the strength of their hands. There the goddess stood and uttered a great and terrible shout, a shrill cry of war, and in the heart of each man of the Achaeans she roused strength to war and to battle without ceasing. And to them at once war became sweeter than to return in their hollow ships to their dear native land.\u2014\u200a\nHer lust for bloodshed is insatiable. Later in Book 11, she is the last of the gods to leave the battlefield, rejoicing as she watches the fighting she has roused. While in Book 5, she is described as raging unceasingly.\nHesiod also associates Eris with war. In his \"Works and Days\", he says that she \"fosters evil war and conflict\". And in his \"Theogony\", has the Hysminai (Battles) and the Machai (Wars) as her children.\nAnother Eris.\nIn addition to the Eris who was the daughter of Nyx (Night), Hesiod, in his \"Works and Days\", mentions another Eris. He contrasts the two: the former being \"blameworthy\" who \"fosters evil war and conflict\", the latter worthy of \"praise\", have been created by Zeus to foster beneficial competition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So there was not just one birth of Strifes after all, but upon the earth there are two Strifes. One of these a man would praise once he got to know it, but the other is blameworthy; and they have thoroughly opposed spirits. For the one fosters evil war and conflict\u2014cruel one, no mortal loves that one, but it is by necessity that they honor the oppressive Strife, by the plans of the immortals. But the other one gloomy Night bore first; and Cronus\u2019 high-throned son, who dwells in the aether, set it in the roots of the earth, and it is much better for men. It rouses even the helpless man to work. For a man who is not working but who looks at some other man, a rich one who is hastening to plow and plant and set his house in order, he envies him, one neighbor envying his neighbor who is hastening toward wealth: and this Strife is good for mortals.\u2014\u200a\nOther mentions.\nAntoninus Liberalis, in his \"Metamorphoses\", involves Eris in the story of Polytechnus and A\u00ebdon, who claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Eris is mentioned many times in Quintus Smyrnaeus' \"Posthomerica\", which covers the period between the end of the \"Iliad\" and the beginning of his \"Odyssey\". Just as in the \"Iliad\", the \"Posthomerica\" Eris is the instigator of conflict, does not take sides, shouts, and delights in the carnage of battle. Eris is also mentioned in the \"Dionysiaca\" of Nonnus. At the start of the epic confrontation between Zeus and Typhon, Nonnus has Nike (Victory) lead Zeus into battle, and Eris lead Typhon, and in another passage has Eris, with the war-goddess Enyo, bring \"Tumult\" to both sides of a battle.\nIconography.\nThere are few certain representations of Eris in art. Her earliest appearances (mid-sixth-century BC) are found on the Chest of Cypselus and in the tondo of a black-figure cup (Berlin F1775). The geographer Pausanias describes seeing Eris depicted on the Chest, as a \"most repulsive\" [\"aischist\u00ea\"] woman standing between Ajax and Hector fighting. On the cup she is depicted as a normal woman in appearance apart from having wings and winged-sandals.\nFrom the later part of fifth-century BC, the upper section of a red-figure calyx krater depicts Eris with Themis facing each other, apparently in animated discussion, while the lower section depicts the Judgement of Paris, confirming Eris' role in the events as told in the \"Cypria\".\nCultural influences.\nThe classic fairy tale \"Sleeping Beauty\" references what appears to be Eris's role in the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Like Eris, a malevolent fairy curses a princess after not being invited to the princess's christening.\nEris is the principal figure of worship in the modern Discordian religion invented as an \"absurdist joke\" in 1957 by two school friends Gregory Hill and Kerry Wendell Thornley. As mythologized in the religion's satirical text \"Principia Discordia\", written by Hill with Thornely and others, Eris (apparently) spoke to Hill and Thornley in an all-night bowling alley, in the form of a chimpanzee.\nEris, the \"Goddess of Discord and Chaos\", is a recurring antagonist in the animated television series The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy, wherein she is depicted as a spoiled and wealthy woman that wields the \"Apple of Discord\".\nSimilarly, Eris, the malevolent \"Goddess of Discord and Chaos\", is the main antagonist in the DreamWorks 2003 animated movie \"\" against Sinbad and his allies.\nThe dwarf planet Eris was named after this Greek goddess in 2006.\nIn 2019, the New Zealand moth species \"Ichneutica eris\" was named in honour of Eris.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

Millay was a renowned social figure and noted feminist in New York City during the Roaring Twenties and beyond. She also wrote prose under the pseudonym Nancy Boyd.\nMillay won the 1923 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for her poem \"\"; she was the first woman and second person to win the award. In 1943, Millay was the sixth person and the second woman to be awarded the Frost Medal for her lifetime contribution to American poetry.\nMillay was highly regarded during much of her lifetime, with the prominent literary critic Edmund Wilson calling her \"one of the only poets writing in English in our time who have attained to anything like the stature of great literary figures.\" By the 1930s, her critical reputation began to decline, as modernist critics dismissed her work for its use of traditional poetic forms and subject matter, in contrast to modernism's exhortation to \"make it new.\" However, the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1960s and 1970s revived an interest in Millay's works.\nEarly life.\nMillay was born Edna Vincent Millay in Rockland, Maine, on February 22, 1892. Her parents were Cora Lounella Buzelle, a custom hair stylist and training nurse for private families, and Henry Tolman Millay, a life insurance agent and teacher who would later become a superintendent of schools. Her middle name derives from St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City, where her uncle's life had been saved from an accident at sea just before her birth. Encouraged to read the classics at home, she was too rebellious to make a success of formal education, but she won poetry prizes from an early age.\nEdna's mother attended a Congregational church. In 1904, Cora officially divorced Millay's father for financial irresponsibility and domestic abuse. They had already been separated for some years. Henry and Edna kept a letter correspondence for many years, but he never re-entered the family. Cora and her three daughters \u2013 Edna (who called herself \"Vincent\"), Norma Lounella, and Kathleen Kalloch (born 1896) \u2013 moved from town to town, living in poverty and surviving various illnesses. Cora travelled with a trunk full of classic literature, including Shakespeare and Milton, which she read to her children. The family settled in a small house on the property of Cora's aunt in Camden, Maine, where Millay would write the first of the poems that would bring her literary fame. The family's house in Camden was \"between the mountains and the sea where baskets of apples and drying herbs on the porch mingled their scents with those of the neighboring pine woods.\"\nThe three sisters were independent and outspoken, which did not always sit well with the authority figures in their lives. Millay's grade school principal, offended by her frank attitude, refused to call her Vincent. Instead, he called her by any woman's name that started with a V. At Camden High School, Millay began developing her literary talents, starting at the school's literary magazine, \"The Megunticook\". At 14, she won the \"St. Nicholas\" Gold Badge for poetry, and by 15, she had published her poetry in the popular children's magazine \"St. Nicholas\", the \"Camden Herald\", and the high-profile anthology \"Current Literature\".\nEmerging fame and college education.\nMillay's fame began in 1912 when, at the age of 20, she entered her poem \"Renascence\" in a poetry contest in \"The Lyric Year\". The backer of the contest, Ferdinand P. Earle, chose Millay as the winner after sorting through thousands of entries, reading only two lines apiece. Earle sent a letter informing Millay of her win before consulting with the other judges, who had previously and separately agreed on a criterion for a winner to winnow down the massive flood of entrants. According to the remaining judges, the winning poem had to exhibit social relevance, and \"Renascence\" did not. The entry of Orrick Glenday Johns, \"Second Avenue\", was about the \"squalid scenes\" Johns saw on Eldridge Street and lower Second Avenue on New York's Lower East Side. Millay ultimately placed fourth. The press drew attention to the fact that the Millays were a family of working-class women living in poverty. Because the three winners were men, some people felt that sexism and classism were a factor in Millay's poem coming in fourth place.\nControversy in newspaper columns and editorial pages launched the careers of Millay and Johns. Johns, who was receiving hate mail, conceded that he thought her poem was better. \"The award was as much an embarrassment to me as a triumph,\" he said. Johns did not attend the awards banquet. The second-prize winner offered Millay his $250 prize money. In the immediate aftermath of the \"Lyric Year\" controversy, wealthy arts patron Caroline B. Dow heard Millay reciting her poetry and playing the piano at the Whitehall Inn in Camden, Maine and was so impressed that she offered to pay for Millay's education at Vassar College.\nMillay entered Vassar College in 1913 at age 21. Her attendance at Vassar, which she called a \"hell-hole\", became a strain to her due to its strict nature. Before she attended college, Millay had a liberal home life that included smoking, drinking, playing gin rummy, and flirting with men. Vassar, on the other hand, expected its students to be refined and live according to their status as young ladies. Millay often would not be formally reprimanded out of respect of her work. At the end of her senior year in 1917, the faculty voted to suspend Millay indefinitely; however, in response to a petition by her peers, she was allowed to graduate. She was a prominent campus writer, becoming a regular contributor to \"The Vassar Miscellany\". She had relationships with many fellow students during her time there and kept scrapbooks including drafts of plays written during the period. While at school, she had several romantic relationships with women, including Edith Wynne Matthison, who would go on to become an actress in silent films.\nMove to Greenwich Village.\nAfter she graduated from Vassar in 1917, Millay moved to New York City. She lived in Greenwich Village just as it was becoming known as a bohemian writers' haven. She resided in a number of places, including a house owned by the Cherry Lane Theatre and 75\u00bd Bedford Street, renowned for being the narrowest in New York City.\nWhile in New York City, Millay, who was bisexual, developed passing relationships with men and women. The critic Floyd Dell wrote that Millay was \"a frivolous young woman, with a brand-new pair of dancing slippers and a mouth like a valentine.\" She maintained relationships with \"The Masses \"editor Floyd Dell and critic Edmund Wilson, both of whom proposed marriage to her and were refused. Counted among Millay's close friends were the writers Witter Bynner, Arthur Davison Ficke, and Susan Glaspell.\nIn 1919, she wrote the anti-war play \"Aria da Capo\", which starred her sister Norma Millay at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York City. In 1921, Millay would write \"The Lamp and the Bell,\" her first verse drama, at the request of the drama department of Vassar. While establishing her career as a poet, Millay initially worked with the Provincetown Players on Macdougal Street and the Theatre Guild. In 1923, Millay and others founded the Cherry Lane Theatre \"to continue the staging of experimental drama.\"\nDuring her stay in Greenwich Village, Millay learned to use her poetry for her feminist activism. She often went into detail about topics others found taboo, such as a wife leaving her husband in the middle of the night. Millay's 1920 collection \"A Few Figs From Thistles\" drew controversy for its exploration of female sexuality and feminism. She engaged in highly successful nationwide tours in which she offered public readings of her poetry.\nTo support her days in the Village, Millay wrote short stories for \"Ainslee's Magazine\". As an aesthete and a canny protector of her identity as a poet, she insisted on publishing this more mass-appeal work under the pseudonym Nancy Boyd.\nPulitzer Prize, marriage, and purchase of Steepletop.\nIn January 1921, Millay traveled to Paris, where she met and befriended the sculptors Thelma Wood and Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, photographer Man Ray, had affairs with journalists George Slocombe and John Carter, and became pregnant by a man named Daubigny. She secured a marriage license but instead went to Dorset in England where her mother Cora helped induce an abortion with alkanet, as recommended in her old copy of Culpeper's \"Complete Herbal\". Possibly as a result, Millay was frequently ill and weak for much of the next four years.\nMillay won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1923 for \"The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver\". She was the first woman to win the poetry prize, though two women (Sara Teasdale in 1918 and Margaret Widdemer in 1919) won special prizes for their poetry prior to the establishment of the award. In 1924, literary critic Harriet Monroe labeled Millay \"the greatest woman poet since Sappho.\"\nAfter experiencing his remarkable attention to her during her illness, she married 43-year-old Eugen Jan Boissevain in 1923. Boissevain was the widower of labor lawyer and war correspondent Inez Milholland, a political icon Millay had met during her time at Vassar. A self-proclaimed feminist, Boissevain supported Millay's career and took primary care of domestic responsibilities. Both Millay and Boissevain had other lovers throughout their 26-year marriage. For Millay, one such significant relationship was with the poet George Dillon, a student 14 years her junior, whom she met in 1928 at one of her readings at the University of Chicago. Their relationship inspired the sonnets in the collection \"Fatal Interview\", which she published in 1931.\nIn 1925, Boissevain and Millay bought Steepletop near Austerlitz, New York, which had once been a blueberry farm. They built a barn (from a Sears Roebuck kit), and then a writing cabin and a tennis court. Millay grew her own vegetables in a small garden. Later, they bought Ragged Island in Casco Bay, Maine, as a summer retreat. Frequently having trouble with the servants they employed, Millay wrote, \"The only people I really hate are servants. They are not really human beings at all.\"\nMillay was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera House to write a libretto for an opera composed by Deems Taylor. The result, \"The King's Henchman\", drew on the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's\" account of Eadgar, King of Wessex. The opera began its production in 1927 to high praise; \"The New York Times\" described it as \"the most effectively and artistically wrought American opera that has reached the stage.\"\nIn August 1927, Millay, along with a number of other writers, was arrested while protesting the impending executions of the Italian American anarchist duo Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. Due to her status, she was able to meet with the governor of Massachusetts, Alvan T. Fuller, to plead for a retrial. Her failure to prevent the executions would be a catalyst for her politicization in her later works, beginning with the poem \"Justice Denied In Massachusetts\" about the case.\nAccident and war effort.\nMillay was staying at the Sanibel Palms Hotel when, on May 2, 1936, a fire started after a kerosene heater on the second floor exploded. Everything was destroyed, including the only copy of Millay's long verse poem, \"Conversation at Midnight\", and a 1600s poetry collection written by the Roman poet Catullus of the first century BC. She would go on to rewrite \"Conversation at Midnight\" from memory and release it the following year.\nIn the summer of 1936, Millay was riding in a station wagon when the door suddenly swung open, and Millay \"was hurled out into the pitch-darkness...and rolled for some distance down a rocky gully.\" The accident severely damaged nerves in her spine, requiring frequent surgeries and hospitalizations, and at least daily doses of morphine. Millay lived the rest of her life in \"constant pain\".\nDespite her accident, Millay was sufficiently alarmed by the rise of fascism to write against it. During World War I, she had been a dedicated and active pacifist; however, in 1940, she advocated for the U.S. to enter the war against the Axis and became an ardent supporter of the war effort. She later worked with the Writers' War Board to create propaganda, including poetry. Millay's reputation in poetry circles was damaged by her war work. Merle Rubin noted, \"She seems to have caught more flak from the literary critics for supporting democracy than Ezra Pound did for championing fascism.\"\nIn 1942 in \"The New York Times Magazine\", Millay mourned the destruction of the Czech village Lidice. Nazi forces had razed Lidice, slaughtered its male inhabitants and scattered its surviving residents in retaliation for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. Millay wrote: \"The whole world holds in its arms today / The murdered village of Lidice, / Like the murdered body of a little child.\" This article would serve as the basis of her 32-page work \"Murder of Lidice\", published by Harper and Brothers in 1942. The poem loosely served as the basis of the 1943 MGM movie \"Hitler's Madman\".\nMillay was critical of capitalism and sympathetic to socialist ideals, which she labeled as \"of a free and equal society\", but she did not identify as a communist.166 She told Grace Hamilton King in 1941 that she had been \"almost a fellow-traveller with the communist idea as far as it went along with the socialist idea.\"166\nDespite the excellent sales of her books in the 1930s, her declining reputation, constant medical bills, and frequent demands from her mentally ill sister Kathleen meant that for most of her last years, Millay was in debt to her own publisher. Author Daniel Mark Epstein also concludes from her correspondence that Millay developed a passion for thoroughbred horse-racing, and spent much of her income investing in a racing stable of which she had quietly become an owner.\nPost-war and death.\nAlthough her work and reputation declined during the war years, possibly due to a morphine addiction she acquired following her accident, she subsequently sought treatment for it and was successfully rehabilitated. Boissevain died in 1949 of lung cancer, leaving Millay to live alone for the last year of her life. Her final collection of poems was published posthumously as the volume \"Mine the Harvest\". The title sonnet recalls her career:\n&lt;poem&gt;Those hours when happy hours were my estate, \u2014\nEntailed, as proper, for the next in line,\nYet mine the harvest, and the title mine \u2014\nThose acres, fertile, and the furrows straight,\nFrom which the lark would rise \u2014 all of my late\nEnchantments, still, in brilliant colours, shine,&lt;/poem&gt;\nMillay died at her home on October 19, 1950, at age 58. She had fallen down the stairs and was found with a broken neck approximately eight hours after her death. Her physician reported that she had suffered a heart attack following a coronary occlusion. She is buried alongside her husband at Steepletop, Austerlitz, New York.\nLegacy.\nAfter her death, \"The New York Times\" described her as \"an idol of the younger generation during the glorious early days of Greenwich Village\" and as \"one of the greatest American poets of her time.\" Thomas Hardy said that America had two great attractions: the skyscraper and the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay. The poet Richard Wilbur asserted that Millay \"wrote some of the best sonnets of the century.\"\nNancy Milford published a biography of the poet in 2001, \"Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St Vincent Millay.\" Millay's sister, Norma Millay (then her only living relative), offered Milford access to the poet's papers based on her successful biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife, \"Zelda\". Milford also edited and wrote an introduction for a collection of Millay's poems called \"The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay.\" Milford would label Millay as \"the herald of the New Woman\".\nA 2001 \"New York Times\" review of Milford noted that \"readers of poetry probably dismiss Millay as mediocre,\" and noted that within 20 years of Millay's death, \"the public was impatient with what had come to seem a poised, genteel emotionalism.\" However, it concludes that \"readers should come away from Milford's book with their understanding of Millay deepened and charged.\" The New York Review of Books in 2002 called Milford's biography \"the story of the life that eclipsed the work,\" and dismissed much of Millay's work as \"soggy\" and \"doggerel\".\nGarrison Keillor in the introduction to his anthology \"Good Poems\" (2002) ranks Millay more highly than her contemporary Marianne Moore, and describes her as \"the shining red-haired heroine of bohemian fame in the twenties, famous for her excesses and not her elegant, formal verse.\"\nMillay was named by Equality Forum as one of their \"31 Icons\" of the 2015 LGBT History Month.\nProperties, conservation, and memorials.\nMillay's sister Norma and her husband, the painter and actor Charles Frederick Ellis, moved to Steepletop after Millay's death. In 1973, they established the Millay Colony for the Arts on seven acres near the house and barn. After the death of her husband in 1976, Norma continued to run the program until her death in 1986. At 17, the poet Mary Oliver visited Steepletop and became a close friend of Norma. She would later live at Steepletop off-and-on for seven years and helped to organize Millay's papers. Mary Oliver herself went on to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, greatly inspired by Millay's work. In 2006, the state of New York paid $1.69 million to acquire of Steepletop, to add the land to a nearby state forest preserve. The proceeds of the sale were used by the Edna St. Vincent Millay Society to restore the farmhouse and grounds and turn it into a museum. The museum opened to the public in the summer of 2010. Conservation of the house has been ongoing.\nConservation of Millay's birthplace began in 2015 with the purchase of the double-house at 198\u2013200 Broadway, Rockland, Maine. Built in 1891, Henry T. and Cora B. Millay were the first tenants of the north side, where Cora gave birth to her first of three daughters during a February 1892 squall. Identified as the Singhi Double House, the home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2019 not as the poet's birthplace, but as a \"good example\" of the \"modest double houses\" that made up almost 10% of residences in the largely working-class city between 1837 and the early 1900s. When fully restored by 2023, half the house will be dedicated to honoring Millay's legacy with workshops and classes, while the other half will be rented for income to sustain conservation and programs. A writer-in-residence will be funded by the Ellis Beauregard Foundation and the Millay House Rockland.Millay is also memorialized in Camden, Maine, where she lived beginning in 1900. A statue of the poet stands in Harbor Park, which shares with Mt. Battie the view of Penobscot Bay that opens \"Renascence\", the poem that launched Millay's career. Camden Public Library also shares Mt. Battie's view.

{"id": "9827", "revid": "51062663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9827", "title": "Ethnocentrism", "text": "Judging another culture by the values and standards of one's own culture\nEthnocentrism in social science and anthropology\u2014as well as in colloquial English discourse\u2014is the application of one's own culture or ethnicity as a frame of reference to judge other cultures, practices, behaviors, beliefs, and people, instead of using the standards of the particular culture involved. Since this judgment is often negative, some people also use the term to refer to the belief that one's culture is superior to, or more correct or normal than, all others\u2014especially regarding the distinctions that define each ethnicity's cultural identity, such as language, behavior, customs, and religion. In common usage, it can also simply mean any culturally biased judgment. For example, ethnocentrism can be seen in the common portrayals of the Global South and the Global North.\nEthnocentrism is sometimes related to racism, stereotyping, discrimination, or xenophobia. However, the term \"ethnocentrism\" does not necessarily involve a negative view of the others' race or indicate a negative connotation. The opposite of ethnocentrism is cultural relativism, a guiding philosophy stating that the best way to understand a different culture is through their perspective rather than judging them from the subjective viewpoints shaped by one's own cultural standards.\nThe term \"ethnocentrism\" was first applied in the social sciences by American sociologist William G. Sumner. In his 1906 book, \"Folkways,\" Sumner describes ethnocentrism as \"the technical name for the view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.\" He further characterized ethnocentrism as often leading to pride, vanity, the belief in one's own group's superiority, and contempt for outsiders.\nOver time, ethnocentrism developed alongside the progression of social understandings by people such as social theorist Theodor W. Adorno. In Adorno's \"The Authoritarian Personality\", he and his colleagues of the Frankfurt School established a broader definition of the term as a result of \"in group-out group differentiation\", stating that ethnocentrism \"combines a positive attitude toward one's own ethnic/cultural group (the in-group) with a negative attitude toward the other ethnic/cultural group (the out-group).\" Both of these juxtaposing attitudes are also a result of a process known as \"social identification\" and \"social counter-identification.\"\nOrigins and development.\nThe term ethnocentrism derives from two Greek words: \"ethnos\", meaning nation, and \"kentron\", meaning center. Scholars believe this term was coined by Polish sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz in the 19th century, although alternate theories suggest that he only popularized the concept as opposed to inventing it. He saw ethnocentrism as a phenomenon similar to the delusions of geocentrism and anthropocentrism, defining Ethnocentrism as \"the reasons by virtue of which each group of people believed it had always occupied the highest point, not only among contemporaneous peoples and nations, but also in relation to all peoples of the historical past.\"\nSubsequently, in the 20th century, American social scientist William G. Sumner proposed two different definitions in his 1906 book \"Folkways.\" Sumner stated that \"Ethnocentrism is the technical name for this view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.\" In the \"War and Other Essays (1911)\", he wrote that \"the sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group, is technically known as ethnocentrism.\" According to Boris Bizumic, it is a popular misunderstanding that Sumner originated the term ethnocentrism, stating that in actuality, he brought ethnocentrism into the mainstreams of anthropology, social science, and psychology through his English publications.\nSeveral theories have been reinforced through the social and psychological understandings of ethnocentrism including Adorno's Authoritarian Personality Theory (1950), Donald T. Campbell's Realistic Group Conflict Theory (1972), and Henri Tajfel's Social identity theory (1986). These theories have helped to distinguish ethnocentrism as a means to better understand the behaviors caused by in-group and out-group differentiation throughout history and society.\nEthnocentrism in social sciences.\nIn social sciences, ethnocentrism means to judge another culture based on the standard of one's own culture instead of the standard of the other particular culture. When people use their own culture as a parameter to measure other cultures, they often tend to think that their culture is superior and see other cultures as inferior and bizarre. Ethnocentrism can be explained at different levels of analysis. For example, at an intergroup level, this term is seen as a consequence of a conflict between groups; while at the individual level, in-group cohesion and out-group hostility can explain personality traits. Also, ethnocentrism can help us to explain the construction of identity. Ethnocentrism can explain the basis of one's identity by excluding the outgroup that is the target of ethnocentric sentiments and used as a way of distinguishing oneself from other groups that can be more or less tolerant. This practice in social interactions creates social boundaries, such boundaries define and draw symbolic boundaries of the group that one wants to be associated with or belong to. In this way, ethnocentrism is a term not only limited to anthropology but also can be applied to other fields of social sciences like sociology or psychology.\u00a0Ethnocentrism may be particularly enhanced in the presence of interethnic competition, hostility and violence. On the other hand, ethnocentrism may negatively influence expatriate worker's performance.\nA more recent interpretation of ethnocentrism, which expands upon the work of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, highlights its positive dimension. Political sociologist Audrey Alejandro of the London School of Economics argues that, while ethnocentrism does produce social hierarchies, it also produces diversity by maintaining the different dispositions, practices, and knowledge of identity groups. Diversity is both fostered and undermined by ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism, for Alejandro, is therefore neither something to be suppressed nor celebrated uncritically. Rather, observers can cultivate a 'balanced ethnocentrism', (individual self worth) allowing themselves to be challenged and transformed by difference whilst still protecting difference.\nAnthropology.\nThe classifications of ethnocentrism originate from the studies of anthropology. With its omnipresence throughout history, ethnocentrism has always been a factor in how different cultures and groups related to one another. Examples including how historically, foreigners would be characterized as \"Barbarians\". These trends exist in complex societies, e.g., \"the Jews consider themselves to be the 'chosen people', and the Greeks defend all foreigners as 'barbarians'\", and how China believed their country to be \"the centre of the world\". However, the anthropocentric interpretations initially took place most notably in the 19th century when anthropologists began to describe and rank various cultures according to the degree to which they had developed significant milestones, such as monotheistic religions, technological advancements, and other historical progressions.\nMost rankings were strongly influenced by colonization and the belief to improve societies they colonized, ranking the cultures based on the progression of their western societies and what they classified as milestones. Comparisons were mostly based on what the colonists believed as superior and what their western societies have accomplished. Victorian era politician and historian Thomas Macaulay once claimed that \"one shelf of a Western library\" had more knowledge than the centuries of text and literature written by Asian cultures. Ideas developed by Western scientists such as Herbert Spencer, including the concept of the \"survival of the fittest\", contained ethnocentric ideals; influencing the belief that societies which were 'superior' were most likely to survive and prosper. Edward Said's concept of Orientalism represented how Western reactions to non-Western societies were based on an \"unequal power relationship\" that the Western world developed due to its history of colonialism and the influence it held over non-Western societies.\nThe ethnocentric classification of \"primitive\" were also used by 19th and 20th century anthropologists and represented how unawareness in cultural and religious understanding changed overall reactions to non-Western societies. 19th-century anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor wrote about \"primitive\" societies in \"Primitive Culture\" (1871), creating a \"civilization\" scale where it was implied that ethnic cultures preceded civilized societies. The use of \"savage\" as a classification is modernly known as \"tribal\" or \"pre-literate\" where it was usually referred as a derogatory term as the \"civilization\" scale became more common. Examples that demonstrate a lack of understanding include when European travelers judged different languages based on the fact that they could not understand it and displayed a negative reaction, or the intolerance displayed by Westerners when exposed to unknown religions and symbolisms. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, a German philosopher, justified Western imperialism by reasoning that since the non-Western societies were \"primitive\" and \"uncivilized\", their culture and history was not worth conserving and thus should welcome Westernization.\nAnthropologist Franz Boas saw the flaws in this formulaic approach to ranking and interpreting cultural development and committed himself to overthrowing this inaccurate reasoning due to many factors involving their individual characteristics. With his methodological innovations, Boas sought to show the error of the proposition that race determined cultural capacity. In his 1911 book \"The Mind of Primitive Man\", Boas wrote that:It is somewhat difficult for us to recognize that the value which we attribute to our own civilization is due to the fact that we participate in this civilization, and that it has been controlling all our actions from the time of our birth; but it is certainly conceivable that there may be other civilizations, based perhaps on different traditions and on a different equilibrium of emotion and reason, which are of no less value than ours, although it may be impossible for us to appreciate their values without having grown up under their influence.Together, Boas and his colleagues propagated the certainty that there are no inferior races or cultures. This egalitarian approach introduced the concept of cultural relativism to anthropology, a methodological principle for investigating and comparing societies in as unprejudiced a way as possible and without using a developmental scale as anthropologists at the time were implementing. Boas and anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski argued that any human science had to transcend the ethnocentric views that could blind any scientist's ultimate conclusions.\nBoth had also urged anthropologists to conduct ethnographic fieldwork to overcome their ethnocentrism. To help, Malinowski would develop the theory of functionalism as guides for producing non-ethnocentric studies of different cultures. Classic examples of anti-ethnocentric anthropology include Margaret Mead's \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" (1928), which in time has met with severe criticism for its incorrect data and generalisations, Malinowski's \"The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia\" (1929), and Ruth Benedict's \"Patterns of Culture\" (1934). Mead and Benedict were two of Boas's students.\nScholars generally agree that Boas developed his ideas under the influence of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Legend has it that, on a field trip to the Baffin Islands in 1883, Boas would pass the frigid nights reading Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\". In that work, Kant argued that human understanding could not be described according to the laws that applied to the operations of nature, and that its operations were therefore free, not determined, and that ideas regulated human action, sometimes independent of material interests. Following Kant, Boas pointed out the starving Eskimos who, because of their religious beliefs, would not hunt seals to feed themselves, thus showing that no pragmatic or material calculus determined their values.\nCauses.\nEthnocentrism is believed to be a learned behavior embedded into a variety of beliefs and values of an individual or group.\nDue to enculturation, individuals in in-groups have a deeper sense of loyalty and are more likely to follow the norms and develop relationships with associated members. Within relation to enculturation, ethnocentrism is said to be a transgenerational problem since stereotypes and similar perspectives can be enforced and encouraged as time progresses. Although loyalty can increase better in-grouper approval, limited interactions with other cultures can prevent individuals to have an understanding and appreciation towards cultural differences resulting in greater ethnocentrism.\nThe social identity approach suggests that ethnocentric beliefs are caused by a strong identification with one's own culture that directly creates a positive view of that culture. It is theorized by Henri Tajfel and John C. Turner that to maintain that positive view, people make social comparisons that cast competing cultural groups in an unfavorable light.\nAlternative or opposite perspectives could cause individuals to develop na\u00efve realism and be subject to limitations in understandings. These characteristics can also lead to individuals to become subject to ethnocentrism, when referencing out-groups, and black sheep effect, where personal perspectives contradict those from fellow in-groupers.\nRealistic conflict theory assumes that ethnocentrism happens due to \"real or perceived conflict\" between groups. This also happens when a dominant group may perceive the new members as a threat. Scholars have recently demonstrated that individuals are more likely to develop in-group identification and out-group negatively in response to intergroup competition, conflict, or threat.\nAlthough the causes of ethnocentric beliefs and actions can have varying roots of context and reason, the effects of ethnocentrism has had both negative and positive effects throughout history. The most detrimental effects of ethnocentrism resulting into genocide, apartheid, slavery, and many violent conflicts. Historical examples of these negative effects of ethnocentrism are The Holocaust, the Crusades, the Trail of Tears, and the internment of Japanese Americans. These events were a result of cultural differences reinforced inhumanely by a majority group who thought of themselves as superior. In his 1976 book on evolution, \"The Selfish Gene\", evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins writes that \"blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretative in terms of Hamilton's genetic theory.\" Simulation-based experiments in evolutionary game theory have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.\nThe positive examples of ethnocentrism throughout history have aimed to prohibit the callousness of ethnocentrism and reverse the perspectives of living in a single culture. These organizations can include the formation of the United Nations; aimed to maintain international relations, and the Olympic Games; a celebration of sports and friendly competition between cultures.\nEffects.\nA study in New Zealand was used to compare how individuals associate with in-groups and out-groupers and has a connotation to discrimination. Strong in-group favoritism benefits the dominant groups and is different from out-group hostility and/or punishment. A suggested solution is to limit the perceived threat from the out-group that also decreases the likeliness for those supporting the in-groups to negatively react.\nEthnocentrism also influences consumer preference over which goods they purchase. A study that used several in-group and out-group orientations have shown a correlation between national identity, consumer cosmopolitanism, consumer ethnocentrism, and the methods consumers choose their products, whether imported or domestic. Countries with high levels of nationalism and isolationism are more likely to demonstrate consumer ethnocentrism, and have a significant preference for domestically-produced goods.\nEthnocentrism and racism.\nEthnocentrism is usually associated with racism. However, as mentioned before, ethnocentrism does not necessarily implicate a negative connotation. In European research, the term racism is not linked to ethnocentrism because Europeans avoid applying the concept of race to humans; meanwhile, using this term is not a problem for American researchers. Since ethnocentrism implicated a strong identification with one's in-group, it mostly automatically leads to negative feelings and stereotyping to the members of the outgroup, which can be confused with racism. Finally, scholars agree that avoiding stereotypes is an indispensable prerequisite to overcome ethnocentrism; and mass media play a key role regarding this issue. The differences that each culture possess causes could hinder one another leading to ethnocentrism and racism. A Canadian study established the differences among French Canadian and English Canadian respondents based on products that would be purchased due to ethnocentrism and racism. Due to how diverse the world has become, society has begun to misinterpret the term cultural diversity, by using ethnocentrism to create controversy among all cultures.\nEffects of ethnocentrism in the media.\nFilm.\nAs the United States leads the film industry in worldwide revenue, ethnocentric views can be transmitted through character tropes and underlying themes. The 2003 film \"\"The Last Samurai\",\" was analyzed to have strong ethnocentric themes, such as in-group preference and the tendency to show judgement towards those in the out-group. Similarly, the film received criticism for historical inaccuracies and perpetuating a \"white savior narrative,\" showing a tendency for ethnocentrism centered around the United States.\nSocial media.\nApproximately 67.1% of the global population use the internet regularly, with 63.7% of the population being social media users. In a 2023 study, researchers found that social media can enable its users to become more tolerant of other people, bridging the gap between cultures, and contributing to global knowledge. In a similar study done regarding social media use by Kenyan teens, researchers found that when social media is limited to a certain group, it can increase ethnocentric views and ideologies.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading"}

{"id": "9830", "revid": "42844658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9830", "title": "European Convention on Human Rights", "text": "International treaty in Europe\nThe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (commonly known as the European Convention on Human Rights or ECHR) is a supranational international treaty designed to protect human rights and political freedoms throughout Europe. It was opened for signature on 4 November 1950 by the member states of the newly formed Council of Europe and entered into force on 3 September 1953. All Council of Europe member states are parties to the Convention, and any new member is required to ratify it at the earliest opportunity.\nThe ECHR was directly inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948. Its main difference lies in the existence of an international court, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), whose judgments are legally binding on states parties. This ensures that the rights set out in the Convention are not just principles but are concretely enforceable through individual complaint or inter-state complaint procedures.\nTo guarantee this judicial enforcement, the Convention established both the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe and the ECtHR, which has sat in Strasbourg since its creation in 1959. Any person who believes their rights under the Convention have been violated by a state party can bring a case before the Court, provided their state allows it under Article 56 of the Convention. Judgments finding violations are binding on the states concerned, which are obliged to comply, particularly by paying appropriate compensation to applicants for any damage suffered. The Committee of Ministers supervises the execution of judgments.\nThe ECtHR has defined the Convention as a living instrument, meaning it must be interpreted in light of present-day conditions. This evolving case law can restrict the margin of appreciation left to states or create new rights derived from existing provisions.\nSince its adoption, the Convention has been amended by seventeen additional protocols, which have added new rights or extended existing ones. These include the right to property, the right to education, the right to free elections, the prohibition of imprisonment for debt, the right to freedom of movement, the ban on expelling nationals, the prohibition of collective expulsion of aliens, the abolition of the death penalty, procedural safeguards for the expulsion of lawfully residing foreigners, the right to a double degree of jurisdiction in criminal matters, the right to compensation for wrongful conviction, the ne bis in idem principle (not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence), equality between spouses, and a general prohibition of discrimination.\nThe most recent version entered into force on 1 August 2021 through Protocol No. 15, which added the principle of subsidiarity to the preamble. This principle reaffirms that states parties have the primary responsibility to secure and remedy human rights violations at national level.\nThe European Convention on Human Rights is widely considered the most effective international treaty for the protection of human rights and has had a significant influence on the domestic law of all Council of Europe member states.\nContext.\nThe European Convention on Human Rights has played an important role in the development and awareness of human rights in Europe. The development of a regional system of human rights protections operating across Europe can be seen as a direct response to twin concerns. First, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the convention, drawing on the inspiration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, can be seen as part of a wider response from the Allied powers in delivering a human rights agenda to prevent the most serious human rights violations which had occurred during the Second World War from happening again.\nSecond, the convention was a response to the growth of Stalinism in Central and Eastern Europe and was designed to protect the member states of the Council of Europe from communist subversion. This, in part, explains the constant references to values and principles that are \"necessary in a democratic society\" throughout the convention, despite the fact that such principles are not in any way defined within the convention itself. Consequently, the convention was principally conceived, at the time of its creation, as an \"anti-totalitarian\" measure to help stabilise social democracies in Western Europe, rather than as a specific reaction to the legacy of Nazism and the Holocaust. This approach was a continuation of Atlanticist beliefs from World War II and the early Cold War which called for the defence of democracy against all forms of authoritarianism.\nHistory.\nFrom 7 to 10 May 1948, politicians including Winston Churchill, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, and Konrad Adenauer, as well as civil society representatives, academics, business leaders, trade unionists, and religious leaders convened the Congress of Europe in The Hague. At the end of the Congress, a declaration and following pledge to create the convention was issued. The second and third articles of the pledge state: \"We desire a Charter of Human Rights guaranteeing liberty of thought, assembly and expression as well as right to form a political opposition. We desire a Court of Justice with adequate sanctions for the implementation of this Charter.\"\nThe convention was drafted as one the first and most important tasks of the newly-formed Council of Europe. Over 100 parliamentarians from the then-twelve member states of the Council gathered in Strasbourg in the summer of 1949 for the first-ever meeting of the Council's Consultative Assembly to draft the \"charter of human rights\" announced at the Hague, and to establish a court to enforce it. British MP and lawyer Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, the chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the convention, based on an earlier draft produced by the European Movement. As a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, he had seen first-hand the power of international justice.\nFrench former minister and French Resistance fighter Pierre-Henri Teitgen submitted a report to the Assembly proposing a list of rights to be protected, selecting a number from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that had recently been agreed to in New York, and defining how the enforcing judicial mechanism might operate. After extensive debates, the Assembly sent its final proposal to the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers, which convened a group of experts to draft the convention itself.\nThe convention was designed to incorporate a traditional civil liberties approach to securing \"effective political democracy\", from the strongest traditions in the United Kingdom, France and other member states of the fledgling Council of Europe, as said by Guido Raimondi, President of the European Court of Human Rights:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The European system of protection of human rights with its Court would be inconceivable untied from democracy. In fact, we have a bond that is not only regional or geographic: a State cannot be party to the European Convention on Human Rights if it is not a member of the Council of Europe; it cannot be a member State of the Council of Europe if it does not respect pluralist democracy, the rule of law and human rights. So a non-democratic State could not participate in the ECHR system: the protection of democracy goes hand in hand with the protection of rights.\u2014\u200a\nThe convention was opened for signature on 4 November 1950 in Rome. It was ratified and entered into force on 3 September 1953. It is overseen and enforced by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and the Council of Europe. Until procedural reforms in the late 1990s, the convention was also overseen by a European Commission on Human Rights.\nProposals for reform of the convention have been put forward, for example by former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and other UK politicians. Conservative politicians have proposed reform or withdrawal from the convention during the 2024 Conservative Party leadership election. After the September 2025 British cabinet reshuffle Labour Party officials said other member countries wanted Britain to play a leading role in reforming the convention, while opposition party Reform UK pledged to leave the ECHR to have free hand in deporting migrants. It has been argued by many academics and most recently the then-Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood that rather than the Convention being the issue, it is rather the way in which the UK interprets the Convention domestically which tends to be more strict than most other State Parties.\nMembership.\n As of 2025, all 46 member states of the Council of Europe are High Contracting Parties to the Convention. Article 59 of the Convention states that it is open for signature by member states of the Council of Europe, and ratification of the Convention is a prerequisite for any state wishing to join the Council. Therefore, the membership of the two bodies is identical.\nThe Convention and its protocols are not open to states outside the Council of Europe. However, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe may invite a non-member state to accede, though this power has not been used.\nFormer members.\nRussia was a party to the Convention from 1998 until 2022. Although it joined the Council of Europe in 1996, it ratified the Convention on 5 May 1998. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe suspended Russia's rights of representation on 25 February 2022.\nOn 16 March 2022, Russia was formally excluded from the Council of Europe. As a legal consequence of its expulsion, Russia ceased to be a High Contracting Party to the Convention on 16 September 2022, after a six-month transitional period. The European Court of Human Rights remains competent to handle applications against Russia concerning violations that occurred before this date.\nAccession by the European Union.\nA unique and ongoing membership consideration is the accession of the European Union (EU) itself to the Convention. The EU is an international organisation, not a state, and its member states are already parties to the Convention.\nThe Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in 2009, made it a legal obligation for the EU to accede to the ECHR. Accession would subject the EU's institutions, including the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), to the external human rights monitoring of the European Court of Human Rights. A draft accession agreement was finalised in 2013.\nHowever, in its Opinion 2/13, delivered on 18 December 2014, the CJEU ruled that the draft agreement was incompatible with EU law, citing several objections, including potential conflicts with the autonomy of the EU legal order. Negotiations resumed in 2020 to address the CJEU's objections, and the process remains ongoing.\nDrafting.\nThe convention is drafted in broad terms, in a similar (albeit more modern) manner to the 1689 Scottish Claim of Right Act 1689, to the 1689 English Bill of Rights, the 1791 U.S. Bill of Rights, the 1789 French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, or the first part of the German Basic Law. Statements of principle are, from a juridical point of view, not determinative and require and have given occasion to extensive interpretation by courts to bring out meaning in particular factual situations.\nConvention articles.\nAs amended by Protocol 11, the convention consists of three parts. The main rights and freedoms are contained in Section I, which consists of Articles 2 to 18. Section II (Articles 19 to 51) sets up the court and its rules of operation. Section III contains various concluding provisions.\nBefore the entry into force of Protocol 11, Section II (Article 19) set up the commission and the court, Sections III (Articles 20 to 37) and IV (Articles 38 to 59) included the high-level machinery for the operation of, respectively, the commission and the court, and Section V contained various concluding provisions.\nMany of the articles in Section I are structured in two paragraphs: the first sets out a basic right or freedom (such as Article 2(1) \u2013 the right to life) but the second contains various exclusions, exceptions or limitations on the basic right (such as Article 2(2) \u2013 which excepts certain uses of force leading to death).\nArticle 1 \u2013 respecting rights.\nArticle 1 simply binds the signatory parties to secure the rights under the other articles of the convention \"within their jurisdiction\". In exceptional cases, \"jurisdiction\" may not be confined to a contracting state's own national territory; the obligation to secure convention rights then also extends to foreign territories, such as occupied land in which the state exercises effective control.\nIn \"Loizidou v Turkey\", the European Court of Human Rights ruled that jurisdiction of member states to the convention extended to areas under that state's effective control as a result of military action.\nArticle 2 \u2013 life.\nArticle 2 protects the right of every person to their life. The right to life extends only to human beings, not to animals, nor to \"legal persons\" such as corporations. In \"Evans v United Kingdom\", the court ruled that the question of whether the right to life extends to a human embryo fell within a state's margin of appreciation. In \"Vo v France\", the court declined to extend the right to life to an unborn child, while stating that \"it is neither desirable, nor even possible as matters stand, to answer in the abstract the question whether the unborn child is a person for the purposes of Article 2 of the Convention\".\nThe court has ruled that states have three main duties under Article 2:\nThe first paragraph of the article contains an exception for lawful executions, although this exception has largely been superseded by Protocols 6 and 13. Protocol 6 prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in peacetime, while Protocol 13 extends the prohibition to all circumstances.\nThe second paragraph of Article 2 provides that death resulting from defending oneself or others, arresting a suspect or fugitive, or suppressing riots or insurrections, will not contravene the Article when the use of force involved is \"no more than absolutely necessary\".\nSignatory states to the convention can only derogate from the rights contained in Article 2 for deaths which result from lawful acts of war.\nThe European Court of Human Rights did not rule upon the right to life until 1995, when in \"McCann and Others v United Kingdom\" it ruled that the exception contained in the second paragraph does not constitute situations when it is permitted to kill, but situations where it is permitted to use force which might result in the deprivation of life.\nArticle 3 \u2013 torture.\nArticle 3 prohibits torture and \"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\". There are no exceptions or limitations on this right. This provision usually applies, apart from torture, to cases of severe police violence and poor conditions in detention.\nThe court has emphasised the fundamental nature of Article 3 in holding that the prohibition is made in \"absolute terms\u00a0... irrespective of the victim's conduct\". The court has also held that states cannot deport or extradite individuals who might be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in the recipient state.\nThe first case to examine Article 3 was the Greek case, which set an influential precedent. In \"Ireland v. United Kingdom\" (1979\u20131980) the court ruled that the five techniques developed by the United Kingdom (wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink), as used against fourteen detainees in Northern Ireland by the United Kingdom were \"inhuman and degrading\" and breached the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not amount to \"torture\".\nIn \"Aksoy v. Turkey\" (1997) the court found Turkey guilty of torture in 1996 in the case of a detainee who was suspended by his arms while his hands were tied behind his back.\n\"Selmouni v. France\" (2000) the court has appeared to be more open to finding states guilty of torture ruling that since the convention is a \"living instrument\", treatment which it had previously characterized as inhuman or degrading treatment might in future be regarded as torture.\nIn 2014, after new information was uncovered that showed the decision to use the five techniques in Northern Ireland in 1971\u20131972 had been taken by British ministers, the Irish Government asked the European Court of Human Rights to review its judgement. In 2018, by six votes to one, the court declined.\nArticle 4 \u2013 servitude.\nArticle 4 prohibits slavery, servitude and forced labour but exempts labour:\nArticle 5 \u2013 liberty and security.\nArticle 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. Liberty and security of the person are taken as a \"compound\" concept \u2013 security of the person has not been subject to separate interpretation by the court.\nArticle 5 provides the right to liberty, subject only to lawful arrest or detention under certain other circumstances, such as arrest on reasonable suspicion of a crime or imprisonment in fulfilment of a sentence. The article also provides those arrested with the right to be informed, in a language they understand, of the reasons for the arrest and any charge they face, the right of prompt access to judicial proceedings to determine the legality of the arrest or detention, to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, and the right to compensation in the case of arrest or detention in violation of this article.\nArticle 6 \u2013 fair trial.\nArticle 6 provides a detailed right to a fair trial, including the right to a public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal within reasonable time, the presumption of innocence, and other minimum rights for those charged with a criminal offence (adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence, access to legal representation, right to examine witnesses against them or have them examined, right to the free assistance of an interpreter).\nThe majority of convention violations that the court finds today are excessive delays, in violation of the \"reasonable time\" requirement, in civil and criminal proceedings before national courts, mostly in Italy and France. Under the \"independent tribunal\" requirement, the court has ruled that military judges in Turkish state security courts are incompatible with Article 6. In compliance with this Article, Turkey has now adopted a law abolishing these courts.\nAnother significant set of violations concerns the \"confrontation clause\" of Article 6 (i.e. the right to examine witnesses or have them examined). In this respect, problems of compliance with Article 6 may arise when national laws allow the use in evidence of the testimonies of absent, anonymous and vulnerable witnesses.\nArticle 7 \u2013 retroactivity.\nArticle 7 prohibits the retroactive criminalisation of acts and omissions. No person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offence at the time of its commission. The article states that a criminal offence is one under either national or international law, which would permit a party to prosecute someone for a crime which was not illegal under domestic law at the time, so long as it was prohibited by international law. The Article also prohibits a heavier penalty being imposed than was applicable at the time when the criminal act was committed.\nArticle 7 incorporates the legal principle \"nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege\" (no crime, no penalty without law) into the convention.\nRelevant cases are:\nArticle 8 \u2013 privacy.\nArticle 8 provides a right to respect for one's \"private and family life, his home and his correspondence\", subject to restrictions that are \"in accordance with law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others\". This article clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches, but the court has given the protection for \"private and family life\" that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. There have been cases discussing consensual familial sexual relationships, and how the criminalisation of this may violate this article. However, the ECHR still allows such familial sexual acts to be criminal.\nThis may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article\u00a08 sometimes comprises positive obligations: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a state from interfering with rights, and thus \"not\" to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the state to become active, and to \"do\" something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced parent to his/her child).\nNotable cases:\nArticle 9 \u2013 conscience and religion.\nArticle 9 provides a right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This includes the freedom to change a religion or belief, and to manifest a religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice and observance, subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\".\nRelevant cases are:\nArticle 10 \u2013 expression.\nArticle 10 provides the right to freedom of expression, subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\". This right includes the freedom to hold opinions, and to receive and impart information and ideas, but allows restrictions for:\nRelevant cases are:\nArticle 11 \u2013 association.\nArticle 11 protects the right to freedom of assembly and association, including the right to form trade unions, subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\".\nArticle 12 \u2013 marriage.\nArticle 12 provides a right for women and men of marriageable age to marry and establish a family.\nDespite a number of invitations, the court has so far refused to apply the protections of this article to same-sex marriage. The court has defended this on the grounds that the article was intended to apply only to different-sex marriage, and that a wide margin of appreciation must be granted to parties in this area.\nIn \"Goodwin v. United Kingdom\" the court ruled that a law which still classified post-operative transsexual people under their birth sex violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual people were unable to marry individuals of the opposite sex. This reversed an earlier ruling in \"Rees v. United Kingdom\". This did not, however, alter the Court's understanding that Article 12 protects only different-sex couples.\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruled in \"Schalk and Kopf v. Austria\" that countries are not required to provide marriage licenses for same-sex couples; however, if a country allows same-sex couple marriage it must be done under the same conditions that opposite-sex couples marriage face, in order to prevent a breach of article 14 \u2013 the prohibition of discrimination. Additionally, the court ruled in the 2015 case of \"Oliari and Others v. Italy\" that states have a positive obligation to ensure there is a specific legal framework for the recognition and protection of same-sex couples.\nArticle 13 \u2013 effective remedy.\nArticle 13 provides for the right for an effective remedy before national authorities for violations of rights under the convention. The inability to obtain a remedy before a national court for an infringement of a Convention right is thus a free-standing and separately actionable infringement of the convention.\nArticle 14 \u2013 discrimination.\nArticle 14 contains a prohibition of discrimination. This prohibition is broad in some ways and narrow in others. It is broad in that it prohibits discrimination under a potentially unlimited number of grounds. While the article specifically prohibits discrimination based on \"sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status\", the last of these allows the court to extend to Article 14 protection to other grounds not specifically mentioned such as has been done regarding discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation.\nAt the same time, the article's protection is limited in that it only prohibits discrimination with respect to rights under the convention. Thus, an applicant must prove discrimination in the enjoyment of a specific right that is guaranteed elsewhere in the convention (e.g. discrimination based on sex \u2013 Article 14 \u2013 in the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression \u2013 Article 10).\nProtocol 12 extends this prohibition to cover discrimination in any legal right, even when that legal right is not protected under the convention, so long as it is provided for in national law.\nArticle 15 \u2013 derogations.\nArticle 15 allows contracting states to derogate from certain rights guaranteed by the convention in a time of \"war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation\". Permissible derogations under article 15 must meet three substantive conditions:\nIn addition to these substantive requirements, the derogation must be procedurally sound. There must be some formal announcement of the derogation and notice of the derogation and any measures adopted under it, and the ending of the derogation must be communicated to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.\nAs of 2016, only eight member states had ever invoked derogations. The court is quite permissive in accepting a state's derogations from the convention but applies a higher degree of scrutiny in deciding whether measures taken by states under a derogation are, in the words of Article 15, \"strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\". Thus in \"A\u00a0v\u00a0United Kingdom\", the court dismissed a claim that a derogation lodged by the British government in response to the September 11 attacks was invalid, but went on to find that measures taken by the United Kingdom under that derogation were disproportionate.\nExamples of such derogations include:\nArticle 16 \u2013 foreign parties.\nArticle 16 allows states to restrict the political activity of foreigners. The court has ruled that European Union member states cannot consider the nationals of other member states to be aliens.\nArticle 17 \u2013 abuse of rights.\nArticle 17 provides that no one may use the rights guaranteed by the convention to seek the abolition or limitation of rights guaranteed in the convention. This addresses instances where states seek to restrict a human right in the name of another human right, or where individuals rely on a human right to undermine other human rights (for example where an individual issues a death threat).\nArticle 18 \u2013 permitted restrictions.\nArticle 18 provides that any limitations on the rights provided for in the convention may be used only for the purpose for which they are provided. For example, Article 5, which guarantees the right to personal freedom, may be explicitly limited in order to bring a suspect before a judge. To use pre-trial detention as a means of intimidation of a person under a false pretext is, therefore, a limitation of right (to freedom) which does not serve an explicitly provided purpose (to be brought before a judge), and is therefore contrary to Article 18.\nConvention protocols.\nAs of July 2025[ [update]], seventeen protocols to the convention have been opened for signature. These can be divided into two main groups: those amending the framework of the convention system, and those expanding the rights that can be protected. The former require unanimous ratification by member states before coming into force, while the latter require a certain number of states to sign before coming into force.\nProtocol 1.\nThis Protocol contains three different rights which the signatories could not agree to place in the convention itself. Monaco and Switzerland have signed but never ratified Protocol 1.\nArticle 1 \u2013 property.\nArticle 1 (\"A1P1\") provides that \"every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions\". The European Court of Human Rights acknowledged a violation of the fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights, also, in the uncertainty \u2013 for the owner \u2013 about the future of the property, and in the absence of an allowance.\nIn the case of \"Mifsud and others v Malta\" (38770/17) the Maltese state was found to have violated Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the convention. The case involved a plot of land owned by the Mifsud family and their heirs which was expropriated twice (in 1984 and in 2012). The court, in its judgment, stated that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 2013 the Court of Appeal in England and Wales upheld a judgment in favour of Infinis against Ofgem, who had denied the company access to Renewable Obligation Certificates, a form of funding incentive for renewable energy generation, to which they were entitled. This case represented the first UK case where A1P1 compensation had been granted in relation to a regulatory authority.\nArticle 2 \u2013 education.\nArticle 2 provides for the right not to be denied an education and the right for parents to have their children educated in accordance with their religious and other views. It does not however guarantee any particular level of education of any particular quality.\nAlthough phrased in the Protocol as a negative right, in \"\u015eahin v. Turkey\" the court ruled that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;it would be hard to imagine that institutions of higher education existing at a given time do not come within the scope of the first sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No 1. Although that Article does not impose a duty on the Contracting States to set up institutions of higher education, any State doing so will be under an obligation to afford an effective right of access to them. In a democratic society, the right to education, which is indispensable to the furtherance of human rights, plays such a fundamental role that a restrictive interpretation of the first sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 would not be consistent with the aim or purpose of that provision.\nArticle 3 \u2013 elections.\nArticle 3 provides for the right to elections performed by secret ballot, that are also free and that occur at regular intervals.\nProtocol 4 \u2013 civil imprisonment, free movement, expulsion.\nArticle 1 prohibits the imprisonment of people for inability to fulfil a contract. Article 2 provides for a right to freely move within a country once lawfully there and for a right to leave any country. Article 3 prohibits the expulsion of nationals and provides for the right of an individual to enter a country of their nationality. Article 4 prohibits the collective expulsion of foreigners.\nTurkey and the United Kingdom have signed but never ratified Protocol 4. Greece and Switzerland have neither signed nor ratified this protocol.\nThe United Kingdom's failure to ratify this protocol is due to concerns over the interaction of Article 2 and Article 3 with British nationality law. Specifically, several classes of \"British national\" (such as British National (Overseas)) do not have the right of abode in the United Kingdom and are subject to immigration control there. In 2009, the UK government stated that it had no plans to ratify Protocol 4 because of concerns that those articles could be taken as conferring that right.\nProtocol 6 \u2013 restriction of death penalty.\nArticle 6 requires parties to restrict the application of the death penalty except for \"acts committed in time of war\" or of \"imminent threat of war\".\nEvery Council of Europe member state has signed and ratified Protocol 6.\nProtocol 7 \u2013 crime and family.\nDespite having signed the protocol more than thirty years ago Germany and the Netherlands have never ratified it. Turkey, which signed the protocol in 1985, ratified it in 2016, becoming the latest member state to do so. The United Kingdom has neither signed nor ratified the protocol.\nProtocol 12 \u2013 discrimination.\nProtocol 12 applies the current expansive and indefinite grounds of prohibited discrimination in Article 14 to the exercise of any legal right and to the actions (including the obligations) of public authorities. The additional scope of the Protocol covers four categories of cases:\nThe Protocol entered into force on 1 April 2005 and has (as of March 2018[ [update]]) been ratified by 20 member states. Several member states\u2014Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Lithuania, Monaco, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom\u2014have not signed the protocol.\nThe United Kingdom government has declined to sign Protocol 12 on the basis that they believe the wording of protocol is too wide and would result in a flood of new cases testing the extent of the new provision. They believe that the phrase \"rights set forth by law\" might include international conventions to which the UK is not a party, and would result in incorporation of these instruments by stealth.\nIt has been suggested that the protocol is therefore in a catch-22, since the UK will decline to either sign or ratify the protocol until the European Court of Human Rights has addressed the meaning of the provision, while the court is hindered in doing so by the lack of applications to the court concerning the protocol caused by the decisions of Europe's most populous states\u2014including the UK\u2014not to ratify the protocol. The UK government, nevertheless, stated in 2004 that it \"agrees in principle that the ECHR should contain a provision against discrimination that is free-standing and not parasitic on the other Convention rights\". The first judgment that found a violation of Protocol No. 12, \"Sejdi\u0107 and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina\", was delivered in 2009.\nProtocol 13 \u2013 complete abolition of death penalty.\nProtocol 13 provides for the total abolition of the death penalty. Currently all Council of Europe member states but Azerbaijan have ratified Protocol 13.\nHowever, account must be taken of the position of the Court, which in practice has regarded the Convention as prohibiting the death penalty. In its 2010 judgment in Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v. the United Kingdom, the Court held that Article 2 and Article 3 of the Convention prohibits the death penalty, owing to the general trend towards its abolition among the States Parties to the Convention. This prohibition applies to all States Parties to the Convention, including those which have not ratified Protocol 13.\nAccordingly, the ratification of this Protocol is now essentially symbolic: it demonstrates a State Party\u2019s voluntary commitment to the abolitionist trend in Europe, without constituting an obligation to which it is compelled to adhere.\nProtocol 16 - dialogue.\nProtocol 16 was adopted on 2 October 2013 and entered into force on 1 August 2018. It allows the highest national courts of ratifying States to request non-binding \"advisory opinions\" from the Court on questions of principle concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention. The purpose of this Protocol is to foster dialogue between courts and to strengthen the \u2018constitutional\u2019 role of the Court.\nOnly courts designated as the \u201chighest\u201d by each State can submit requests, which must relate to a pending domestic case and raise a question of principle. If the request is accepted by a five-judge panel, the Grand Chamber delivers the opinion; the national judge sits ex officio.\nAdvisory opinions are formally non-binding under Article 5 of the Protocol, but they carry strong persuasive weight in national proceedings and are generally followed by the Strasbourg Court in later cases.\nSince its entry into force, the Court has received eleven requests and issued seven opinions. Topics addressed include surrogacy and recognition of parenthood (France), defamation and double jeopardy (Armenia) and adult adoption (Finland).\nAs of November 2025, twenty-six States have ratified the Protocol and three more have signed it without ratifying it.\nProcedural and institutional protocols.\nThe convention's provisions affecting institutional and procedural matters have been altered several times by means of protocols. These amendments have, with the exception of Protocol 2, amended the text of the convention. Protocol 2 did not amend the text of the convention as such but stipulated that it was to be treated as an integral part of the text. All of these protocols have required the unanimous ratification of all the member states of the Council of Europe to enter into force.\nProtocol 11.\nProtocols 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 have now been superseded by Protocol 11 which entered into force on 1 November 1998. It established a fundamental change in the machinery of the convention. It abolished the commission, allowing individuals to apply directly to the court, which was given compulsory jurisdiction and altered the latter's structure. Previously states could ratify the convention without accepting the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights. The protocol also abolished the judicial functions of the Committee of Ministers.\nProtocol 14.\nProtocol 14 follows on from Protocol 11 in proposing to further improve the efficiency of the court. It seeks to \"filter\" out cases that have less chance of succeeding along with those that are broadly similar to cases brought previously against the same member state. Furthermore, a case will not be considered admissible where an applicant has not suffered a \"significant disadvantage\". This latter ground can only be used when an examination of the application on the merits is not considered necessary and where the subject-matter of the application had already been considered by a national court.\nA new mechanism was introduced by Protocol 14 to assist enforcement of judgements by the Committee of Ministers. The committee can ask the court for an interpretation of a judgement and can even bring a member state before the court for non-compliance of a previous judgement against that state. Protocol 14 also allows for European Union accession to the convention. The protocol has been ratified by every Council of Europe member state, Russia being last in February 2010. It entered into force on 1 June 2010.\nA provisional Protocol 14bis had been opened for signature in 2009. Pending the ratification of Protocol 14 itself, 14bis was devised to allow the court to implement revised procedures in respect of the states which have ratified it. It allowed single judges to reject manifestly inadmissible applications made against the states that have ratified the protocol. It also extended the competence of three-judge chambers to declare applications made against those states admissible and to decide on their merits where there already is a well-established case law of the court. Now that all Council of Europe member states have ratified Protocol 14, Protocol 14bis has lost its \"raison d'\u00eatre\" and according to its own terms ceased to have any effect when Protocol 14 entered into force on 1 June 2010.\nProtocol 15.\nProtocol 15, opened for signature by the States Parties on 24 June 2013 and entered into force on 1 August 2021, amends the Convention by introducing a reference to the principle of subsidiarity and to the margin of appreciation left to national judges in the interpretation of the Convention. With Protocol 15, the time limit for lodging an application with the Court is reduced from six to four months from the date of the final national decision. In addition, judges are no longer eligible for election after the age of 65, which allows them to complete a full term of office. Finally, the Court may declare an application inadmissible even if the case has not been examined by a domestic court.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "9833", "revid": "415269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9833", "title": "Eureka Rebellion", "text": "1854 gold miners' revolt in Victoria, Australia\nThe Eureka Rebellion involved gold miners who revolted against the British administration of the colony of Victoria, Australia, during the Victorian gold rush. It culminated in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade, which took place on 3 December 1854 at Ballarat between the rebels and the colonial forces of Australia. The fighting resulted in an official total of 27 deaths and many injuries, the majority of casualties being rebels. There was a preceding period beginning in 1851 of peaceful demonstrations and civil disobedience on the Victorian goldfields. The miners had various grievances, chiefly the cost of mining permits and the officious way the system was enforced.\nTensions began in 1851, with the introduction of a tax on gold mines. Miners began to organise and protest the taxes; miners stopped paying the taxes en masse. The October 1854 murder of a gold miner, and the burning of a local hotel (which miners blamed on the government), ended the previously peaceful nature of the miners' dispute. Open rebellion broke out on 29 November 1854, as a crowd of some 10,000 swore allegiance to the Eureka Flag. Gold miner Peter Lalor became the rebellion's \"de facto\" leader, as he had initiated the swearing of allegiance. The Battle of Eureka Stockade ended the short-lived rebellion on 3 December. A group of 13 captured rebels (not including Lalor, who was in hiding) was put on trial for high treason in Melbourne, but mass public support led to their acquittal.\nThe legacy of the Rebellion is contested. Rebel leader Peter Lalor was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1856, though he proved to be less of an ally to the common man than expected. Several reforms sought by the rebels were subsequently implemented, including legislation providing for universal adult male suffrage for Assembly elections and the removal of property qualifications for Legislative Assembly members. The Eureka Rebellion is controversially identified with the birth of democracy in Australia and interpreted by many as a political revolt.\nOrigins in the Victorian gold rush.\nThe Eureka Rebellion had its origins in the Australian gold rush that began in 1851. Following the separation of Victoria from New South Wales on 1 July 1851, gold prospectors were offered 200 guineas for making discoveries within of Melbourne. In August 1851, the news was received around the world that, on top of several earlier finds, Thomas Hiscock had found still more deposits west of Buninyong.\nThis led to gold fever taking hold as the colony's population increased from 77,000 in 1851 to 198,496 in 1853. In three years, the total number of people living in and around the Victorian goldfields stood at a 12-month average of 100,351. In 1851, the Australian population was 430,000. In 1871, it was 1.7 million. Among this number was \"a heavy sprinkling of ex-convicts, gamblers, thieves, rogues and vagabonds of all kinds\". The local authorities soon found themselves with fewer police and lacked the infrastructure needed to support the expansion of the mining industry. The number of public servants, factory and farm workers leaving for the goldfields to seek their fortune made for chronic labour shortages that needed to be resolved.\nProtests on the goldfields: 1851\u20131854.\nLa Trobe introduces monthly mining tax as protests begin.\nOn 16 August 1851, just days after Hiscock's lucky strike, Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe issued two proclamations that reserved to the crown all land rights to the goldfields and introduced a mining licence (tax) of 30 shillings per month, effective 1 September. The universal mining tax was based on time stayed rather than what was seen as the more equitable option, an export duty levied only on gold found, meaning it was always designed to make life unprofitable for most prospectors.\nThere were several mass public meetings and miners' delegations in the years leading up to the armed revolt. The earliest rally was held on 26 August 1851 at Hiscock's Gully in Buninyong and attracted 40\u201350 miners protesting the new mining regulations, and four resolutions to this end were passed. From the outset, there was a division between the \"moral force\" activists who favoured lawful, peaceful and democratic means and those who advocated \"physical force\", with some in attendance suggesting that the miners take up arms against the lieutenant governor, who was irreverently viewed as a feather-wearing, effeminate fop. This first meeting was followed by ongoing protests across all the colony's mining settlements in the years leading up to the 1854 armed uprising at Ballarat.\nFirst gold commissioner arrives in Ballarat.\nIn mid-September 1851, D. C. Doveton, the first local gold commissioner appointed by La Trobe, arrived in Ballarat. At the beginning of December, there was discontent when it was announced that the licence fee would be raised to 3 pounds a month, a 200 per cent increase, effective 1 January 1852. In Ballarat, some miners became so agitated that they began to gather arms. On 8 December, the rebellion continued to build momentum with an anti-mining tax banner put on public display at Forrest Creek.\nAfter remonstrations, particularly in Melbourne and Geelong, on 13 December 1851, the previous increase was rescinded. The Forest Creek Monster Meeting took place at Mount Alexander on 15 December 1851. This was the first truly mass demonstration of the Eureka Rebellion. According to high-end estimates, up to 20,000 miners turned out in a massive display of support for repealing the mining tax. The only pictorial evidence concerning the flag on display at the meeting is an engraving of the scene by Thomas Ham and David Tulloch that features only part of the design.\nBased on the research of Doug Ralph, Marjorie Theobald and others have questioned whether there was an iconic Digger's flag displayed at Forest Creek that spread to other mining settlements.\nTwo days later, it was announced that La Trobe had reversed the planned increase in the mining tax. The oppressive licence hunts continued and increased in frequency, causing general dissent among the diggers. There was strong opposition to the strict prohibition of liquor imposed by the government at the goldfields settlements, whereby the sale and consumption of alcohol were restricted to licensed hotels.\nDespite the high turnover in population on the goldfields, discontent continued to simmer throughout 1852. La Trobe received a petition from the people of Bendigo on 2 September 1862, drawing attention to the need for improvements in the road from Melbourne. The lack of police protection was also a major issue for the protesting miners. On 14 August 1852, a fight broke out among 150 men over land rights in Bendigo. An inquiry recommended increasing police numbers in the colony's mining settlements. Around this time, the first gold deposits at the Eureka lead in Ballarat were found.\nIn October 1852, at Lever Flat near Bendigo, the miners attempted to respond to rising crime levels by forming a \"Mutual Protection Association\". They pledged to withhold the licence fee, build detention centres, and begin nightly armed patrols, with vigilantes dispensing summary justice to those suspected of criminal activities. That month, Government House received a petition from Lever Flat, Forrest Creek and Mount Alexander about policing levels as the colony continued to strain due to the gold rush. On 25 November 1852, a police patrol was attacked by a mob of miners who wrongly believed they were obliged to take out a whole month's subscription for seven days at Oven's goldfield in Bendigo.\nIn 1852, it was decided by the UK government that the Australian colonies should each draft their own constitutions, pending final approval by the Imperial parliament in London.\nBendigo Petition and the Red Ribbon Movement.\nThe disquiet on the goldfields continued in 1853, with public meetings held in Castlemaine, Heathcote and Bendigo. On 3 February 1853, a policeman accidentally caused the death of William Guest at Reid's Creek. Assistant Commissioner James Clow had to defuse a difficult situation with a promise to conduct an inquiry into the circumstances. A group of one thousand angry miners overran the government camp and relieved the police of their sidearms and weapons, destroying a cache of weapons. George Black assisted Dr John Owens in chairing a public meeting held at Ovens field on 11 February 1853 that called for the death of Guest to be fully investigated.\nThe Anti-Gold Licence Association was formed in June at a meeting in Bendigo, where 23,000 signatures were collected for a mass petition, including 8,000 from the mining settlement at McIvor.\nThere was an incident on 2 July 1853 in which police were assaulted in the vicinity of an anti-licence meeting at the Sandhurst goldfield in Bendigo, with rocks being thrown as they escorted an intoxicated miner to the holding cells. On 16 July 1853, an anti-licence demonstration in Sandhurst attracted 6,000 people, who also raised the issue of lack of electoral rights. The high commissioner of the goldfields, William Wright, advised La Trobe of his support for an export duty on gold found rather than the existing universal tax on all prospectors based on time stayed.\nOn 3 August, the Bendigo petition was placed before La Trobe, who refused to act on a request to suspend the mining tax again and give the miners the right to vote. The next day, there was a meeting held at Protestant Hall in Melbourne where the delegation reported on the exchange with La Trobe. The crowd reacted with \"loud disapprobation and showers of hisses\" when the lieutenant governor was mentioned. Manning Clark speaks of one of the leaders of the \"moral force\" faction, George Thompson, who returned to Bendigo, where he attended another meeting on 28 July. Formerly, there was talk of \"moral suasion\" and \"the genius of the English people to compose their differences without resort to violence\". Thompson pointed to the Union Jack and jokingly said that \"if the flag went, it would be replaced by a diggers' flag\".\nThe Bendigo \"diggers flag\" was unfurled at a rally at View Point, Sandhurst, on 12 August 1853 to hear from delegates who had returned from Melbourne with news of the failure of the Bendigo petition. The miners paraded under the flags of several nations, including the Irish tricolour, the saltire of Scotland, the Union Jack, revolutionary French and German flags, and the Stars and Stripes. The \"Geelong Advertiser\" reported that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gully after gully hoisted its own flag, around which the various sections rallied, and as they proceeded towards the starting points, formed quite an animated spectacle \u2026 But the flag which attracted the greatest attention was the Diggers' Banner, the work of one of the Committee, Mr Dexter, an artist of considerable talent, and certainly no company ever possessed a more appropriate coat of arms, or a motto more in character with themselves.\nThe design of the Digger's flag was along the same lines as the flag flown at Forrest Creek in 1851. It has four quarters that feature a pick, shovel and cradle, symbolising the mining industry; a bundle of sticks tied together, symbolising unity; the scales of justice, symbolising the remedies the miners sought; and a Kangaroo and Emu, symbolising Australia.\nOn 20 August 1853, just as an angry mob of 500\u2013600 miners went to assemble outside the government camp at Waranga, the authorities used a legal technicality to release some mining tax evaders. A meeting in Beechworth called for reducing the licence fee to ten shillings and voting rights for the mining settlements. A larger rally attended by 20,000 people was held at Hospital Hill in Bendigo on 23 August 1853, which resolved to support a mining tariff fixed at 10 shillings a month.\nThere was a second multinational-style assembly at View Point on 27 August 1853. The next day a procession of miners passed by the government camp with the sounds of bands and shouting and fifty pistol rounds as an assembly of about 2,000 miners took place. On 29 August 1853, assistant commissioner Robert William Rede at Jones Creek counselled that a peaceful, political solution could still be found. In Ballarat, miners offered to surround the guard tent to protect gold reserves amid rumours of a planned robbery.\nA sitting of the goldfields committee of the Legislative Council in Melbourne on 6 September 1853 heard from goldfields activists Dr William Carr, W Fraser and William Jones. \"An Act for the Better Management of the Goldfields\" was passed, which, upon receiving royal assent on 1 December, reduced the licence fee to 40 shillings for every three months. The act featured increasing fines in the order of 5, 10 and 15 pounds for repeat offenders, with goldfields residents required to carry their permits, which had to be available for inspection at all times. This temporarily relieved tensions in the colony. In November, the select committee bill proposed a licence fee of 1 pound for one month, 2 pounds for three months, 3 for six months and 5 pounds for 12 months, along with extending the voting franchise and land rights to the miners. La Trobe amended the scheme by increasing the six-month licence to 4 pounds, with a fee of 8 pounds for 12 months.\nOn 3 December 1853, a crowd of 2,000\u20133,000 attended an anti-licence rally at View Point. Then, on 31 December 1854, about 500 people gathered there to elect a so-called \"Diggers Congress\".\nLegislative Council calls for Commission of Inquiry.\nLa Trobe decided to cancel the September 1853 mining tax collections. The Legislative Council supported a Commission of Inquiry into goldfields grievances. It also considered a proposal to abolish the licence fee in return for a royalty on the gold and a nominal charge for maintaining the police service. In November, it was resolved by the Legislative Council that the licence fee be reinstated on a sliding scale of 1 pound per month, 2 pounds per three months, 4 pounds for six months, and 8 pounds for 12 months. License evasion was punishable by increasing fines of 5, 15 and 30 pounds, with serial offenders liable to be sentenced to imprisonment. Licence inspections, treated as a great sport and \"carried out in the style of an English fox-hunt\" by mounted officials, known to the miners by the warning call \"Traps\" or \"Joes\", were henceforth able to take place at any time without notice.\nThe latter sobriquet was a reference to La Trobe, whose proclamations posted around the goldfields were signed and sealed \"Walter Joseph Latrobe\". Many of the police were former convicts from Tasmania. They would get a fifty per cent commission from all fines imposed on unlicensed miners and grog sellers. Plainclothes officers enforced prohibition, and those involved in the illegal sale of alcohol were initially handed 50-pound fines. Subsequent offences were punishable by months of hard labour. This led to the corrupt practice of police demanding blackmail of 5 pounds from repeat offenders.\nMiners were arrested for not carrying licences on their person, as they often left them in their tents due to the typically wet and dirty conditions in the mines, then subjected to such indignities as being chained to trees and logs overnight. The impost was most felt by a greater number of miners, who were finding the mining tax untenable without any more significant gold discoveries.\nIn March 1854, La Trobe sent a reform package to the Legislative Council, which was adopted and sent to London for the approval of the Imperial parliament. The voting franchise would be extended to all miners upon purchasing a 12-month permit.\nHotham replaces La Trobe.\nLa Trobe's successor as lieutenant-governor, Sir Charles Hotham, who took up his commission in Victoria on 22 June 1854. He instructed Rede to introduce a strict enforcement system and conduct a weekly cycle of licence hunts, which it was hoped would cause the exodus to the goldfields to be reversed. In August 1854, Hotham and his wife were received in Ballarat during a tour of the Victorian goldfields. In September, Hotham imposed more frequent twice-weekly licence hunts, with more than half of the prospectors on the goldfields remaining non-compliant with the regulations.\nThe miners in Bendigo responded to the increase in the frequency of licence hunts with threats of armed rebellion.\nTensions escalate.\nMurder of James Scobie and the burning of the Eureka hotel.\nIn October 1854, James Scobie was murdered outside the Eureka Hotel. Johannes Gregorius was prosecuted for the murder. A colonial inquest found no evidence of culpability by the Bentley Hotel owners for the fatal injuries amid allegations that Magistrate D'Ewes had a conflict of interest presiding over a case involving the prosecution of Bentley, said to be a friend and indebted business partner.\nGregorius, a physically disabled servant who worked for Father Smyth of St Alipius chapel, had been in the past subjected to police brutality and false arrest for licence evasion, even though he was exempt from the requirement. On 15 October, a mass meeting of predominantly Catholic miners took place on Bakery Hill in protest over the treatment of Gregorius. Two days later, responding to the acquittal, a meeting of approximately 10,000 men occurred near the Eureka Hotel in protest. The hotel was set alight as Rede was pelted with eggs. The available security forces were unable to restore order.\nOn 21 October, Andrew McIntyre and Thomas Fletcher were arrested for the arson attack on the Eureka Hotel. A third man, John Westerby, was also indicted. A committee meeting of miners on Bakery Hill agreed to indemnify the bail sureties for McIntyre and Fletcher. As a large mob approached the government camp, the two men were hurriedly released under their own recognisance.\nAround this time two reward notices were distributed around Ballarat. One offered a 500-pound reward for information leading to an arrest in the Scobie murder case. The other announced the reward for more information about the Bank of Victoria heist in Ballarat that was carried out by robbers wearing black crepe-paper masks, and which was increased from 500 to 1,600 pounds. Rede received a miner's delegation on 23 October which had heard that the police officers involved in the arrest of Gregorius would be dismissed. Two days later, a meeting led by Timothy Hayes and John Manning heard reports from the deputies sent to negotiate with Rede. The meeting resolved to petition Hotham for a retrial of Gregorius and to the reassignment of the assistant commissioner Johnston away from Ballarat.\nOn 27 October, Captain John Wellesley Thomas laid contingency plans for the defence of the government outpost. In the weeks leading up to the battle, men had already been aiming musket balls at the barely fortified barracks during the night. On 30 October, Hotham appointed a board of enquiry into the murder of James Scobie to sit in Ballarat on 2 and 10 November. The panel included Melbourne magistrate Evelyn Sturt, assisted by his local magistrate Charles Hackett and William McCrea. After receiving representations from the US consul, Hotham released James Tarleton from custody.\nThe inquiry into the Ballarat rioting concluded with a statement made on 10 November in the name of the Ballarat Reform League that was signed by John Basson Humffray, Fredrick Vern, Henry Ross and Samuel Irwin of the \"Geelong Advertiser\". The final report agreed with the League's submission, blaming the government camp for the unsatisfactory state of affairs. The recommendation that Magistrate Dewes and Sergeant Major-Milne of the constabulary should be dismissed was acted upon.\nOn 1 November, around 5,000 miners gathered in Bendigo, as a plan was drawn up to organise the diggers at all the mining settlements, with speakers openly advocating physical force addressing the crowd.\nBallarat Reform League meetings.\nOn 11 November 1854, a crowd of more than 10,000 gathered at Bakery Hill, directly opposite the government encampment. At this meeting, the Ballarat Reform League was formally established under the chairmanship of Chartist John Humffray. (Several other reform league leaders, including George Black, Henry Holyoake, and Tom Kennedy, are also believed to have been Chartists.) It was reported by the \"Ballarat Times\" that at the appointed hour, the \"Union Jack and the American ensign were hoisted as signals for the people to assemble\". It was at this time the Union Jack became a national flag while being \"inscribed with slogans as a protest flag of the Chartist movement in the nineteenth century\".\nThe Ballarat Reform League charter was inspired by the charter ratified at the 1839 Chartist National Convention held in London. The Ballarat charter contains five of the same demands as the London one: A full and fair representation, Manhood suffrage, No property qualification of members for the Legislative Council, Payment of members of parliament. The Ballarat league did not adopt the Chartist's sixth demand: secret ballots. The meeting passed a resolution \"that it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called on to obey, that taxation without representation is tyranny\". The meeting resolved to secede from the United Kingdom if the situation did not improve.\nThroughout the following weeks, the league sought to negotiate with Rede and Hotham on the specific matters relating to Bentley and the death of James Scobie, the men being tried for the burning of the Eureka Hotel, the broader issues of the abolition of the licence, suffrage and democratic representation of the goldfields, and the disbanding of the gold commission.\nHotham sent a message to England on 16 November which revealed his intention to establish an inquiry into goldfields grievances. Notes to the royal commissioners had already been made on 6 November, where Hotham stated his opposition to an export duty on gold replacing the universal mining tax. W. C. Haines MLC was to be the chairman, serving alongside lawmakers John Fawkner, John O'Shanassy, William Westgarth, as well as chief gold commissioner William Wright. These men were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.\nRather than hear the Ballarat Reform League's grievances, Rede increased the police presence on the Ballarat goldfields and summoned reinforcements from Melbourne. Rede told one deputation that their campaign against \"The licence is a mere cloak to cover a democratic revolution\", and the day before the battle reported to the chief gold commissioner that the government forces stood ready to \"crush them and the democratic agitation at one blow\".\nThe James Scobie murder trial ended on 18 November 1854, with the accused, James Bentley, Thomas Farrell and William Hance, being convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to three years of hard labour on a road crew. Catherine Bentley was acquitted. Two days later, the miners Westerby, Fletcher and McIntyre were convicted for burning the Eureka Hotel and were sentenced to jail terms of six, four and three months.\nThe jury recommended the prerogative of mercy be evoked and noted that they held the local authorities in Ballarat responsible for the loss of property. One week later, a reform league delegation, including Humffray, met with Hotham, Stawell and Foster to negotiate the release of the three Eureka Hotel rioters. Hotham declared that he would take a stand on the word \"demand\", satisfied that due process had been observed. Father Smyth informed Rede in confidence that he believed the miners might be about to march on the government outpost.\nEscalating violence as military convoy looted.\nFoot police reinforcements arrived in Ballarat on 19 October 1854. A further detachment of the 40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot arrived a few days behind. On 28 November, the 12th (East Suffolk) Regiment of Foot arrived to reinforce the government camp in Ballarat. As they moved alongside where the Eureka Stockade was about to be erected, members of the convoy were attacked by a mob looking to loot the wagons.\nBy the beginning of December, the police contingent at Ballarat had been surpassed by the number of soldiers from the 12th and 40th regiments. The strength of the various units in the government camp was: 40th regiment (infantry): 87 men; 40th regiment (mounted): 30 men; 12th regiment (infantry): 65 men; mounted police: 70 men; and the foot police: 24 men.\nOpen rebellion.\nParamilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross.\nOn 29 November, a meeting that drew a crowd of around 10,000 was held at Bakery Hill. The miners heard from their deputies news of the unsuccessful outcome of their meeting with Hotham, demanding the release of Westerby, Fletcher and McIntyre.\nThe Eureka Flag was flown there for the first time. The crowd was incited by Timothy Hayes shouting, \"Are you ready to die?\" and Fredrick Vern, who was accused of abandoning the garrison four days later as soon as the danger arrived, with suspicions of being a double agent.\nRede responded by ordering police to conduct a licence search on 30 November. There was further rioting where objects were thrown at military and law enforcement by the protesting miners who had refused to cooperate with licence inspections \"en masse\". Eight licence defaulters were arrested. Most of the military resources available had to be summoned to extricate the arresting officers from the angry mob that had assembled.\nThere was another gathering on Bakery Hill where a militant leader, Peter Lalor, mounted a stump armed with a rifle and proclaimed \"liberty\". He then called for volunteers to step forward and be sworn into companies, and rebel captains to be appointed.\nLalor knelt, pointed to the Eureka Flag, and swore to the affirmation of his fellow demonstrators: \"We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties\".\nIn a dispatch dated 20 December 1854, Hotham reported: \"The disaffected miners ... held a meeting whereat the Australian flag of independence was solemnly consecrated and vows offered for its defence\".\nFortification of the Eureka lead.\nAfter the oath swearing ceremony, about 1,000 rebels marched in double file from Bakery Hill to the Eureka lead behind the Eureka Flag being carried by Henry Ross, where construction of the stockade took place between 30 November and 2 December. There were existing mines within the stockade. The stockade consisted of diagonal wooden spikes made from materials including pit props and overturned horse carts. It encompassed an area said to be one acre. Other estimates give the dimensions of the stockade as x . Contemporaneous descriptions and representations vary and have the stockade as either rectangular or semi-circular.\nLalor later said the stockade \"was nothing more than an enclosure to keep our own men together, and was never erected with an eye to military defence\". Peter FitzSimons asserts that Lalor may have downplayed the fact that the Eureka Stockade was intended as something of a fortress at a time when \"it was very much in his interests\" to do so. The construction work was overseen by Vern, who had apparently received instruction in military methods. John Lynch wrote that his \"military learning comprehended the whole system of warfare ... fortification was his strong point\".\nOther descriptions of the stockade contradicted Lalor's recollection of it being a simple fence after the fall of the stockade. Testimony was heard at the high treason trials for the Eureka rebels that the stockade was four to seven feet high in places and was unable to be negotiated on horseback without being reduced.\nHotham feared that the \"network of rabbit burrows\" on the goldfields would prove readily defensible as his forces \"on the rough pot-holed ground would be unable to advance in regular formation and would be picked off easily by snipers\". These considerations were part of the reasoning behind the decision to move into position in the early morning for a surprise attack. Carboni details the rebel dispositions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The shepherds' holes inside the lower part of the stockade had been turned into rifle-pits, and were now occupied by Californians of the I. C. Rangers' Brigade, some twenty or thirty in all, who had kept watch at the 'outposts' during the night.\nThe location of the stockade has been described as \"appalling from a defensive point of view\", as it was situated on \"a gentle slope, which exposed a sizeable portion of its interior to fire from nearby high ground\". A detachment of 800 men, which included \"two field pieces and two howitzers\" was under the commander in chief of the British forces in Australia, Major General Sir Robert Nickle. Nickle himself, who had seen action during the 1798 Irish rebellion, arrived after the insurgency had been put down. In 1860, Withers stated in a lecture that \"The site was most injudicious for any purpose of defence as it was easily commanded from adjacent spots, and the ease with which the place could be taken was apparent to the most unprofessional eye\".\nAt 4 am on the morning of 1 December, the rebels were observed to be massing on Bakery Hill, but a government raiding party found the area vacated. Again, Rede ordered the riot act read to a mob that had gathered around Bath's Hotel, with mounted police breaking up the unlawful assembly. Raffaello Carboni, George Black and Father Smyth met with Rede to present a peace proposal. Rede was suspicious of the Chartist undercurrent of the anti-mining tax movement and he rejected the proposals.\nThe rebels sent out scouts and established picket lines in order to have advance warning of Rede's movements and a request for reinforcements to the other mining settlements. The \"moral force\" faction had withdrawn from the protest movement as the men of violence moved into the ascendancy. The rebels continued to fortify their position as 300-400 men arrived from Creswick's Creek, and Carboni recalls they were: \"dirty and ragged, and proved the greatest nuisance. One of them, Michael Tuohy, behaved valiantly\". Once foraging parties were organised, there was a rebel garrison of around 200 men. Amid the Saturday night revelry, low munitions, and major desertions, Lalor ordered that any man attempting to leave the stockade be shot.\nVinegar Hill blunder: Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade.\n\"The Argus\" newspaper of 4 December 1854 reported that the Union Jack \"had\" to be hoisted underneath the Eureka Flag at the stockade and that both flags were in possession of the foot police. Peter FitzSimons has questioned whether this contemporaneous report of the otherwise unaccounted-for Union Jack known as the Eureka Jack being present is accurate. Among those willing to credit the first report of the battle as being true and correct it has been theorised that the hoisting of a Union Jack at the stockade was possibly an 11th-hour response to the divided loyalties among the heterogeneous rebel force which was in the process of dissipating.\nAt one point up to 1,500 of 17,280 men in Ballarat were garrisoning the stockade, with as few as 120 taking part in the battle. Lalor's choice of password for the night of 2 December\u2014\"Vinegar Hill\"\u2014caused support for the rebellion to fall away among those who were otherwise disposed to resist the military, as word spread that the question of Irish home rule had become involved. One survivor of the battle stated that \"the collapse of the rising at Ballarat may be regarded as mainly attributable to the password given by Lalor on the night before the assault\". Asked by one of his subordinates for the \"night pass\", he gave \"Vinegar Hill\", the site of a battle during the 1798 Irish rebellion. The 1804 Castle Hill uprising, also known as the second battle of Vinegar Hill, was the site of a convict rebellion in the colony of New South Wales, involving mainly Irish transportees, some of whom were at Vinegar Hill.\nWilliam Craig recalled that \"Many at Ballaarat, who were disposed before that to resist the military, now quietly withdrew from the movement\". In his memoirs, Lynch states: \"On the afternoon of Saturday we had a force of seven hundred men on whom we thought we could rely\". There was a false alarm from the picket line during the night. The subsequent roll call revealed there had been a sizable desertion that Lynch says \"ought to have been seriously considered, but it was not\".\nThere were rebellious miners converging on Ballarat from Bendigo, Forrest Creek, and Creswick to take part in the armed struggle. The latter contingent was said to number a thousand men, \"but when the news circulated that Irish independence had crept into the movement, almost all turned back\". FitzSimons points out that although the number of reinforcements converging on Ballarat was probably closer to 500, there is no doubt that as a result of the choice of password \"the Stockade is denied many strong-armed men because of the feeling that the Irish have taken over\". Withers states that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Lalor, it is said, gave 'Vinegar Hill' as the night's pass-word, but neither he nor his adherents expected that the fatal action of Sunday was coming, and some of his followers, incited by the sinister omen of the pass-word, abandoned that night what they saw was a badly organised and not very hopeful movement.\nIt is certain that Irish-born people were strongly represented at the Eureka Stockade. Most of the rebels inside the stockade at the time of the battle were Irish, and the area where the defensive position was established was overwhelmingly populated by Irish miners. Blainey has advanced the view that the white cross of the Eureka Flag is \"really an Irish cross rather than being [a] configuration of the Southern Cross\".\nThere is another theory advanced by Gregory Blake, military historian and author of \"Eureka Stockade: A Ferocious and Bloody Battle\", who concedes that two flags may have been flown on the day of the battle, as the miners were claiming to be defending their British rights.\nIn a signed contemporaneous affidavit dated 7 December 1854, Private Hugh King, who was at the battle serving with the 40th regiment, recalled that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... three or four hundred yards a heavy fire from the stockade was opened on the troops and me. When the fire was opened on us we received orders to fire. I saw some of the 40th wounded lying on the ground but I cannot say that it was before the fire on both sides. I think some of the men in the stockade should-they had a flag flying in the stockade; it was a white cross of five stars on a blue ground. \u2013 flag was afterwards taken from one of the prisoners like a union jack \u2013 we fired and advanced on the stockade, when we jumped over, we were ordered to take all we could prisoners ...\nThere was a further report in \"The Argus\", 9 December 1854 edition, stating that Hugh King had given live testimony at the committal hearings for the Eureka rebels where he stated that the flag was found:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... rollen up in the breast of a[n] [unidentified] prisoner. He [King] advanced with the rest, firing as they advanced ... several shots were fired on them after they entered [the stockade]. He observed the prisoner [Hayes] brought down from a tent in custody.\nBlake leaves open the possibility that the flag being carried by the prisoner had been souvenired from the flag pole as the routed garrison was fleeing the stockade.\nDeparting detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind.\nAmid the rising number of rebels absent without leave throughout 2 December, a contingent of 200 Americans under James McGill arrived at 4 pm. Styled as \"The Independent Californian Rangers' Revolver Brigade\", they had horses and were equipped with sidearms and Mexican knives. In a fateful decision, McGill took most of his two hundred Californian Rangers away from the stockade to intercept rumoured British reinforcements from Melbourne. Many Saturday night revellers within the rebel garrison returned to their own tents, assuming that the government camp would not attack on the Sabbath day. A small contingent of miners remained at the stockade overnight, which the spies reported to Rede. Common estimates for the size of the garrison at the time of the attack on 3 December range from 120 to 150 men.\nAccording to Lalor's reckoning: \"There were about 70 men possessing guns, 30 with pikes and 30 with pistols, but many had no more than one or two rounds of ammunition. Their coolness and bravery were admirable when it is considered that the odds were 3 to 1 against\". Lalor's command was riddled with informants, and Rede was kept well advised of his movements, particularly through the work of government agents Henry Goodenough and Andrew Peters, who were embedded within the rebel garrison.\nInitially outnumbering the government camp considerably, Lalor had already devised a strategy where \"if the government forces come to attack us, we should meet them on the Gravel Pits, and if compelled, we should retreat by the heights to the old Canadian Gully, and there we shall make our final stand\". On being brought to battle that day, Lalor stated: \"we would have retreated, but it was then too late\".\nOn the eve of the battle, Father Smyth issued a plea for Catholics to down their arms and attend mass the following day.\nBattle of the Eureka Stockade.\nRede planned to send the combined military police formation of 276 men under the command of Captain Thomas to attack the Eureka Stockade when the rebel garrison was observed to be at a low watermark. The police and military had the element of surprise and timed their assault on the stockade for dawn on Sunday, the Christian Sabbath day of rest. The soldiers and police marched off in silence at around 3:30 am Sunday morning after the troopers had drunk the traditional tot of rum.\nThe British commander used bugle calls to coordinate his forces. The 40th regiment provided covering fire from one end, with mounted police covering the flanks. Enemy contact began at approximately 150 yards as the two columns of regular infantry and the contingent of foot police moved into position. Although Lalor claimed that the government forces fired the first shot, it appears from all the other remaining accounts as if it came from the rebel garrison.\nAccording to Gregory Blake, the fighting in Ballarat on 3 December 1854 was not one-sided and full of indiscriminate murder by the colonial forces. In his memoirs, one of Lalor's captains, John Lynch, mentions \"some sharp shooting\". For at least 10 minutes, the rebels offered stiff resistance, with ranged fire coming from the Eureka Stockade garrison such that Thomas's best formation, the 40th regiment, wavered and had to be rallied. Blake says this is \"stark evidence of the effectiveness of the defender's fire\".\nEventually, the rebels started to run short of ammunition, and the government advance resumed. The Victorian police contingent led the way over the top as the forlorn hope in a bayonet charge. Lalor had his arm shattered by a musket ball and was secreted away by supporters, with his arm later requiring amputation. The Eureka flag was captured by Constable John King, who volunteered to scale the flagpole, which then snapped. The exact number of casualties cannot be determined. After the battle, the registrar of Ballarat entered the names of 27 people into the Victorian death register. Lalor lists 34 rebel casualties, of which 22 died. In his report, Captain Thomas states that one soldier was killed in action, two died of wounds, and fourteen were wounded.\nAftermath.\nBlainey has commented that \"Every government in the world would probably have counter-attacked in the face of the building of the stockade\". Hotham would receive the news that the government forces had been victorious the same day, with Stawell waiting outside Saint James church, where Hotham was attending a service with Foster. He immediately set about firing up the government printing press to put out placards calling for support from among the colonists.\nA state of martial law was proclaimed with no lights allowed in any tent after 8 pm \"even though the legal basis for it was dubious\". It was around this time that a number of unprovoked shots were fired from the government camp toward the diggings. Unrelated first-hand accounts variously state that a woman, her infant child and several men were killed or wounded in an episode of indiscriminate shooting.\nNews of the battle spread quickly to Melbourne and across the goldfields, turning a perceived government military victory in repressing a minor insurrection into a public relations disaster. On 5 December, reinforcements under Major General Nickle arrived at the government camp in Ballarat. Reverend Taylor expected further repression, stating that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs it happened, Nickle proved to be a wise, considered and even-handed military commander who calmed the tensions and Taylor \"found him to be a very affable and kind gentleman\". Evans' diary records the effect of his conduct as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sir Robert Nichol [\"sic\"] has taken the reins of power at the Camp. Already there is a sensible and gratifying deference in its appearance. The old General went round unattended to several tents early this morning &amp; made enquiries from the diggers relative to the cause of the outbreak. It is very probable from the humane &amp; temperate course he is taking that he will establish himself in the goodwill of the people.\nThe same day several thousand people attended a public meeting held in Swanston Street, Melbourne. There were howls of anger when several pro-government motions were proposed. When the seconder of one motion, which called for the maintenance of law and order, framed the issue as \"would they support the flag of old England...or the new flag of the Southern Cross\", the speaker was drowned out by groans from the crowd. In response, it was then proposed that restoring order required removing the government that caused the disorder in the first place. Amid cheers from the crowd, the mayor of Melbourne as chairman declared the pro-government motions carried and hastily adjourned the meeting. However, a new chairman was elected, and motions condemning the government and calling for the resignation of Foster were passed.\nFoster had acted as the temporary administrator of Victoria during the transition from La Trobe to Hotham. As colonial secretary to the lieutenant governor, he rigorously enforced the mining licence requirement amid the colony's budget and labour crisis. Foster had already offered his resignation on 4 December as the protests began, which Hotham accepted a week later.\nOn 6 December 1854, a 6,000-strong crowd gathered at Saint Paul's Cathedral protesting against the government's response to the Eureka Rebellion, as a group of 13 rebel prisoners were indicted for treason. Newspapers in the colony characterised it as a brutal overuse of force, in a situation brought about by the actions of government officials, and public condemnation became insurmountable. Letters Patent formally appointing the members of the Royal Commission were signed and sealed on 7 December 1854.\nHotham managed to have an auxiliary force of 1,500 special constables from Melbourne sworn in along with others from Geelong, with his resolve that further \"rioting and sedition would be speedily put down\", undeterred by the rebuff his policies had received from the general public. In Ballarat, only one man stepped forward and answered the call to enlist. By the beginning of 1855, normalcy had returned to the streets of Ballarat, with mounted patrols no longer being a feature of daily life.\nAmong the government officials, although Foster was made a scapegoat for the affair at Eureka, he remained a member of the Legislative Council. He briefly served on the parliamentary executive as treasurer before returning to England in 1857, where he published his speeches on the Eureka Rebellion. Rede was recalled from Ballarat and kept on full pay until 1855. He served as the sheriff at Geelong (1857), Ballarat (1868), and Melbourne (1877) and was the Commandant of the Volunteer Rifles, being the second-in-command at Port Phillip.\nIn 1880, Rede was sheriff at the trial of Ned Kelly and an official witness to his execution. Hotham was promoted on 22 May 1855 when the title of the colony's chief executive was changed from lieutenant governor to governor. He died in Melbourne on New Year's Eve 1855 while in a coma after suffering from a severe cold.\nTrials for sedition and high treason.\nThe first trial relating to the rebellion was a charge of sedition against Henry Seekamp of the \"Ballarat Times\". Seekamp was tried and convicted of seditious libel by a Melbourne jury on 23 January 1855 and, after a series of appeals, sentenced to six months imprisonment on 23 March. He was released from prison on 28 June 1855, three months early. During Seekamp's absence, Clara served as editor of the \"Ballarat Times\".\nOf the approximately 120 individuals detained after the battle, thirteen were put on trial for high treason. There were Timothy Hayes, Raffaello Carboni, John Manning, John Joseph, Jan Vennick, James Beattie, Henry Reid, Michael Tuohy, James Macfie Campbell, William Molloy, Jacob Sorenson, Thomas Dignum, and John Phelan.\nThe African American John Joseph was the first rebel put on trial. Matters of fact were decided by a lay juries drawn from a general public that was largely sympathetic to the rebel cause. One of the junior counsels for Joseph was Butler Cole Aspinall, who appeared pro bono. Formerly chief of parliamentary reporting for \"The Argus\" before returning to practice, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly in the wake of the Eureka trials. He received many other criminal briefs later in his legal career, including that of Henry James O'Farrell, who was indicted for an 1868 assassination attempt on the Duke of Edinburgh in Sydney. Gavan Duffy said of Aspinall that he was: \"one of the half-dozen men whose undoubted genius gave the Parliament of Victoria a first place among colonial legislatures\".\nThe jury's verdict of not guilty was greeted by applause, with two men being sentenced to a week in prison for contempt of court. Over 10,000 people had come to hear the jury's verdict. Joseph was carried around the streets of Melbourne in a chair in triumph, according to \"The Ballarat Star\".\nManning's case was heard next. The indicted rebels were acquitted in quick succession, with the last five all being tried together on 27 March. The lead defence counsel Archibald Michie observed that the proceedings had become \"weary, stale, flat, dull and unprofitable\". The trials have, on several occasions, been described as a farce.\nAs Molony points out, the legality of putting a foreign national on trial for treason had been settled as far back as 1649. A difficulty the Crown prosecutor faced regarding the mens rea was that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... it was another thing entirely to prove that any treasonable intent was harboured in the mind of John Joseph... These matters were weighty and more conclusive of proof than a charge of murder, but they left the Crown with an arduous task of convincing the jury that Joseph had acted with such an elevated intent.\nThe Colonial Secretary Lord John Russell rebuked Hotham over the decision to prosecute the captured rebels, saying in a despatch:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... respecting the trial of the prisoners taken at Ballarat, I wish to say that, although I do not doubt you have acted to the best of your judgment, and under advice, yet I question the expediency of bringing these rioters to trial under a charge of High Treason, being one so difficult of proof, and so open to objections of the kind which appear to have prevailed with the jury.\nCommission of Inquiry report.\nOn 14 December 1854, the goldfields commission sat for the first time. The first Ballarat session was held four days later at Bath's Hotel. In a meeting with Hotham on 8 January 1855, the goldfields commissioners made an interim recommendation that the mining tax be scrapped, and two days later made a submission advising a general amnesty be granted for all those rebels on the run from the Eureka Stockade.\nThe commission's final report into the Victorian goldfields was presented to Hotham on 27 March 1855. It was scathing in its assessment of the administration of the goldfields, particularly the Eureka Stockade affair. Within 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League were implemented. The changes included the abolition of gold licences to be replaced with an export duty. An annual 1-pound miner's right that entitles the holder to voting rights for the lower house and a land deed was introduced. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and there was a reduction in police numbers. The Legislative Council was reconstituted to provide representation for the major gold field settlements.\nConcerning the tensions caused by the Chinese presence on the goldfields, the report states inter alia:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A most serious social question with reference to the gold-fields, and one that has lately crept on with rapid but almost unobserved steps, is with reference to the great number of the Chinese. This number, although already almost incredible, yet appears to be still fast increasing ... The question of the influx of such large numbers of a pagan and inferior race is a very serious one ... The statement of one of this people, that \"all\" were coming, comprises an unpleasant possibility of the future, that a comparative handful of colonists may be buried in a countless throng of Chinamen ... some step is here necessary, if not to prohibit, at least to check and diminish this influx.\nThe legislative remedy came in the form of a poll tax, assented to on 12 June 1855, made payable by Chinese immigrants.\nHumffray commended the report in a letter to the editor, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The [commission] report is a most masterly and statesmanlike document, and if its wise suggestions are wisely and honestly carried out, that commission will have rendered a service to the colony ... the wrongs and grievances of the digging community are clearly set forth in the Report, and practical schemes suggested for their removal.\nPeter Lalor enters parliament.\nLalor, in his letter to the colonists of Victoria, lamented that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are two things connected with the late outbreak (Eureka) which I deeply regret. The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.\nIn July 1855, the Victorian Constitution received royal assent, which provided for a fully elected bicameral parliament, with a new Legislative Assembly of 60 seats and a reformed Legislative Council of 30 seats. The franchise was available to all holders of the miner's right for the inaugural Legislative Assembly election, with members of parliament themselves subject to property qualifications. In the interim, five representatives from the mining settlements were appointed to the old part elected Legislative Council, including Lalor and Hummfray in Ballarat.\nLalor is said to have \"aroused hostility among his digger constituents\" by not supporting the principle of one vote, one value. He instead preferred the existing property-based franchise and plural voting, where ownership of a certain number of holdings conferred the right to cast multiple ballots. In the event when the \"Electoral Act of 1856\" (Vic) was enacted, these provisions were not carried forward. Universal adult male suffrage was then introduced in 1857 for Legislative Assembly elections. (That said, property and later ratepaying franchises and hence 'plural voting' for some persisted: one-person-one-vote was not achieved until 1938 and property qualifications remained until 1950 for the Legislative Council.)\nOn another occasion, there were 17,745 signatures from Ballarat residents on a petition against a regressive land ownership bill Lalor supported that favoured the \"squattocracy\", who came from pioneering families who had acquired their prime agricultural land through occupation and were not of a mind to give up their monopoly on the countryside, nor political representation. He is on record as having been opposed to payment for members of the Legislative Council, which had been another key demand of the Ballarat Reform League. In November 1855, under the new constitutional arrangements, Lalor was elected unopposed to the Legislative Assembly for the seat of North Grenville, which he held from 1856 to 1859.\nWithers and others have noted that those who considered Lalor a legendary folk hero were surprised that he was more concerned with accumulating styles and estates than securing any gains from the Eureka Rebellion. Lalor was found wanting by a critical mass of his supporters, who had hitherto sustained his political career. Lynch recalls that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The semi-Chartist, revolutionary Chief, the radical reformer thus suddenly metamorphosed into a smug Tory, was surely a spectacle to make good men weep. But good men did more than weep; they decried him with vehemence in keeping with the recoil of their sentiments\". \nUnder pressure from constituents to clarify his position, in a letter dated 1 January 1857 published in the \"Ballarat Star\", Lalor described his political ideology in the following terms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I would ask the gentlemen what they mean by the term 'Democracy'? Do they mean Chartism, or Communism, or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if democracy means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have ever been, am still, and I ever will remain a democrat.\nFrom there on, he never represented a Ballarat-based constituency again. He successfully contested the Melbourne seat of South Grant in the Legislative Assembly in 1859, until being twice defeated at the polls in 1871, on the second occasion contesting the seat of North Melbourne. In 1874, he was again elected as the member for South Grant, which he represented in parliament until he died in 1889.\nLalor served as chairman of committees from 1859 to 1868 before being sworn into the ministry. He was first appointed as Commissioner of Trade and Customs in 1875, an office he held throughout 1877-1880, riding the fortunes of his parliamentary faction. He was briefly Postmaster-General of Victoria from May to July 1877. Lalor served as the speaker from 1880 and 1887. When his health situation forced him to step down, parliament awarded him a sum of 4,000 pounds. Lalor twice refused to accept the highest Imperial honour of a British knighthood.\nLocation of Bakery Hill and the Eureka Stockade.\nIn 1931, R. S. Reed claimed that \"an old tree stump on the south side of Victoria Street, near Humffray Street, is the historic tree at which the pioneer diggers gathered in the days before the Eureka Stockade to discuss their grievances against the officialdom of the time\". Reed called for the formation of a committee of citizens to \"beautify the spot, and to preserve the tree stump\" upon which Lalor addressed the assembled rebels during the oath swearing ceremony. It was also reported the stump \"has been securely fenced in, and the enclosed area is to be planted with floriferous trees. The spot is adjacent to Eureka, which is famed alike for the stockade fight and for the fact that the Welcome Nugget. (sold for \u00a310,500) was discovered in 1858 within a stone's throw of it\".\nA 2015 report commissioned by the City of Ballarat found that given documentary evidence and its elevation, the most likely location of the oath swearing ceremony is 29 St. Paul's Way, Bakery Hill. As of 2016, the area was a car park awaiting residential development.\nAs the materials used by the rebels to fortify the Eureka lead were quickly removed and the landscape altered by mining, the exact location of the Eureka Stockade is unknown. Various studies have been undertaken that have arrived at different conclusions. In 1994, Jack Harvey conducted an exhaustive survey and concluded that the Eureka Stockade Memorial is situated within the confines of the historical Eureka Stockade.\nPolitical legacy.\nThe actual political significance of the Eureka Rebellion is contested. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of republicanism. Some historians believe that the prominence of the event in the public record has come about because Australian history does not include a major armed rebellion phase equivalent to the French Revolution, the English Civil War, or the Indian Rebellion, making the Eureka story inflated well beyond its real importance. Others maintain that Eureka was a seminal event and that it marked a major change in the course of Australian history.\nIn modern times, there have been calls for the official Australian national flag to be replaced by the Eureka Flag.\nIn his eyewitness account, Carboni stated that \"amongst the foreigners ... there was no democratic feeling, but merely a spirit of resistance to the licence fee\". He also disputes the accusations \"that have branded the miners of Ballarat as disloyal to their QUEEN\".\nAmerican author Mark Twain, who journeyed to Ballarat, noted how the Eureka Rebellion was well remembered by locals, likening it to the battles of Concord and Battle of Lexington in his 1897 travel book \"Following the Equator\". Concerning the legacy of the battle, he stated: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think it may be called the finest thing in Australasian history. It was a revolution - small in size; but great politically; it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for a principle, a stand against injustice and oppression... It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle.\nH. V. Evatt, leader of the ALP, wrote that \"Australian democracy was born at Eureka\". Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies said, \"the Eureka revolution was an earnest attempt at democratic government\". Ben Chifley, former ALP Prime Minister, believed the Eureka Rebellion was not just a \"short-lived revolt against tyrannical authority\" and expressed the view that it was consequential in terms of Australia's development as a nation in that \"it was the first real affirmation of our determination to be masters of our own political destiny\".\nBlainey has described Evatt's view as \"slightly inflammatory\" for such reasons as the first parliamentary elections in Australian history actually took place in South Australia, albeit according to a more limited property-based franchise, observing that it had been a battle cry for nationalists, republicans, liberals, radicals, and communists with \"each creed finding in the rebellion the lessons they liked to see\". He acknowledged that the inaugural parliament that convened under Victoria's revised constitution \"was alert to the democratic spirit of the goldfields\". The parliament eventually passed laws that enabled all adult males to vote by secret ballot and contest Legislative Assembly elections. He points out that many miners were temporary migrants from Britain and the United States who did not intend to settle permanently in Australia, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nowadays it is common to see the noble Eureka Flag and the rebellion of 1854 as the symbol of Australian independence, of freedom from foreign domination; but many saw the rebellion in 1854 as an uprising by outsiders who were exploiting the country's resources and refusing to pay their fair share of taxes. So we make history do its handsprings.\nIn 1999, the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, dismissed the Eureka Stockade as a \"protest without consequence\". Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson made the Eureka Flag a federal election campaign issue in 2004 saying \"I think people have tried to make too much of the Eureka Stockade ... trying to give it a credibility and standing that it probably doesn't enjoy\". In the opening address of the Eureka 150 Democracy Conference in 2004, the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, said \"that Eureka was about the struggle for basic democratic rights. It was not about a riot\u2014it was about rights\".\nCommemoration.\n19th century.\nFollowing an earlier meeting on 22 November 1855 held at the location of the stockade where calls for compensation were made, Carboni returned to the rebel burial ground for the first anniversary of the battle and remained for the day selling copies of his self-published memoirs. In 1856, for the second anniversary, veteran John Lynch gave a speech as several hundred people gathered at the Eureka lead before a march to the local cemetery to remember the fall of the Eureka Stockade. There was a collection to building railings around the Eureka burial ground.\nOn 22 March 1856, a diggers' memorial was erected in the Ballaarat Old Cemetery near marked graves. Sculpted in stone from the Barrabool Hills by James Leggatt in Geelong, it features a pillar with the names of the deceased miners and the inscription \"Sacred to the memory of those who fell on the memorable 3 December 1854 in resisting the unconstitutional proceedings of the Victorian Government\".\nIn 1857, the anniversary was much more low-key and was marked by \"some of the friends of those who fell to decorate their tombs with flowers ... the occasion will be passed over without any public demonstrations...\". In 1858, at the appointed time, there was only a crowd of seven people at the cemetery, two of whom were journalists. The \"Ballarat Star\" report \"deplored the general lack of interest and neglected condition of the graves\".\nThe soldiers were buried in the same cemetery as the rebels. In August 1872, the area surrounding the soldiers' graves was enclosed with a fence. A soldiers' memorial was constructed in 1879, an obelisk constructed of limestone sourced from Waurn Ponds with the words \"Victoria\" and \"Duty\" carved in its north and south faces, respectively.\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, press interest in the events that had taken place at the Eureka Stockade dwindled, with the anniversary rating the occasional reference in the \"Courier\" and \"Star\". Eureka was kept alive at the campfires, pubs, and at memorial events in Ballarat. Key living figures such as Lalor and Humffray were still in the public eye.\nThe Eureka Stockade Monument located within the Eureka Stockade Gardens dates from 1884 and has been added to the Australian National Heritage List. A meeting was held at the partially completed monument on 3 December 1884. It appears there were no further gatherings at the Eureka Stockade Monument until the 50th-anniversary commemorations in 1904.\nFor at least ten years, beginning in 1884, the Old Colonists' Association held a service on or around the anniversary at Ballarat's Eastern Oval in conjunction with its annual charity appeal. There was some reference made to the Eureka Stockade. It was sometimes preceded by a march from the Old Colonists' Hall in Lydiard Street.\nSome of the earliest recorded examples of the Eureka Flag being used as a symbol of white nationalism and trade unionism are from the late 19th century. According to an oral tradition, the Eureka Flag was displayed at a seaman's union protest against using cheap Asian labour on ships at Circular Quay in 1878. In August 1890, the Eureka Flag was draped from a platform in front of a crowd of 30,000 protesters assembled at the Yarra Bank in Melbourne in a show of solidarity with maritime workers. There was a similar flag flown prominently above the camp at Barcaldine during the 1891 Australian shearers' strike.\nIn 1889, Melbourne businessmen employed renowned American cyclorama artist Thaddeus Welch, who teamed up with local artist Izett Watson to paint a canvas of the Eureka Stockade, wrapped around a wooden structure. When it opened in Melbourne, the exhibition was an instant hit. \"The Age\" reported in 1891 that \"it afforded a very good opportunity for people to see what it might have been like at Eureka\". \"The Australasian\" stated, \"that many persons familiar with the incidents depicted, were able to testify to the fidelity of the painted scene\". The people of Melbourne flocked to the cyclorama, paid up and had their picture taken before it. Eventually, it was dismantled and disappeared from sight.\n20th century.\nFor the 50th anniversary in 1904, around sixty veterans gathered for a reunion at the Eureka Stockade memorial with large crowds in attendance. According to one report, there was a procession and \"much cheering and enthusiasm along the line of route, and the old pioneers received a very hearty greeting\". The crowd heard from several speakers, including Ballarat-born Richard Crouch MP, who \"was not at all satisfied that the necessity for revolt had at all ended; in fact, he rather advocated a revolt against conventionalism and political cant\".\nIn 1954, a committee of Ballarat locals was formed to coordinate events to mark the centenary of the Eureka Stockade. Historian Geoffrey Blainey, who was in Ballarat, recalls attending one function and finding that no one apart from a small group of communists was there. There was an oration at the Peter Lalor statue, a procession, a pageant at Sovereign Hill, a concert and dance, a dawn service, and a pilgrimage to the Eureka graves. The procession was headed by mounted police and servicemen from the Royal Australian Airforce base at Ballarat dressed in 1850s soldiers' uniforms. There were centenary commemoration events around Australia held under the auspices of the Communist Party of Australia, which in the 1940s named their youth organisation the Eureka Youth League. Catholic Church affiliates also endorsed a Eureka centenary supplement with commemorative events.\nBallarat's best-known tourist destination, Sovereign Hill, was opened in November 1970 as an open-air museum set in the gold rush period. Since 1992, in commemoration of the Eureka Stockade, Sovereign Hill has featured a 90-minute son et lumi\u00e8re \"Blood Under the Southern Cross\", a sound and light show attraction played under the night skies. It was revised and expanded in 2003. The Eureka Flag was temporarily on display at Sovereign Hill during 1987, while renovation work was being carried out at the Art Gallery of Ballarat.\nIn 1973, Gough Whitlam gave a speech, to mark the largest and most celebrated fragments of the Eureka Flag donated by the descendants of John King going on permanent display at the Art Gallery of Ballarat. He predicted that: \"an event like Eureka, with all its associations, with all its potent symbolism, will acquire an aura of excitement and romance, and stir the imagination of the Australian people\".\nA purpose-built interpretation centre was erected at the cost of $4 million in March 1998 in the suburb of Eureka near the Eureka Stockade memorial. Designed to be a new landmark for Ballarat, it was known as the Eureka Stockade Centre and then the Eureka Centre. The building originally featured an enormous sail emblazoned with the Eureka Flag. Before its development there was considerable debate over whether a replica or reconstruction of wooden structures was appropriate. It was eventually decided against, and this is seen by many as a reason for the apparent failure of the centre to draw significant tourist numbers. Due primarily to falling visitor numbers the \"controversial\" Eureka Centre was redeveloped between 2009 and 2011.\nA life-size bronze sculpture of the Pikeman's dog was unveiled in the courtyard of the interpretative centre at Eureka Stockade Memorial Park on 5 December 1999 in a ceremony that was attended by the Victorian premier Steve Bracks, former prime minister Gough Whitlam, and the Irish ambassador Richard O'Brien.\nIn 2013 it was relaunched as the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka with the aid of a further $5 million in funding from both the Australian and Victorian governments and $1.1 million from the City of Ballarat. The centrepiece of MADE's collection was the \"King\" fragments of the Eureka Flag made available on loan from the Art Gallery of Ballarat, that represent 69.01% of the original specimen. In 2018, the City of Ballarat council resolved to assume responsibility for managing the facility. MADE was closed and since being reopened has been called the Eureka Centre Ballarat.\n21st century.\nIn 2004, the 150th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade was commemorated. In November, the Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks announced that the Ballarat V/Line rail service would be renamed the \"Eureka Line\" to mark the 150th anniversary, taking effect from late 2005 at the same time as the renaming of Spencer Street railway station to Southern Cross. The proposal was criticised by community groups including the Public Transport Users Association.\nRenaming of the line did not go ahead. The Spencer Street Station redesignation was announced in December 2005. Bracks stated that the change would resonate with Victorians because the Southern Cross \"stands for democracy and freedom because it flew over the Eureka Stockade\".\nAn Australian postage stamp featuring the Eureka Flag was released along with a set of commemorative coins. A ceremony in Ballarat known as the lantern walk was held at dawn. Prime Minister John Howard did not attend any commemorative events and refused to allow the Eureka Flag to fly over Parliament House.\nThe Eureka Tower in Melbourne, completed in 2006, is named in honour of the rebellion and features symbolic aspects such as blue glass and white stripes in reference to both the Eureka Flag and a surveyor's measuring staff and a crown of gold glass with a red stripe to represent the blood spilled on the goldfields.\nIn 2014, to mark the 160th anniversary of the Eureka Rebellion, the Australian Flag Society released a commemorative folk cartoon entitled \"Fall Back with the Eureka Jack\" that was inspired by the Eureka Jack mystery.\nIn June 2022, the City of Ballarat, in conjunction with Eureka Australia, unveiled a new Pathway of Remembrance at the Eureka Stockade Memorial Park commemorating the \"35 men who lost their lives during the Eureka Stockade in 1854\".\nPopular culture.\nThe Eureka Rebellion has been the inspiration for numerous novels, poems, films, songs, plays and artworks. Much of the Eureka folklore relies heavily on Raffaello Carboni's 1855 book, \"The Eureka Stockade\", which was the first and only comprehensive eyewitness account of the rebellion. Henry Lawson wrote a number of poems about Eureka, as have many novelists. There have been four motion pictures based on the uprising at Ballarat. The first was \"Eureka Stockade\", a 1907 silent film, the second feature film produced in Australia.\nThere have been a number of plays and songs about the rebellion. The folk song \"German Teddy\" concerns Edward Thonen, one of the rebels who dies defending the Eureka Stockade.\nSee also.\nLists:\nAustralian rebellions:\nGeneral:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9835", "revid": "51043513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9835", "title": "Escape from New York", "text": "1981 film by John Carpenter\nEscape from New York is a 1981 American independent science fiction action film co-written, co-scored, and directed by John Carpenter. It stars Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence, Isaac Hayes, Harry Dean Stanton, and Adrienne Barbeau.\nThe film, set in a then-near-future world of 1997, concerns a crime-ridden United States, which has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country's sole maximum security prison. Air Force One is hijacked by anti-government insurgents who deliberately crash it into the walled-off borough. Former Special Forces and current federal prisoner Snake Plissken (Russell) is given just 24 hours to go in and rescue the President of the United States, after which, if successful, he will be pardoned.\nCarpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the Watergate scandal. After the success of \"Halloween\" (1978), he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in St. Louis, Missouri, on an estimated budget of $6 million. Debra Hill and Larry J. Franco served as the producers. The film was co-written by Nick Castle, who played Michael Myers in \"Halloween\".\nReleased in the United States on July 10, 1981 (coincidentally, another Russell starred film also debuted that day, Disney's \"The Fox and the Hound\") the film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing more than $50 million at the box office. The film was nominated for four Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. The film became a cult classic and was followed by a sequel, \"Escape from L.A.\" (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell.\nPlot.\nIn 1988, amidst war between the United States and an alliance of China and the USSR, Manhattan has been converted into a maximum security prison to address a 400% increase in crime.\nIn 1997, while flying President John Harker to a peace summit in Hartford, Air Force One is hijacked by a terrorist group. The President is handcuffed with a briefcase and put into an escape pod that drops into Manhattan as the aircraft crashes.\nPolice, led by Commissioner Bob Hauk, are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, a subordinate of the Duke of New York (a crime boss), warns Hauk that the President has been captured and will be killed if further rescue attempts are made. Meanwhile, former Special Forces soldier Snake Plissken is about to be imprisoned in Manhattan after being convicted of robbing the Federal Reserve. Snake accepts a deal from Hauk in which he will be pardoned in exchange for rescuing the President in time for the summit. To ensure his cooperation, Hauk has Snake injected with micro-explosives that will sever his carotid arteries in 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.\nSnake uses a stealth glider to land atop the World Trade Center, then follows the President's tracking device to a vaudeville theater, only to find the tracker on the arm of a vagrant. Inspecting the escape pod, Snake is ambushed by starving crazies, and his radio is destroyed. He is rescued by \"Cabbie,\" a jovial character who drives a taxi.\nCabbie takes Snake to Harold \"Brain\" Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake. An engineer, Brain has established a gasoline refinery fueling the city's remaining cars; he tells Snake that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the 69th Street Bridge, using the President as a human shield. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's hideout at Grand Central Terminal. Snake finds the President but gets shot in the leg with a crossbow bolt and is overpowered by the Duke's men.\nWhile Snake is forced to fight Duke's champion Slag in a deathmatch, Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the President. Snake kills Slag and finds the trio trying to escape in the glider. Inmates drop the glider off the roof, forcing the group to street level, where the Duke and his followers confront them. Cabbie arrives and offers to take them across the bridge. He reveals that he bartered with Romero for a cassette tape that contains information about nuclear fusion, intended to be an international peace offering. The President demands the cassette, but Snake refuses to hand it over.\nThe Duke gives chase, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Snake, but they hit a mine, and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain accidentally stumbles onto another mine. A distraught Maggie sacrifices herself to slow the Duke. Snake and the President reach the containment wall, and guards hoist the President up. The Duke opens fire, killing the guards before Snake subdues him. As the rope is lifting Snake, the Duke attempts to shoot him, but the President takes up a dead guard's rifle and kills the Duke. Snake is hoisted to safety, and Hauk's doctor neutralizes the explosives in his neck.\nAs the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he off-handedly thanks Snake for saving him and offers only half-hearted regret for the deaths of his colleagues; Snake walks away in disgust. Hauk offers Snake a job as his deputy, but he keeps walking. The President's speech commences, and he plays the cassette. To his embarrassment, it only plays Cabbie's favorite song, \"Bandstand Boogie\". As Snake walks away free, he pulls the real cassette from his pocket and destroys it.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Kurt Russell as Lieutenant S.D. Bob \"Snake\" Plissken\nProduction.\nDevelopment and writing.\nCarpenter originally wrote the screenplay for \"Escape from New York\" in 1976, in the aftermath of Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, \"The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the president.\" He wrote the screenplay, but no studio wanted to make it because, according to Carpenter, \"[i]t was too violent, too scary, [and] too weird\". He had been inspired by the film \"Death Wish\", which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy, but liked how it conveyed \"the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science-fiction film along these lines\".\nInternational Film Investors agreed to provide 50% of the budget, and Goldcrest Films signed a co-financing deal with them. They ended up providing \u00a3720,000 of the budget and making a profit of \u00a3672,000 from their investment after earning \u00a31,392,000.\nCasting.\nAVCO Embassy Pictures, the film's financial backer, preferred Charles Bronson, Tommy Lee Jones or Chuck Norris to play the role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the \"lightweight\" screen image conveyed by his roles in several Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the film with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as \"a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Eastwood's vocal-ness.\" Russell suggested that the character should wear an eyepatch. All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is \"the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is.\" Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the eyepatch between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception.\nPre-production.\nCarpenter had just made \"Dark Star\", but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making \"Escape\" later. After the success of \"Halloween\", Avco-Embassy signed producer Debra Hill and him to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was \"The Fog\". Initially, the second film he was going to make to finish the contract was \"The Philadelphia Experiment\", but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt something was missing and recalls, \"This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see.\" He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film-school days at University of Southern California, who played \"The Shape\" in \"Halloween\". Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.\nThe film's setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on a shoestring budget. The film's production designer Joe Alves and he rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot, but Alves nixed that idea \"because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot.\" They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), \"on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America,\" producer Debra Hill remembers.\nBernardi suggested East St. Louis, Illinois, because it was filled with old buildings \"that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality\" that the team was looking for. East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, \"block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places, there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away.\" Also, Alves found an old bridge to serve as the \"69th St. Bridge\". The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, \"so that they wouldn't have any liability,\" Hill remembers. Locations across the river in St. Louis were used, including Union Station and the Fox Theatre, both of which have since been renovated, as well as the building that would eventually become the Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery.\nFilming.\nCarpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to 10 blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. \"We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange.\" The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, \"That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [spiked] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape.\" In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system (the latter scenes were cut from the final film). In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. \"We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble\".\nCarpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. \"One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences, which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England\". Certain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, who was at the time a special-effects artist with Roger Corman's New World Pictures. Cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, three screens on his control panel display wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter initially wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light, with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a three-dimensional wireframe animation.\nRelease.\nHome media.\nLaserDisc releases.\n\"Escape from New York\" was released on LaserDisc 10 times between 1983 and 1998. A 1994 Collector's Edition includes a commentary track by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell that is still included on more recent DVD releases of the film.\nDVD releases.\n\"Escape from New York\" was released on DVD twice by MGM (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK). One MGM release is a barebones edition containing just the theatrical trailer. Another version is the Collector's Edition, a two-disc set featuring a high definition remastered transfer with a 5.1 stereo audio track, two commentaries (one by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, another by producer Debra Hill and Joe Alves), a making-of featurette, the first issue of a comic book series titled \"John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles\", and the 10-minute Colorado bank robbery deleted opening sequence.\nMGM's special edition of the 1981 film was not released until 2003 because the original negative had gone missing. The workprint containing deleted scenes finally turned up in a salt-mine film depository in Hutchinson, Kansas. The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: \"After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there.\" The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.\nBlu-ray release.\nOn August 3, 2010, MGM Home Entertainment released \"Escape From New York\" as a bare-bones Blu-ray. Scream Factory, in association with Shout! Factory, released the film on a special edition Blu-ray on April 21, 2015.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Escape from New York\" opened in New York and Los Angeles July 10, 1981. The film grossed $26 million in American theaters in summer 1981. Worldwide it grossed over $50 million.\nCritical response.\nThe film received generally positive reviews. \"Newsweek\" magazine wrote of Carpenter: \"[He has a] deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility\u00a0\u2013 which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however\". In \"Time\" magazine, Richard Corliss wrote, \"John Carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity: to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia. It's a trip worth taking\". Vincent Canby, in his review for \"The New York Times\", wrote, \"[The film] is not to be analyzed too solemnly, though. It's a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season\". On the other hand, in his negative review for the \"Chicago Reader\", critic Dave Kehr, wrote \"it fails to satisfy \u2013 it gives us too little of too much\".\nChristopher John reviewed \"Escape from New York\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #10 and commented that \"It is solid summer entertainment of unusually high caliber. By not pretending to be more than it is, but by also not settling for any \"less\" than it could be, \"Escape\" becomes an exciting, fast-moving drama, the likes of which we haven't seen in years.\"\nC. J. Henderson reviewed \"Escape from New York\" for \"Pegasus\" magazine and stated that \"Word got out that the film was bad. The people who wanted sex and violence stopped going, and the people who would have enjoyed the film said, 'Well, if \"those\" kinds of people aren't going to see it, it must \"really\" be bad,' and stayed home as well.\"\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 72 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis, Escape from New York is a strange, entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 76 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\nLegacy.\nCyberpunk pioneer William Gibson credits the film as an influence on his 1984 science fiction novel \"Neuromancer\". \"I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didn't you?' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot\". Popular video game director Hideo Kojima copied aspects of the film for his \"Metal Gear\" series. Solid Snake heavily resembles the character Snake Plissken. In ', Snake even uses the alias \"Pliskin\" to hide his real identity during most of the game. J. J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film \"Cloverfield\", mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for \"Escape from New York\". \"Empire\" magazine ranked Snake Plissken number 29 in their \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll.\nOther media.\nSequel.\nA sequel, \"Escape from L.A.\", was released in 1996, with Carpenter returning along with Russell, now also a producer and co-writer.\nA remake for \"Escape from New York\" began development in 2007, when New Line Cinema won the rights to remake in a bidding war. Gerard Butler was attached to play Snake Plissken, Neal H. Moritz would produce through his Original Film company, and Ken Nolan would be in charge of the screenplay. Len Wiseman was announced to direct, but was later replaced by Brett Ratner, who also stepped down from the project. In April 2010, \"Variety\" reported that Breck Eisner was being looked at to direct a remake of \"Escape from New York\", with David Kajganich and Allan Loeb providing revisions to the script. It was later announced in 2011 that New Line had dropped the remake completely. In January 2015, 20th Century Fox purchased the remake rights, with The Picture Company producing. In March 2017, it was announced that Robert Rodriguez would direct a remake of the film with Carpenter producing it. In February 2019, it was reported that Leigh Whannell would be writing the script after \"Luther\" creator Neil Cross completed a recent iteration of the project. Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt, was considered to portray Snake Plissken, but he expressed no interest in playing the role, considering it \"career suicide.\" In November 2022, it was revealed that Radio Silence would be directing the film, with Andrew Rona, Alex Heineman, and Radio Silence producing, and Carpenter serving as an executive producer. They are currently searching for a writer. The next month, the film was confirmed to be a sequel, rather than a remake.\nNovelization.\nIn 1981, Bantam Books published a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style reminiscent of the film. The novel includes significant scenes that were cut from the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides background on the relationship between Snake and Hauk\u2014presenting the characters as disillusioned war veterans, and deepening the relationship that was only hinted in the film. The novel also explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazed son, who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel gives greater detail on the world in which these characters live, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. It explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the nation's population is gradually being driven insane by nerve gas as a result of World War III. The novel also clarifies that the president's plan for the cassette tape is not benevolent. Rather than presenting to the world a new energy source in the form of nuclear fusion (as claimed in the film), the tape actually reveals the successful development of a \"fallout-free thermonuclear weapon, which would grant the US supremacy in the global conflict.\nComic books.\nMarvel Comics released the one-shot \"The Adventures of Snake Plissken\" in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between \"Escape from New York\" and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in \"Escape from L.A.\" Snake has robbed Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As ATACS shuts down, it can only ask him, \"Why?\" Snake just walks off, answering, \"I don't need the competition\".\nIn 2003, CrossGen and Hurricane Entertainment published \"John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles\", a four-part comic book miniseries. The story takes place a day or so after the events of \"Escape from New York\". Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of \"Escape from New York\" shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double-crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, \"Captain Ron\"). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob, who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job. The series was written by William O'Neill and penciled by Tone Rodriguez with Jan Utstein as editor.\nIn 2014, BOOM! Studios began publishing an \"Escape from New York\" comic book by writer, Christopher Sebela. The first issue of the series was released on December 3, 2014, and the story picks up moments after the end of the film.\nBOOM! released a crossover comics miniseries between Snake and Jack Burton titled \"Big Trouble in Little China/Escape from New York\" in October 2016.\nBoard games.\nAn \"Escape from New York\" board game was released in 1981 by TSR, Inc. Another board game was crowd-funded in 2022.\nCancelled anime.\nIn 2003, Carpenter was planning an anime spin-off of \"Escape from New York\", with \"Outlaw Star\"'s Mitsuru Hongo slated to direct.\nCancelled video game.\nA video game adaptation was in development in 2004\u20132005.\nUnauthorized remake.\nA 2015 ruling by the French Tribunal de Paris found that the French film \"Lockout\" (2012) had plagiarized both \"Escape from New York\" and its sequel \"Escape from L.A.\" John Carpenter was awarded \u20ac20,000, with co-writer Nick Castle getting \u20ac10,000, and \u20ac50,000 given to rights holder StudioCanal. \"Lockout\"'s writer and producer Luc Besson appealed the ruling, which was rejected in July 2016. The claimant's total damages were increased to \u20ac450,000. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9837", "revid": "47555821", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9837", "title": "Ethylene", "text": "Hydrocarbon compound (H2C=CH2)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nEthylene (IUPAC name: ethene) is a hydrocarbon which has the formula or . It is a colourless, flammable gas with a faint \"sweet and musky\" odour when pure. It is the simplest alkene (a hydrocarbon with carbon\u2013carbon double bonds).\nEthylene is widely used in the chemical industry, and its worldwide production (over 225 million tonnes in 2022) exceeds that of any other organic compound. Much of this production goes toward creating polyethylene, which is a widely used plastic containing polymer chains of ethylene units in various chain lengths. Production emits greenhouse gases, including methane from feedstock production and carbon dioxide from any non-sustainable energy used.\nEthylene is also an important natural plant hormone and is used in agriculture to induce ripening of fruits. The hydrate of ethylene is ethanol.\nStructure and properties.\nThis hydrocarbon has four hydrogen atoms bound to a pair of carbon atoms that are connected by a double bond. All six atoms that comprise ethylene are coplanar. The H-C-H angle is 117.4\u00b0, close to the 120\u00b0 for ideal sp\u00b2 hybridized carbon. The molecule is also relatively weak: rotation about the C-C bond is a very low energy process that requires breaking the \u03c0-bond by supplying heat at 50\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe \u03c0-bond in the ethylene molecule is responsible for its useful reactivity. The double bond is a region of high electron density, thus it is susceptible to attack by electrophiles. Many reactions of ethylene are catalyzed by transition metals, which bind temporarily to the ethylene using both the \u03c0 and \u03c0* orbitals.\nBeing a simple molecule, ethylene is spectroscopically simple. Its UV-vis spectrum is still used as a test of theoretical methods.\nUses.\nMajor industrial reactions of ethylene include in order of scale: 1) polymerization, 2) oxidation, 3) halogenation and hydrohalogenation, 4) alkylation, 5) hydration, 6) oligomerization, and 7) hydroformylation. In the United States and Europe, approximately 90% of ethylene is used to produce ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, ethylbenzene and polyethylene. Most of the reactions with ethylene are electrophilic addition.\nPolymerization.\nPolyethylene production uses more than half of the world's ethylene supply. Polyethylene, also called \"polyethene\" and \"polythene\", is the world's most widely used plastic. It is primarily used to make films in packaging, carrier bags and trash liners. Linear alpha-olefins, produced by oligomerization (formation of short-chain molecules) are used as precursors, detergents, plasticisers, synthetic lubricants, additives, and also as co-monomers in the production of polyethylenes.\nOxidation.\nEthylene is oxidized to produce ethylene oxide, a key raw material in the production of surfactants and detergents by ethoxylation. Ethylene oxide is also hydrolyzed to produce ethylene glycol, widely used as an automotive antifreeze as well as higher molecular weight glycols, glycol ethers, and polyethylene terephthalate.\nEthylene oxidation in the presence of a palladium catalyst can form acetaldehyde. This conversion remains a major industrial process (10M kg/y). The process proceeds via the initial complexation of ethylene to a Pd(II) center.\nHalogenation and hydrohalogenation.\nMajor intermediates from the halogenation and hydrohalogenation of ethylene include ethylene dichloride, ethyl chloride, and ethylene dibromide. The addition of chlorine entails \"oxychlorination\", i.e. chlorine itself is not used. Some products derived from this group are polyvinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, methyl chloroform, polyvinylidene chloride and copolymers, and ethyl bromide.\nAlkylation.\nMajor chemical intermediates from the alkylation with ethylene is ethylbenzene, precursor to styrene. Styrene is used principally in polystyrene for packaging and insulation, as well as in styrene-butadiene rubber for tires and footwear. On a smaller scale, ethyltoluene, ethylanilines, 1,4-hexadiene, and aluminium alkyls. Products of these intermediates include polystyrene, unsaturated polyesters and ethylene-propylene terpolymers.\nOxo reaction.\nThe hydroformylation (oxo reaction) of ethylene results in propionaldehyde, a precursor to propionic acid and n-propyl alcohol.\nHydration.\nEthylene has long represented the major non-fermentative precursor to ethanol. The original method entailed its conversion to diethyl sulfate, followed by hydrolysis. The main method practiced since the mid-1990s is the direct hydration of ethylene catalyzed by solid acid catalysts:\nC2H4 + H2O \u2192 CH3CH2OH\nDimerization to butenes.\nEthylene is dimerized by hydrovinylation to give \"n\"-butenes using processes licensed by Lummus or IFP. The Lummus process produces mixed \"n\"-butenes (primarily 2-butenes) while the IFP process produces 1-butene. 1-Butene is used as a comonomer in the production of certain kinds of polyethylene.\nFruit and flowering.\nEthylene is a hormone that affects the ripening and flowering of many plants. It is widely used to control freshness in horticulture and fruits. The scrubbing of naturally occurring ethylene delays ripening. Adsorption of ethylene by nets coated in titanium dioxide gel has also been shown to be effective.\nNiche uses.\nAn example of a niche use is as an anesthetic agent (in an 85% ethylene/15% oxygen ratio). It is also used as a refrigerant gas for low temperature applications under the name R-1150.\nProduction.\nGlobal ethylene production was 107 million tonnes in 2005, 109 million tonnes in 2006, 138 million tonnes in 2010, and 141 million tonnes in 2011. By 2013, ethylene was produced by at least 117 companies in 32 countries. To meet the ever-increasing demand for ethylene, sharp increases in production facilities are added globally, particularly in the Mideast and in China. Production emits greenhouse gas, namely significant amounts of carbon dioxide.\nIndustrial process.\nEthylene is produced by several methods in the petrochemical industry. A primary method is steam cracking (SC) where hydrocarbons and steam are heated to 750\u2013950\u00a0\u00b0C. This process converts large hydrocarbons into smaller ones and introduces unsaturation. When ethane is the feedstock, ethylene is the product. Ethylene is separated from the resulting mixture by repeated compression and distillation. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking naphtha, gasoil and condensates with the coproduction of propylene, C4 olefins and aromatics (pyrolysis gasoline). Other procedures employed for the production of ethylene include Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and methanol-to-olefins (MTO).\nLaboratory synthesis.\nAlthough of great value industrially, ethylene is rarely synthesized in the laboratory and is ordinarily purchased. It can be produced via dehydration of ethanol with sulfuric acid or in the gas phase with aluminium oxide or activated alumina.\nBiosynthesis.\nEthylene is produced from methionine in nature. The immediate precursor is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid.\nLigand.\nEthylene is a fundamental ligand in transition metal alkene complexes. One of the first organometallic compounds, Zeise's salt is a complex of ethylene. Useful reagents containing ethylene include Pt(PPh3)2(C2H4) and Rh2Cl2(C2H4)4. The Rh-catalysed hydroformylation of ethylene is conducted on an industrial scale to provide propionaldehyde.\nHistory.\nSome geologists and scholars believe that the famous Greek Oracle at Delphi (the Pythia) went into her trance-like state as an effect of ethylene rising from ground faults.\nEthylene appears to have been discovered by Johann Joachim Becher, who obtained it by heating ethanol with sulfuric acid; he mentioned the gas in his \"Physica Subterranea\" (1669). Joseph Priestley also mentions the gas in his \"Experiments and observations relating to the various branches of natural philosophy: with a continuation of the observations on air\" (1779), where he reports that Jan Ingenhousz saw ethylene synthesized in the same way by a Mr. En\u00e9e in Amsterdam in 1777 and that Ingenhousz subsequently produced the gas himself. The properties of ethylene were studied in 1795 by four Dutch chemists, Johann Rudolph Deimann, Adrien Paets van Troostwyck, Anthoni Lauwerenburgh and Nicolas Bondt, who found that it differed from hydrogen gas and that it contained both carbon and hydrogen. This group also discovered that ethylene could be combined with chlorine to produce the \"Dutch oil\", 1,2-dichloroethane; this discovery gave ethylene the name used for it at that time, \"olefiant gas\" (oil-making gas.) The term olefiant gas is in turn the etymological origin of the modern word \"olefin\", the class of hydrocarbons in which ethylene is the first member.\nIn the mid-19th century, the suffix \"-ene\" (an Ancient Greek root added to the end of female names meaning \"daughter of\") was widely used to refer to a molecule or part thereof that contained one fewer hydrogen atoms than the molecule being modified. Thus, \"ethylene\" (C2H4) was the \"daughter of ethyl\" (C2H5). The name ethylene was used in this sense as early as 1852.\nIn 1866, the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann proposed a system of hydrocarbon nomenclature in which the suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to denote the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogens than their parent alkane. In this system, ethylene became \"ethene\". Hofmann's system eventually became the basis for the Geneva nomenclature approved by the International Congress of Chemists in 1892, which remains at the core of the IUPAC nomenclature. However, by that time, the name ethylene was deeply entrenched, and it remains in wide use today, especially in the chemical industry.\nFollowing experimentation by Luckhardt, Crocker, and Carter at the University of Chicago, ethylene was used as an anesthetic. It remained in use through the 1940s, even while chloroform was being phased out. Its pungent odor and its explosive nature limit its use today.\nNomenclature.\nThe 1979 IUPAC nomenclature rules made an exception for retaining the non-systematic name \"ethylene\"; however, this decision was reversed in the 1993 rules, and it remains unchanged in the newest 2013 recommendations, so the IUPAC name is now \"ethene\". In the IUPAC system, the name \"ethylene\" is reserved for the divalent group -CH2CH2-. Hence, names like \"ethylene oxide\" and \"ethylene dibromide\" are permitted, but the use of the name \"ethylene\" for the two-carbon alkene is not. Nevertheless, use of the name \"ethylene\" for H2C=CH2 (and propylene for H2C=CHCH3) is still prevalent among chemists in North America.\nSafety.\nLike all hydrocarbons, ethylene is a combustible asphyxiant. It is listed as an IARC group 3 agent, since there is no current evidence that it causes cancer in humans.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 2005, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released a technical standard for Eiffel.\nThe design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method. Both are based on a set of principles, including design by contract, command\u2013query separation, the uniform-access principle, the single-choice principle, the open\u2013closed principle, and option\u2013operand separation.\nMany concepts initially introduced by Eiffel were later added into Java, C#, and other languages. New language design ideas, particularly through the Ecma/ISO standardization process, continue to be incorporated into the Eiffel language.\nCharacteristics.\nThe key characteristics of the Eiffel language include:\nDesign goals.\nEiffel emphasizes declarative statements over procedural code and attempts to eliminate the need for bookkeeping instructions.\nEiffel shuns coding tricks or techniques intended as program optimization hints to a compiler. The goals are to make the code more readable, and to facilitate concentrating on the important aspects of a program without getting bogged down in implementation details. Eiffel's simplicity is intended to promote simple, extensible, reusable, and reliable answers to computing problems. Compilers for computer programs written in Eiffel provide extensive optimizing techniques, such as automatic inline expansion (inlining), that eliminate part of the optimizing burden.\nBackground.\nEiffel was originally developed by Eiffel Software, a company founded by Bertrand Meyer. \"Object-Oriented Software Construction\" contains a detailed treatment of the concepts and theory of the object technology that led to Eiffel's design.\nThe design goal behind the Eiffel language, libraries, and programming methods is to enable programmers to create reliable, reusable software modules. Eiffel supports multiple inheritance, genericity, polymorphism, encapsulation, type-safe conversions, and parameter covariance. Eiffel's most important contribution to software engineering is design by contract (DbC), in which assertions, preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants are employed to help ensure program correctness without sacrificing efficiency.\nEiffel's design is based on object-oriented programming theory, with only minor influence of other programming paradigms or concern for support of legacy code. Eiffel formally supports abstract data types. Under Eiffel's design, a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself, using a formalized implementation of the \"Abstract Data Type\".\nImplementations and environments.\nEiffelStudio is an integrated development environment available under either an open source or a commercial license. It offers an object-oriented environment for software engineering. EiffelEnvision is a plug-in for Microsoft Visual Studio that allows users to edit, compile, and debug Eiffel projects from within the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Five other open source implementations are available: \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp; Gobo Eiffel; SmartEiffel, the GNU implementation, based on an older version of the language; LibertyEiffel, based on the SmartEiffel compiler; and Visual Eiffel.\nSeveral other programming languages incorporate elements first introduced in Eiffel. Sather, for example, was originally based on Eiffel but has since diverged, and now includes several functional programming features. The interactive-teaching language Blue, forerunner of BlueJ, is also Eiffel-based. The Apple Media Tool includes an Eiffel-based Apple Media Language.\nSpecifications and standards.\nThe Eiffel language definition is an international standard of the ISO. The standard was developed by ECMA International, which first approved the standard on 21 June 2005 as Standard ECMA-367, Eiffel: Analysis, Design and Programming Language. In June 2006, ECMA and ISO adopted the second version. In November 2006, ISO first published that version. The standard can be found and used free of charge on the ECMA site. The ISO version is identical in all respects except formatting.\nEiffel Software, \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp and Eiffel-library-developer Gobo have committed to implementing the standard; Eiffel Software's EiffelStudio 6.1 and \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp implement some of the major new mechanisms\u2014in particular, inline agents, assigner commands, bracket notation, non-conforming inheritance, and attached types. The SmartEiffel team has turned away from this standard to create its own version of the language, which they believe to be closer to the original style of Eiffel. Object Tools has not disclosed whether future versions of its Eiffel compiler will comply with the standard. LibertyEiffel implements a dialect somewhere in between the SmartEiffel language and the standard.\nThe standard cites the following, predecessor Eiffel-language specifications:\nThe current version of the standard from June 2006 contains some inconsistencies (e.g. covariant redefinitions). The ECMA committee has not yet announced any timeline and direction on how to resolve the inconsistencies.\nSyntax and semantics.\nOverall structure.\nAn Eiffel \"system\" or \"program\" is a collection of \"classes\". Above the level of classes, Eiffel defines \"cluster\", which is essentially a group of classes, and possibly of \"subclusters\" (nested clusters). Clusters are not a syntactic language construct, but rather a standard organizational convention. Typically an Eiffel program will be organized with each class in a separate file, and each cluster in a directory containing class files. In this organization, subclusters are subdirectories. For example, under standard organizational and casing conventions, codice_1 might be the name of a file that defines a class called X.\nA class contains \"features\", which are similar to \"routines\", \"members\", \"attributes\" or \"methods\" in other object-oriented programming languages. A class also defines its invariants, and contains other properties, such as a \"notes\" section for documentation and metadata. Eiffel's standard data types, such as codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4, are all themselves classes.\nEvery system must have a class designated as \"root\", with one of its creation procedures designated as \"root procedure\". Executing a system consists of creating an instance of the root class and executing its root procedure. Generally, doing so creates new objects, calls new features, and so on.\nEiffel has five basic executable instructions: assignment, object creation, routine call, condition, and iteration. Eiffel's control structures are strict in enforcing structured programming: every block has exactly one entry and exactly one exit.\nScoping.\nUnlike many object-oriented languages, but like Smalltalk, Eiffel does not permit any assignment into attributes of objects, except within the features of an object, which is the practical application of the principle of information hiding or data abstraction, requiring formal interfaces for data mutation. To put it in the language of other object-oriented programming languages, all Eiffel attributes are \"protected\", and \"setters\" are needed for client objects to modify values. An upshot of this is that \"setters\" can and normally do, implement the invariants for which Eiffel provides syntax.\nWhile Eiffel does not allow direct access to the features of a class by a client of the class, it does allow for the definition of an \"assigner command\", such as:\n some_attribute: SOME_TYPE assign set_some_attribute\n set_some_attribute (v: VALUE_TYPE)\n -- Set value of some_attribute to `v'.\n do\n some_attribute := v\n end\nWhile a slight bow to the overall developer community to allow something looking like direct access (e.g. thereby breaking the Information Hiding Principle), the practice is dangerous as it hides or obfuscates the reality of a \"setter\" being used. In practice, it is better to redirect the call to a setter rather than implying a direct access to a feature like codice_5 as in the example code above.\nUnlike other languages, having notions of \"public\", \"protected\", \"private\" and so on, Eiffel uses an exporting technology to more precisely control the scoping between client and supplier classes. Feature visibility is checked statically at compile-time. For example, (below), the \"{NONE}\" is similar to \"protected\" in other languages. Scope applied this way to a \"feature set\" (e.g. everything below the 'feature' keyword to either the next feature set keyword or the end of the class) can be changed in descendant classes using the \"export\" keyword.\nfeature {NONE} -- Initialization\n default_create\n -- Initialize a new `zero' decimal instance.\n do\n make_zero\n end\nAlternatively, the lack of a {x} export declaration implies {ANY} and is similar to the \"public\" scoping of other languages.\nfeature -- Constants\nFinally, scoping can be selectively and precisely controlled to any class in the Eiffel project universe, such as:\nfeature {DECIMAL, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_PARSER, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_HANDLER} -- Access\nHere, the compiler will allow only the classes listed between the curly braces to access the features within the feature group (e.g. DECIMAL, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_PARSER, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_HANDLER).\n\"Hello, world!\".\nA programming language's look and feel is often conveyed using a \"Hello, world!\" program. Such a program written in Eiffel might be:\nclass\n HELLO_WORLD\ncreate\n make\nfeature\n make\n do\n print (\"Hello, world!%N\")\n end\nend \nThis program contains the class codice_6. The constructor (create routine) for the class, named codice_7, invokes the codice_8 system library routine to write a codice_9\u00a0codice_10 message to the output.\nDesign by contract.\nThe concept of Design by Contract is central to Eiffel. The contracts assert what must be true before a routine is executed (precondition) and what must hold to be true after the routine finishes (post-condition). Class Invariant contracts define what assertions must hold true both before and after any feature of a class is accessed (both routines and attributes). Moreover, contracts codify into executable code developer and designers assumptions about the operating environment of the features of a class or the class as a whole by means of the invariant.\nThe Eiffel compiler is designed to include the feature and class contracts in various levels. EiffelStudio, for example, executes all feature and class contracts during execution in the \"Workbench mode.\" When an executable is created, the compiler is instructed by way of the project settings file (e.g. ECF file) to either include or exclude any set of contracts. Thus, an executable file can be compiled to either include or exclude any level of contract, thereby bringing along continuous levels of unit and integration testing. Moreover, contracts can be continually and methodically exercised by way of the Auto-Test feature found in EiffelStudio.\nThe Design by Contract mechanisms are tightly integrated with the language and guide redefinition of features in inheritance:\nIn addition, the language supports a \"check instruction\" (a kind of \"assert\"), loop invariants, and loop variants (which guarantee loop termination).\nVoid-safe capability.\nVoid-safe ability, like static typing, is another facility for improving software quality. Void-safe software is protected from runtime errors caused by calls to void references, and therefore will be more reliable than software in which calls to void targets can occur. The analogy to static typing is a useful one. Void-safe ability can be seen as an extension to the type system, or a step beyond static typing, because the mechanism for ensuring void safety is integrated into the type system.\nThe guard against void target calls can be seen by way of the notion of attachment and (by extension) detachment (e.g. detachable keyword). The void-safe facility can be seen in a short re-work of the example code used above:\n some_attribute: detachable SOME_TYPE\n use_some_attribute\n -- Set value of some_attribute to `v'.\n do\n if attached some_attribute as l_attribute then\n do_something (l_attribute)\n end\n end\n do_something (a_value: SOME_TYPE)\n -- Do something with `a_value'.\n do\n ... doing something with `a_value' ...\n end\nThe code example above shows how the compiler can statically address the reliability of whether codice_5 will be attached or detached at the point it is used. Notably, the codice_12 keyword allows for an \"attachment local\" (e.g. codice_13), which is scoped to only the block of code enclosed by the if-statement construct. Thus, within this small block of code, the local variable (e.g. codice_13) can be statically guaranteed to be non-void (i.e. void safe).\nFeatures: commands and queries.\nThe primary characteristic of a class is that it defines a set of features: as a class represents a set of run-time objects, or \"instances\", a feature is an operation on these objects. There are two kinds of features: queries and commands. A query provides information about an instance. A command modifies an instance.\nThe command-query distinction is important to the Eiffel method. In particular:\nOverloading.\nEiffel does not allow argument overloading. Each feature name within a class always maps to a specific feature within the class. One name, within one class, means one thing. This design choice helps the readability of classes, by avoiding a cause of ambiguity about which routine will be invoked by a call. It also simplifies the language mechanism; in particular, this is what makes Eiffel's multiple inheritance mechanism possible.\nNames can, of course, be reused in different classes. For example, the feature plus (along with its infix alias \"+\") is defined in several classes: INTEGER, REAL, STRING, etc.\nGenericity.\nA generic class is a class that varies by type (e.g. LIST [PHONE], a list of phone numbers; ACCOUNT [G-&gt;ACCOUNT_TYPE], allowing for ACCOUNT [SAVINGS] and ACCOUNT [CHECKING], etc.). Classes can be generic, to express that they are parameterized by types. Generic parameters appear in square brackets:\nclass LIST [G] ...\nG is known as a \"formal generic parameter\". (Eiffel reserves \"argument\" for routines, and uses \"parameter\" only for generic classes.) With such a declaration G represents within the class an arbitrary type; so a function can return a value of type G, and a routine can take an argument of that type:\nitem: G do ... end\nput (x: G) do ... end\nThe codice_17 and codice_18 are \"generic derivations\" of this class. Permitted combinations (with codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22) are:\nn := il.item\nwl.put (w)\ncodice_2 and codice_24 are the \"actual generic parameters\" in these generic derivations.\nIt is also possible to have 'constrained' formal parameters, for which the actual parameter must inherit from a given class, the \"constraint\". For example, in\n class HASH_TABLE [G, KEY -&gt; HASHABLE]\na derivation codice_25 is valid only if codice_3 inherits from codice_27 (as it indeed does in typical Eiffel libraries). Within the class, having codice_28 constrained by codice_27 means that for codice_30 it is possible to apply to codice_31 all the features of codice_27, as in codice_33.\nInheritance basics.\nTo inherit from one or more others, a class will include an codice_34 clause at the beginning:\nclass C inherit\n A\n B\n-- ... Rest of class declaration ...\nThe class may redefine (override) some or all of the inherited features. This must be explicitly announced at the beginning of the class through a codice_35 subclause of the inheritance clause, as in\nclass C inherit\n A\n redefine f, g, h end\n B\n redefine u, v end\nSee for a complete discussion of Eiffel inheritance.\nDeferred classes and features.\nClasses may be defined with codice_36 rather than with codice_37 to indicate that the class may not be directly instantiated. Non-instantiatable classes are called abstract classes in some other object-oriented programming languages. In Eiffel parlance, only an \"effective\" class can be instantiated (it may be a descendant of a deferred class). A feature can also be deferred by using the codice_38 keyword in place of a codice_39 clause. If a class has any deferred features it must be declared as deferred; however, a class with no deferred features may nonetheless itself be deferred.\nDeferred classes play some of the same role as interfaces in languages such as Java, though many object-oriented programming theorists believe interfaces are themselves largely an answer to Java's lack of multiple inheritance (which Eiffel has).\nRenaming.\nA class that inherits from one or more others gets all its features, by default under their original names. It may, however, change their names through codice_40 clauses. This is required in the case of multiple inheritance if there are name clashes between inherited features; without renaming, the resulting class would violate the no-overloading principle noted above and hence would be invalid.\nTuples.\nTuples types may be viewed as a simple form of class, providing only attributes and the corresponding \"setter\" procedure. A typical tuple type reads\n TUPLE [name: STRING; weight: REAL; date: DATE]\nand could be used to describe a simple notion of birth record if a class is not needed. An instance of such a tuple is simply a sequence of values with the given types, given in brackets, such as\n [\"Brigitte\", 3.5, Last_night]\nComponents of such a tuple can be accessed as if the tuple tags were attributes of a class, for example if codice_41 has been assigned the above tuple then codice_42 has value 3.5.\nThanks to the notion of assigner command (see below), dot notation can also be used to assign components of such a tuple, as in\n t.weight := t.weight + 0.5\nThe tuple tags are optional, so that it is also possible to write a tuple type as codice_43. (In some compilers this is the only form of tuple, as tags were introduced with the ECMA standard.)\nThe precise specification of e.g. codice_44 is that it describes sequences of \"at least\" three elements, the first three being of types codice_45, codice_46, codice_47 respectively. As a result, codice_44 conforms to (may be assigned to) codice_49, to codice_50 and to codice_51 (without parameters), the topmost tuple type to which all tuple types conform.\nAgents.\nEiffel's \"agent\" mechanism wraps operations into objects. This mechanism can be used for iteration, event-driven programming, and other contexts in which it is useful to pass operations around the program structure. Other programming languages, especially ones that emphasize functional programming, allow a similar pattern using continuations, closures, or generators; Eiffel's agents emphasize the language's object-oriented paradigm, and use a syntax and semantics similar to code blocks in Smalltalk and Ruby.\nFor example, to execute the codice_52 block for each element of codice_53, one would write:\n my_list.do_all (agent my_action)\nTo execute codice_52 only on elements satisfying codice_55, a limitation/filter can be added:\n my_list.do_if (agent my_action, agent my_condition)\nIn these examples, codice_52 and codice_55 are routines. Prefixing them with codice_58 yields an object that represents the corresponding routine with all its properties, in particular the ability to be called with the appropriate arguments. So if codice_59 represents that object (for example because codice_59 is the argument to codice_61), the instruction\n a.call ([x])\nwill call the original routine with the argument codice_31, as if we had directly called the original routine: codice_63. Arguments to codice_64 are passed as a tuple, here codice_65.\nIt is possible to keep some arguments to an agent open and make others closed. The open arguments are passed as arguments to codice_64: they are provided at the time of \"agent use\". The closed arguments are provided at the time of agent \"definition\". For example, if codice_67 has two arguments, the iteration\n my_list.do_all (agent action2 (?, y))\niterates codice_68 for successive values of codice_31, where the second argument remains set to codice_70. The question mark codice_71 indicates an open argument; codice_70 is a closed argument of the agent. Note that the basic syntax codice_73 is a shorthand for codice_74 with all arguments open. It is also possible to make the \"target\" of an agent open through the notation codice_75 where codice_76 is the type of the target.\nThe distinction between open and closed operands (operands = arguments + target) corresponds to the distinction between bound and free variables in lambda calculus. An agent expression such as codice_77 with some operands closed and some open corresponds to a version of the original operation \"curried\" on the closed operands.\nThe agent mechanism also allows defining an agent without reference to an existing routine (such as codice_52, codice_55, codice_67), through inline agents as in\nmy_list.do_all (agent (s: STRING)\n require\n not_void: s /= Void\n do\n s.append_character (',')\n ensure\n appended: s.count = old s.count + 1\n end)\nThe inline agent passed here can have all the trappings of a normal routine, including precondition, postcondition, rescue clause (not used here), and a full signature. This avoids defining routines when all that's needed is a computation to be wrapped in an agent. This is useful in particular for contracts, as in an invariant clause that expresses that all elements of a list are positive:\n my_list.for_all (agent (x: INTEGER): BOOLEAN do Result := (x &gt; 0) end)\nThe current agent mechanism leaves a possibility of run-time type error (if a routine with \"n\" arguments is passed to an agent expecting \"m\" arguments with \"m\" &lt; \"n\"). This can be avoided by a run-time check through the precondition codice_81 of codice_64. Several proposals for a purely static correction of this problem are available, including a language change proposal by Ribet et al.\nOnce routines.\nA routine's result can be cached using the codice_83 keyword in place of codice_39. Non-first calls to a routine require no additional computation or resource allocation, but simply return a previously computed result. A common pattern for \"once functions\" is to provide shared objects; the first call will create the object, subsequent ones will return the reference to that object. The typical scheme is:\nshared_object: SOME_TYPE\n once\n create Result.make (args)\n -- This creates the object and returns a reference to it through `Result'.\n end\nThe returned object\u2014codice_85 in the example\u2014can itself be mutable, but its reference remains the same.\nOften \"once routines\" perform a required initialization: multiple calls to a library can include a call to the initialization procedure, but only the first such call will perform the required actions. Using this pattern initialization can be decentralized, avoiding the need for a special initialization module. \"Once routines\" are similar in purpose and effect to the singleton pattern in many programming languages, and to the used in Python.\nBy default, a \"once routine\" is called \"once per thread\". The semantics can be adjusted to \"once per process\" or \"once per object\" by qualifying it with a \"once key\", e.g. codice_86.\nConversions.\nEiffel provides a mechanism to allow conversions between various types. The mechanisms coexists with inheritance and complements it. To avoid any confusion between the two mechanisms, the design enforces the following principle:\n (Conversion principle) A type may not both conform and convert to another.\nFor example, codice_87 may conform to codice_88, but codice_2 converts to codice_90 (and does not inherit from it).\nThe conversion mechanism simply generalizes the ad hoc conversion rules (such as indeed between codice_2 and codice_90) that exist in most programming languages, making them applicable to any type as long as the above principle is observed. For example, a codice_93 class may be declared to convert to codice_3; this makes it possible to create a string from a date simply through\n my_string := my_date\nas a shortcut for using an explicit object creation with a conversion procedure:\n create my_string.make_from_date (my_date)\nTo make the first form possible as a synonym for the second, it suffices to list the creation procedure (constructor) codice_95 in a codice_96 clause at the beginning of the class.\nAs another example, if there is such a conversion procedure listed from codice_97, then one can directly assign a tuple to a date, causing the appropriate conversion, as in\n Bastille_day := [14, \"July\", 1789]\nException handling.\nException handling in Eiffel is based on the principles of design by contract. For example, an exception occurs when a routine's caller fails to satisfy a precondition, or when a routine cannot ensure a promised postcondition. In Eiffel, exception handling is not used for control flow or to correct data-input mistakes.\nAn Eiffel exception handler is defined using the rescue keyword. Within the rescue section, the retry keyword executes the routine again. For example, the following routine tracks the number of attempts at executing the routine, and only retries a certain number of times:\nconnect_to_server (server: SOCKET)\n -- Connect to a server or give up after 10 attempts.\n require\n server /= Void and then server.address /= Void\n local\n attempts: INTEGER\n do\n server.connect\n ensure\n connected: server.is_connected\n rescue\n if attempts &lt; 10 then\n attempts := attempts + 1\n retry\n end\n end\nThis example is arguably flawed for anything but the simplest programs, however, because connection failure is to be expected. For most programs a routine name like attempt_connecting_to_server would be better, and the postcondition would not promise a connection, leaving it up to the caller to take appropriate steps if the connection was not opened.\nConcurrency.\nA number of networking and threading libraries are available, such as EiffelNet and EiffelThreads. A concurrency model for Eiffel, based on the concepts of design by contract, is SCOOP, or \"Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming\", not yet part of the official language definition but available in EiffelStudio. CAMEO is an (unimplemented) variation of SCOOP for Eiffel. Concurrency also interacts with exceptions. Asynchronous exceptions can be troublesome (where a routine raises an exception after its caller has itself finished).\nOperator and bracket syntax, assigner commands.\nEiffel's view of computation is completely object-oriented in the sense that every operation is relative to an object, the \"target\". So for example an addition such as\na + b\nis conceptually understood as if it were the method call\na.plus (b)\nwith target codice_59, feature codice_99 and argument codice_100.\nOf course, the former is the conventional syntax and usually preferred. Operator syntax makes it possible to use either form by declaring the feature (for example in codice_2, but this applies to other basic classes and can be used in any other for which such an operator is appropriate):\nplus alias \"+\" (other: INTEGER): INTEGER\n -- ... Normal function declaration...\n end\nThe range of operators that can be used as \"alias\" is quite broad; they include predefined operators such as \"+\" but also \"free operators\" made of non-alphanumeric symbols. This makes it possible to design special infix and prefix notations, for example in mathematics and physics applications.\nEvery class may in addition have \"one\" function aliased to \"[]\", the \"bracket\" operator, allowing the notation codice_102 as a synonym for codice_103 where codice_104 is the chosen function. This is particularly useful for container structures such as arrays, hash tables, lists etc. For example, access to an element of a hash table with string keys can be written\n number := phone_book [\"JILL SMITH\"]\n\"Assigner commands\" are a companion mechanism designed in the same spirit of allowing well-established, convenient notation reinterpreted in the framework of object-oriented programming. Assigner commands allow assignment-like syntax to call \"setter\" procedures. An assignment proper can never be of the form codice_105 as this violates information hiding; you have to go for a setter command (procedure). For example, the hash table class can have the function and the procedure\nitem alias \"[]\" (key: STRING): ELEMENT [3]\n -- The element of key `key'.\n -- (\"Getter\" query)\n do\n end\nput (e: ELEMENT; key: STRING)\n -- Insert the element `e', associating it with the key `key'.\n -- (\"Setter\" command)\n do\n end\nThen to insert an element you have to use an explicit call to the setter command:\n [4] phone_book.put (New_person, \"JILL SMITH\")\nIt is possible to write this equivalently as\n [5] phone_book [\"JILL SMITH\"] := New_person\n(in the same way that codice_106 is a synonym for codice_107), provided the declaration of codice_108 now starts (replacement for [3]) with\n item alias \"[]\" (key: STRING): ELEMENT assign put\nThis declares codice_109 as the assigner command associated with codice_108 and, combined with the bracket alias, makes [5] legal and equivalent to [4]. (It could also be written, without taking advantage of the bracket, as codice_111.\nNote: The argument list of a's assigner is constrained to be: (a's return type;all of a's argument list...)\nLexical and syntax properties.\nEiffel is not case-sensitive. The tokens codice_7, codice_113 and codice_114 all denote the same identifier. See, however, the \"style rules\" below.\nComments are introduced by codice_115 (two consecutive dashes) and extend to the end of the line.\nThe semicolon, as instruction separator, is optional. Most of the time the semicolon is just omitted, except to separate multiple instructions on a line. This results in less clutter on the program page.\nThere is no nesting of feature and class declarations. As a result, the structure of an Eiffel class is simple: some class-level clauses (inheritance, invariant) and a succession of feature declarations, all at the same level.\nIt is customary to group features into separate \"feature clauses\" for more readability, with a standard set of basic feature tags appearing in a standard order, for example:\nclass HASH_TABLE [ELEMENT, KEY -&gt; HASHABLE] inherit TABLE [ELEMENT]\n feature -- Initialization\n -- ... Declarations of initialization commands (creation procedures/constructors) ...\n feature -- Access\n -- ... Declarations of non-Boolean queries on the object state, e.g. item ...\n feature -- Status report\n -- ... Declarations of Boolean queries on the object state, e.g. is_empty ...\n feature -- Element change\n -- ... Declarations of commands that change the structure, e.g. put ...\n -- etc.\nend\nIn contrast to most curly bracket programming languages, Eiffel makes a clear distinction between expressions and instructions. This is in line with the Command-Query Separation principle of the Eiffel method.\nStyle conventions.\nMuch of the documentation of Eiffel uses distinctive style conventions, designed to enforce a consistent look-and-feel. Some of these conventions apply to the code format itself, and others to the standard typographic rendering of Eiffel code in formats and publications where these conventions are possible.\nWhile the language is case-insensitive, the style standards prescribe the use of all-capitals for class names (codice_116), all-lower-case for feature names (codice_7), and initial capitals for constants (codice_118). The recommended style also suggests underscore to separate components of a multi-word identifier, as in codice_119.\nThe specification of Eiffel includes guidelines for displaying software texts in typeset formats: keywords in bold, user-defined identifiers and constants are shown in \"codice_120\", comments, operators, and punctuation marks in codice_121, with program text in codice_122 as in the present article to distinguish it from explanatory text. For example, the \"Hello, world!\" program given above would be rendered as below in Eiffel documentation:\nclass\n HELLO_WORLD\ncreate\n make\nfeature\n make\n do\n print (\"Hello, world!\")\n end\nend\nInterfaces to other tools and languages.\nEiffel is a purely object-oriented language but provides an open architecture for interfacing with \"external\" software in any other programming language.\nIt is possible for example to program machine- and operating-system level operations in C. Eiffel provides a straightforward interface to C routines, including support for \"inline C\" (writing the body of an Eiffel routine in C, typically for short machine-level operations).\nThere is no direct connection between Eiffel and C. However, many Eiffel compilers (Visual Eiffel is one exception) emit C source code as an intermediate language, to submit to a C compiler, for optimizing or porting. As such, they are examples of transcompilers. The Eiffel Compiler tecomp can execute Eiffel code directly (like an interpreter) without going via an intermediate C code or emit C code which will be passed to a C compiler to obtain optimized native code. On .NET, the EiffelStudio compiler directly generates Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code. The SmartEiffel compiler can also emit Java bytecode.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is regarded as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church, which sets his feast day as July 13, the same as that of his contemporary, Nehemiah. He is also venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, which sets his feast day on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers.\nThere is no historical consensus on Ezra\u2019s existence or mission due to a lack of extrabiblical evidence and conflicting scholarly interpretations, ranging from viewing him as a historical Aramean official to a literary figure, with debates hinging on the authenticity of the Artaxerxes rescript and its dating.\nLife.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nThe canonical Book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah are the oldest sources for the activity of Ezra. Many of the other books ascribed to Ezra (First Esdras, 3\u20136 Ezra) are later literary works dependent on the canonical books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The book of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah was always written as one scroll.\nIn late medieval Christian Bibles, the single book was divided into two, as First and Second Ezra. This division became Jewish practice in the first printed Hebrew bibles. Modern Hebrew Bibles call the two books Ezra and Nehemiah, as do other modern Bible translations. A few parts of the Book of Ezra (4:8 to 6:18 and 7:12\u201326) were written in Aramaic, and the majority in Hebrew, Ezra himself being skilled in both languages.\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah, the last High Priest to serve in Solomon's Temple, and a close relative of Joshua, the first High Priest of the Second Temple. He returned from Babylonian captivity and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem. According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodox Church, he was also a High Priest. Rabbinic Judaism supports the positions that Ezra was an ordinary member of the priesthood and that he served as a High Priest of Israel.\nin the seventh year of Artaxerxes I, the Achaemenid emperor (c.\u2009457 BCE) sent Ezra from Babylon to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them. The Book of Ezra describes how he led a group of Judean exiles living in Babylon to their home city of Jerusalem where he is said to have enforced observance of the Torah.\nWhen Ezra discovered that Jewish men had been marrying foreign pagan women, he tore his garments in despair. He confessed the sins of Israel before God, then braved the opposition of some of his countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. He was described as exhorting the Israelite people to be sure to follow the Torah Law so as not to intermarry with people of foreign blood, a set of commandments described in the Torah. Some years later, Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah, a Jewish noble in his service, as governor in Jerusalem with the task of rebuilding the city walls. Once this task was completed, Nehemiah had Ezra read the Torah to the assembled Israelites and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.\nBurial place.\nSeveral traditions have developed over his place of burial. One tradition says that he is buried in Ezra's Tomb near Basra, Iraq while another tradition alleges that he is buried in Tadef near Aleppo in northern Syria.\nAccording to Josephus, Ezra died and was buried \"in a magnificent manner in Jerusalem.\" If the tradition that Ezra wrote under the pen name \"Malachi\" is correct, then he was probably buried in the Tomb of the Prophets, the traditional resting place of Malachi, along with two other prophets from Ezra's lifetime, Haggai and Zechariah. However, according to archeological research, these tombs date from the 1 century BC.\nIn later Second Temple period literature.\n1 Esdras.\n1 Esdras, probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries BCE, preserves a Greek text of Ezra and a part of Nehemiah distinctly different from that of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah \u2013 in particular it eliminates Nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to Ezra, as well as telling events in a different order. Scholars are divided on whether it is based on Ezra\u2013Nehemiah, or reflects an earlier literary stage before the combination of Ezra and Nehemiah accounts.\nJosephus.\nThe first-century Jewish historian Josephus deals with Ezra in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\". He uses the name Xerxes for Artaxerxes I reserving the name Artaxerxes for the later Artaxerxes II whom he identifies as the Ahasuerus of Esther, thus placing Ezra before the events of the book of Esther. Josephus' account of the deeds of Ezra derives entirely from 1 Esdras, which he cites as the 'Book of Ezra' in his numeration of the Hebrew bible. Contrariwise, Josephus does not appear to recognise Ezra-Nehemiah as a biblical book, does not quote from it, and relies entirely on other traditions in his account of the deeds of Nehemiah.\nThe apocalyptic Ezra traditions.\nThe apocalyptic fourth book of Ezra (also sometimes called the 'second book of Esdras' or the 'third book of Esdras') was written c. CE 100, probably in Judeo-Aramaic, but now survives in Latin, Slavonic and Ethiopic. In this book, Ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an angel of God three times and has four visions. Ezra, thirty years into the Babylonian Exile (4 Ezra 3:1 / 2 Esdras 1:1), recounts the siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon's Temple. The central theological themes are \"the question of theodicy, God's justness in the face of the triumph of the heathens over the pious, the course of world history in terms of the teaching of the four kingdoms, the function of the law, the eschatological judgment, the appearance on Earth of the heavenly Jerusalem, the Messianic Period, at the end of which the Messiah will die, the end of this world and the coming of the next, and the Last Judgment.\" Ezra restores the law that was destroyed with the burning of the Temple in Jerusalem. He dictates 24 books for the public (i.e. the Hebrew Bible) and another 70 for the wise alone (70 unnamed revelatory works). At the end, he is taken up to heaven like Enoch and Elijah. Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book.\nThere is also another work, thought to be influenced by this one, known as the \"Greek Apocalypse of Ezra\".\nIn rabbinic literature.\nTraditionally Judaism credits Ezra with establishing the Great Assembly of scholars and prophets, the forerunner of the Sanhedrin, as the authority on matters of religious law. The Great Assembly is credited with establishing numerous features of contemporary traditional Judaism in something like their present form, including Torah reading, the Amidah, and celebration of the feast of Purim.\nIn Rabbinic traditions, Ezra is metaphorically referred to as the \"flowers that appear on the earth\" signifying the springtime in the national history of Judaism. A disciple of Baruch ben Neriah, he favored study of the Law over the reconstruction of the Temple and thus because of his studies, he did not join the first party returning to Jerusalem in the reign of Cyrus. According to another opinion, he did not join the first party so as not to compete, even involuntarily, with Joshua ben Jozadak for the office of High Priest of Israel.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, Ezra was the writer of the Books of Chronicles, and is the same prophet known also as Malachi. There is a slight controversy within rabbinic sources as to whether or not Ezra had served as High Priest of Israel.\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud, Ezra the Scribe is said to have enacted ten standing laws and orders, which are as follows:\nIn the Syrian village of Tedef, a synagogue said to be the place where Ezra stopped over has been venerated by Jews for centuries. Another tradition locates his tomb near Basra, Iraq.\nIn Christian traditions.\nIn Christian tradition, Ezra is considered to be the author of the book of Ezra and 1 and 2 Chronicles. Due to the strong similarity between the books of Malachi and Ezra, some Christian traditions adopt the Jewish view that Ezra was Malachi; Jerome was one prominent Christian who held this view.\nEarly Christian writers occasionally cited Ezra as author of the apocalyptic books attributed to him. Clement of Alexandria in his \"Stromata\" referred to Ezra as an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a section from 2 Esdras. Where early Christian writers refer to the 'Book of Ezra' it is always the text of 1 Esdras that is being cited.\nIn Islam.\nIn Islam, he is known as Uzair (). He was mentioned in the Qur'an. Although he was not mentioned as one of the Prophets of Islam, he is considered one of them by some Muslim scholars, based on Islamic traditions. His tomb at Al-\u02bbUzer on the banks of the Tigris near Basra, Iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local Marsh Arabs. Many Islamic scholars and modern Western academics do not view Uzer as \"Ezra\"; for example, Professor Gordon Darnell Newby associates \u2018Uzayr with Enoch and Metatron.\nAcademic view.\nTimeline.\nScholars debate the dating of Ezra\u2019s mission due to textual emendations and lack of extrabiblical evidence, with proposed timelines placing his activity either during the reign of Artaxerxes I or Artaxerxes II, complicating the historical context and relationship with Nehemiah. Ezra came to Jerusalem \"in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the King\". The text does not specify whether the king in the passage refers to Artaxerxes I (465\u2013424 BCE) or to Artaxerxes II (404\u2013359 BCE). Most scholars hold that Ezra lived during the rule of Artaxerxes I, though some have difficulties with this assumption: Nehemiah and Ezra \"seem to have no knowledge of each other; their missions seem to have no overlap\". These difficulties have led many scholars to assume that Ezra arrived in the seventh year of the rule of Artaxerxes II, i.e. some 50 years after Nehemiah. This assumption would imply that the biblical account is not chronological. The last group of scholars regard \"the seventh year\" as a scribal error and hold that the two men were contemporaries.\nHowever, in Nehemiah 8, Nehemiah has Ezra read the Torah to the people. So, they clearly were contemporaries working together in Jerusalem at the time the wall and the city of Jerusalem were rebuilt in contrast to the previously stated viewpoint. There is a much clearer problem with the timeline in a story from Ezra 4, that tells of a letter that was sent to Artaxerxes asking to stop the rebuilding of the temple (which started during the reign of Cyrus and then restarted in the second year of Darius, in 521 BCE). Clearly no such letter could have been sent to Artaxerxes, as he only became king in 465 BCE, so apparently some events detailing the resistance of leaders of nearby peoples against the works of Nehemiah must have been confused with events during the days of Zerubbabel.\nHistoricity.\nThere is no historical consensus on Ezra\u2019s existence or mission due to a lack of extrabiblical evidence and conflicting scholarly interpretations, ranging from viewing him as a historical Aramean official to a literary figure, with debates hinging on the authenticity of the Artaxerxes rescript and its dating.\nMary Joan Winn Leith in \"The Oxford History of the Biblical World\" believes that Ezra was a historical figure whose life was enhanced in the scripture and given a theological buildup. Gosta W. Ahlstrom argues the inconsistencies of the biblical tradition are insufficient to say that Ezra, with his central position as the 'father of Judaism' in the Jewish tradition, has been a later literary invention. Those who argue against the historicity of Ezra argue that the presentation style of Ezra as a leader and lawgiver resembles that of Moses. There are also similarities between Ezra the priest-scribe (but not high priest) and Nehemiah the secular governor on the one hand and Joshua and Zerubbabel on the other hand. The early 2nd-century BCE Jewish author Ben Sira praises Nehemiah, but makes no mention of Ezra.\nRichard Friedman argues in his book \"Who Wrote the Bible?\" that Ezra is the one who redacted the Torah, and in fact effectively produced the first Torah. It has been argued that even if one does not accept the documentary hypothesis, Ezra was instrumental in the start of the process of bringing the Torah together.\nOne particular aspect of Ezra's story considered dubious historically is the account in Ezra 7 of his commission. According to it, Ezra was given truly exalted status by the king: he was seemingly put in charge of the entire western half of the Persian Empire, a position apparently above even the level of the satraps (regional governors). Ezra was given vast hoards of treasure to take with him to Jerusalem as well as a letter where the king seemingly acknowledges the sovereignty of the God of Israel. Yet, his actions in the story do not appear to be that of someone with near unlimited government power, and the alleged letter from a Persian king is written with Hebraisms and Jewish idiom.\nBiblical scholar Tova Ganzel has recently argued that Ezra's status as both priest and scribe fits well in its fifth century BCE historical context in light of parallels with the Babylonian temple scribes of the Neo-Babylonian and Persian Periods.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "9840", "revid": "49649547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9840", "title": "Elijah", "text": "Biblical prophet\nElijah ( or ) or Elias (\"My God is Yahweh/YHWH\") was a prophet and miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Ahab (9th century BC), according to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible. \nIn 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of the Hebrew deity Yahweh over that of the Canaanite deity Baal. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection, bringing fire down from the sky, and ascending to heaven alive. He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as \"the sons of the prophets\". Following Elijah's ascension, his disciple and devoted assistant Elisha took over as leader of this school. The Book of Malachi prophesies Elijah's return \"before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD\", making him a harbinger of the Messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the Hebrew Bible. References to Elijah appear in Sirach, the New Testament, the Mishnah and Talmud, the Quran, the Book of Mormon, and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed writings. Scholars generally agree that a historical figure named Elijah existed in ancient Israel, though the biblical accounts of his life are considered more legendary and theologically reflective than historically accurate.\nIn Judaism, Elijah's name is invoked at the weekly Havdalah rite that marks the end of Shabbat, and Elijah is invoked in other Jewish customs, among them the Passover Seder and the brit milah (ritual circumcision). He appears in numerous stories and references in the Haggadah and rabbinic literature, including the Babylonian Talmud. According to some Jewish interpretations, Elijah will return during the End of Times. The Christian New Testament notes that some people thought that Jesus was, in some sense, Elijah, but it also makes clear that John the Baptist is \"the Elijah\" who was promised to come in ; . According to accounts in all three of the Synoptic Gospels, Elijah appeared with Moses during the Transfiguration of Jesus.\nElijah in Islam appears in the Quran as a prophet and messenger of God, where his biblical narrative of preaching against the worshipers of Baal is recounted in a concise form. Due to his importance to Muslims, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians, Elijah has been venerated as the patron saint of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1752.\nBiblical accounts.\nAccording to the Bible, by the 9th\u00a0century BC, the Kingdom of Israel, once united under Solomon, had been divided into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah (which retained the historical capital of Jerusalem along with its Temple). Omri, King of Israel, continued policies dating from the reign of Jeroboam, contrary to religious law, that were intended to reorient religious focus away from Jerusalem: encouraging the building of local temple altars for sacrifices, appointing priests from outside the family of the Levites, and allowing or encouraging temples dedicated to Baal, an important deity in ancient Canaanite religion. Omri achieved domestic security with a marriage alliance between his son Ahab and princess Jezebel, a worshipper of Baal and the daughter of the king of Sidon in Phoenicia. These solutions brought security and economic prosperity to Israel for a time, but did not bring peace with the Israelite prophets, who advocated a strict deuteronomic interpretation of the religious law.\nUnder Ahab's kingship tensions exacerbated. Ahab built a temple for Baal, and his wife Jezebel brought a large entourage of priests and prophets of Baal and Asherah into the country. In this context Elijah is introduced in 1 Kings 17:1 as Elijah \"the Tishbite\". He warns Ahab that there will be years of catastrophic drought so severe that not even dew will form, because Ahab and his queen stand at the end of a line of kings of Israel who are said to have \"done evil in the sight of the Lord.\"\nBooks of Kings.\nNo background for the person of Elijah is given except for his brief characterization as a Tishbite. His name in Hebrew means \"My God is Jah\", and may be a title applied to him because of his challenge to worship of Baal.\nAs told in the Hebrew Bible, Elijah's challenge is bold and direct. Baal was the Canaanite god responsible for rain, thunder, lightning, and dew.\nElijah thus, when he initially announces the drought, not only challenges Baal on behalf of God himself, but he also challenges Jezebel, her priests, Ahab and the people of Israel.\nWidow of Zarephath.\nAfter Elijah's confrontation with Ahab, God tells him to flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook Chorath, east of the Jordan, where he will be fed by ravens. When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living in the town of Zarephath in Phoenicia.\nWhen Elijah finds her, he asks her for some water and a piece of bread, but she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, \"Do not be afraid ... For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of flour will not be used up, and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.\" She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true.\nSome time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, \"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!\" Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated, and \"[God] listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.\" This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. The widow cried, \"the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.\"\nAfter more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought. While on his way, Elijah meets Obadiah, the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets from Jezebel's violent purge. Obadiah fears that when he reports to Ahab about Elijah's whereabouts, Elijah would disappear, provoking Ahab to execute him. Elijah reassures Obadiah and sends him to Ahab.\nChallenge to Baal.\nWhen Ahab confronts Elijah, he denounces him as being the \"troubler of Israel\" but Elijah retorts that Ahab himself is the one who troubled Israel by allowing the worship of false gods.\nAt Elijah's instruction, Ahab summons the people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of Asherah to Mount Carmel. Elijah then berates the people for their acquiescence in Baal worship: \"How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\"\nElijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and Yahweh (both Asherah and her prophets disappear from the story entirely): he and Baal's prophets will each take one of two bulls, prepare it for sacrifice and lay it on wood, but put no fire to it. The prophets of Baal choose and prepare a bull accordingly. Elijah then invites them to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. \"At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, 'Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.'\" They respond by shouting louder and slashing themselves with swords, spears, knives, and sickles. They continue praying until evening without success.\nElijah then repairs Yahweh's altar with twelve stones, representing the twelve tribes of Israel. Elijah digs a trench around it and prepares the other bull for sacrifice as before. He then orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from \"four large jars\" poured three times, filling also the trench. He asks Yahweh to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the sacrifice, the stones of the altar itself, the earth and the water in the trench as well. When the people see this, they declare, \"The LORD\u2014he is God; the LORD\u2014he is God.\" Elijah then orders them to seize the prophets of Baal, which they do, and Elijah brings them down to the River Kishon and slays them, at which the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.\nMount Horeb.\nJezebel, enraged that Elijah has killed the prophets of Baal, threatens to kill him. Elijah flees to Beersheba in Judah, continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death and eventually falling asleep. At length an angel of the Lord rouses him gently, telling him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water, eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel then comes to him a second time, telling him to eat and drink afresh, because he has a long journey ahead of him.\nElijah travels for forty days and forty nights to Mount Horeb, where Moses had received the Ten Commandments. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a cave. Elijah is told to \"Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by.\" There comes a mighty wind, then an earthquake and then fire, but Yahweh is not in any of these, choosing to come instead as a , which bids Elijah go forth again\u2014this time to Damascus to anoint Hazael as king of Aram, Jehu as king of Israel, and Elisha as the old prophet's successor.\nVineyard of Naboth.\nElijah encounters Ahab again in 1 Kings 21, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters in Ahab's name to the elders and nobles who live near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.\nGod again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: \"Have you murdered, and also taken possession?\" and, \"In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.\" Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents so sincerely that God stays his hand in punishing Ahab, choosing instead to vent his wrath upon Jezebel and her son by Ahab, Ahaziah.\nAhaziah.\nElijah's story continues now from Ahab to an encounter with Ahaziah (2 Kings 1). The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of Baalzebub in Ekron, outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message \"Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?\" Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.\nAhaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. Ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with Elijah's word.\nDeparture.\nAccording to 2 Kings 2:3\u20139, Elisha (Eliseus) and \"the sons of the prophets\" knew beforehand that Elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. Elisha asked Elijah to \"let a double portion\" of Elijah's \"spirit\" be upon him. Elijah agreed, with the condition that Elisha would see him be \"taken\".\nElijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the Jordan. He rolls up his mantle and strikes the water. The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.\nBooks of Chronicles.\nElijah is mentioned once more in 2 Chronicles 21:12, which will be his final mention in the Hebrew Bible. A letter is sent under the prophet's name to Jehoram of Judah. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death.\nThis letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with \"Thus says YHVH, God of your father David...\" rather than the more usual \"...in the name of YHVH the God of Israel.\" Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind.\nMichael Wilcock, formerly of Trinity College, Bristol, suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet. John Van Seters, however, rejects the letter as having any connection with the Elijah tradition. However, Wilcock argues that Elijah's letter \"does address a very 'northern' situation in the southern kingdom\", and thus is authentic.\nIn Malachi.\nWhile the final mention of Elijah in the Hebrew Bible is in the Book of Chronicles, the Christian Bible's reordering places the Book of Malachi (which prophesies a messiah) as the final book of the Old Testament, before the New Testament gospels. Thus, Elijah's final Old Testament appearance is in the Book of Malachi, where it is written, \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.\"\nHistoricity.\nScholars generally agree that a prophet named Elijah existed in the Kingdom of Israel during the reigns of Kings Ahab and Ahaziah, that he was a religious figure of great personal dynamism and conservative zeal and the leader of resistance to the rise of Baal worship in Israel in the ninth century BC.\nHowever, the biblical presentation of the prophet cannot be taken as historical documentation of his activity. The biblical texts present his career through the eyes of popular legend and subsequent theological reflection, which consider him a personality of heroic proportions. In this process his actions and relations to the people and the King became stereotyped, and the presentation of his behavior paradigmatic.\nIn the Aggadah, Talmud, and extra-canonical books.\nJewish legends about Elijah abound in the Aggadah, which is found throughout various collections of rabbinic literature, including the Babylonian Talmud. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death\u2014or \"translation\"\u2014ends only with the close of the history of the human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.\nFrom the time of Malachi, who says of Elijah that God will send him before \"the great and dreadful day\", down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.\nOrigin.\nThree different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:\n(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad,\n(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in 1 Chronicles 8:27, and\n(3) he was a priest.\nMany Church Fathers also have stated that Elijah was a priest. Some rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with Phinehas.\nAccording to later Kabbalistic literature, Elijah was really an angel in human form, so that he had neither parents nor offspring.\nThe Midrash Rabbah Exodus 4:2 states \"Elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the Zarephathite\" indicating he surely had parents.\nThe Talmud states \"Said he [Rabbah] to him (Elijah): Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?\"\nZeal for God.\nA midrash tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God.\nIn the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.\nThe vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through \"four worlds\". This world was shown to the prophet by God through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since the world disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in Gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.\nThree years after this vision, Elijah was \"translated\". Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men.\nBut as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven underwent divergent possible interpretations by Christian theologians, the assertion was made that Elijah never entered into heaven proper. In later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of Elijah, but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain, the last two statements may be identical.\nEcclesiasticus.\nElijah's glory is honoured in the Book of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus). His designated tasks are altered to:\nIn Judaism.\nElijah's chair.\nAt Jewish circumcision ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a witness at all circumcisions when the sign of the covenant is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at Mount Horeb: Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on Mount Carmel. God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: \"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away\". According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue, and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.\nElijah's cup.\nIn the Talmudic literature, Elijah would visit rabbis to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the eschaton. Thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision \"until Elijah comes\".\nOne such decision was whether the Passover Seder required four or five cups of wine. Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the \"four expressions of redemption\" in the Book of Exodus:\nI am the Lord, and \"I will bring you out\" from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and \"I will deliver you\" from their bondage, and \"I will redeem you\" with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and \"I will take you\" for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.\nThe next verse, \"And \"I will bring you\" into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.\" was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.\nIn practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah's and is used for no other purpose.\nHavdalah.\nHavdalah is the ceremony that concludes the Sabbath Day (Saturday evening in Jewish tradition). As part of the concluding hymn, an appeal is made to God that Elijah will come during the following week. \"Elijah the Prophet, Elijah the Tishbite, Elijah from Gilead. Let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of David.\"\nIn Jewish folklore.\nThe volume of references to Elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. Elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation about his true identity. Louis Ginzberg equates him with Phinehas, Aaron's grandson. Because of Phinehas's zealousness for God, he and his descendants were promised \"a covenant of lasting priesthood\". Therefore, Elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. Elijah is also equated with the archangel Sandalphon, whose four wings will carry him to any part of the earth. When forced to choose between death and dishonor, Rav Kahana II decided to leap to his death. Before he could strike the ground, Elijah (i.e., Sandalphon) appeared to catch him. Elijah is also sometimes called the \"Angel of the Covenant\".\nRabbi Joshua ben Levi.\nReferences to Elijah in Jewish folklore range from short observations (e.g., it is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because Elijah is nearby) to lengthy parables on the nature of God's justice.\nOne such story is that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah's, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he could join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking questions about the prophet's actions. He agreed, and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave their hospitality as best they could. The following day, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die, and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they left, they passed the man's wall and saw it crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired, and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. Elijah prayed that every synagogue member might become a leader when they left.\nFinally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here, they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. Elijah prayed that God might give them a wise leader when they left. At this, Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded Elijah's explanation of his actions. At the old couple's house, Elijah knew the Angel of Death was coming for the older woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. A great treasure was hidden in the crumbling wall at the wealthy man's house. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored, thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. \"Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.\"\nRabbi Eliezer.\nThe Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai, is illustrative. Once, when walking on a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man\u2014the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, \"Peace be with thee, Rabbi.\" Instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, \"How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?\" Elijah responded with, \"I don't know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction.\" The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness from the rabbi, and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.\nLilith.\nElijah was always seen as deeply pious, and it seemed natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of Lilith. Lilith, in legend, was Adam's first wife. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came to be seen as a demon and a witch.\nElijah encountered Lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, \"Unclean one, where are you going?\" Unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. She intended to kill the woman and eat the child.\nElijah pronounced his malediction, \"I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!\" But Lilith was able to make a bargain with Elijah. She promises to \"forsake my evil ways\" if Elijah will remove his curse. To seal the bargain, she gives Elijah her names so they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or newborn children or used as amulets. Lilith promises, \"Where I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me.\"\nIn Christianity.\nNew Testament.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus would say for those who believed, John the Baptist was Elijah, who would come before the \"great and terrible day\" as predicted by Malachi.\nSome English translations of the New Testament use Elias, a Greek form of the name. In the King James Version, \"Elias\" appears only in the texts translated from Greek.\nJohn the Baptist.\nJohn the Baptist preached a message of repentance and baptism. He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi. He also preached that the Messiah was coming. All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience. He wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle. He also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the Jordan River.\nIn the Gospel of John, when John the Baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) \"Art thou Elias\", he replied \"I am not\". Matthew 11:14 and Matthew 17:10\u201313 however, make it clear that John was the spiritual successor to Elijah. In the Nativity of St. John the Baptist in Luke, Gabriel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and told him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God\", and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah\".\nTransfiguration.\nElijah makes an appearance in the New Testament during an incident known as the Transfiguration.\nAt the summit of an unnamed mount, Jesus' face begins to shine. The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is \"My beloved Son\". The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus. This apparently relates to how both Elijah and Moses, the latter according to tradition but not the Bible, both were translated to heaven instead of dying. Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three \"tabernacles\": one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses.\nThere is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus \"I perceive thou art a prophet.\" Moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced Son of God.\nOther references.\nElijah is mentioned four more times in the New Testament: in Luke, Romans, Hebrews, and James. In Luke 4:24\u201327, Jesus uses Elijah as an example of rejected prophets. Jesus says, \"No prophet is accepted in his own country\", and then mentions Elijah, saying that there were many widows in Israel, but Elijah was sent to one in Phoenicia. In Romans 11:1\u20136, Paul cites Elijah as an example of God's never forsaking his people (the Israelites). Hebrews 11:35 (\"Women received their dead raised to life again...\") refers to both Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarephath and Elisha raising the son of the woman of Shunem, citing both Elijah and Elisha as Old Testament examples of faith. In James 5:16\u201318, James says, \"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much\", and then cites Elijah's prayers which started and ended the famine in Israel as examples.\nProphet saint.\nIn Western Christianity, Elijah is commemorated as a saint with a feast day on 20 July by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. Catholics believe that he was unmarried and celibate.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and Byzantine Catholic Churches, he is commemorated on the same date, 2 August\u00a0[O.S. 20 July]. He is greatly revered among the Orthodox as a model of the contemplative life. He is also commemorated on the Orthodox liturgical calendar on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the Nativity of the Lord).\nElijah has been venerated as the patron saint of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 26 August 1752, replacing George of Lydda at the request of Bishop Pavao Dragi\u010devi\u0107. The reasons for the replacement are unclear. It has been suggested that Elijah was chosen because of his importance to all three main religious groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2014Catholics, Muslims and Orthodox Christians. Pope Benedict XIV is said to have approved Bishop Dragi\u010devi\u0107's request with the remark that a wild nation deserved a wild patron.\nProphet Elias is commemorated by the Catholic Church on 17 June. He is also commemorated by the Eastern Orthodox Church on 14 April with all holy Sinai monks.\nCarmelite tradition.\nElijah is revered as the spiritual Father and traditional founder of the Catholic religious Order of Carmelites. In addition to taking their name from Mt. Carmel where the first hermits of the order established themselves, the Calced Carmelite and Discalced Carmelite traditions pertaining to Elijah focus upon the prophet's withdrawal from public life. The medieval Carmelite Book of the First Monks offers some insight into the heart of the Orders' contemplative vocation and reverence for the prophet. In 1725, the Holy See of the Catholic Church, during the reign of Pope Benedict XIII, allowed the Carmelites to place a statue of the Prophet Elias in St. Peter's Basilica, denoting him as their founder.\nIn the 17th century the Bollandist Society, whose declared aim was to search out and classify materials concerning the saints venerated by the Church, and to print what seemed to be the most reliable sources of information entered into controversy with the Carmelites on this point. In writing of St. Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, the Bollandist Daniel Papebroch stated that the attribution of Carmelite origin to Elijah was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites reacted strongly. From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of Jean de Launoy and the Sorbonne. In November 1698, Pope Innocent XII ordered an end to the controversy.\nLiturgical commemorations.\nSince most Eastern Churches either use Greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the Greek, \"Elias\" (or its modern iotacized form \"Ilias\") is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite.\nThe feast day of Saint Elias falls on 20 July of the Orthodox liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 20 July currently falls on 2 August of the modern Gregorian Calendar). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.\nElias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the Nativity of the Lord).\nThe Apolytikion in the Fourth Tone for St. Elias:\nThe incarnate Angel, the Cornerstone of the Prophets, the second Forerunner of the Coming of Christ, the glorious Elias, who from above, sent down to Elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.\nThe Kontakion in the Second Tone for St. Elias:\nO Prophet and foreseer of the great works of God, O greatly renowned Elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only Loving One.\nPagan associations and mountaintops.\nStarting in the fifth century, Elias is often connected with Helios, the Sun. The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the holocaust sacrifice offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven corresponds to the sun warming the earth.\nSedulius writes poetically in the fifth century that the \"bright path to glittering heaven\" suits Elias both \"in merits and name\", as changing one letter makes his name \"Helios\"; but he does not identify the two. A homily entitled \"De ascensione Heliae\", misattributed to Chrysostom, claims that poets and painters use the ascension of Elijah as a model for their depictions of the sun, and says that \"Elijah is really Helios\". Saint Patrick appears to conflate Helios and Elias. In modern times, much Greek folklore also connects Elias with the sun.\nIn Greece, chapels and monasteries dedicated to Prophet Elias (\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0397\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) are often found on mountaintops, which themselves are often named after him. Since Wachsmuth (1864), the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines. But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias. The modern folklore is not good evidence for the \"origin\" of the association of the sun, Elias, and mountaintops. Perhaps Elias is simply a \"natural patron of high places\".\nThe association of Elias with mountaintops seems to come from a different pagan tradition: Elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with Zeus, especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain, thunder, lightning, and wind. When Elias prevailed over the priests of Baal, it was on Mount Carmel which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on Mount Horeb. When Elias confronted Ahab, he stopped the rains for three years.\nA map of mountain-cults of Zeus shows that most of these sites are now dedicated to Elias, including Mount Olympus, Mount Lykaion, Mount Arachnaion, and Mount Taleton on the mainland, and Mount Kenaion, Mount Oche, and Mount Kynados in the islands. Of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a Helios cult is Mount Taleton.\nElias is associated with pre-Christian lightning gods in many other European traditions.\nAmong Albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. One such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 August pilgrimage to Ljuboten on the Sharr mountains. Muslims refer to this day as \"Aligjyn\" (\"Ali Day\"), and it is believed that Ali becomes Elias at midday.\nAs Elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the Christian missionaries who converted Slavic tribes likely found him an ideal analogy for Perun, the supreme Slavic god of storms, thunder and lightning bolts. In many Slavic countries Elijah is known as Elijah the Thunderer (\"Ilija Gromovnik\"), who drives the heavens in a chariot and administers rain and snow, thus actually taking the place of Perun in popular beliefs. Perun is also sometimes conflated with the legendary hero Elijah of Murom. The feast of St. Elias is known as \"Ilinden\" in South Slavic, and was chosen as the day of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising in 1903; it is now the holiday of Republic Day in North Macedonia.\nIn Estonian folklore Elijah is considered to be the successor of Ukko, the lightning spirit.\nIn Georgian mythology, he replaces Elwa. A Georgian story about Elijah:\nOnce Jesus, the prophet Elijah, and St. George were going through Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian shepherd and decided to ask him to feed them. First, Elijah went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said that, he was the one who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows. (After Elijah, Jesus and St. George attempt to get help and eventually succeed).\nAmong other peoples of the Caucasus, including the Ossetians and Kabardians, Elijah is understood as a kind of thunder-divinity named Uac-illa, Ilia, or Yeli, and was traditionally invoked in \"choppa\" ritual associated with lightning strikes and certain mental illnesses. If a person or animal was struck by lightning, a circle dance was performed immediately around the site, even if the storm was still ongoing, and Elijah's name was invoked alongside a nonsense word \"choppa\" or \"coppay\". If the victim had died, their family were forbidden from grieving and were required to bury them where they fell instead of in the village cemetery. If the victim survived, their lives were dedicated to Elijah: human survivors were prophets, while animals were released with a mark so that others would know not to take them home. In other versions of this tradition, the one venerated was not Elijah, but other traditional thunder-divinities like Shyble (\u0429\u044b\u0431\u043b\u044d), Afy (\u0410\u0444\u044b), or Antswa (\u0410\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0430).\nElias has other pagan associations: a modern legend about Elias mirrors precisely the legend of Odysseus seeking a place where the locals would not recognize an oar\u2014hence the mountaintops.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acknowledges Elijah as a prophet. The Church teaches that the Malachi prophecy of the return of Elijah was fulfilled on 3 April 1836, when Elijah visited the prophet and founder of the church, Joseph Smith, along with Oliver Cowdery, in the Kirtland Temple as a resurrected being. This event is chronicled in . This experience forms the basis for the church's focus on genealogy and family history and belief in the eternal nature of marriage and families.\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, the name-title Elias is not always synonymous with Elijah and is often used for people other than the biblical prophet. According to Joseph Smith,\nThe spirit of Elias is first, Elijah second, and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way, and the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after, holding the keys of power, building the Temple to the capstone, placing the seals of the Melchizedek Priesthood upon the house of Israel, and making all things ready; then Messiah comes to His Temple, which is last of all.\nPeople to whom the title Elias is applied in Mormonism include Noah, the angel Gabriel (who is considered to be the same person as Noah in Mormon doctrine), Elijah, John the Baptist, John the Apostle, and an unspecified man who was a contemporary of Abraham.\nDetractors of Mormonism have often alleged that Smith, in whose time and place the King James Version was the only available English translation of the Bible, simply failed to grasp the fact that the Elijah of the Old Testament and the Elias of the New Testament are the same person. Latter-day Saints deny this and say that the difference they make between the two is deliberate and prophetic. The names Elias and Elijah refer to one who prepares the way for the coming of the Lord. This is applicable to John the Baptist coming to prepare the way for the Lord and His baptism; it also refers to Elijah appearing during the transfiguration to prepare for Jesus by restoring keys of sealing power. Jesus then gave this power to the Twelve saying, \"Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"\nIn Islam.\nElijah () is mentioned as a prophet in Quran https://. Elijah's narrative in the Quran and later Muslim tradition resembles closely that in the Hebrew Bible and Muslim literature records Elijah's primary prophesying as taking place during the reign of Ahab and Jezebel as well as Ahaziah. He is seen by Muslims to be the prophetic predecessor to Elisha. While neither the Bible nor the Quran mentions the genealogy of Elijah, some scholars of Islam believe he may have come from the priestly family of the prophet Aaron. While Elijah is associated with Islamic eschatology, Islam views Jesus as the Messiah. However, Elijah is expected to come back along with the mysterious figure known as Khidr during the Last Judgment. Elijah's figure has been identified with a number of other prophets and saints, including Idris, which is believed by some scholars to have been another name for Elijah, and Khidr. Islamic legend later developed the figure of Elijah, greatly embellishing upon his attributes, and some apocryphal literature gave Elijah the status of a half-human, half-angel. Elijah also appears in later works of literature, including the \"Hamzanama\".\nQuran.\nElijah is mentioned in the Quran, where his preaching is recounted in a concise manner. The Quran narrates that Elijah told his people to come to the worship of God and to leave the worship of Baal, the primary idol of the area. The Quran states, \"And Elias was indeed one of the messengers. \u02f9Remember\u02fa when he said to his people, \u201cWill you not fear \u02f9Allah\u02fa? Do you call upon \u02f9the idol of\u02fa Ba\u2019l and abandon the Best of Creators\u2014 Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers?\u201d \"\nThe Quran makes it clear that the majority of Elijah's people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry. However, it mentions that a small number of devoted servants of God among them followed Elijah and believed in and worshiped God. The Quran states, \"But they rejected him, so they will certainly be brought \u02f9for punishment\u02fa. But not the chosen servants of Allah. We blessed him \u02f9with honourable mention\u02fa among later generations: \"\nIn the Quran, God praises Elijah in two places:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u201cPeace be upon Elias.\u201d Indeed, this is how We reward the good-doers. He was truly one of Our faithful servants.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Likewise, \u02f9We guided\u02fa Zachariah, John, Jesus, and Elias, who were all of the righteous.\u2014\u200a\nNumerous commentators, including Abdullah Yusuf Ali, have offered commentary on Al-An\u2019am 6: 85 saying that Elijah, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus were all spiritually connected. Abdullah Yusuf Ali says, \"The third group consists not of men of action, but Preachers of Truth, who led solitary lives. Their epithet is: \"the Righteous.\" They form a connected group round Jesus. Zachariah was the father of John the Baptist, who is referenced as \"Elias, which was for to come\" (Matt 11:14); and Elias is said to have been present and talked to Jesus at the Transfiguration on the Mount (Matt. 17:3).\"\nLiterature and tradition.\nMuslim literature and tradition recounts that Elijah preached to the Kingdom of Israel, ruled over by Ahab and later his son Ahaziah. He is believed to have been a \"prophet of the desert\u2014like John the Baptist\". Elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife Jezebel, who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of false idols in this area. Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of God to Israel after him.\nElijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with Khidr, and in one legend, with Muhammad himself. In Islamic mysticism, Elijah is associated closely with the sage Khidr. One hadith reported that Elijah and Khidr met together every year in Jerusalem to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca. Elijah appears also in the \"Hamzanama\" numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of Khidr as well as one who drank from the Fountain of Youth.\nFurther, It is narrated in Kitab al-Kafi that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq was reciting the prostration of Ilyas (Elijah) in the Syrian language and began to weep. He then translated the supplication in Arabic to a group of visiting scholars: \n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"O Lord, will I find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I rub my face on Earth to worship you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I give up sins for you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I stay awake all night just for you?\" To which Allah then inspired to Ilyas, \"Raise your head from the Earth for I will not punish you\".\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nAlthough most Muslim scholars believed that Elijah preached in Israel, some early commentators on the Quran stated that Elijah was sent to Baalbek, in Lebanon. Modern scholars have rejected this claim, stating that the connection of the city with Elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city's name, that of \"Baal\", which was the deity that Elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping. Scholars who reject identification of Elijah's town with Baalbek further argue that the town of Baalbek is not mentioned with the narrative of Elijah in either the Quran or the Hebrew Bible.\nIn Druze religion.\nDruze tradition honors several \u201cmentors\u201d and \u201cprophets\u201d, and Elijah is honored as a prophet. Elijah is considered a central figure in Druze. And due to his importance in the religion, the settlement of Druzes on Mount Carmel had partly to do with Elijah's story and devotion. There are two large Druze towns on the eastern slopes of Mount Carmel: Daliyat al-Karmel and Isfiya. The Druze regard the Cave of Elijah as holy, and they identify Elijah as \"al-Khidr\", the green prophet who symbolizes water and life, a miracle who cures the sick. He and Jethro (Shuaib) are considered patron saints of the Druze people.\nDruze, like some Christians, believe that Elijah came back as John the Baptist, since they believe in reincarnation and the transmigration of the soul, Druze believe that El Khidr and John the Baptist are one and the same; along with Saint George.\nDue to the Christian influence on the Druze faith, two Christian saints become the Druze's favorite venerated figures: Saint George and Saint Elijah. Thus, in all the villages inhabited by Druze and Christians in central Mount Lebanon a Christian church or Druze maqam is dedicated to either one of them. According to scholar Ray Jabre Mouawad the Druze appreciated the two saints for their bravery: Saint George because he confronted the dragon and Saint Elijah because he competed with the pagan priests of Baal and won over them. In both cases the explanations provided by Christians is that Druzes were attracted to warrior saints that resemble their own militarized society.\nIn Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed faith.\nIn the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed faith, the B\u00e1b, founder of the B\u00e1b\u00ed faith, is believed to be the return of Elijah and John the Baptist. Both Elijah and John the Baptist are considered to be Lesser Prophets, whose stations are below that of a Manifestation of God like Jesus Christ, Buddha, the B\u00e1b or Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. The B\u00e1b is buried on Mount Carmel, where Elijah had his confrontation with the prophets of Baal.\nControversies.\nMiracle of the ravens.\nThat ravens fed Elijah by the brook Chorath has been questioned. The Hebrew text at 1 Kings 17:4\u20136 uses the word \"`\u014drv\u012bm\", which means \"ravens\", but with a different vocalization might equally mean \"Arabs\". The Septuagint has , \"ravens\", and other traditional translations followed.\nAlternatives have been proposed for many years; for example Adam Clarke (d. 1832) treated it as a discussion already of long standing. Objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean as well as physically dirty; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting. The parallelism with the incident that follows, where Elijah is fed by the widow, also suggests a human, if mildly improbable, agent.\nProf. John Gray chooses \"Arabs\", saying \"We adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel, where Elijah is fed by an alien Phoenician woman.\" His translation of the verses in question is:\nAnd the word of YHWH came to Elijah saying, Go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi, and I have commanded the Arabs to feed thee there. And he went and did according to the word of YHWH and went and dwelt in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan. And the Arabs brought him bread in the morning and flesh in the evening and he would drink of the wadi.\nFire on Mount Carmel.\nThe challenge to the priests of Baal had the two-fold purpose of demonstrating that the God of Israel was greater than Baal, and that it was he who was the giver of rain. According to J. Robinson, \"Some scholars have suggested that the pouring of water was a piece of sympathetic magic.\"\nHugo Gressmann suggested that the fire that destroyed the offering and altar was lightning, while Ferdinand Hitzig and others thought the water poured on the sacrifice and into the ditch might have been flammable naphtha. Baptist scholar H. H. Rowley rejects both views. Robinson dismisses the suggestion of naphtha with the view that the priests of Baal would have been aware of the properties of naphtha. Julian Morgenstern rejects the idea of sympathetic magic, but supports the interpretation of white naphtha possibly ignited by a glass or mirror to focus the sun's rays, citing other mentions of sacred fire, as in 2 Maccabees 1:18\u201322.\nAscension into the heavens.\nElijah's name typically occurs in Jewish lists of those who have entered heaven alive.\nIn the Gospel of John, Jesus says: \"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [\"even\"] the Son of man which is in heaven.\" Traditionally Christianity interprets the \"Son of Man\" as a title of Jesus, but this has never been an article of faith and there are other interpretations. Further interpreting this quote, some Christians believe that Elijah was not assumed into heaven but simply transferred to another assignment either in heaven or with King Jehoram of Judah.\nThe question of whether Elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on the view of the letter Jehoram received from Elijah in 2 Chronicles 21:12 after Elijah had ascended. Some have suggested that the letter was written before Elijah ascended, but only delivered later. The rabbinical Seder Olam explains that the letter was delivered seven years after his ascension. This is also a possible explanation for some variation in manuscripts of Josephus' \"Antiquities of the Jews\" when dealing with this issue. Others have argued that Elijah was only \"caught away\" such as Philip in Acts 8 John Lightfoot reasoned that it must have been a different Elijah.\nReturn.\nThe Jewish nation awaits the coming of Elijah to precede the coming of the Messiah. \nFor Christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospel. After Elijah appears during the Transfiguration alongside Moses, Jesus explains to his disciples that John the Baptist, recently beheaded by Herod Antipas, had been Elijah reincarnate. Commentators have said that Moses' appearance represented the law, while Elijah's appearance represented the prophets. \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that Elijah returned on 3 April 1836 in an appearance to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, fulfilling the prophecy in Malachi.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith believes Elijah returned as the biblical prophet John the Baptist and as the B\u00e1b who founded the B\u00e1b\u00ed Faith in 1844. Druze, like Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith believes, believe that Elijah came back as John the Baptist,\nThe American founded Nation of Islam believes Elijah returned as Elijah Muhammad, black separatist religious leader (who claimed to be a \"messenger\", not a prophet). This is considered less important than their belief that Allah himself showed up in the person of Fard Muhammad, the founder of the group. It differs notably from most beliefs about Elijah, in that his re-appearance is usually the precursor to a greater one's appearance, rather than an afterthought.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A person with expressive aphasia will exhibit effortful speech. Speech generally includes important content words but leaves out function words that have more grammatical significance than physical meaning, such as prepositions and articles. This is known as \"telegraphic speech\". The person's intended message may still be understood, but their sentence will not be grammatically correct. In very severe forms of expressive aphasia, a person may only speak using single word utterances. Typically, comprehension is mildly to moderately impaired in expressive aphasia due to difficulty understanding complex grammar. A better way to describe aphasia is fluent or non-fluent rather than \"expressive\" or \"receptive\" given the typical presence of both expressive and receptive language deficits in all subtypes of aphasia.\nIt is caused by acquired damage to the frontal regions of the brain, such as Broca's area. Expressive aphasia contrasts with receptive aphasia, in which patients are able to speak in grammatical sentences that lack semantic significance and generally also have trouble with comprehension. Expressive aphasia differs from dysarthria, which is typified by a patient's inability to properly move the muscles of the tongue and mouth to produce speech. Expressive aphasia also differs from apraxia of speech, which is a motor disorder characterized by an inability to create and sequence motor plans for conscious speech.\nSigns and symptoms.\nBroca's (expressive) aphasia is a type of non-fluent aphasia in which an individual's speech is halting and effortful. Misarticulations or distortions of consonants and vowels, namely phonetic dissolution, are common. Individuals with expressive aphasia may only produce single words, or words in groups of two or three. Long pauses between words are common and multi-syllabic words may be produced one syllable at a time with pauses between each syllable. The prosody of a person with Broca's aphasia is compromised by shortened length of utterances and the presence of self-repairs and disfluencies. Intonation and stress patterns are also deficient.\nFor example, in the following passage, a patient with Broca's aphasia is trying to explain how he came to the hospital for dental surgery:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Yes... ah... Monday... er... Dad and Peter H... (his own name), and Dad... er... hospital... and ah... Wednesday... Wednesday, nine o'clock... and oh... Thursday... ten o'clock, ah doctors... two... an' doctors... and er... teeth... yah.The speech of a person with expressive aphasia contains mostly content words such as nouns, verbs, and some adjectives. However, function words like conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are rarely used except for \"and\" which is prevalent in the speech of most patients with aphasia. The omission of function words makes the person's speech agrammatic. A communication partner of a person with aphasia may say that the person's speech sounds telegraphic due to poor sentence construction and disjointed words. For example, a person with expressive aphasia might say \"Smart... university... smart... good... good...\"\nSelf-monitoring is typically well preserved in patients with Broca's aphasia. They are usually aware of their communication deficits, and are more prone to depression and outbursts from frustration than are patients with other forms of aphasia.\nIn general, word comprehension is preserved, allowing patients to have functional receptive language skills. Individuals with Broca's aphasia understand most of the everyday conversation around them, but higher-level deficits in receptive language can occur. Because comprehension is substantially impaired for more complex sentences, it is better to use simple language when speaking with an individual with expressive aphasia. This is exemplified by the difficulty to understand phrases or sentences with unusual structure. A typical patient with Broca's aphasia will misinterpret \"the man is bitten by the dog\" by switching the subject and object to \"the dog is bitten by the man.\"\nTypically, people with expressive aphasia can understand speech and read better than they can produce speech and write. The person's writing will resemble their speech and will be effortful, lacking cohesion, and containing mostly content words. Letters will likely be formed clumsily and distorted and some may even be omitted. Although listening and reading are generally intact, subtle deficits in both reading and listening comprehension are almost always present during assessment of aphasia.\nBecause Broca's area is anterior to the primary motor cortex, which is responsible for movement of the face, hands, and arms, a lesion affecting Broca's areas may also result in hemiparesis (weakness of both limbs on the same side of the body) or hemiplegia (paralysis of both limbs on the same side of the body). The brain is wired contralaterally, which means the limbs on right side of the body are controlled by the left hemisphere and vice versa. Therefore, when Broca's area or surrounding areas in the left hemisphere are damaged, hemiplegia or hemiparesis often occurs on the right side of the body in individuals with Broca's aphasia.\nSeverity of expressive aphasia varies among patients. Some people may only have mild deficits and detecting problems with their language may be difficult. In the most extreme cases, patients may be able to produce only a single word. Even in such cases, over-learned and rote-learned speech patterns may be retained\u2013 for instance, some patients can count from one to ten, but cannot produce the same numbers in novel conversation.\nManual language and aphasia.\nIn deaf patients who use manual language (such as American Sign Language), damage to the left hemisphere of the brain leads to disruptions in their signing ability. Paraphasic errors similar to spoken language have been observed; whereas in spoken language a phonemic substitution would occur (e.g. \"tagle\" instead of \"table\"), in ASL case studies errors in movement, hand position, and morphology have been noted. Agrammatism, or the lack of grammatical morphemes in sentence production, has also been observed in lifelong users of ASL who have left hemisphere damage. The lack of syntactic accuracy shows that the errors in signing are not due to damage to the motor cortex, but rather area manifestation of the damage to the language-producing area of the brain. Similar symptoms have been seen in a patient with left hemisphere damage whose first language was British Sign Language, further showing that damage to the left hemisphere primarily hinders linguistic ability, not motor ability. In contrast, patients who have damage to non-linguistic areas on the left hemisphere have been shown to be fluent in signing, but are unable to comprehend written language.\nOverlap with receptive aphasia.\nIn addition to difficulty expressing oneself, individuals with expressive aphasia are also noted to commonly have trouble with comprehension in certain linguistic areas. This agrammatism overlaps with receptive aphasia, but can be seen in patients who have expressive aphasia without being diagnosed as having receptive aphasia. The most well-noted of these are object-relative clauses, object Wh- questions, and topicalized structures (placing the topic at the beginning of the sentence). These three concepts all share phrasal movement, which can cause words to lose their thematic roles when they change order in the sentence. This is often not an issue for people without agrammatic aphasias, but many people with aphasia rely heavily on word order to understand roles that words play within the sentence.\nCauses.\nLess common.\nCommon causes.\nThe most common cause of expressive aphasia is stroke. A stroke is caused by hypoperfusion (lack of oxygen) to an area of the brain, which is commonly caused by thrombosis or embolism. Some form of aphasia occurs in 34 to 38% of stroke patients. Expressive aphasia occurs in approximately 12% of new cases of aphasia caused by stroke.\nIn most cases, expressive aphasia is caused by a stroke in Broca's area or the surrounding vicinity. Broca's area is in the lower part of the premotor cortex in the language dominant hemisphere and is responsible for planning motor speech movements. However, cases of expressive aphasia have been seen in patients with strokes in other areas of the brain. Patients with classic symptoms of expressive aphasia in general have more acute brain lesions, whereas patients with larger, widespread lesions exhibit a variety of symptoms that may be classified as global aphasia or left unclassified.\nExpressive aphasia can also be caused by trauma to the brain, tumor, cerebral hemorrhage and by extradural abscess.\nUnderstanding lateralization of brain function is important for understanding which areas of the brain cause expressive aphasia when damaged. In the past, it has been believed that the area for language production differs between left and right-handed individuals. If this were true, damage to the homologous region of Broca's area in the right hemisphere should cause aphasia in a left-handed individual. More recent studies have shown that even left-handed individuals typically have language functions only in the left hemisphere. However, left-handed individuals are more likely to have a dominance of language in the right hemisphere.\nUncommon causes.\nLess common causes of expressive aphasia include primary autoimmune phenomenon and autoimmune phenomenon that are secondary to cancer (as a paraneoplastic syndrome) have been listed as the primary hypothesis for several cases of aphasia, especially when presenting with other psychiatric disturbances and focal neurological deficits. Many case reports exist describing paraneoplastic aphasia, and the reports that are specific tend to describe expressive aphasia. Although most cases attempt to exclude micro-metastasis, it is likely that some cases of paraneoplastic aphasia are actually extremely small metastasis to the vocal motor regions.\nNeurodegenerative disorders may present with aphasia. Alzheimer's disease may present with either fluent aphasia or expressive aphasia. There are case reports of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease presenting with expressive aphasia.\nDiagnosis.\nExpressive aphasia is classified as non-fluent aphasia, as opposed to fluent aphasia. Diagnosis is done on a case-by-case basis, as lesions often affect the surrounding cortex and deficits are highly variable among patients with aphasia.\nA physician is typically the first person to recognize aphasia in a patient who is being treated for damage to the brain. Routine processes for determining the presence and location of lesion in the brain include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. The physician will complete a brief assessment of the patient's ability to understand and produce language. For further diagnostic testing, the physician will refer the patient to a speech-language pathologist, who will complete a comprehensive evaluation.\nIn order to diagnose a patient with Broca's aphasia, there are certain commonly used tests and procedures. The Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) classifies individuals based on their scores on the subtests; spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition, and naming. The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) can inform users what specific type of aphasia they may have, infer the location of lesion, and assess current language abilities. The Porch Index of Communication Ability (PICA) can predict potential recovery outcomes of the patients with aphasia. Quality of life measurement is also an important assessment tool. Tests such as the Assessment for Living with Aphasia (ALA) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) allow for therapists to target skills that are important and meaningful for the individual.\nIn addition to formal assessments, patient and family interviews are valid and important sources of information. The patient's previous hobbies, interests, personality, and occupation are all factors that will not only impact therapy but may motivate them throughout the recovery process. Patient interviews and observations allow professionals to learn the priorities of the patient and family and determine what the patient hopes to regain in therapy. Observations of the patient may also be beneficial to determine where to begin treatment. The current behaviors and interactions of the patient will provide the therapist with more insight about the client and their individual needs. Other information about the patient can be retrieved from medical records, patient referrals from physicians, and the nursing staff.\nIn non-speaking patients who use manual languages, diagnosis is often based on interviews from the patient's acquaintances, noting the differences in sign production pre- and post-damage to the brain. Many of these patients will also begin to rely on non-linguistic gestures to communicate, rather than signing since their language production is hindered.\nTreatment.\nCurrently, there is no standard treatment for expressive aphasia. Most aphasia treatment is individualized based on a patient's condition and needs as assessed by a speech language pathologist. Patients go through a period of spontaneous recovery following brain injury in which they regain a great deal of language function.\nIn the months following injury or stroke, most patients receive traditional treatment for a few hours per day. Among other exercises, patients practice the repetition of words and phrases. Mechanisms are also taught in traditional treatment to compensate for lost language function such as drawing and using phrases that are easier to pronounce.\nEmphasis is placed on establishing a basis for communication with family and caregivers in everyday life. Treatment is individualized based on the patient's own priorities, along with the family's input.\nA patient may have the option of individual or group treatment. Although less common, group treatment has been shown to have advantageous outcomes. Some types of group treatments include family counseling, maintenance groups, support groups and treatment groups.\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication.\nAugmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) refers to a set of tools and strategies that support or replace verbal communication for individuals with communication disorders, such as Broca's aphasia or other conditions that affect speech and language abilities. AAC is designed to enhance communication and may be used as a temporary or permanent solution, depending on the individual's needs. Here are some key aspects of AAC:\nAAC is a dynamic and evolving field, and advancements in technology continue to enhance the range and effectiveness of communication tools available for individuals with speech and language challenges. The selection of AAC strategies depends on factors such as the individual's abilities, preferences, and the specific nature of their communication disorder.\nMelodic intonation therapy.\nMelodic intonation therapy was inspired by the observation that individuals with non-fluent aphasia sometimes can sing words or phrases that they normally cannot speak. \"Melodic Intonation Therapy was begun as an attempt to use the intact melodic/prosodic processing skills of the right hemisphere in those with aphasia to help cue retrieval words and expressive language.\" It is believed that this is because singing capabilities are stored in the right hemisphere of the brain, which is likely to remain unaffected after a stroke in the left hemisphere. However, recent evidence demonstrates that the capability of individuals with aphasia to sing entire pieces of text may actually result from rhythmic features and the familiarity with the lyrics.\nThe goal of Melodic Intonation Therapy is to utilize singing to access the language-capable regions in the right hemisphere and use these regions to compensate for lost function in the left hemisphere. The natural musical component of speech was used to engage the patients' ability to produce phrases. A clinical study revealed that singing and rhythmic speech may be similarly effective in the treatment of non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech. Moreover, evidence from randomized controlled trials is still needed to confirm that Melodic Intonation Therapy is suitable to improve propositional utterances and speech intelligibility in individuals with (chronic) non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech.\nMelodic Intonation Therapy appears to work particularly well in patients who have had a unilateral, left hemisphere stroke, show poor articulation, are non-fluent or have severely restricted speech output, have moderately preserved auditory comprehension, and show good motivation. MIT therapy on average lasts for 1.5 hours per day for five days per week. At the lowest level of therapy, simple words and phrases (such as \"water\" and \"I love you\") are broken down into a series of high- and low-pitch syllables. With increased treatment, longer phrases are taught and less support is provided by the therapist. Patients are taught to say phrases using the natural melodic component of speaking and continuous voicing is emphasized. The patient is also instructed to use the left hand to tap the syllables of the phrase while the phrases are spoken. Tapping is assumed to trigger the rhythmic component of speaking to utilize the right hemisphere.\nFMRI studies have shown that Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) uses both sides of the brain to recover lost function, as opposed to traditional therapies that utilize only the left hemisphere. In MIT, individuals with small lesions in the left hemisphere seem to recover by activation of the left hemisphere perilesional cortex. Meanwhile, individuals with larger left-hemisphere lesions show a recruitment of the use of language-capable regions in the right hemisphere. The interpretation of these results is still a matter of debate. For example, it remains unclear whether changes in neural activity in the right hemisphere result from singing or from the intensive use of common phrases, such as \"thank you\", \"how are you?\" or \"I am fine.\" This type of phrases falls into the category of formulaic language and is known to be supported by neural networks of the intact right hemisphere.\nA pilot study reported positive results when comparing the efficacy of a modified form of MIT to no treatment in people with nonfluent aphasia with damage to their left-brain. A randomized controlled trial was conducted and the study reported benefits of utilizing modified MIT treatment early in the recovery phase for people with nonfluent aphasia.\nMelodic Intonation Therapy is used by music therapists, board-certified professionals that use music as a therapeutic tool to effect certain non-musical outcomes in their patients. Speech language pathologists can also use this therapy for individuals who have had a left hemisphere stroke and non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's or even apraxia of speech. Its effectiveness has been show in many languages. \nConstraint-induced therapy.\nConstraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) is based on similar principles as constraint-induced movement therapy developed by Dr. Edward Taub at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Constraint-induced movement therapy is based on the idea that a person with an impairment (physical or communicative) develops a \"learned nonuse\" by compensating for the lost function with other means such as using an unaffected limb by a paralyzed individual or drawing by a patient with aphasia. In constraint-induced movement therapy, the alternative limb is constrained with a glove or sling and the patient is forced to use the affected limb. In constraint-induced aphasia therapy the interaction is guided by communicative need in a language game context, picture cards, barriers making it impossible to see other players' cards, and other materials, so that patients are encouraged (\"constrained\") to use the remaining verbal abilities to succeed in the communication game.\nTwo important principles of constraint-induced aphasia therapy are that treatment is very intense, with sessions lasting for up to 6 hours over the course of 10 days and that language is used in a communication context in which it is closely linked to (nonverbal) actions. These principles are motivated by neuroscience insights about learning at the level of nerve cells (synaptic plasticity) and the coupling between cortical systems for language and action in the human brain. Constraint-induced therapy contrasts sharply with traditional therapy by the strong belief that mechanisms to compensate for lost language function, such as gesturing or writing, should not be used unless absolutely necessary, even in everyday life.\nIt is believed that CIAT works by the mechanism of increased neuroplasticity. By constraining an individual to use only speech, it is believed that the brain is more likely to reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.\nThe strongest results of CIAT have been seen in patients with chronic aphasia (lasting over 6 months). Studies of CIAT have confirmed that further improvement is possible even after a patient has reached a \"plateau\" period of recovery. It has also been proven that the benefits of CIAT are retained long term. However, improvements only seem to be made while a patient is undergoing intense therapy. Recent work has investigated combining constraint-induced aphasia therapy with drug treatment, which led to an amplification of therapy benefits.\nMedication.\nIn addition to active speech therapy, pharmaceuticals have also been considered as a useful treatment for expressive aphasia. This area of study is relatively new and much research continues to be conducted.\nThe following drugs have been suggested for use in treating aphasia and their efficacy has been studied in control studies.\nThe most effect has been shown by piracetam and amphetamine, which may increase cerebral plasticity and result in an increased capability to improve language function. It has been seen that piracetam is most effective when treatment is begun immediately following stroke. When used in chronic cases it has been much less efficient.\nBromocriptine has been shown by some studies to increase verbal fluency and word retrieval with therapy than with just therapy alone. Furthermore, its use seems to be restricted to non-fluent aphasia.\nDonepezil has shown a potential for helping chronic aphasia.\nNo study has established irrefutable evidence that any drug is an effective treatment for aphasia therapy. Furthermore, no study has shown any drug to be specific for language recovery. Comparison between the recovery of language function and other motor function using any drug has shown that improvement is due to a global increase plasticity of neural networks.\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation.\nIn transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic fields are used to create electrical currents in specified cortical regions. The procedure is a painless and noninvasive method of stimulating the cortex. TMS works by suppressing the inhibition process in certain areas of the brain. By suppressing the inhibition of neurons by external factors, the targeted area of the brain may be reactivated and thereby recruited to compensate for lost function. Research has shown that patients can demonstrate increased object naming ability with regular transcranial magnetic stimulation than patients not receiving TMS. Furthermore, research suggests this improvement is sustained upon the completion of TMS therapy. However, some patients fail to show any significant improvement from TMS which indicates the need for further research of this treatment.\nTreatment of underlying forms.\nDescribed as the linguistic approach to the treatment of expressive aphasia, treatment begins by emphasizing and educating patients on the thematic roles of words within sentences. Sentences that are usually problematic will be reworded into active-voiced, declarative phrasings of their non-canonical counterparts. The simpler sentence phrasings are then transformed into variations that are more difficult to interpret. For example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. \"What\" and \"who\" questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts. For instance, therapists have used sentences like, \"Who is the boy helping?\" and \"What is the boy fixing?\" because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object. In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training \"who\" sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained \"who\" sentences as well as untrained \"what\" sentences, and vice versa. Likewise, \"where\" and \"when\" question types are very closely linked. \"What\" and \"who\" questions alter placement of arguments, and \"where\" and \"when\" sentences move adjunct phrases. Training is in the style of: \"The man parked the car in the driveway. What did the man park in the driveway?\" Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.\nResults: Patients' use of sentence types used in the TUF treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in TUF, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others. Generalization of sentence types used can be improved when the treatment progresses in the order of more complex sentences to more elementary sentences. Treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fMRI mappings. Training of Wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced. Patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy. In terms of on-line sentence processing, patients having undergone this treatment discriminate between anomalous and non-anomalous sentences with more accuracy than control groups and are closer to levels of normalcy than patients not having participated in this treatment.\nMechanisms of recovery.\nMechanisms for recovery differ from patient to patient. Some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy. FMRI studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. Recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area. It has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation. It is thought that, because the right hemisphere is not intended for full language function, using the right hemisphere as a mechanism of recovery is effectively a \"dead-end\" and can lead only to partial recovery.\nThere is evidence to support that, among all types of therapies, one of the most important factors and best predictors for a successful outcome is the intensity of the therapy. By comparing the length and intensity of various methods of therapies, it was proven that intensity is a better predictor of recovery than the method of therapy used.\nPrognosis.\nIn most individuals with expressive aphasia, the majority of recovery is seen within the first year following a stroke or injury. The majority of this improvement is seen in the first four weeks in therapy following a stroke and slows thereafter. However, this timeline will vary depending upon the type of stroke experienced by the patient. Patients who experienced an ischemic stroke may recover in the days and weeks following the stroke, and then experience a plateau and gradual slowing of recovery. On the contrary, patients who experienced a hemorrhagic stroke experience a slower recovery in the first 4\u20138 weeks, followed by a faster recovery which eventually stabilizes.\nNumerous factors impact the recovery process and outcomes. Site and extent of lesion greatly impacts recovery. Other factors that may affect prognosis are age, education, gender, and motivation. Occupation, handedness, personality, and emotional state may also be associated with recovery outcomes.\nStudies have also found that prognosis of expressive aphasia correlates strongly with the initial severity of impairment. However, it has been seen that continued recovery is possible years after a stroke with effective treatment. Timing and intensity of treatment is another factor that impacts outcomes. Research suggests that even in later stages of recovery, intervention is effective at improving function, as well as, preventing loss of function.\nUnlike receptive aphasia, patients with expressive aphasia are aware of their errors in language production. This may further motivate a person with expressive aphasia to progress in treatment, which would affect treatment outcomes. On the other hand, awareness of impairment may lead to higher levels of frustration, depression, anxiety, or social withdrawal, which have been proven to negatively affect a person's chance of recovery.\nHistory.\nExpressive aphasia was first identified by the French neurologist Paul Broca. By examining the brains of deceased individuals having acquired expressive aphasia in life, he concluded that language ability is localized in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobe. One of the most important aspects of Paul Broca's discovery was the observation that the loss of proper speech in expressive aphasia is due to the brain's loss of ability to produce language, as opposed to the mouth's loss of ability to produce words.\nThe discoveries of Paul Broca were made during the same period of time as the German Neurologist Carl Wernicke, who was also studying brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as Wernicke's area. Discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. While both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was Carl Wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between expressive and receptive aphasia).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
