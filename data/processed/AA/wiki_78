It expresses the ratio of two values of a power or root-power quantity on a logarithmic scale. Two signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 101/10 (approximately ) or root-power ratio of 101/20 (approximately ). \nThe strict original usage above only expresses a relative change. However, the word decibel has since also been used for expressing an absolute value that is relative to some fixed reference value, in which case the dB symbol is often suffixed with letter codes that indicate the reference value. For example, for the reference value of 1\u00a0volt, a common suffix is \"V\" (e.g., \"20\u00a0dBV\").\nAs it originated from a need to express power ratios, two principal types of scaling of the decibel are used to provide consistency depending on whether the scaling refers to ratios of power quantities or root-power quantities. When expressing a power ratio, the corresponding change in decibels is defined as ten times the logarithm with base 10 of that ratio. That is, a change in \"power\" by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10\u00a0dB change in level. When expressing root-power ratios, a change in amplitude by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20\u00a0dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two, so that the related power and root-power levels change by the same value in linear systems, where power is proportional to the square of amplitude.\nThe definition of the decibel originated in the measurement of transmission loss and power in telephony of the early 20th century in the Bell System in the United States. The bel was named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell, but the bel is seldom used. Instead, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering, most prominently for sound power in acoustics, in electronics and control theory. In electronics, the gains of amplifiers, attenuation of signals, and signal-to-noise ratios are often expressed in decibels.\nHistory.\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. Until the mid-1920s, the unit for loss was \"miles of standard cable\" (MSC). 1\u00a0MSC corresponded to the loss of power over one mile (approximately 1.6\u00a0km) of standard telephone cable at a frequency of \u00a0radians per second (795.8\u00a0Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to a listener. A standard telephone cable was \"a cable having uniformly distributed resistance of 88\u00a0ohms per loop-mile and uniformly distributed shunt capacitance of 0.054\u00a0microfarads per mile\" (approximately corresponding to 19\u00a0gauge wire).\nIn 1924, Bell Telephone Laboratories received a favorable response to a new unit definition among members of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony in Europe and replaced the MSC with the \"Transmission Unit\" (TU). 1\u00a0TU was defined such that the number of TUs was ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of measured power to a reference power. The definition was conveniently chosen such that 1\u00a0TU approximated 1\u00a0MSC; specifically, 1\u00a0MSC was 1.056\u00a0TU. In 1928, the Bell system renamed the TU as the \"decibel\", being one tenth of a newly defined unit for the base-10 logarithm of the power ratio. It was named the \"bel\", in honor of the telecommunications pioneer Alexander Graham Bell. The bel is seldom used, as the decibel was the proposed working unit.\nThe naming and early definition of the decibel is described in the NBS Standard's Yearbook of 1931:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Since the earliest days of the telephone, the need for a unit in which to measure the transmission efficiency of telephone facilities has been recognized. The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 100.1 and any two amounts of power differ by \"N\" decibels when they are in the ratio of 10\"N\"(0.1). The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit\u00a0...\nThe word decibel was soon misused to refer to absolute quantities and to ratios other than power. Some proposals attempted to address the resulting confusion. In 1954, J. W. Horton considered that 100.1 be treated as an elementary ratio and proposed the word \"logit\" as \"a standard ratio which has the numerical value 100.1 and which combines by multiplication with similar ratios of the same value\", so one would describe a 100.1 ratio of units of mass as \"a mass logit\". This contrasts with the word \"unit\" which would be reserved for magnitudes which combine by addition and reserves the word \"decibel\" specifically for unit transmission loss. The \"decilog\" was another proposal (by N. B. Saunders in 1943, A. G. Fox in 1951, and E. I. Green in 1954) to express a division of the logarithmic scale corresponding to a ratio of 100.1.\nIn April\u00a02003, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) considered a recommendation for the inclusion of the decibel in the International System of Units (SI), but decided against the proposal. However, the decibel is recognized by other international bodies such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The IEC permits the use of the decibel with root-power quantities as well as power and this recommendation is followed by many national standards bodies, such as NIST, which justifies the use of the decibel for voltage ratios. In spite of their widespread use, suffixes (such as in dBA or dBV) are not recognized by the IEC or ISO.\nDefinition.\nThe IEC Standard 60027-3:2002 defines the following quantities. The decibel (dB) is one-tenth of a bel: 1\u00a0dB\u00a0= 0.1\u00a0B. The bel (B) is \u00a0ln(10) nepers: 1\u00a0B\u00a0= \u00a0ln(10)\u00a0Np. The neper is the change in the level of a root-power quantity when the root-power quantity changes by a factor of \"e\", that is 1 Np = ln(e) = 1, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural \"log\" of root-power-quantity ratios, \u00a0= \u00a0= . Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two root-power quantities of \u221a10:1.\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 101/10, which is approximately , and an amplitude (root-power quantity) ratio of 101/20 ().\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with SI unit prefixes other than \"deci\"; it is customary, for example, to use \"hundredths of a decibel\" rather than \"millibels\". Thus, five one-thousandths of a bel would normally be written 0.05\u00a0dB, and not 5\u00a0mB.\nThe method of expressing a ratio as a level in decibels depends on whether the measured property is a \"power quantity\" or a \"root-power quantity\"; see \"Power, root-power, and field quantities\" for details.\nPower quantities.\nWhen referring to measurements of \"power\" quantities, a ratio can be expressed as a level in decibels by evaluating ten times the base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the measured quantity to reference value. Thus, the ratio of \"P\" (measured power) to \"P\"0 (reference power) is represented by \"L\"\"P\", that ratio expressed in decibels, which is calculated using the formula:\n formula_1\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel). \"P\" and \"P\"0 must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If \"P\" = \"P\"0 in the above equation, then \"L\"\"P\"\u00a0= 0. If \"P\" is greater than \"P\"0 then \"L\"\"P\" is positive; if \"P\" is less than \"P\"0 then \"L\"\"P\" is negative.\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for \"P\" in terms of \"P\"0 and \"L\"\"P\" :\n formula_2\nRoot-power (field) quantities.\nWhen referring to measurements of root-power quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of \"F\" (measured) and \"F\"0 (reference). This is because the definitions were originally formulated to give the same value for relative ratios for both power and root-power quantities. Thus, the following definition is used:\n formula_3\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n formula_4\nSimilarly, in electrical circuits, dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of voltage or current when the impedance is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level \"L\"\"G\":\n formula_5\nwhere \"V\"out is the root-mean-square (rms) output voltage, \"V\"in is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\nThe term \"root-power quantity\" is introduced by ISO Standard 80000-1:2009 as a substitute of \"field quantity\". The term \"field quantity\" is deprecated by that standard and \"root-power\" is used throughout this article.\nRelationship between power and root-power levels.\nAlthough power and root-power quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically expressed in the same units, typically decibels. A factor of 2 is introduced to make \"changes\" in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the \"same\" waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time. This relies on the relationship\n formula_6\nholding. In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity. However, even in a linear system in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. voltage and current), if the impedance is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities \"P\"0 and \"F\"0 need not be related), or equivalently,\n formula_7\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the root-power level difference from power \"P\"1 and \"F\"1 to \"P\"2 and \"F\"2. An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0\u00a0dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified. Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities power spectral density and the associated root-power quantities via the Fourier transform, which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\nConversions.\nSince logarithm differences expressed in these units often represent power ratios and root-power ratios, values for both are shown below. The bel is traditionally used as a unit of logarithmic power ratio, while the neper is used for logarithmic root-power (amplitude) ratio.\nExamples.\n(31.62 V / 1 V)2 \u2248 1 kW / 1 W, illustrating the consequence from the definitions above that \"L\"\"G\" has the same value, 30\u00a0dB, regardless of whether it is obtained from powers or from amplitudes, provided that in the specific system being considered power ratios are equal to amplitude ratios squared.\nA change in power ratio by a factor of 10 corresponds to a change in level of 10 dB. A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or is approximately a change of 3\u00a0dB. More precisely, the change is \u00b1\u00a0dB, but this is almost universally rounded to 3\u00a0dB in technical writing. This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of . Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, corresponding to a quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as 6\u00a0dB rather than \u00b1\u00a0dB.\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional significant figures. 3.000\u00a0dB corresponds to a power ratio of 103/10, or , about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of , about 0.12% different from exactly \u221a2. Similarly, an increase of 6.000\u00a0dB corresponds to a power ratio of 106/10 \u2248 , about 0.5% different from 4.\nProperties.\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplicative effects, such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive, such as in the combined sound pressure level of two machines operating together. Care is also necessary with decibels directly in fractions and with the units of multiplicative operations.\nReporting large ratios.\nThe logarithmic scale nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number. For example, 50\u00a0dB is easier to say than \"the two powers bear a 100,000 to 1 ratio\" or that \"one power is 105 the other\". Decibels express huge changes of a quantity with few digits of dB.\nRepresentation of multiplication operations.\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of amplifier stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, log(\"A\" \u00d7 \"B\" \u00d7 \"C\")= log(\"A\") + log(\"B\") + log(\"C\"). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1\u00a0dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3\u00a0dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10\u00a0dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of slide rules than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret. Quantities in decibels are not necessarily additive, thus being \"of unacceptable form for use in dimensional analysis\". Thus, units require special care in decibel operations. Take, for example, carrier-to-noise-density ratio \"C\"/\"N\"0 (in hertz), involving carrier power \"C\" (in watts) and noise power spectral density \"N\"0 (in W/Hz). Expressed in decibels, this ratio would be a subtraction (\"C\"/\"N\"0)dB = \"C\"dB \u2212 \"N\"0\u00a0dB. However, the linear-scale units still simplify in the implied fraction, so that the results would be expressed in dB-Hz.\nRepresentation of addition operations.\nAccording to Mitschke, \"The advantage of using a logarithmic measure is that in a transmission chain, there are many elements concatenated, and each has its own gain or attenuation. To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\" However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:if two machines each individually produce a sound pressure level of, say, 90\u00a0dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93\u00a0dB, but certainly not to 180\u00a0dB!; suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87\u00a0dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83\u00a0dBA. [...] the machine noise [level (alone)] may be obtained by 'subtracting' the 83\u00a0dBA background noise from the combined level of 87\u00a0dBA; i.e., 84.8\u00a0dBA.; in order to find a representative value of the sound level in a room a number of measurements are taken at different positions within the room, and an average value is calculated. [...] Compare the logarithmic and arithmetic averages of [...] 70\u00a0dB and 90\u00a0dB: logarithmic average = 87\u00a0dB; arithmetic average = 80\u00a0dB.\nAddition on a logarithmic scale is called logarithmic addition, and can be defined by taking exponentials to convert to a linear scale, adding there, and then taking logarithms to return. For example, where operations on decibels are logarithmic addition/subtraction and logarithmic multiplication/division, while operations on the linear scale are the usual operations:\nformula_12\nformula_13\nThe logarithmic mean is obtained from the logarithmic sum by subtracting formula_14, since logarithmic division is linear subtraction.\nFractions.\nAttenuation constants, in topics such as optical fiber communication and radio propagation path loss, are often expressed as a fraction or ratio to distance of transmission. In this case, dB/m represents decibel per meter, dB/mi represents decibel per mile, for example. These quantities are to be manipulated obeying the rules of dimensional analysis, e.g., a 100-meter run with a 3.5 dB/km fiber yields a loss of 0.35 dB = 3.5 dB/km \u00d7 0.1\u00a0km.\nUses.\nPerception.\nThe human perception of the intensity of sound and light more nearly approximates the logarithm of intensity rather than a linear relationship (see Weber\u2013Fechner law), making the dB scale a useful measure.\nAcoustics.\nThe decibel is commonly used in acoustics as a unit of sound power level or sound pressure level. The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure. As sound pressure is a root-power quantity, the appropriate version of the unit definition is used:\n formula_15\nwhere \"p\"rms is the root mean square of the measured sound pressure and \"p\"ref is the standard reference sound pressure of 20 micropascals in air or 1 micropascal in water.\nUse of the decibel in underwater acoustics leads to confusion, in part because of this difference in reference value.\nSound intensity is proportional to the square of sound pressure. Therefore, the sound intensity level can also be defined as:\n formula_16\nThe human ear has a large dynamic range in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is equal to or greater than 1\u00a0trillion (1012). Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in logarithmic scale: the base-10 logarithm of 1012 is 12, which is expressed as a sound intensity level of 120\u00a0dB re 1 pW/m2. The reference values of I and p in air have been chosen such that this corresponds approximately to a sound pressure level of 120\u00a0dB re 20\u00a0\u03bcPa.\nThe original choice of the decibel over the bel as a log unit of change of intensity is because a single change in a property of sound which is below the just-noticeable difference (JND) does not affect perception of the sound. For amplitude, the JND for humans is around 1\u00a0dB.\nSince the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, the acoustic power spectrum is modified by frequency weighting (A-weighting being the most common standard) to get the weighted acoustic power before converting to a sound level or noise level in decibels.\nTelephony.\nThe decibel is used in telephony and audio. Similarly to the use in acoustics, a frequency weighted power is often used. For audio noise measurements in electrical circuits, the weightings are called psophometric weightings.\nElectronics.\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for gains) in preference to arithmetic ratios or percentages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as amplifiers and attenuators) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium (free space, waveguide, coaxial cable, fiber optics, etc.) using a link budget.\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, dBW uses a 1\u00a0W reference, while dBm uses a 1 mW reference (\"m\" being short for \"milliwatt\"). A power level of 0\u00a0dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1\u00a0dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259\u00a0mW).\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the dBu. This is relative to the root mean square voltage which delivers 1\u00a0mW (0\u00a0dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or \u221a1\u00a0mW \u00d7 600\u00a0\u03a9\u2248 0.775\u00a0VRMS. When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are identical.\nOptics.\nIn an optical link, if a known amount of optical power, in dBm (referenced to 1\u00a0mW), is launched into a fiber, and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.\nIn spectrometry and optics, the blocking unit used to measure optical density is equivalent to \u22121\u00a0B.\nVideo and digital imaging.\nIn connection with video and digital image sensors, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20\u00a0log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a CCD imager where response voltage is linear in intensity.\nThus, a camera signal-to-noise ratio or dynamic range quoted as 40\u00a0dB represents a ratio of 100:1 between optical signal intensity and optical-equivalent dark-noise intensity, not a 10,000:1 intensity (power) ratio as 40\u00a0dB might suggest.\nSometimes the 20\u00a0log ratio definition is applied to electron counts or photon counts directly, which are proportional to sensor signal amplitude without the need to consider whether the voltage response to intensity is linear.\nHowever, as mentioned above, the 10\u00a0log intensity convention prevails more generally in physical optics, including fiber optics, so the terminology can become murky between the conventions of digital photographic technology and physics. Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20 log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the stop, to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\nSuffixes and reference values.\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1\u00a0milliwatt.\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\nThis form of attaching suffixes to dB is widespread in practice, albeit being against the rules promulgated by standards bodies (ISO and IEC), given the \"unacceptability of attaching information to units\" and the \"unacceptability of mixing information with units\". The IEC 60027-3 standard recommends the following format: \"L\"\"x\" (re \"x\"ref) or as \"L\"\"x\"/\"x\"ref, where \"x\" is the quantity symbol and \"x\"ref is the value of the reference quantity, e.g., \"L\"\"E\" (re 1\u00a0\u03bcV/m)\u00a0= 20\u00a0dB or \"L\"\"E\"/(1 \u03bcV/m)\u00a0= 20\u00a0dB for the electric field strength \"E\" relative to 1 \u03bcV/m reference value.\nIf the measurement result 20\u00a0dB is presented separately, it can be specified using the information in parentheses, which is then part of the surrounding text and not a part of the unit: 20\u00a0dB (re 1 \u03bcV/m) or 20\u00a0dB (1 \u03bcV/m).\nOutside of documents adhering to SI units, the practice is very common as illustrated by the following examples. There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of \u03bcV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"\u03bb\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for A-weighted sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a hyphen, as in \"dB\u2011Hz\", or with a space, as in \"dB\u00a0HL\", or enclosed in parentheses, as in \"dB(HL)\", or with no intervening character, as in \"dBm\" (which is non-compliant with international standards).\nList of suffixes.\nVoltage.\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n In professional audio, equipment may be calibrated to indicate a \"0\" on the VU meters some finite time after a signal has been applied at an amplitude of +4 dBu. Consumer equipment typically uses a lower \"nominal\" signal level of \u221210 dBV. Therefore, many devices offer dual voltage operation (with different gain or \"trim\" settings) for compatibility. A switch or adjustment that covers at least the range between +4 dBu and \u221210 dBV is common in professional equipment.\nAcoustics.\nProbably the most common usage of \"decibels\" in reference to sound level is dBSPL, sound pressure level referenced to the nominal threshold of human hearing: The measures of pressure (a root-power quantity) use the factor of 20, and the measures of power (e.g. dBSIL and dBSWL) use the factor of 10.\nAudio electronics.\nSee also dBV and dBu above.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8411", "revid": "28422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8411", "title": "Darwinism", "text": "Theory of biological evolution\nDarwinism is a term used to describe a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) and his contemporaries. The theory states that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories. English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term \"Darwinism\" in April 1860.\nDarwinism \"stricto sensu\" lacks a clear theory of inheritance, in contrast with later neo-Darwinian theories such as the modern synthesis (which integrates mendelian inheritance).\nTerminology.\nEnglish biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term \"Darwinism\" in April 1860. It was used to describe evolutionary concepts in general, including earlier concepts published by English philosopher Herbert Spencer. Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called Lamarckism. The strict neo-Darwinism of German evolutionary biologist August Weismann gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During the approximate period of the 1880s to about 1920, sometimes called \"the eclipse of Darwinism\", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms which eventually proved untenable. The development of the modern synthesis in the early 20th century, incorporating natural selection with population genetics and Mendelian genetics, revived Darwinism in an updated form.\nWhile the term \"Darwinism\" has remained in use amongst the public when referring to modern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued by science writers such as Olivia Judson, Eugenie Scott, and Carl Safina that it is an inappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory. For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of the Moravian scientist and Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel, and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of heredity. He naturally had no inkling of later theoretical developments and, like Mendel himself, knew nothing of genetic drift, for example.\nIn the United States and to some extent in the United Kingdom, creationists often use the term \"Darwinism\" as a pejorative term in reference to beliefs such as scientific materialism.\nThough the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution, creationists have appropriated it to refer to the origin of life or to cosmic evolution, that are distinct to biological evolution, and therefore consider it to be the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work, in place of other concepts, including divine design and extraterrestrial origins.\nHuxley.\nHuxley, upon first reading Darwin's theory in 1858, responded, \"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\"\nWhile the term \"Darwinism\" had been used previously to refer to the work of Erasmus Darwin in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin's 1859 book \"On the Origin of Species\" was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of \"The Westminster Review\". Having hailed the book as \"a veritable Whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism\" promoting scientific naturalism over theology, and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's gradualism and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species, Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of Nicolaus Copernicus in explaining planetary motion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular? What if species should offer residual phenomena, here and there, not explicable by natural selection? Twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is, or is not, the case; but in either event they will owe the author of \"The Origin of Species\" an immense debt of gratitude... And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's \"Researches on Development,\" thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.\nThese are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin:\nOther 19th-century usage.\n\"Darwinism\" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase \"survival of the fittest\" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck than to that of Darwin, and predated the publication of Darwin's theory in 1859. What is now called \"Social Darwinism\" was, in its day, synonymous with \"Darwinism\"\u2014the application of Darwinian principles of \"struggle\" to society, usually in support of anti-philanthropic political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin Francis Galton, was that \"Darwinism\" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on \"civilized\" people, it was possible for \"inferior\" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the gene pool) to overwhelm the \"superior\" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable\u2014the foundation of eugenics.\nIn Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term \"Darwinism\", and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and Ernst Haeckel developed what was known as \"Darwinismus\" in Germany, although, like Spencer's \"evolution\", Haeckel's \"Darwinism\" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centred on natural selection. In 1886, Alfred Russel Wallace went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called \"Darwinism\" without any problems.\nIn his book \"Darwinism\" (1889), Wallace had used the term \"pure-Darwinism\" which proposed a \"greater efficacy\" for natural selection. George Romanes dubbed this view as \"Wallaceism\", noting that in contrast to Darwin, this position was advocating a \"pure theory of natural selection to the exclusion of any supplementary theory.\" Taking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The latter was denied by Wallace who was a strict selectionist. Romanes' definition of Darwinism conformed directly with Darwin's views and was contrasted with Wallace's definition of the term.\nContemporary usage.\nThe term \"Darwinism\" is often used in the United States by promoters of creationism, notably by leading members of the intelligent design movement, as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an \"-ism\") based on philosophical naturalism, atheism, or both. For example, in 1993, UC Berkeley law professor and author Phillip E. Johnson made this accusation of atheism with reference to Charles Hodge's 1874 book \"What Is Darwinism?\" However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American botanist Asa Gray who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin's natural selection theory, before answering the question posed in the book's title by concluding: \"It is Atheism.\"\nCreationists use pejoratively the term \"Darwinism\" to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as dogmatic and inflexible in their belief. In the 2008 documentary film \"\", which promotes intelligent design (ID), American writer and actor Ben Stein refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for \"Scientific American\", John Rennie says \"The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas ... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to Marxism.\"\nHowever, \"Darwinism\" is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, which is sometimes called \"neo-Darwinism\", from those first proposed by Darwin. \"Darwinism\" also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, \"Darwinism\" may refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and gene flow. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the history of evolutionary thought\u2014particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nIn political discussions in the United States, the term is mostly used by its enemies. Biologist E. O. Wilson at Harvard University described the term as being \"a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of faith, like 'Maoism [...] Scientists don't call it 'Darwinism'.\" In the United Kingdom, the term often retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example British ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins wrote in his collection of essays \"A Devil's Chaplain\", published in 2003, that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.\nIn his 1995 book \"Darwinian Fairytales\", Australian philosopher David Stove used the term \"Darwinism\" in a different sense from the above examples. Describing himself as non-religious and as accepting the concept of natural selection as a well-established fact, Stove nonetheless attacked what he described as flawed concepts proposed by some \"Ultra-Darwinists\". Stove alleged that by using weak or false \"ad hoc\" reasoning, these Ultra-Darwinists used evolutionary concepts to offer explanations that were not valid: for example, Stove suggested that the sociobiological explanation of altruism as an evolutionary feature was presented in such a way that the argument was effectively immune to any criticism. English philosopher Simon Blackburn wrote a rejoinder to Stove, though a subsequent essay by Stove's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 James Franklin suggested that Blackburn's response actually \"confirms Stove's central thesis that Darwinism can 'explain' anything.\"\nIn more recent times, the Australian moral philosopher and professor Peter Singer, who serves as the Ira\u00a0W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, has proposed the development of a \"Darwinian left\" based on the contemporary scientific understanding of biological anthropology, human evolution, and applied ethics in order to achieve the establishment of a more equal and cooperative human society in accordance with the sociobiological explanation of altruism.\nEsoteric usage.\nIn evolutionary aesthetics theory, there is evidence that perceptions of beauty are determined by natural selection and therefore Darwinian; that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8412", "revid": "34765295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8412", "title": "Doraemon", "text": "Japanese manga series by Fujiko F. Fujio\n is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio. First serialized in 1969, the manga's chapters were collected in 45 volumes published by Shogakukan from 1974 to 1996. The story revolves around an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back in time from the 22nd century to assist a boy named Nobita Nobi in his day-to-day life.\nThe manga spawned a media franchise. It was adapted into three different anime TV series in 1973, 1979, and 2005. Additionally, Shin-Ei Animation has produced over forty animated films, including two 3D computer-animated films, all of which are distributed by Toho. Various types of merchandise and media have been developed, including soundtrack albums, video games, and musicals. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America, via Amazon Kindle, through a collaboration of Fujiko F. Fujio Pro with Voyager Japan and AltJapan Co., Ltd. The anime series was licensed by Disney for an English-language release in North America in 2014, and LUK International in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\"Doraemon\" was well-received by critics and became a commercial success in many Asian countries. It won numerous awards, including the Japan Cartoonists Association Award in 1973 and 1994, the Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga in 1982, and the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 1997. As of 2024, it has sold over 300 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. The character of Doraemon is considered a Japanese cultural icon, and was appointed as the first \"anime ambassador\" in 2008 by the country's Foreign Ministry.\nSynopsis.\nNobita Nobi is a ten-year-old Japanese school boy who is kind-hearted and honest, but also lazy, clumsy, and hapless, performing poorly in both school and sports. One day, a blue robot cat from the 22nd century named Doraemon is sent back to the past by Nobita's future great-great-grandson, Sewashi Nobi, to take care of Nobita so that his descendants can have a better life. Doraemon has a four-dimensional pocket in which he stores tools, inventions, and gadgets from the future to aid Nobita whenever he is faced with a problem. Although Doraemon is a cat robot, he has a fear of mice because of an incident where robotic mice chewed off his ears. This is why Doraemon lost his original yellow color and turned blue, from sadness.\nNobita has three main friends: Takeshi Goda (nicknamed Gian), Suneo Honekawa (Gian's sidekick), and Shizuka Minamoto, Nobita's best friend and love-interest. Gian is a strong, leading and domineering boy, but also loyal to his friends. Suneo is a wealthy and spoiled boy who uses his friendship with Gian to win the respect of other schoolmates. Shizuka is a gentle and kind girl who frequently plays with Nobita. Nobita has a crush on Shizuka; she is his prospective future wife (Nobita's future wife is initially Gian's younger sister). Although Gian and Suneo are Nobita's friends, they also typically bully and abuse him. Nobita normally responds by using Doraemon's gadgets to fight back against them, but Nobita has a tendency to get carried away with using the gadgets (or Gian and Suneo, if they steal it away), which typically results in unintended consequences for him and others.\nIn addition to Gian, Suneo, and Shizuka, Dorami and Hidetoshi Dekisugi are also recurring characters. Dorami is Doraemon's younger sister, and Dekisugi is a gifted student boy who as Shizuka's close friend, frequently attracts the jealousy of Nobita.\nProduction.\nDevelopment and themes.\n\"Doraemon\" was written and illustrated by Fujiko F. Fujio, the pen name of Japanese manga artist Hiroshi Fujimoto. According to Fujio, the series was originally conceived following a series of three events: when searching for ideas for a new manga, he wished a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him; during this, he tripped over his daughter's toy, and heard cats fighting in his neighborhood. To set up the plot and characters, he used some elements from his earlier manga series, \"Obake no Q-Tar\u014d\", which involve an living with humans, with a similar formula. Fujio said that the idea for \"Doraemon\" came after \"an accumulation of trial and error\", during which he finally found the most suitable style of manga to him. Initially, the series achieved little success as was well-known at the time, and it only became a hit after its adaptation into an anime TV series and multiple feature films.\n\"Doraemon\" is mainly aimed at children, so Fujio chose to create the character with a simple graphic style, based on shapes such as circles and ellipses. He used the same sequences of cartoons with regularity and continuity to enhance the reader's ease of understanding. In addition, blue, a characteristic color of Doraemon, was chosen as the main color in magazine publications, which used to have a yellow cover and red title. Set in Tokyo, the manga reflected parts of Japan's society, such as the class system and the \"ideal\" of Japanese childhood. Problems, if they occurred, were resolved in a way so as not to rely on violence and eroticism, and the stories were integrated with the concept of environmentalism. The manga also insisted on the ethical values of integrity, perseverance, courage, family and respect.\nIn order to underline the crucial role of the younger generation in society, the manga's creator chose to have the act carried out in a \"children's domain\" where young people can live with happiness, freedom and power without adult interference. As Saya S. Shiraishi noted, the existence of the \"domain\" helped \"Doraemon\" to have a strong appeal in various Asian countries. During \"Doraemon\"'s development, Fujio did not express a change in characters; he said, \"When a manga hero become a success, the manga suddenly stops being interesting. So the hero has to be like the stripes on a barber pole; he seems to keep moving upward, but actually he stays in the same place.\"\nAccording to Zensho Ito, Fujio's former student, the \"length\" of time in the universe is one of the ideas that inspired Fujio to make \"Doraemon\". Frequently displayed in its stories is Nobita's desire to control time, and there exist time-control gadgets that he uses to satisfy that desire, particularly the \"Time Machine\", which lies in his desk drawer. Unlike Western works of science fiction, the manga does not explain the theory nor the applied technology behind these tools, but instead focusing on how the characters exploit them to their advantage, making it more child-friendly.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe name \"Doraemon\" can be roughly translated to \"stray\". Unusually, the name is written in a mixture of two Japanese scripts: katakana () and hiragana (). \"Dora\" derives from , and is a corruption of nora (stray), while \"-emon\" (in kanji ) is an old-fashioned suffix for male names (for example, as in Ishikawa Goemon). Nobita's home address in Tsukimidai (\"moon-view-heights\"), Nerima refers to Fujimidai (\"Fuji-view-heights\"), where Osamu Tezuka's residence and animation studio is based. The name \"Nobita Nobi\" refers to \"nobi nobi\", meaning \"the way a young child grows up free, healthy, and happy, unrestrained in any sense\".\nGadgets.\nGadgets, or , are Doraemon's tools from the future, used to assist the characters. Fujio said that Doraemon has a total of 1,293 gadgets; according to a 2004 analysis by Yasuyuki Yokoyama of Toyama University, there are 1,963 gadgets found in 1,344 sketches. The most recurring gadgets include \"Take-Copter\", a small piece of headgear made out of bamboo that can allow its users to fly; \"Time Machine\", a machine used for time travel; \"Anywhere Door\", a pink-colored door that allows people to travel according to the thoughts of the person who turns the knob; \"Time Kerchief\", a handkerchief which can turn an object new or old or a person young or old; \"Translator Tool\", a cuboid jelly that allows one to converse in any language; and \"Designer\", a camera used to instantly dress-up the user.\nSaya S. Shiraishi wrote that most of the gadgets were \"an impressive testimony to the standards of quality control and innovation that exist in the twenty-second century\". The gadgets are an essential part of the series so as to reflect a positive point of view concerning the association of technology in children, and to express the wishes of modern society.\nConclusion.\nThe series ceased its original run in 1994 and was not given an ending before Fujimoto's death in 1996; this has since aroused numerous urban legends throughout the years. One of the most well-known \"endings\" of the manga was by an amateur manga cartoonist under the pen name \"Yasue T. Tajima\", first appearing on the Internet in 1998 and made into a manga in 2005. The story takes place when Doraemon's battery dies, and Nobita later grows up becoming a robot engineer, potentially reviving Doraemon and live a happy life. Tajima issued an apology making his own ending in 2007, and the profits were shared with Shogakukan and the copyright owner, Fujiko F. Fujio Pro.\nRy\u016bichi Yagi and Takashi Yamazaki, the directors of \"Stand by Me Doraemon\", confirmed that it had only one opening, while the ending has been rewritten several times. Because of this, Shogakukan had to clarify that only if the marriage of Nobita and Shizuka is finalized will the mission be accomplished, and then Doraemon will return to the future.\nMedia.\nManga.\nIn December 1969, the \"Doraemon\" manga appeared in six different children's monthly magazines published by Shogakukan: \"Yoiko\", \"Y\u014dchien\", \"Shogaku Ichi-nensei\", \"Shogaku Ni-nensei\", \"Shogaku San-nensei\", and \"Shogaku Yo-nensei\". The magazines were aimed at children from nursery school to fourth grade. In 1973, two other magazines, \"Shogaku Go-nensei\" and \"Shogaku Roku-nensei\" (aimed at fifth-grade and sixth-grade students respectively), started publishing the manga. In 1977, \"CoroCoro Comic\" was launched as the flagship magazine of \"Doraemon.\"\nSince the debut of \"Doraemon\" in 1969, the stories have been selectively collected into forty-five volumes that were published under Shogakukan's imprint from July 31, 1974, to April 26, 1996. These volumes are collected in the Takaoka Central Library in Toyama, Japan, where Fujio was born. Between April 25, 2005, and February 28, 2006, Sh\u014dgakukan published a series of five manga volumes under the title \"Doraemon Plus\" (\"Doraemon+\"), featuring short stories which did not appear in the forty-five original volumes; a sixth volume, the first volume in eight years, was published on December 1, 2014. Additionally, 119 unpublished stories were compiled into six colored-manga volumes under the title \"Doraemon Kara Sakuhin-shu\" , published from July 17, 1999, to September 2, 2006. Between July 24, 2009, and September 25, 2012, Shogakukan published a \"master works\" collection, consisting of twenty volumes with all 1,345 stories written by Fujio. In December 2019, on the 50th anniversary of \"Doraemon\", a \"Volume 0\" was published by Shogakukan featuring six different versions of Doraemon's first appearance.\nThere have been two series of bilingual, Japanese and English, volumes of the manga by Shogakukan English Comics under the title \"Doraemon: Gadget Cat from the Future\", and two audio versions. The first series has ten volumes and the second one has six. 21st Century Publishing House released bilingual English-Chinese versions in mainland China, and Chingwin Publishing Group released bilingual English-Chinese versions in Taiwan.\nIn July 2013, Fujiko F. Fujio Pro announced that they would be collaborating with ebook publisher Voyager Japan and localization company AltJapan Co., Ltd. to release an English-language version of the manga in full color digitally via the Amazon Kindle platform in North America. Shogakukan released the first volume in November 2013; by 2016, a total of 200 volumes have been published. The English version incorporates a variety of changes to character names; Nobita is \"Noby\", Shizuka is \"Sue\", Suneo is \"Sneech\", and Gian is \"Big G\", while the food dorayaki is \"Yummy Bun/Fudgy Pudgy Pie\". Also, by 2016, four volumes of the manga had been published in English in print by Shogakukan Asia.\nShogakukan started digital distribution of all forty-five original volumes throughout Japan from July 16, 2015.\nLong Stories.\n\"Doraemon's Long Tales\", also known as \"Doraemon's Long Stories\", is a manga and movie series ongoing since 1979, featuring longer and continuous narratives about the characters' adventures into various lands of science fiction and fantasy. The series consists of twenty-four tank\u014dbon volumes published from 1983 to 2004.\nSpin-offs.\nSeveral spin-off manga series of \"Doraemon\" have been made. \"The Doraemons\", a manga illustrated by Michiaki Tanaka based on \"Doraemon\", was published by Shogakukan in six \"tank\u014dbon\" volumes from 1996 to 2001. Between 1997 and 2003, Shogakukan also published fifteen volumes of \"The Doraemons Special\", created by Yukihiro Mitani and Masaru Miyazaki as a complement part of \"The Doraemons\", including twelve from the main series and three from the \"Robot Training School Edition\". \"Dorabase\", a baseball-themed manga written and illustrated by Mugiwara Shintar\u014d, is another spin-off of \"Doraemon\"; twenty-three volumes of the manga were published by Shogakukan from April 26, 2001, to October 28, 2011.\nAnime.\nThe first attempt of a \"Doraemon\" animated series was in 1973, by Nippon Television. After a January 1973 pilot named \"Doraemon Mirai Kara Yattekuru\" , twenty-six episodes, each with two segments, were broadcast on Nippon TV from April 1 to September 30 of the same year. The series was directed by Mitsuo Kaminashi with a voice cast from Aoni Production; Doraemon was voiced by K\u014dsei Tomita, then later by Masako Nozawa. Later in the series, the animation studio, Nippon TeleMovie Productions, went bankrupt, and the masters were sold off or destroyed. The series re-aired on Nippon TV and several local stations until 1979, when Shogakukan requested Toyama Television to cease broadcasting. Some of the segments were found in the archives of Imagica in 1995, and some others were recovered by Jun Masami in 2003. As of 2013, 21 of 52 segments are known to survive, two of which have no audio.\n\"Doraemon\" remained fairly exclusive in manga form until 1979 when an animation studio, Shin-Ei Animation (now owned by TV Asahi) produced an animated second attempt of \"Doraemon\". The series debuted on TV Asahi on April 2, 1979. Ryo Motohira served as chief director from 1981, and Tsutomu Shibayama from 1984. Eiichi Nakamura served as director of character design, while Shunsuke Kikuchi served as composer. Nobuyo \u014cyama voiced Doraemon in the series; because of this, in Asia, this version is sometimes referred to as the \u014cyama Edition. In total, 1,787 episodes were produced and released in VHS and DVD by Toho. On April 15, 2005, a major renewal premiered; it includes the replacement of voice actors and staff, and updated character designs. The third series is sometimes referred to in Asia as the Mizuta Edition, as a tribute for the voice actress for Doraemon, Wasabi Mizuta. It was released in DVD on February 10, 2006, under the title \"New TV-ban Doraemon\" with a Shogakukan Video banner.\nIn May 2014, TV Asahi Corporation announced an agreement with The Walt Disney Company to bring the 2005 series to the Disney XD television channel and Disney Channel in the United States beginning in the summer of that year. Besides using the name changes that were used in AltJapan's English adaptation of the original manga, other changes and edits had also been made to make the show more accessible to an American audience, such as Japanese text being replaced with English text on certain objects like signs and graded papers, items such as yen notes being replaced by US dollar bills, and the setting being changed from Japan to the United States. Initial response to the edited dub was positive. The Disney adaptation began broadcast in Japan on Disney Channel on February 1, 2016. The broadcast offered the choice of the English dub or a newly recorded Japanese track by the Japanese cast of the 2005 series.\nThe anime has been aired in over sixty countries worldwide. It premiered in Thailand in 1982, the Philippines in 1999, India in 2005, and Vietnam in 2010. Other Asian countries and regions that broadcast the series include China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea. The series is licensed in EMEA regions by LUK International; it premiered in Spain in 1993 and France in 2003. It has also been distributed in South American countries, including Brazil, Colombia, and Chile. In 2017, POPS Worldwide, a Vietnamese multimedia company, collaborated with TV Asahi to release the anime series on YouTube and other digital platforms.\nFilms.\nAs of 2025, there have been 44 annual feature-length animated films produced by Shin-Ei Animation and released by Toho. The first twenty-five films are based on the 1979 anime, while the rest are based on the 2005 anime. Unlike the anime and manga series, the films are more action-adventure oriented, taking the familiar characters of \"Doraemon\" and placing them in a variety of exotic and perilous settings.\nA 3D computer-animated film, \"Stand by Me Doraemon,\" released in Japan on August 8, 2014. Directed by Takashi Yamazaki and Ry\u016bichi Yagi, it combines elements from the short stories of the manga series: \"All the Way from the Country of the Future\", \"Imprinting Egg\", \"Goodbye, Shizuka-chan\", \"Romance in Snowy Mountain\", \"Nobita's the Night Before a Wedding\", and \"Goodbye, Doraemon\u00a0...\" into a new complete story, from the first time Doraemon came to Nobita's house to Doraemon bidding farewell to Nobita. The film was a box office success, grossing $183.4 million worldwide. A sequel, \"Stand by Me Doraemon 2\", also directed by Yamazaki and Yagi, was released on November 20, 2020.\nShort films, OVA and crossover.\nSeveral \"Doraemon\" short films were produced and released between 1989 and 2004. These include ', a film about the life of Doraemon from birth before coming to Nobita; ', a film about the events related to the marriage of Nobita and Shizuka; \"The Day When I Was Born\" and \"\", the films about the relationship between Nobita and his parents along with his grandmother. Other short films focus on Dorami and The Doraemons. In 1981, Toho released \"What Am I for Momotaro\", a film about Momotar\u014d, the hero of Japanese folklore.\nIn 1994, an educational OVA was made, titled \"Doraemon: Nobita to Mirai Note\" , where the main characters express the hope for a better Earth. The OVA was released in DVD along with the 13th issue of \"Fujiko F. Fujio Wonderland\" magazine in September 2004. A crossover episode of \"Doraemon\" with \"\" aired on TV Asahi on November 9, 2018.\nMusic.\nThe soundtrack of the 1973 anime series was composed by Nobuyoshi Koshibe, who also arranged the opening theme song and the ending theme song , both performed by Harumi Nait\u014d. For the 1979 anime, Shunsuke Kikuchi was the composer, who arranged ; it had been performed by numerous singers, including Kumiko \u014csugi and Satoko Yamano. When the anime got a reboot in 2005, Kan Sawada was the composer of the series. There are four other opening themes, including an instrumental version of \"Doraemon no Uta\" performed by Twelve Girls Band; \"Hagushichao\" performed by Rimi Natsukawa; \"Yume wo Kanaete Doraemon\" , the opening theme broadcast from 2007 to 2018; and \"Doraemon\" performed by Gen Hoshino, broadcast since October 2019.\nNumerous collections of theme songs of the anime series and feature films were initially available in cassettes. Since the 1990s, \"Doraemon\" songs have been released in CD, under the type of singles and compilation albums. Soundtracks of \"Doraemon\" feature films have been released by Nippon Columbia since 2001 in the album series .\nMusical shows.\n\"Doraemon\" has been adapted into a musical, titled . Based on the 1990 anime film , it debuted at Tokyo Metropolitan Art Space on September 4, 2008, running through September 14. Shoji Kokami was the director and writer, Makoto Sakamoto played Nobita and Reiko Suho as Shizuka; Jaian and Suneo were portrayed by Tomohiro Waki and Kensaku Kobayashi, respectively; Wasabi Mizuta voiced Doraemon. The musical was later revived and ran at Sunshine Theater, Tokyo from March 26 to April 2, 2017, then later in other prefectures including Fukuoka, Osaka, Miyagi and Aichi. The 2017 revival is also directed and written by Kokami, with Mizuta reprising her role; Nobita, Shizuka, Jaian and Suneo were played by Yuuchi Ogoe, Hina Higuchi, Koki Azuma and Sh\u014d Jinnai, respectively.\nVideo games.\nMany Japanese-only video games based on \"Doraemon\" have been developed. For instance, in 1983, Bandai developed , an arcade game inspired by Pac-Man. \"Doraemon\", a NES video game made by Hudson Soft, was released on December 12, 1986, and became one of the best-selling games of that year in Japan with over 1.15 million copies sold. On December 6, 2007, Sega published \"Doraemon Wii\", the first \"Doraemon\" video game released on Wii. Doraemon can also be seen in Namco's \"Taiko no Tatsujin\" rhythm game series, such as in \"Taiko no Tatsujin: Sesson de Dodon ga Don!\" (2017). The first Doraemon game to receive a Western release was \"Doraemon Story of Seasons\" (2019). Card games with \"Doraemon\" themes have also been made in several special occasions, sometimes to exploit the popularity of feature films. In 2016, a special edition of \"Uno\" about the series' characters was released exclusively in Japan, as a result of a cooperation between Asatsu-DK and Mattel. In April 2025, CTW announced , the first online browser game based on the series, on its gaming platform G123.\nMerchandise.\nIn Japan, the \"Doraemon\" merchandising rights belong to Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions, which has produced and distributed a wide range of products under its brand, such as toys, food, stationery, action figures, , shoes, clothing, and others. Several companies have collaborated on the creation and distribution of products on the series and its characters, including Sanrio, Converse, Moleskine, and ESP Guitars, which has made guitars decorated with \"Doraemon\" characters; a further partnership of \"Doraemon\" with Uniqlo led to a line of clothing designed by Takashi Murakami. The \"Doraemon\" franchise has also collaborated with various Japanese brands, including Tsi Groove &amp; Sports's \"Jack Bunny!!\" golf apparel brand, Unicharm's \"MamiPoko\" diaper brand, and the video games \"LINE Pop 2\", \"Monster Strike\", and \"Granblue Fantasy\". Viz Media owns the \"Doraemon\" merchandising rights in North and Latin America, which has developed \"Doraemon\"-themed clothing and collectibles in collaboration with retail chain Hot Topic, and themed Happy Meals in a 2015 collaboration with McDonald's. Viz Media Europe (now Crunchyroll EMEA) manages the merchandising in Europe except Spain and Portugal; LUK International has obtained licenses in these two countries.\nCharacters from \"Doraemon\" have been used in advertising through specific agreements with Shogakukan. For instance, following the Cool Japan initiative promoted by the Japanese government, Sharp Corporation produced a series of commercials featuring the characters of Doraemon and Nobita, which were broadcast in several ASEAN countries. In late 2011, Shogakukan and Toyota Motor Corporation joined forces to create a series of live-action commercials as part of Toyota's ReBorn ad campaign, which depicted the manga's characters two decades after being grown up, where Hollywood actor Jean Reno played Doraemon.\nReception.\nGeneral.\n\"Doraemon\" is considered one of the best-known manga of all time, a true Japanese cultural icon, and an essential part of family life of the Japanese post-war generation. Akihiro Motoyama observed that \"mothers who watched the movies when they were children are now taking their own children to see them\". It was also commercially successful: over 108 million volumes were sold in Japan by 1996. The 1979 and 2005 anime series also achieved high ratings on television. With the film \"\", the \"Doraemon\" anime film series reached 100 million tickets sold at the Japanese box office, surpassing \"Godzilla\" as the highest-grossing film franchise in Japan. By 2015, it had sold over 103 million tickets, and was the largest franchise by numbers of admissions in the country.\n\"Doraemon\" was also a hit in other parts of Asia, and is considered an archetypical example of Japanese soft power, although it has been published without a license in some countries. The anime television series is available in over 60 countries, and reportedly getting high ratings in at least 30 countries. However, \"Doraemon\" has been less successful in Western countries, due to being viewed by many as a children-only series, and there were tight restrictions about publishing manga and broadcasting anime series the region. The manga had sold over 170 million copies worldwide by 2012; over 250 million by 2019; and over 300 million by 2024. Estimates show that \"Doraemon\" has generated at least more than $ in merchandise sales by 2019, and over $1.7 billion from feature films by 2020, making it one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\nOutside Japan, \"Doraemon\" achieved particular success in Vietnam, with a record-breaking 40 million copies sold by 2006. The manga was first launched there in 1992 by Kim \u0110\u1ed3ng Publishing House, but the copyright from Shogakukan was not fully acquired until 1996. In 1993, the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture considered the manga's publication to be \"an impactful event for the improvement of children, youth and adult's likings\u00a0... [\"Doraemon\"] is a comprehensively educational book series which has the effect of developing children's personality\". Doraemon is now a cultural icon in Vietnam, having been featured at many cultural events.\nCritical reception and analysis.\n\"Doraemon\" has received favorable reviews. Critic Mark Schilling wrote, \"For kids whose lives are often so regulated, Doraemon represents a welcome breath of freedom and a glimpse of a funnier, friendlier world where all dreams, even foolish ones, can come true.\" Italian writer Massimo Nicora wrote that the manga \"can be interpreted as a type of book that criticizes, with irony, the omnipotence of science that pretends to solve every problem with its tools\", alluding to the fact that Doraemon's gadgets often end up making the problems even worse than they initially were, more than anything else. He added that it represents \"the metaphor of the childish imagination, which always manages to find the most bizarre and original solutions, in a continuous game of transformation of reality\".\nSome critics considered that Nobita's flawed personality and modest background is different from the special or extraordinary characteristics usually seen in other typical anime and manga protagonists; this portrayal has been seen as reasons of its appeal as well as the contrary, especially in the United States. According to the Italian Parents Movement (Moige), in the manga, \"the lazy Nobita does not know any kind of appreciable evolution\", though there are still good points including \"the criticism of bullying, the goodness that transpires from the little Nobita and the positive figure of Shizuka\".\nIn his 2000 article, Leo Ching explained that the success of \"Doraemon\" in Asia was due to reflecting Asian values such as imagination and responsibility, the same reason that \"Oshin\", another Japanese cultural export, became well known there. On the other hand, according to an analysis by Anne Allison, professor of cultural anthropology at Duke University, the strong point of it was not the variety of the gadgets, but the relationship between Doraemon and Nobita, which was particularly appreciated. Jason Thompson praised the \"silly situations\" and \"old fashioned, simple artwork\", with Doraemon's expression and comments adding to the \"surrounding elementary-school mischief\". On the manga's 50th anniversary, an op-ed published on \"Asahi Shimbun\" stated that the manga \"has already become a contemporary classic\".\nAwards, accolades and public recognition.\n\"Doraemon\" has received numerous accolades. It won the Japan Cartoonists Association Award twice in 1973 and 1994, the former for the Excellence Award while the latter for the Minister of Education, Science and Technology Award. In 1982, it received the first Shogakukan Manga Award for children's manga. In 1997, the manga won the Grand Prize at the first Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize. The 1979 series won the award from the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs four times for best television series in 1984, 1985, 1988 and 1989.\nA 2006 poll among 80,000 Japanese fans for the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival placed \"Doraemon\" at fifth among the top ten best manga of all time. The 2005 and 2006 surveys conducted by TV Asahi found the \"Doraemon\" anime ranked fifth and third, respectively, among the 100 favorite anime series of all time. In 2010, a survey conducted by researchers of Tokyo Polytechnic University found that most responders considered \"Doraemon\", along with \"Dragon Ball\" franchise, to be the anime series that best represents Cool Japan. In a 2013 survey, \"Doraemon\" was found to be the best anime recommended for foreign people.\nCriticism.\n\"Doraemon\" has been blamed for having a negative impact on children, due to the controversial traits of the characters in the anime. The character has received criticism in China, where some media outlets considered Doraemon to be a politically subversive character and that it was a tool of Japan's \"cultural invasion\". Some education groups in Taiwan demanded the anime to be banned, as the plot involves bullying, which was feared would encourage campus bullying. In 2016, a resolution to ban the Hindi-dubbed \"Doraemon\" anime series was submitted in Pakistan. Around the same time, legal notices were served against several companies in India, targeting \"Doraemon\" and \"Crayon Shin-chan\" for bans (which did not materialize), as having an adverse effect on children. Disney Channel India, the regional broadcaster of the anime, was banned in Bangladesh and Pakistan due to the non-availability of localized dubs for content including \"Doraemon\".\nCultural impact and legacy.\nThe \"Doraemon\" manga has inspired many other mangakas; these include Eiichiro Oda, the creator of \"One Piece\" with the idea of \"Devil Fruits\", and Masashi Kishimoto, the creator of \"Naruto\", who drew characters from anime shows during his childhood, including Doraemon. The manga has also been referenced in \"Gin Tama\" and \"Great Teacher Onizuka\". The character Doraemon is considered one of the most recognizable cultural icons in Japan, and one of the most well-known characters in manga history; some critics compared his popularity with that of Mickey Mouse and Snoopy. Mark Schilling noted that Doraemon's \"Take-Copter\" is familiar among Japanese people \"just as Snoopy's biplane is familiar to most Americans\".\nOn April 22, 2002, in the special issue of \"Asian Hero\" in \"Time\" magazine, Doraemon was the only anime character to be named one of the twenty-two Asian Heroes, and was described as \"The Cuddliest Hero in Asia\". A 2007 poll by Oricon shown that Doraemon was the second-strongest manga character ever, behind only Son Goku of \"Dragon Ball\". Doraemon is also referred as something with the ability to satisfy all wishes.\nIn 2005, the Taiwan Society of New York selected \"Doraemon\" as a culturally significant work of Japanese otaku pop-culture in its exhibit \"Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture\", curated by renowned artist Takashi Murakami. In 2008, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed Doraemon as the first anime cultural ambassador; a Ministry spokesperson explained the decision as an attempt to help people in other countries better understand anime and to deepen their interest in Japanese culture. On September 3, 2012, Doraemon was granted official residence in the city of Kawasaki, Kanagawa, one hundred years before he was born. In the same year, Hong Kong celebrated the birthday of Doraemon 100 years early with a series of displays of the character. In April 2013, Doraemon was chosen as Japan's ambassador in Tokyo's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics. He appeared in the 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony to promote the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\nA Fujiko F. Fujio museum opened in Kawasaki on September 3, 2011, featuring Doraemon as the star of the museum. The National Museum of Singapore held a time-travelling exhibition in October 2020 as a tribute to the manga. After the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, Shogakukan released an earthquake survival guidebook, which included the main cast of the \"Doraemon\" manga series. TV Asahi launched the \"Doraemon Fund\" charity fund to raise money for natural disasters in 2004 and 2011. In 2020, the Mumbai's Sion Friends Circle group distributed food and books to children using mascots, one being Doraemon, to those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Vietnam, a Doraemon scholarship fund was established in 1996, and the Doraemon character has been used for education of traffic safety. \"Doraemon\"'s creator, Fujiko F. Fujio, received the Culture Fighter Medal from the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture in 1996 for his contributions to youth education through the manga.\nMany prominent figures have been nicknamed after the cast of \"Doraemon\": politician Osamu Fujimura is known as the \"Doraemon of Nagatacho\" due to his figure and warm personality, and sumo wrestler Takamisugi was nicknamed \"Doraemon\" because of his resemblance to the character. In 2015, a group of people in a drought-affected village in northern Thailand used a Doraemon toy to complete a rain-ritual, in order to avoid controversies that would occur by using real animals.\nA parody of \"Doraemon\" created by Hikari Fujisaki, titled \"Nozoemon\" , was first serialized in Nihon Bungeisha's \"Comic Heaven\" magazine in September 2014, with the compiled book volume released on June 9, 2015; however, it was discontinued in August 2015 due to content issues.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8414", "revid": "49281287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8414", "title": "Dartmoor Preservation Association", "text": "English conservation charity\nDartmoor Preservation Association (DPA) is one of the oldest environmental or amenity bodies in the UK. It was founded in 1883. It concerns itself with Dartmoor, a National Park in Devon, south-west England. It began with two main areas of concern. Firstly, commoners' rights were being eroded through army use, including the firing of live artillery shells, and piecemeal enclosure of land around the margins. Secondly, there was increasing public interest in Dartmoor's scenery, archaeology, history and wildlife\nThe DPA has opposed what it considered to be unsuitable developments on Dartmoor throughout its history. In its founding year, the secretary, Robert Burnard persuaded the War Department not to fire on the Okehampton Firing Range on Saturdays to allow access to the public. Many battles have been fought since, particularly against the military presence and the proposed building of reservoirs on the moor, notably under the Chairmanship of Lady Sayer, granddaughter of Robert Burnard.\nThe DPA continues to follow the same objectives as when it was founded. For example, in June 2015, it supported the inhabitants of Widecombe-in-the-Moor against the erecting of a telecommunications mast in an area of pristine countryside against the wishes of the local population.\nDartmoor Preservation Association is a registered charity, Number 215665.\nBackground.\nDartmoor is said to be one of the last remaining areas of wilderness in Britain, but it has been a managed landscape since the late Neolithic (3,000-2,500 BCE). The Bronze Age inhabitants (from 2,500 to 750 BCE) cleared ancient forest and developed farming. They made extensive use of surface moorstone in the construction of roundhouses (their remains now seen as \"hut circles\"), enclosures, land-dividing reaves, stone rows, stone circles, menhirs and kistvaens.\nFarming has continued through the medieval period to the present day, but a more disruptive activity to the landscape was the appearance of tin-mining, firstly by stream-working, then by lode-working and finally by underground mining. Many valleys have been dug over and scarred, leaving a rich industrial archaeology. Other activities such as newtake wall building, peat cutting, rabbit warrening, quarrying, clay extraction and the building of a prominent prison have all left marks on the moor. Recent undertakings have left more obvious changes: the building of reservoirs and the planting of conifer forests.\nHistory of the association.\nThe use of moorstone continued up to recent times with the extensive building of dry stone walls around farm newtakes. Later, stone was cut and dressed. The use of moorstone continued to such an extent that in 1847 boundary markers were cut around Pew Tor to protect it. Marker stones were erected around Roos Tor. The taking of stone started to change the Dartmoor landscape: for example Eric Hemery (writing in 1983) stated that Swell Tor had been \"decapitated and disembowelled by the quarrymen\".\nIn August 1881, a public meeting was convened by the Portreeve of Tavistock in the Guildhall to discuss the continued taking of stone, particularly from landmark tors. The DPA was founded in 1883. The protected area around Pew Tor was extended in December 1896. In 1901, the DPA commissioned a report into damage to ancient monuments, caused by the taking of stone for building and road-mending, and into unlawful enclosures of common land.\nCommoners' rights.\nThe first publication of the DPA, in 1890, was a short history of commoners' rights on Dartmoor and the commons of Devon. This notes a decrease in the numbers of animals even in medieval times: in 1296 \u2013 5,000 cattle, 487 horses, 131 folds of sheep; in 1316 \u2013 3,292 cattle, 368 horses, 100 folds of sheep. \"An important battle occurred in 1894 when the Corporation of London attempted to buy the whole of Dartmoor in order to pipe its water to Paddington alongside Brunel\u2019s recently converted railway, when it went from broad gauge to standard gauge. The DPA led the revolt against this\". In 1897, the DPA went to court to fight successfully the enclosure of a section of Peter Tavy Great Common, in support of a farmer. Commoners rights seem to have been a settled issue in recent years: except for where they are impinged upon by the military presence.\nMilitary use.\nDartmoor Training Area has been used regularly for military training since 1873, although it was used earlier during the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars. In 1906\u201307, seven miles of roads were built on the north moor to facilitate the movement of guns. There are three established firing ranges at Okehampton, Willsworthy and Merrivale. The area taken up with live firing ranges is and they are used on average 120 days each year. They are used for small arms, mortars and artillery smoke and illuminating shells.\nThe use of the moor by the military has been a major concern of the DPA since its founding. In its first year, Robert Burnard (DPA Secretary) persuaded the War Department not to fire on the Okehampton Firing Range on Saturdays so that there may be some public access to the area. Lady Sylvia Sayer was very outspoken about it being totally at odds with the area being designated as a National Park. In 1963 the DPA published a widely circulated 24-page booklet entitled \"Misuse of a National Park\" which includes photographs of unexploded shells lying on the open moor, corrugated iron buildings, large craters, a derelict tank used as a target, bullet marks on standing stones, etc. It also contains details of a 1958 incident in which a young boy was killed by a mortar shell near Cranmere Pool.\nSince the 1960s there has been much less military damage and litter as a result of the DPA persuading the Services to be more cautious. The military have changed since the Victorian era, they now have 120 conservation groups across the Ministry of Defence (MOD), including Dartmoor Military Conservation Group. The current leases run for many years, with Cramber Tor most recently being granted a further 40-year licence.\nAfforestation.\nEarly afforestation occurred when Brimpts was planted with trees in 1862. The Forestry Commission was founded in 1919, following World War I and in that year the Duchy of Cornwall planted 800 acres of conifers at Fernworthy. In 1921, Plymouth Corporation planted conifers around Burrator Reservoir. The Forestry Commission planted Bellever and Laughter Tor farms in 1930-32 and in 1944-1945 Soussons Down was also planted. The DPA opposed these post-war plantings and R. Hansford Worth (1868\u20131950, a Plymouth engineer, scientist and antiquarian) delivered a lecture fiercely critical of the Duchy of Cornwall as the landowners at The Plymouth Athenaeum, using the argument of encroachment on the rights of common and loss of ancient monuments. DPA opposition to forestry on Dartmoor arose again in 1953 when it wrote a policy on woodlands in the then-new national park. Opposition was exercised when Hawn, Dendles and High House Wastes, all near Cornwood, were designated for tree planting in 1959. Argument continued while Hawns and Dendles Wastes were ploughed in 1960. High House Waste was purchased by the DPA in 1964 and the Nature Conservancy (UK) bought neighbouring Dendles in 1965. The situation in 2015 is that some of the Dartmoor plantations have been affected by the fungal disease Phytophthora ramorum which results in widespread clear felling to prevent further spread of the disease. The policy now is to replant with more native hardwood trees although more resistant conifers are also being used.\nReservoirs.\nThere are eight Dartmoor reservoirs, with the earliest being Tottiford Reservoir, 1861. Three were built in the mid-20th century: Fernworthy, 1942; Avon, 1957 and Meldon, 1972, and the DPA fought many battles over these. It opposed plans for reservoirs on Brent Moor (1899) and Holne Moor (1901) where, later, the Avon Reservoir and Venford Reservoirs were respectively built. The DPA's opposition was supported in the House of Commons with argument made regarding the effects on the local water table. The DPA was one of many local and national amenity bodies that fought the building of the Meldon dam. The preservation battle for the Meldon valley was recorded in a DPA publication. The DPA offered a viable alternative site, Gorhuish Valley, for various reasons, including the fact that minerals such as arsenic would leach into the water supply if Meldon were selected. The Meldon story was discussed many times in Parliament. Another battle was fought against the flooding of the Swincombe valley to form another reservoir. This was rejected in parliament in 1970, revived in 1974 and finally resolved by the building of the Roadford Reservoir to the west of the moor. In 1985 the DPA used funds from a bequest to purchase 50 acres of land where the dam of a reservoir at Swincombe would have to be.\nNational Park designation.\nThe National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 led to Dartmoor being one of the first four parks to be designated, by an order made on 15 August 1951 and confirmed on 30 October 1951. Shortly after this, the DPA tried to ensure that the new National Park was run by an independent committee and not by the Dartmoor Standing Committee that was a subcommittee of Devon County Council Planning Committee. The committee was reformed as Dartmoor National Park Committee under the Local Government Act 1972 but it was still a subcommittee of Devon County Council and as such it was not seen to be an independent guardian of the moor by the DPA. It was not until 1997 that an independent Dartmoor National Park Authority was enabled under the Environment Act 1995 as a free-standing local authority, forty-four years after the park was created, although it is still dominated by local authorities and government appointees.\nNorth Hessary Tor TV mast.\nThe DPA learned in October 1951 that the BBC planned to build a 750-foot television mast on North Hessary Tor, near Princetown, that was erected in 1955. This was to be a relay from a transmitting station at Wenvoe, South Wales. The DPA objected to this threat and sought expert opinion, offered alternative solutions, pressed for a public enquiry, engaged a lawyer, held public meetings, distributed pamphlets, wrote to the press and petitioned parliament. Eventually, a public enquiry was announced. When the decision was made to permit the mast, there were a number of conditions, included among them was that the development was built near the tor, leaving it still intact, and that its new approach road should not be fenced. During the process of obtaining land for the transmitter, one MP asked in the House of Commons: \"Will the Assistant Postmaster-General bear in mind that we have no desire to hinder the provision of this station but that it is felt that ancient common rights such as these, that have existed for a thousand years, should be adequately protected or properly extinguished by due process of law?\"\nSharpitor.\nDuring World War II, the Royal Air Force (RAF) built a mast and buildings on Peek Hill, as RAF Sharpitor. In 1956, permission was granted to rebuild the station as part of the \"Gee\" radio navigation system, to be occupied for ten years. There followed delay in leaving and a proposal was made in 1970 by Devon &amp; Cornwall Police to use the mast, which was rejected. Then later that year Plymouth Corporation wanted to use the exposed site for housing juvenile offenders. This was also rejected, but Plymouth appealed. At a public enquiry in June 1973 Lady Sylvia Sayer represented the DPA and permission for development on the site was refused. A few years later, DPA fought successfully in support of South West Water (SWW) against renewed calls for a new reservoir at Swincombe. To mark the victory, Sylvia Sayer asked SWW if DPA could purchase the rocky outcrop of Sharpitor. The DPA purchased 32 acres in February 1984.\nOkehampton bypass.\nOkehampton lies on the A30 main road, the shortest route from London to west Devon and Cornwall. The need for a bypass was mooted in 1963. In 1975, three routes were considered: a northern route through mainly farmland, a central route using a railway, and a southern route through Dartmoor National Park. In August 1976, the Department of the Environment announced the preferred route was through the National Park. A major event on the timeline of this project was a 96-day public enquiry from 1 May 1979 to 4 February 1980 held in Okehampton. In March 1984, the DPA with other organisations petitioned Parliament opposing compulsory purchase orders on public open spaces. The Secretary of State announced in July 1985 that he was introducing a bill to reverse the decision of a Joint Parliamentary Committee and confirm a route through the National Park. This was followed by a confirmation bill in November 1985 that was passed in the House of Lords on 5 December 1985. Construction started in November 1986 and the road was opened on 19 July 1988.\nSince 2000.\nThe DPA continues to follow the same objectives as when it was founded. The activities have widened, involving local partners, it has a calendar of events, walks and work days with its Conservation Team undertaking a variety of moorland projects, it funds the supply of walking boots to some children who need them for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme through the Moor Boots Scheme, it collaborates with the Campaign for National Parks, it monitors the activities of Dartmoor National Park Authority who run the National Park. It objected to eight planning proposals (with success in seven cases), with many other achievements in the DPA Director's Annual Report. The DPA remains true to its original objectives and has also added other activities in support of Dartmoor and its inhabitants.\nChina clay expansion.\nThe china clay industry on Dartmoor was established long before the DPA was founded. The earliest record of a china clay pit refers to Hook Lake in 1502. The area was surveyed around 1827 by Cornishmen with thirty years experience in the clay industry. They obtained a 21-year lease in 1830, from the Earl of Morley who owned the land, to work the area between Lee Moor and Shaugh Moor. A rival pit was opened at Leftlake in about 1850 and at Hemerdon and Broomage in about 1855. Further pits were opened at Cholwichtown, Whitehill Yeo and Wigford Down/Brisworthy (circa 1860). Others followed at Smallhanger and Headon in the 1870s. Redlake started working in 1910. China clay pits are open cast mines that result in large holes in the ground accompanied by large waste tips. Over time, the pits become larger and more ground is needed for the waste, changing the landscape: the effect of this can be seen from space.\nThe DPA argues that this is an activity that does not agree with the ethos of a National Park, whose purpose is to protect landscape from unsuitable development. In 1994, the National Park boundaries were changed to include common land at Shaugh Moor and exclude china clay worked land at Lee Moor. The DPA revived its campaign with the publication of a booklet in 1999 when the Blackabrook Valley, Crownhill Down and Shaugh Moor, near the popular tourist area of Cadover Bridge, all came under threat from exploitation or dumping of waste. The china clay companies relinquished planning permissions in 2001. However, in November 2009, the clay companies, Sibelco and Imerys, produced a report reviewing old mineral permissions under the Environment Act 1995 with a view to joining up two pits. A presumed Bronze Age barrow, known as Emmets Post, was to be removed and three other monuments may be affected. The DPA were recorded twice, with other bodies, in a Devon County Council Development Management Committee Report for their representations in securing the future of the three areas where planning permissions were relinquished in 2001. Oxford Archaeology held an open day during their excavation of Emmets Post in 2014 prior to its removal.\nHouse of Lords reception.\nThe DPA and Exmoor Society held a joint reception at the House of Lords on 6 November 2008, hosted by Baroness Mallalieu, to lobby members of both Houses of Parliament and relevant Ministers about ensuring that environmental schemes for the uplands are \"fit for purpose\". Both organisations funded an invited number of upland hill farmers to attend.\nWhitehorse Hill excavation.\nThe excavation in August 2011 on the north moor of a Bronze Age burial kistvaen, or cist, that was originally uncovered in 2001 was part-funded by the DPA, along with other bodies.\nSouth West Uplands Federation Conference.\nA conference for the upland farmers of Bodmin Moor, Exmoor and Dartmoor was held as a joint venture between the South West Uplands Federation and the DPA. It was run by the DPA at Exeter Racecourse in October 2012, with 150 delegates. Speakers came from the Foundation for Common Land, the Forest of Dartmoor Commoners, the University of Gloucestershire, the National Farmers Union of England and Wales and the Open Spaces Society. The CEO raised sponsorship from Dartmoor National Park, Exmoor National Park, Natural England, Duchy of Cornwall and the Exmoor Society - this reflecting the standing of the DPA with those bodies.\nUndergrounding power cables.\nTwo major projects to underground overhead power cables in Dartmoor National Park have been completed in a joint project between Western Power Distribution, the South West Protected Landscapes Forum (SWPLF) and Dartmoor National Park Authority. The two schemes on Holne Moor and Walkhampton Common between them remove nearly 6\u00a0km of overhead line from open moorland. At nearly 5\u00a0km, the Walkhampton scheme is the largest to be undertaken in the South West region by Western Power Distribution. The old overhead line was readily visible from the B3212 Princetown to Yelverton Road, strung across Walkhampton Common from Devil's Elbow to just above Horseyeatt at Peek Hill. The works to provide the new underground supply were mainly undertaken on the highway to minimise the impact on the sensitive moorland landscape, its archaeology, wildlife and livestock. The DPA has supported the undergrounding of these visually intrusive power lines for many years.\nThe Dartmoor Conservation Garden.\nThe Dartmoor Conservation Garden is a joint project between DPA and Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) and is located in the Jack Wigmore Garden behind the High Moorland Centre in Princetown: this is a memorial garden to a former Chair of the Authority. It is planted with a cross-section of typical native Dartmoor plants. It also houses some typical Dartmoor archaeological features, such as a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age burial kistvaen (or cist) and a medieval granite cross from Ter Hill. This marked the Monk's Path but was constantly being pushed over by cattle. The purpose of the Garden is to illustrate the biodiversity on Dartmoor. The project came online in June 2015.\nWidecombe telecommunications mast.\nThe DPA were involved in a campaign in June 2015 against four telecommunications masts planned for Dartmoor, with the first to be erected in the village of Widecombe. At short notice, the DPA banners were taken out, letters written, press interviews given and support given to the villagers when an inflatable mast was demonstrated \u2013 with the effect that the planning application was withdrawn.\nFriends of Dartmoor.\nIn common with other amenity bodies, such as those for the Lake District, Peak District, Pembrokeshire Coast, Yorkshire Dales Three Peaks and the New Forest Trust, the image of Dartmoor Preservation Association is evolving from its Victorian origins, although the original name is being retained. Friends of Dartmoor projects a more modern image of preservation where several years of diplomacy have achieved good relations with the partner agencies that operate in the Dartmoor arena. This is due mainly to the efforts of the previous CEO, James Paxman and his successor, Phil Hutt.\nConstitution, objectives and policies.\nThe DPA Constitution, objectives and policies are published on the DPA web site.\nThe objectives enshrined in the constitution are the protection, preservation and enhancement in the public interest of the landscape, antiquities, flora and fauna, natural beauty, cultural heritage and scientific interest of Dartmoor. Also the protection and preservation of public access to and on Dartmoor subject to the ancient rights of commoners. Co-operation with the commoners and any organisation in achieving DPA objectives, also the study of and the recording and publication of information upon the antiquities, history and natural history of Dartmoor.\nThe DPA has twenty-two policies listed on its web site: regarding access and rights of way, fencing, protecting monuments, diverse habitats, bracken, china clay quarrying, military training and live firing, hill farming and small scale traditional local industries, quarrying, television and telephone masts, wind farms, planning applications, housing developments, woodlands and forestry, ponies, swaling, and recreational activities.\nConservation.\nThe DPA conservation team meet throughout the year to work on a number of ongoing projects; from gorse clearance, to habitat protection and archaeological surveying. A quarterly timetable is released both on the organisation's website and through its member publications, along with details of how to get involved. The team also host an annual open day at the DPA land holding of Pudsham Meadows.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, Dartmouth is one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Emerging into national prominence at the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth has since been considered among the most prestigious undergraduate colleges in the United States.\nAlthough originally established to educate Native Americans in Christian theology and the Anglo-American way of life, the university primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized. While Dartmouth is now a research university rather than simply an undergraduate college, it focuses on undergraduate education and continues to go by \"Dartmouth College\" to emphasize this.\nFollowing a liberal arts curriculum, Dartmouth provides undergraduate instruction in 40 academic departments and interdisciplinary programs, including 60 majors in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering, and enables students to design specialized concentrations or engage in dual degree programs. In addition to the undergraduate faculty of arts and sciences, Dartmouth has four professional and graduate schools: the Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies. The university also has affiliations with the Dartmouth\u2013Hitchcock Medical Center. Dartmouth is home to the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Social Sciences, the Hood Museum of Art, the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts. With a student enrollment of about 6,700, Dartmouth is the smallest university in the Ivy League. Undergraduate admissions are highly selective with an acceptance rate of 5.3% for the class of 2028, including a 3.8% rate for regular decision applicants.\nSituated on a terrace above the Connecticut River, Dartmouth's main campus is in the rural Upper Valley region of New England. The university functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. Dartmouth is known for its undergraduate focus, Greek culture, and campus traditions. Its 34 varsity sports teams compete intercollegiately in the Ivy League conference of the NCAA Division I. The university has many prominent alumni, including 170 members of the United States Congress, 25 U.S. governors, 8 U.S. Cabinet secretaries, 3 Nobel Prize laureates, 2 U.S. Supreme Court justices, and a U.S. vice president. Other notable alumni include 81 Rhodes Scholars, 26 Marshall Scholarship recipients, 13 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 10 current CEOs of \"Fortune\" 500 companies, and 51 Olympic medalists.\nHistory.\nDartmouth was founded by Eleazar Wheelock, a Yale graduate and Congregational minister from Windham, Connecticut, who had sought to establish a school to train Native Americans as Christian missionaries. It was one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. Wheelock's ostensible inspiration for such an establishment resulted from his relationship with Mohegan Indian Samson Occom. Occom became an ordained minister after studying under Wheelock from 1743 to 1747, and later moved to Long Island to preach to the Montauks.\nWheelock founded Moor's Indian Charity School in 1755. The Charity School proved somewhat successful, but additional funding was necessary to continue school's operations, and Wheelock sought the help of friends to raise money. The first major donation to the school was given by John Phillips in 1762, who went on to found Phillips Exeter Academy. Occom, accompanied by the Reverend Nathaniel Whitaker, traveled to England in 1766 to raise money from churches. With these funds, they established a trust to help Wheelock. The head of the trust was a Methodist named William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth.\nAlthough the fund provided Wheelock ample financial support for the Charity School, Wheelock initially had trouble recruiting Indians to the institution, primarily because its location was far from tribal territories. In seeking to expand the school into a college, Wheelock relocated it to Hanover, in the Province of New Hampshire. The move from Connecticut followed a lengthy and sometimes frustrating effort to find resources and secure a charter. The Royal Governor of New Hampshire, John Wentworth, provided the land upon which Dartmouth would be built and on December 13, 1769, issued a royal charter in the name of King George III establishing the college. That charter created a college \"for the education and instruction of youth of the Indian tribes in this land in reading, writing, and all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing and christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences and also of English youth and any others\". The reference to educating Native American youth was included to connect Dartmouth to the Charity School and enable the use of the Charity School's unspent trust funds. Named for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth \u2013 an important supporter of Eleazar Wheelock's earlier efforts but who, in fact, opposed creation of the college and never donated to it \u2013 Dartmouth is the nation's ninth oldest college and the last institution of higher learning established under colonial rule. The college granted its first degrees in 1771.\nGiven the limited success of the Charity School, however, Wheelock intended his new college as one primarily for whites. Occom, disappointed with Wheelock's departure from the school's original goal of Indian Christianization, went on to form his own community of New England Indians called Brothertown Indians in New York.\nIn 1819, Dartmouth College was the subject of the historic Dartmouth College case, which challenged New Hampshire's 1816 attempt to amend the college charter to make the school a public university. An institution called Dartmouth University occupied the college buildings and began operating in Hanover in 1817, though the college continued teaching classes in rented rooms nearby. Daniel Webster, an alumnus of the class of 1801, presented the college's case to the Supreme Court, which found the amendment of Dartmouth's charter to be an illegal impairment of a contract by the state and reversed New Hampshire's takeover of the college. Webster concluded his peroration with the famous words: \"It is, Sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it.\"\nDartmouth taught its first African-American students in 1775 and 1808. By the end of the Civil War, 20 black men had attended the college or its medical school, and Dartmouth \"was recognized in the African-American community as a place where a man of color could go to get educated\". One of those first 20 black alumni, Jonathan C. Gibbs, served as Secretary of State and Superintendent of Public Instruction for the state of Florida.\nIn 1866, the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts was incorporated in Hanover, in connection with Dartmouth College. The institution was officially associated with Dartmouth and was directed by Dartmouth's president. The new college was moved to Durham, New Hampshire, in 1891, and later became known as the University of New Hampshire.\nDartmouth emerged onto the national academic stage at the turn of the 20th century. Prior to this period, the college had clung to traditional methods of instruction and was relatively poorly funded. Under President William Jewett Tucker (1893\u20131909), Dartmouth underwent a major revitalization of facilities, faculty, and the student body, following large endowments such as the $10,000 given by Dartmouth alumnus and law professor John Ordronaux.&lt;ref name=\"Many Bequests to Carity; Will of Dr. Ordronaux D...\"/&gt; 20 new structures replaced antiquated buildings, while the student body and faculty both expanded threefold. Tucker is often credited for having \"refounded Dartmouth\" and bringing it into national prestige. Presidents Ernest Fox Nichols (1909\u201316) and Ernest Martin Hopkins (1916\u201345) continued Tucker's trend of modernization, further improving campus facilities and introducing selective admissions in the 1920s. In 1945, Hopkins was subject to no small amount of controversy, as he openly admitted to Dartmouth's practice of using racial quotas to deny Jews entry into the university. John Sloan Dickey, serving as president from 1945 until 1970, strongly emphasized the liberal arts, particularly public policy and international relations. During World War II, Dartmouth was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a navy commission.\nThe Dartmouth workshop, which was held in 1956, is widely considered to be the founding event of artificial intelligence as a field.\nIn 1970, longtime professor of mathematics and computer science John George Kemeny became president of Dartmouth. Kemeny oversaw several major changes at the college. Dartmouth, which had been a men's institution, began admitting women as full-time students and undergraduate degree candidates in 1972 amid much controversy. At about the same time, the college adopted its \"Dartmouth Plan\" of academic scheduling, permitting the student body to increase in size within the existing facilities.\nIn 1988, Dartmouth's alma mater song's lyrics changed from \"Men of Dartmouth\" to \"Dear old Dartmouth\".\nDuring the 1990s, the college saw a major academic overhaul under President James O. Freedman and a controversial (and ultimately unsuccessful) 1999 initiative to encourage the school's single-sex Greek houses to go coed. The first decade of the 21st century saw the commencement of the $1.5 billion Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience, the largest capital fundraising campaign in the college's history, which surpassed $1 billion in 2008. The mid- and late first decade of the 21st century have also seen extensive campus construction, with the erection of two new housing complexes, full renovation of two dormitories, and a forthcoming dining hall, life sciences center, and visual arts center. In 2004, Booz Allen Hamilton selected Dartmouth College as a model of institutional endurance \"whose record of endurance has had implications and benefits for all American organizations, both academic and commercial\", citing \"Dartmouth College v. Woodward\" and Dartmouth's successful self-reinvention in the late 19th century.\nSince the election of a number of petition-nominated trustees to the Board of Trustees starting in 2004, the role of alumni in Dartmouth governance has been the subject of ongoing conflict. President James Wright announced his retirement in February 2008 and was replaced by Harvard University professor and physician Jim Yong Kim on July 1, 2009. Kim was succeeded by Philip J. Hanlon in June 2013.\nIn May 2010 Dartmouth joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Durham University (UK), Queen's University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany), University of Western Australia (Australia) and Uppsala University (Sweden). It left the network in 2025.\nIn early August 2019, Dartmouth College agreed to pay nine current and former students a total of $14 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging they were sexually harassed by three former neuroscience professors.\nIn April 2022, Dartmouth College returned the papers of Samson Occom, who helped Eleazar Wheelock secure the funds for Dartmouth College for what Occom believed would be a school for Native students in Connecticut, to the Mohegan Tribe.\nOn June 12, 2023 Sian Beilock began her tenure as the first female president of Dartmouth.\nIn September 2023, Dartmouth convened an event entitled The Future of Mental Health and Wellness, which included the seven living U.S. Surgeons General at the time. In 2024, the college hired a chief wellness office in order to provide increased mental health support on campus and to help students to manage daily stressors.\nIn April 2024, Dartmouth announced the creation of the Dartmouth Climate Collaboration, pledging $500 million towards the goal of eliminating carbon emissions on campus by 2050. The plan includes the installation of high-capacity heat pumps and a geoexchange system, making it the largest operational change in the college's history.\nAcademics.\nDartmouth, a liberal arts institution, offers a four-year Bachelor of Arts and an ABET-accredited Bachelor of Engineering degree to undergraduate students. The college has 39 academic departments offering 56 major programs, while students are free to design special majors or engage in dual majors. For the graduating class of 2017, the most popular majors were economics, government, computer science, engineering sciences, and history. The Economics Department, whose prominent professors include David Blanchflower, Andrew Samwick, and Diego Comin, among others, also holds the distinction as the top-ranked bachelor's-only economics program in the world. The Government Department similarly includes numerous eminent faculty members, such as Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth, and is among Dartmouth's most popular majors. These two departments are known for enforcing a median grade of B+ in most of their courses in order to curb the burgeoning trend of grade inflation at American universities. \nIn order to graduate, a student must complete 35 total courses, eight to ten of which are typically part of a chosen major program. Other requirements for graduation include the completion of ten \"distributive requirements\" in a variety of academic fields, proficiency in a foreign language, and completion of a writing class and first-year seminar in writing. Many departments offer honors programs requiring students seeking that distinction to engage in \"independent, sustained work\", culminating in the production of a thesis. In addition to the courses offered in Hanover, Dartmouth offers 57 different off-campus programs, including Foreign Study Programs, Language Study Abroad programs, and Exchange Programs.\nThrough the Graduate Studies program, Dartmouth grants doctorate and master's degrees in 19 Arts &amp; Sciences graduate programs. Although the first graduate degree, a PhD in classics, was awarded in 1885, many of the current PhD programs have only existed since the 1960s. Furthermore, Dartmouth is home to three professional schools: the Geisel School of Medicine (established 1797), Thayer School of Engineering (1867)\u2014which also serves as the undergraduate department of engineering sciences\u2014and Tuck School of Business (1900). With these professional schools and graduate programs, conventional American usage would accord Dartmouth the label of \"Dartmouth University\"; however, because of historical and nostalgic reasons (such as \"Dartmouth College v. Woodward\"), the school uses the name \"Dartmouth College\" to refer to the entire institution.\nDartmouth employs a total of 607 tenured or tenure-track faculty members, including the highest proportion of female tenured professors among the Ivy League universities, and the first black woman tenure-track faculty member in computer science at an Ivy League university.\nDartmouth served as the host member of the University Press of New England, a university press founded in 1970 that included Brandeis University, Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire, and Northeastern University. The University Press of New England shut down in 2018. With the exception of Dartmouth College Press titles, in 2021, Brandeis become the sole owner of all copyrights and titles of UPNE.\nResearch.\nDartmouth College is a research institution designated by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as having \"very high research activity\". In 2019, Dartmouth College was elected to the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization of 69 research universities.\nFaculty members have been at the forefront of such major academic developments as the Dartmouth Workshop, the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, Dartmouth BASIC, and Dartmouth ALGOL 30. In 2005, sponsored project awards to Dartmouth faculty research amounted to $169 million.\nIn 2017, Eric Fossum, a professor of engineering at Dartmouth College, was awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize for his work on imaging sensor technology. The Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, which was approved in 2021, was based on findings that originated in a science lab at the college. In 2024, researchers at Dartmouth received a $31.3 million grant from the federal government to further their study of prostate cancer. In 2025, Dartmouth received approximately $97 million worth of funding from the National Institutes of Health.\nIn 2025, Dartmouth received approximately $97 million worth of funding from the National Institutes of Health.\nRankings.\nDartmouth was ranked 12th among undergraduate programs at national universities by \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" in its 2022 rankings. \"U.S. News\" also ranked the school 3rd best for veterans, tied for 5th best in undergraduate teaching, and 7th for \"best value\" national universities. Dartmouth's undergraduate teaching was previously ranked 1st by \"U.S. News\" for five years in a row (2009\u20132013). Dartmouth College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.\nIn \"Forbes\"' 2019 rankings of 650 universities, liberal arts colleges and service academies, Dartmouth ranked 10th overall and 10th in research universities. In the \"Forbes\" 2018 \"grateful graduate\" rankings, Dartmouth came in first for the second year in a row.\nThe 2021\" Academic Ranking of World Universities\" ranked Dartmouth among the 90\u2013110th best universities in the nation. However, this specific ranking has drawn criticism from scholars for not adequately adjusting for the size of an institution, which leads to larger institutions ranking above smaller ones like Dartmouth.\nAdmissions.\nUndergraduate admission to Dartmouth College is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation and \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" as \"most selective\". The \"Princeton Review\", in its 2024 edition, gave the university an admissions selectivity rating of 99 out of 99.\nFor the freshman class entering Fall 2023, Dartmouth received a record 28,841 applications of which 6.2% were accepted, consistent with the prior two years; approximately 67% of those accepted are expected to matriculate. Of those admitted students who reported class rank, 444 were ranked first or second in their class, while 96% ranked in the top decile. The admitted students' academic profile showed an all-time high SAT average score of 1501, while the average composite ACT score remained at 33.\nAdditionally, for the 2016\u20132017 academic year, Dartmouth received 685 transfer applications of which 5.1% were accepted, with an average SAT composite score of 1490, average composite ACT score of 34, and average college GPA of about 3.85. Dartmouth meets 100% of students' demonstrated financial need in order to attend the college, and currently admits all students, including internationals, on a need-blind basis.\nIn 2020, Dartmouth made it optional for students applying to the college to submit their SAT scores due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, the college became the first Ivy League school to announce that it would once again require applicants to submit their test scores.\nFinancial aid.\nDartmouth guarantees to meet 100% of the demonstrated need of every admitted student who applies for financial aid at the time of admission. Dartmouth is one of seven American universities to practice international need-blind admissions. This means that all applicants, including U.S. permanent residents, undocumented students in the U.S., and international students, are admitted to the college without regard to their financial circumstances. At Dartmouth, free tuition is provided for students from families with total incomes of $125,000 or less and possessing typical assets. Dartmouth is also one of a few U.S. universities to eliminate undergraduate student loans and replace them with expanded scholarship grants. In 2015, $88.8 million (~$ in 2024) in need-based scholarships were awarded to Dartmouth students.\nThe median family income of Dartmouth students is $200,400, with 58% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 14% from the bottom 60%.\nHowever, a 2022 article from \"The Dartmouth\" disputes the college's claims by saying the following: \"To put it all together with the $9 million of student debt from the Class of 2021, this change in Dartmouth policy, hailed as \"eliminat[ing] loans for undergraduate students\" actually eliminated only about a quarter\u201427.4% to be exact\u2014of student loans for undergraduate students. So, while Dartmouth gets glowing coverage in news publications across the country, 72.6% of the debt it saddles its students with remains.\"\nIn March 2024, the estate of Glenn Britt gifted over $150 million to Dartmouth to enable students from middle-income families to attend the college for free.\nThe Dartmouth Plan.\nDartmouth functions on a quarter system, operating year-round on four ten-week academic terms. The Dartmouth Plan (or simply \"D-Plan\") is an academic scheduling system that permits the customization of each student's academic year. All undergraduates are required to be in residence for the fall, winter, and spring terms of their freshman year and two terms of their senior year, as well as the summer term of their sophomore year. However, students may petition to alter this plan so that they may be off during terms of their senior year or sophomore summer terms. During all terms, students are permitted to choose between studying on-campus, studying at an off-campus program, or taking a term off for vacation, outside internships, or research projects. The typical course load is three classes per term, and students will generally enroll in classes for 12 total terms over the course of their academic career.\nThe D-Plan was instituted in the early 1970s at the same time that Dartmouth began accepting female undergraduates. It was initially devised as a plan to increase the enrollment without enlarging campus accommodations, and has been described as \"a way to put 4,000 students into 3,000 beds\". Although new dormitories have been built since, the number of students has also increased and the D-Plan remains in effect. It was modified in the 1980s in an attempt to reduce the problems of lack of social and academic continuity.\nBoard of trustees.\nDartmouth is governed by a board of trustees comprising the college president (\"ex officio\"), the state governor (\"ex officio\"), 13 trustees nominated and elected by the board (called \"charter trustees\"), and eight trustees nominated by alumni and elected by the board (\"alumni trustees\"). The nominees for alumni trustee are determined by a poll of the members of the Association of Alumni of Dartmouth College, selecting from among names put forward by the Alumni Council or by alumni petition.\nAlthough the board elected its members from the two sources of nominees in equal proportions between 1891 and 2007, the board decided in 2007 to add several new members, all charter trustees. In the controversy that followed the decision, the Association of Alumni filed a lawsuit, although it later withdrew the action. In 2008, the board added five new charter trustees.\nInternational collaboration.\nThe college is an active member of the University of the Arctic. UArctic is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of more than 200 universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region.\nCampus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThis is what a college is supposed to look like.\n \u2014U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953 \nDartmouth College is situated in the rural town of Hanover, New Hampshire, located in the Upper Valley along the Connecticut River in New England. Its campus is centered on a \"Green\", a former field of pine trees cleared in 1771. Dartmouth is the largest private landowner of the town of Hanover, and its total landholdings and facilities are worth an estimated $434 million. In addition to its campus in Hanover, Dartmouth owns of Mount Moosilauke in the White Mountains and a tract of land in northern New Hampshire known as the Second College Grant.\nDartmouth's campus buildings vary in age from Wentworth and Thornton Halls of the 1820s (the oldest surviving buildings constructed by the college) to new dormitories and mathematics facilities completed in 2006. Most of Dartmouth's buildings are designed in the Georgian colonial architecture style, a theme which has been preserved in recent architectural additions. The college has actively sought to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage on campus, earning it the grade of A\u2212 from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2008.\nA notable feature of the Dartmouth campus is its many trees which (despite Dutch elm disease) include some 200 American elms. The campus also has the largest Kentucky coffeetree in New Hampshire, at 91\u00a0ft tall.\nWhile Dartmouth's campus is located in a rural setting, it is connected to several major cities by intercity bus services that directly serve Dartmouth and Hanover. Dartmouth Coach provides service from Hanover to South Station and Logan International Airport in Boston as well as New York City, while Greyhound Lines operates a daily route connecting Hanover and Montreal. All three cities are popular weekend/vacation destinations for Dartmouth students.\nAcademic facilities.\nThe college's creative and performing arts facility is the Hopkins Center for the Arts (\"the Hop\"). Opened in 1962, the Hop houses the college's drama, music, film, and studio arts departments, as well as a woodshop, pottery studio, and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and faculty. The building was designed by the famed architect Wallace Harrison, who would later design the similar-looking fa\u00e7ade of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center. Its facilities include two theaters and one 900-seat auditorium and the Courtyard Caf\u00e9 dining facility. The Hop is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, arguably North America's oldest museum in continuous operation, and the Loew Auditorium, where films are screened.\nIn addition to its 19 graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Dartmouth is home to three separate graduate schools. The Geisel School of Medicine is located in a complex on the north side of campus and includes laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a biomedical library. The Dartmouth\u2013Hitchcock Medical Center, located several miles to the south in Lebanon, New Hampshire, contains a 396-bed teaching hospital for the Medical School. The Thayer School of Engineering and the Tuck School of Business are both located at the end of Tuck Mall, west of the center of campus and near the Connecticut River. The Thayer School comprises two buildings; Tuck has seven academic and administrative buildings, as well as several common areas. The two graduate schools share a library, the Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library. In December 2018, Dartmouth began a major expansion of the west end of campus by breaking ground on the $200 million (~$ in 2024) Center for Engineering and Computer Science. The center will house the Computer Science department and Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship. In October 2019, construction began on the Irving Institute of Energy and Society. Both were completed by Spring 2022, and the Center for Engineering and Computer Science was renamed the Class of 1982 Engineering and Computer Science Center.\nDartmouth's libraries are all part of the collective Dartmouth College Library, which comprises 2.48 million volumes and 6 million total resources, including videos, maps, sound recordings, and photographs. Its specialized libraries include the Biomedical Libraries, Evans Map Room, Feldberg Business &amp; Engineering Library, Jones Media Center, Rauner Special Collections Library, and Sherman Art Library. Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth, consisting of a merger of the Baker Memorial Library (opened 1928) and the Berry Library (completed 2002). Located on the northern side of the Green, Baker's tower is an iconic symbol of the college.\nAthletic facilities.\nDartmouth's original sports field was the Green, where students played cricket and old division football during the 19th century. Today, two of Dartmouth's athletic facilities are located in the southeast corner of campus. The center of athletic life is the Alumni Gymnasium, which includes the Karl Michael Competition Pool and the Spaulding Pool, a fitness center, a weight room, and a 1/13th-mile (123\u00a0m) indoor track. Attached to Alumni Gymnasium is the Berry Sports Center, which contains basketball and volleyball courts (Leede Arena), as well as the Kresge Fitness Center. Behind the Alumni Gymnasium is Memorial Field, a 15,600-seat stadium overlooking Dartmouth's football field and track. The nearby Thompson Arena, designed by Italian engineer Pier Luigi Nervi and constructed in 1975, houses Dartmouth's ice rink. Also visible from Memorial Field is the Nathaniel Leverone Fieldhouse, home to the indoor track. The new softball field, Dartmouth Softball Park, was constructed in 2012, sharing parking facilities with Thompson arena and replacing Sachem Field, located over a mile from campus, as the primary softball facility.\nDartmouth's other athletic facilities in Hanover include the Friends of Dartmouth Rowing Boathouse and the old rowing house storage facility (both located along the Connecticut River), the Hanover Country Club, Dartmouth's oldest remaining athletic facility (established in 1899), and the Corey Ford Rugby Clubhouse. The college also maintains the Dartmouth Skiway, a skiing facility located over two mountains near the Hanover campus in Lyme Center, New Hampshire, that serves as the winter practice grounds for the Dartmouth Ski Team, which is a perennial contender for the NCAA Division I championship.\nDartmouth's close association and involvement in the development of the downhill skiing industry is featured in the 2010 book \"Passion for Skiing\" as well as the 2013 documentary based on the book \"Passion for Snow\".\nResidential housing and student life facilities.\nBeginning in the fall term of 2016, Dartmouth placed all undergraduate students in one of six House communities, similar to residential colleges, including Allen House, East Wheelock House, North Park House, School House, South House, and West House, alongside independent Living Learning Communities. Dartmouth used to have nine residential communities located throughout campus, instead of ungrouped dormitories or residential colleges. The dormitories varied in design from modern to traditional Georgian styles, and room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites. Since 2006, the college has guaranteed housing for students during their freshman and sophomore years. More than 3,000 students elect to live in housing provided by college.\nIn November 2022, Dartmouth Hall was rededicated after a $42 million renovation. Fundraising for the project was led by over 1700 alumnae as part of the celebration of 50 years of coeducation at Dartmouth College.\nCampus meals are served by Dartmouth Dining Services, which operates 11 dining establishments around campus. The Class of 1953 Commons, commonly referred to as \"Foco\", is the all-you-can-eat dining hall, located at the center of campus. Dartmouth also operates \u00e0 la carte cafes around campus (Collis Caf\u00e9, Courtyard Caf\u00e9, Novack Caf\u00e9, The Fern Coffee &amp; Tea Bar, Ramekin, and Caf\u00e9@Baker), a convenience store (Collis Market), and three snack bars located in the Allen House Commons (also called the \"Cube\"), McLaughlin Cluster, and East Wheelock Cluster.\nThe Collis Center is the center of student life and programming, serving as what would be generically termed the \"student union\" or \"campus center\". It contains a caf\u00e9, study space, common areas, and a number of administrative departments, including the Academic Skills Center. Robinson Hall, next door to both the Collis Center and the Class of 1953 Commons, contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the Dartmouth Outing Club and \"The Dartmouth\" daily newspaper.\nStudent life.\nDartmouth Student Government represents students on issues related to student life. Annually, students elect a student body president, vice president, and undergraduate senate to represent them in the following academic year. In 2006, \"The Princeton Review\" ranked Dartmouth third in its \"Quality of Life\" category, and sixth for having the \"Happiest Students\". Athletics and participation in the Greek system are the most popular campus activities. In all, Dartmouth offers more than 350 organizations, teams, and sports. The school is also home to a variety of longstanding traditions and celebrations and has a loyal alumni network; Dartmouth ranked #2 in \"The Princeton Review\" in 2006 for Best Alumni Network.\nIn 2014, Dartmouth College was the third highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 42 reports of rape. \"The Washington Post\" attributed the high number of rape reports to the fact that a growing number of sexual assault victims feel comfortable enough to report sexual assaults that would have gone unreported in previous years. In 2015, the Huffington Post reported that Dartmouth had the highest rate of bystander intervention of any college surveyed, with 57.7% of Dartmouth students reporting that they would take some sort of action if they saw someone acting in a \"sexually violent or harassing manner,\" compared to 45.5% of students nationally.\nDartmouth fraternities have an extensive history of hazing and alcohol abuse, leading to police raids and accusations of sexual harassment.\nStudent groups.\nDartmouth's more than 200 student organizations and clubs cover a wide range of interests. In 2007, the college hosted eight academic groups, 17 cultural groups, two honor societies, 30 \"issue-oriented\" groups, 25 performing groups, 12 pre-professional groups, 20 publications, and 11 recreational groups. Notable student groups include the nation's largest and oldest collegiate outdoors club, the Dartmouth Outing Club, which includes the nationally recognized Big Green Bus; the campus's oldest a cappella group, The Dartmouth Aires; the controversial independent newspaper \"The Dartmouth Review\"; Dartmouth Student Government, the college's official undergraduate student government; and \"The Dartmouth\", arguably the nation's oldest university newspaper. \"The Dartmouth\" describes itself as \"America's Oldest College Newspaper, Founded 1799\".\nPartially because of Dartmouth's rural, isolated location, the Greek system dating from the 1840s is one of the most popular social outlets for students. Dartmouth is home to 32 recognized Greek houses: 17 fraternities, 12 sororities, and three coeducational organizations. In 2007, roughly 70% of eligible students belonged to a Greek organization; since 1987, students have not been permitted to join Greek organizations until their sophomore year. Dartmouth College was among the first institutions of higher education to desegregate fraternity houses, doing so in the 1950s, and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s. In the early first decade of the 21st century, campus-wide debate focused on a board of trustees recommendation that Greek organizations become \"substantially coeducational\"; this attempt to change the Greek system eventually failed.\nDartmouth also has a number of secret societies, which are student- and alumni-led organizations often focused on preserving the history of the college and initiating service projects. Most prominent among them is the Sphinx society, housed in a prominent Egyptian tomb-like building near the center of campus. The Sphinx has been the subject of numerous rumors as to its facilities, practices, and membership.\nThe college has an additional classification of social/residential organizations known as undergraduate societies.\nAthletics.\nApproximately 20% of students participate in a varsity sport, and nearly 80% participate in some form of club, varsity, intramural, or other athletics. In 2021, Dartmouth College fielded 33 intercollegiate varsity teams: 15 for men, 17 for women, and coeducational sailing and equestrian programs. Dartmouth's athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I eight-member Ivy League conference; some teams also participate in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). As is mandatory for the members of the Ivy League, Dartmouth College does not offer athletic scholarships. In addition to the traditional American team sports (football, basketball, baseball, and ice hockey), Dartmouth competes at the varsity level in many other sports including track and field, softball, squash, sailing, tennis, rowing, soccer, skiing, and lacrosse.\nThe college also offers 26 club and intramural sports such as fencing, rugby, water polo, figure skating, boxing, volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and cricket, leading to a 75% participation rate in athletics among the undergraduate student body. The Dartmouth Fencing Team, despite being entirely self-coached, won the USACFC club national championship in 2014. The Dartmouth Men's Rugby Team, founded in 1951, has been ranked among the best collegiate teams in that sport, winning for example the Ivy Rugby Conference every year between 2008 and 2020. The figure skating team won the national championship five straight times from 2004 through 2008. In addition to the academic requirements for graduation, Dartmouth requires every undergraduate to complete a swim and three terms of physical education.\nNative Americans at Dartmouth.\nThe charter of Dartmouth College, granted to Wheelock in 1769, proclaims that the institution was created \"for the education and instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, writing and all parts of Learning ... as well as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth and any others\". However, Wheelock primarily intended the college to educate white youth, and the few Native students that attended Dartmouth experienced much difficulty in an institution ostensibly dedicated to their education. The funds for the Charity School for Native Americans that preceded Dartmouth College were raised primarily by the efforts of a Mohegan named Samson Occom, and at least some of those funds were used to help found the college.\nThe college graduated only 19 Native Americans during its first 200 years. In 1970, the college established Native American academic and social programs as part of a \"new dedication to increasing Native American enrollment\". Since then, Dartmouth has graduated over 700 Native American students from over 200 different tribes, more than the other seven Ivy League universities combined.\nTraditions.\nDartmouth is well known for its fierce school spirit and many traditions. The college functions on a quarter system, and one weekend each term is set aside as a traditional celebratory event, known on campus as \"big weekends\" or \"party weekends\". In the fall term, Homecoming (officially called Dartmouth Night) is marked by a bonfire on the Green constructed by the freshman class. Winter term is celebrated by Winter Carnival, a tradition started in 1911 by the Dartmouth Outing Club to promote winter sports. This tradition is the oldest in the United States, and subsequently went on to catch on at other New England colleges. In the spring, Green Key is a weekend mostly devoted to campus parties and celebration.\nThe summer term was formerly marked by Tubestock, an unofficial tradition in which the students used wooden rafts and inner tubes to float on the Connecticut River. Begun in 1986, Tubestock was ended in 2006 by town ordinance. The Class of 2008, during their summer term on campus in 2006, replaced the defunct Tubestock with Fieldstock. This new celebration includes a barbecue, live music, and the revival of the 1970s and 1980s tradition of racing homemade chariots around the Green. Unlike Tubestock, Fieldstock is funded and supported by the college.\nAnother longstanding tradition is four-day, student-run First-Year Trips for incoming freshmen, begun in 1935. Each trip concludes at the Moosilauke Ravine Lodge. In 2011, over 96% of freshmen elected to participate.\nInsignia and other representations.\nMotto and song.\nDartmouth's motto, chosen by Eleazar Wheelock, is \"Vox clamantis in deserto\". The Latin motto is literally translated as \"The voice of one crying in the wilderness\", but is more often rendered as \"A voice crying out in the wilderness\". The phrase appears five times in the Bible and is a reference to the college's location on what was once the frontier of European settlement. Richard Hovey's \"Men of Dartmouth\" was elected as the best of Dartmouth's songs in 1896, and became the school's official song in 1926. The song was retitled to \"Alma Mater\" in the 1980s when its lyrics were changed to refer to women as well as men.\nSeal.\nDartmouth's 1769 royal charter required the creation of a seal for use on official documents and diplomas. The college's founder, Eleazar Wheelock, designed a seal for his college bearing a striking resemblance to the seal of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary society founded in London in 1701, in order to maintain the illusion that his college was more for mission work than for higher education. Engraved by a Boston silversmith, the seal was ready by commencement of 1773. The trustees officially accepted the seal on August 25, 1773, describing it as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOn October 28, 1926, the trustees affirmed the charter's reservation of the seal for official corporate documents alone. The College Publications Committee commissioned noted typographer William Addison Dwiggins to create a line drawing version of the seal in 1940 that saw widespread use. Dwiggins' design was modified during 1957 to change the date from \"1770\" to \"1769\", to accord with the date of the college charter. The trustees commissioned a new set of dies with a date of \"1769\" to replace the old dies, now badly worn after almost two hundred years of use. The 1957 design continues to be used.\nShield.\nOn October 28, 1926, the trustees approved a \"Dartmouth College Shield\" for general use. Artist and engraver W. Parke Johnson designed this emblem on the basis of the shield that is depicted at the center of the original seal. This design does not survive. On June 9, 1944, the trustees approved another coat of arms based on the shield part of the seal, this one by Canadian artist and designer Thoreau MacDonald. That design was used widely and, like Dwiggins' seal, had its date changed from \"1770\" to \"1769\" around 1958. That version continues to be used under trademark registration number 3112676 and others.\nCollege designer John Scotford made a stylized version of the shield during the 1960s, but it did not see the success of MacDonald's design. The shield appears to have been used as the basis of the shield of the Geisel School of Medicine, and it has been reproduced in sizes as small as 20 micrometers across. The design has appeared on Rudolph Ruzicka's Bicentennial Medal (Philadelphia Mint, 1969) and elsewhere.\nNickname, symbol, and mascot.\nDartmouth has never had an official mascot. The nickname \"The Big Green\", originating in the 1860s, is based on students' adoption of a shade of forest green (\"Dartmouth Green\") as the school's official color in 1866. Beginning in the 1920s, the Dartmouth College athletic teams were known by their unofficial nickname \"the Indians\", a moniker that probably originated among sports journalists. This unofficial mascot and team name was used until the early 1970s, when its use came under criticism. In 1974, the Trustees declared the \"use of the [Indian] symbol in any form to be inconsistent with present institutional and academic objectives of the College in advancing Native American education\". Some alumni and students, as well as the conservative student newspaper, \"The Dartmouth Review\", have sought to return the Indian symbol to prominence, but never succeeded in doing so.\nVarious student initiatives have been undertaken to adopt a mascot, but none has become \"official\". One proposal devised by the college humor magazine the \"Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern\" was Keggy the Keg, an anthropomorphic beer keg who makes occasional appearances at college sporting events. Despite student enthusiasm for Keggy, the mascot has received approval from only the student government. In November 2006, student government attempted to revive the \"Dartmoose\" amid renewed controversy surrounding the former unofficial Indian mascot.\nAlumni.\nDartmouth's alumni are known for frequently donating to their alma mater.\nBy 2008, Dartmouth had graduated 238 classes of students, and had over 60,000 living alumni in a variety of fields. Finance, consulting, and technology have consistently been the most popular industries to enter for students. Top employers of new graduates include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, McKinsey &amp; Company, Bain &amp; Company, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\nNelson A. Rockefeller, 41st Vice President of the United States and 49th Governor of New York, graduated cum laude from Dartmouth with a degree in economics in 1930. Over 164 Dartmouth graduates have served in the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives, such as Massachusetts statesman Daniel Webster. Cabinet members of American presidents include Attorney General Amos T. Akerman, Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson, and Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. C. Everett Koop was the Surgeon General of the United States under President Ronald Reagan. Two Dartmouth alumni have served as justices on the Supreme Court of the United States: Salmon P. Chase and Levi Woodbury. Eugene Norman Veasey (class of 1954) served as the Chief Justice of Delaware. The 46th Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf; the 42nd Governor of Illinois, businessman Bruce Rauner; and the 31st governor and current senator from North Dakota, John Hoeven (R), are also Dartmouth alumni. Ernesto de la Guardia, class of 1925, was president of the Republic of Panama.\nIn literature and journalism, Dartmouth has produced 13 Pulitzer Prize winners: Thomas M. Burton, Richard Eberhart, Dan Fagin, Paul Gigot, Frank Gilroy, Jake Hooker, Nigel Jaquiss, Joseph Rago, Martin J. Sherwin, David K. Shipler, David Shribman, Justin Harvey Smith and Robert Frost. Frost, who received four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry in his lifetime, attended but did not graduate from Dartmouth; he is, however, the only person to have received two honorary degrees from Dartmouth.\nOther authors and media personalities include CNN Chief White House correspondent and anchor Jake Tapper, novelist and founding editor of \"The Believer\" Heidi Julavits, \"Dean of rock critics\" Robert Christgau, National Book Award winners Louise Erdrich and Phil Klay, novelist/screenwriter Budd Schulberg, political commentator Dinesh D'Souza, radio talk show host Laura Ingraham, commentator Mort Kondracke, and journalist James Panero. Norman Maclean, professor at the University of Chicago and author of \"A River Runs Through It and Other Stories\", graduated from Dartmouth in 1924. Theodor Geisel, better known as children's author Dr. Seuss, was a member of the class of 1925. Tom Ryan, CEO and president of Paramount Streaming and Founder of Pluto TV graduated in 1991.\nIn the area of religion and theology, Dartmouth alumni include priests and ministers Ebenezer Porter, Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs, Caleb Sprague Henry, Arthur Whipple Jenks, Solomon Spalding, and Joseph Tracy; Transcendental Meditation Movement leader John Hagelin; and rabbis Marshall Meyer, Arnold Resnicoff, and David E. Stern. Hyrum Smith, brother of Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith, attended the college in his teens. He was Patriarch of the LDS Church.\nDartmouth alumni in academia include Stuart Kauffman and Jeffrey Weeks, both recipients of MacArthur Fellowships (commonly called \"genius grants\"). Dartmouth has also graduated three Nobel Prize winners with four separate prizes: Owen Chamberlain (Physics, 1959), K. Barry Sharpless (Chemistry, 2001 and 2022), and George Davis Snell (Physiology or Medicine, 1980). Educators include founder and first president of Bates College Oren Burbank Cheney (1839); the former chancellor of the University of California, San Diego, Marye Anne Fox (PhD. in chemistry, 1974); founding president of Vassar College Milo Parker Jewett; founder and first president of Kenyon College Philander Chase; first professor of Wabash College Caleb Mills; president of Union College Charles Augustus Aiken. Nine of Dartmouth's seventeen presidents were alumni of the college.\nDartmouth alumni serving as CEOs or company presidents and executives include John Henry Patterson (NCR owner) and founder, Charles Alfred Pillsbury, founder of the Pillsbury Company and patriarch of the Pillsbury family, Sandy Alderson (San Diego Padres), John Donahoe (Nike, Inc.), Louis V.

{"id": "8419", "revid": "745492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8419", "title": "Dartmouth, Devon", "text": "Town in Devon, England\nDartmouth () is a town and civil parish in the English county of Devon. It is a tourist destination set on the western bank of the estuary of the River Dart, which is a long narrow tidal ria that runs inland as far as Totnes. It lies within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and South Hams district, and had a population of 5,512 in 2001, reducing to 5,064 at the 2011 census. There are two electoral wards in the \"Dartmouth\" area (Townstal &amp; Kingswear). Their combined population at the above census was 6,822.\nHistory.\nIn 1086, the Domesday Book listed \"Dunestal\" as the only settlement in the area which now makes up the parish of Dartmouth. It was held by Walter of Douai. It paid tax on half a hide, and had two plough teams, two slaves, five villagers and four smallholders. There were six cattle, 40 sheep and 15 goats. At this time Townstal (as the name became) was apparently a purely agricultural settlement, centred around the church. Walter of Douai rebelled against William II, and his lands were confiscated and added to the Honour of Marshwood (Dorset), which sublet Townstal and Dartmouth to the FitzStephens. It was probably during the early part of their proprietorship that Dartmouth began to grow as a port, as it was of strategic importance as a deep-water port for sailing vessels. The port was used as the sailing point for the Crusades of 1147 and 1190, and Warfleet Creek, close to Dartmouth Castle is supposed by some to be named for the vast fleets which assembled there. Dartmouth was a home of the Royal Navy from the reign of Edward III and was twice surprised and sacked during the Hundred Years' War, after which the mouth of the estuary was closed every night with a great chain. The narrow mouth of the Dart is protected by two fortified castles, Dartmouth Castle and Kingswear Castle. Originally Dartmouth's only wharf was Bayard's Cove, a relatively small area protected by a fort at the southern end of the town.\nIn 1373 Geoffrey Chaucer visited and among the pilgrims in his \"Canterbury Tales\",\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotwithstanding Dartmouth's connections with the crown and respectable society, it was a major base for privateering in medieval times. John Hawley or Hauley, a licensed privateer and sometime mayor of Dartmouth is reputed to be a model for Chaucer's \"schipman\".\nThe earliest street in Dartmouth to be recorded by name (in the 13th century) is Smith Street. Several of the houses on the street are originally late 16th century or early 17th century and probably rebuilt on the site of earlier medieval dwellings. The street name undoubtedly derives from the smiths and shipwrights who built and repaired ships here when the tidal waters reached as far as this point. Smith Street was also the site of the town pillory in medieval times.\nThe first church in the parish was St Clement's, Townstal, which may have existed in some form before the 1190s. It was granted by the FitzStephens to Torre Abbey in about 1198, the Abbey having been founded in 1196, and the present stone-built church was probably started shortly after this.\nManorial transactions are first recorded in 1220, when the manor house was at Norton, about half a mile west of Townstal. Names of occupations also started to appear, including taverner, tailor, coggar, korker, goldsmith, glover, skinner and baker. The \"Fosse\", now Foss Street, a dam across the creek known later as The Mill Pool, was first mentioned in 1243. The flow of water out of the pool through the Mill Gullet powered a tidal mill. The dam was used as an unofficial footpath linking Clifton, to the south, with Hardness, to the north. Before this it was necessary to go westwards to the head of the creek at Ford to travel between the two settlements. The lord of the manor was given the rights to hold a weekly market and an annual fair in 1231. In 1281, a legal case proved that the Lord of Totnes had the right to charge tolls on ships using the river, and this right was bought by Nicholas of Tewkesbury in 1306, who conveyed the town, river and port to the king in 1327, so making Dartmouth a Royal Borough. The king gave the river to the Duchy of Cornwall in 1333, who still own the \"fundus\" or bed of the river. In 1335 Edward III granted Dartmouth to Joan of Carew, whose husband was Lord of Stoke Fleming, and almost immediately she obediently passed the lordship to Guy de Bryan, one of the king's leading ministers. In 1341, the town was granted a Royal Charter, which allowed for the election of a mayor. The borough was required to provide two ships for forty days per year. After 1390, no more is heard of lordship rights, and the borough became effectively independent of any lord.\nSt Saviour's Church was constructed in 1335 and consecrated in 1372. It contains a pre-Reformation oak rood screen built in 1480 and several monuments including the tomb of John Hawley (died 1408) and his two wives, covered with a large brass plate effigy of all three. A large medieval ironwork door is decorated with two leopards of the Plantagenets and is possibly the original portal. Although it is dated \"1631\", this is thought to be the date of a subsequent refurbishment coincidental with major renovations of the church in the 17th century. The gallery of the church is decorated with the heraldic crests of prominent local families and is reputed to be constructed of timbers from ships captured during the defeat of the Spanish Armada, although this has not been categorically substantiated. An engraving of a painting by Thomas Allom of the interior of the church, showing the rood screen, provided the inspiration for Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poetical illustration \"Dartmouth Church\" in Fisher's Drawing Room scrap Book, 1833.\nIn medieval times, land access from the Totnes direction passed the manor at Norton and the parish church at Townstal before falling steeply along what are now Church Road, Mount Boone and Ridge Hill to the river at Hardness. There were steeper routes via Townstal Hill and Clarence Street and also via Brown's Hill. These were all too steep for vehicles, so the only land access was by packhorse. In 1671 there is the first mention of the building of the \"New Ground\". A previously existing sandbank was built up using ships' ballast, and a quay wall was built around it to provide more mooring space. The area proved too unstable to be built on, and is now the Royal Avenue Gardens. It was originally linked to the corner of the Quay by a bridge, opposite Duke Street. At the other end of The Quay, Spithead extended into the river for a few yards. \nDartmouth sent numerous ships to join the English fleet that attacked the Spanish Armada, including the Roebuck, Crescent and Hart. The \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario\", the Spanish Armada's \"payship\" commanded by Admiral Pedro de Vald\u00e9s, was captured along with all its crew by Sir Francis Drake. It was reportedly anchored in the River Dart for more than a year and the crew were used as labourers on the nearby Greenway Estate which was the home of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and his half-brother Sir Walter Raleigh. Greenway was later the home of Dame Agatha Christie.\nIn 1592 the \"Madre de Deus\", a Portuguese treasure ship captured by the English in the Azores, docked at Dartmouth Harbour. It attracted all manner of traders, dealers, cutpurses and thieves and by the time Sir Walter Raleigh arrived to reclaim the Crown's share of the loot, a cargo estimated at half a million pounds had been reduced to \u00a3140,000. Still, ten freighters were needed to carry the treasure to London.\nHenry Hudson put into Dartmouth on his return from North America, and was arrested for sailing under a foreign flag. The Pilgrim Fathers put into Dartmouth's Bayard's Cove, en route from Southampton to North America. They rested a while before setting off on their journey in \"Mayflower\" and \"Speedwell\" on 20 August 1620. About 300 miles west of Land's End, upon realising that \"Speedwell\" was unseaworthy, she returned to Plymouth. \"Mayflower\" departed alone to complete the crossing to Cape Cod. Dartmouth's sister city is Dartmouth, Massachusetts.\nThe town contains many medieval and Elizabethan streetscapes and is a patchwork of narrow lanes and stone stairways. A significant number of the historic buildings are listed. One of the most obvious is the Butterwalk, built 1635 to 1640. Its intricately carved wooden fascia is supported on granite columns. Charles II held court in the Butterwalk whilst sheltering from storms in 1671 in a room which now forms part of Dartmouth Museum. Much of the interior survives from that time.\nThe Royal Castle Hotel was built in 1639 on the then new quay. The building was re-fronted in the 19th century, and as the new frontage is itself listed, it is not possible to see the original which lies beneath. A claimant for the oldest building is a former merchant's house in Higher Street, now a Good Beer Guide listed public house called \"the Cherub\", built circa 1380. Agincourt House (next to the Lower Ferry) is also 14th century.\nThe remains of a fort at Gallants Bower just outside the town are some of the best preserved remains of a Civil War defensive structure. The fort was built by Royalist occupation forces in c. 1643 to the south east of the town, with a similar fort at Mount Ridley on the opposite slopes of what is now Kingswear. The Parliamentarian General Fairfax attacked from the north in 1646, taking the town and forcing the Royalists to surrender, after which Gallants Bower was demolished.\n19th century.\nBefore 1671, what is now the town centre was almost entirely tidal mud flats. The New Road (now Victoria Road) was constructed across the bed of the (silted up) Mill Pool and up the Ford valley after 1823. \nThe population in the 1841 census was 4,663 inhabitants. On 1 January 1848 there were 451 registered vessels in the port with a combined tonnage of 32,080 tons.\nSpithead was extended in 1864 when the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway arrived in Kingswear and a pontoon was constructed, linked to Spithead by a bridge. The railway directors and others formed the Dartmouth Harbour Commissioners. \nAt this time, all the roads in those parts of Dartmouth which were not land reclamations were very narrow. In 1864-7 Higher Street was widened into Southtown and linked to Lower Street, which was also widened, with the northern part renamed Fairfax Place. Some of the buildings were rebuilt further back with decorative frontages.\nIn 1881 the Harbour Commissioners produced a scheme for an embankment or esplanade from near the Lower Ferry to Hardness, across the remains of The Pool, to provide an attraction for tourists and further mooring space. It was completed in 1885 after much disagreement between the Borough, the Commissioners and the Railway (now the Great Western Railway). A new station was also built at this time. The building of the Embankment left a section of river isolated between Spithead and the New Ground, which is known as The Boatfloat, and is linked to the river by a bridge for small vessels under the road.\nThe coming of steam ships led to Dartmouth being used as a bunkering port, with coal being brought in by ship or train. Coal lumpers were members of gangs, who competed to bunker the ships by racing to be first to a ship. This led to the men living as close as possible to the river, and their tenements became grossly overcrowded, with the families living in slum conditions, with up to 15 families in one house, one family to a room.\nThe Royal National Lifeboat Institution opened the Dart Lifeboat Station at the Sand Quay in 1878, but it was closed in 1896. In all this time only one effective rescue was made by the lifeboat.\n20th century.\nThe area to the north of Ridge Hill was a shallow and muddy bay (\"Coombe Mud\") with a narrow road running along the shore linking with the Higher Ferry. The mud was a dumping ground for vessels, including a submarine. The reclamation was completed in 1937 by the extension of the Embankment and the reclamation of the mud behind it, which became Coronation Park. \nIn the 1920s, aided by government grants, the council made a start on clearing the slums. This was aided by the decline in the use of coal as a fuel for ships. The slums were demolished, and the inhabitants were rehoused in new houses in the Britannia Avenue area, to the west of the old village or hamlet of Townstal. The process was interrupted by the second world war, but was resumed with the construction of many prefabs, and later more houses. Community facilities were minimal at first, but a central area was reserved for a church, which was used by the Baptists and opened in 1954, together with a speedway track. The latter was later used for housing, but a new community centre was opened nearby, together with a leisure centre, an outdoor swimming pool, and later an indoor pool, and supermarkets. There are also light industrial units.\nIn the latter part of the Second World War the town was a base for American forces and one of the departure points for Utah Beach in the D Day landings. Slipways and harbour improvements were also constructed. Much of the surrounding countryside and notably Slapton Sands was closed to the public while it was used by US troops for practise landings and manoeuvres. \nBetween 1985 and 1990 the Embankment was widened by 6 metres and raised to prevent flooding at spring tides. A tidal lock gate was provided at the Boatfloat bridge, which could be closed at such times.\n21st century.\nDart Lifeboat Station was reopened in 2007, the first time that a lifeboat had been stationed in the town since 1896. It has initially been kept in a temporary building in Coronation Park.\nIn 2010, a fire seriously damaged numerous historical properties in Fairfax Place and Higher Street. Several were Tudor and Grade I or Grade II listed buildings.\nGovernance.\nThe town was an ancient borough, incorporated by Edward III, known formally as Clifton-Dartmouth-Hardness, and consisting of the three parishes of \"St Petrox\", \"St Saviour\" and \"Townstal\", and incorporating the hamlets of Ford, Old Mill and Norton. It was reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The town returned two members of parliament from the 13th century until 1835, after which one Member of Parliament (MP) was elected until the town was disenfranchised in 1868. It remained a municipal borough until 1974, when it was merged into the South Hams district, and became a successor parish of Dartmouth with a town council.\nDartmouth Town Council is the lowest of three tiers of local government. It consists of 16 councillors representing the two wards of Clifton and Townstal. At the second tier, Dartmouth forms part of the Dartmouth and Kingswear ward of South Hams District Council, which returns three councillors. At the upper tier of local government Dartmouth and Kingswear Electoral Division elects one member to Devon County Council.\nCulture and tourism.\nThe Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta takes place annually over three days at the end of August. The event sees the traditional regatta boat races along with markets, fun fairs, community games, musical performances, air displays including the Red Arrows and fireworks. A Royal Navy guard ship is often present at the event.\nOther cultural events include beer festivals in February and July (the latter in Kingswear), a music festival and an art and craft weekend in June, a food festival in October and a Christmas candlelit event.\nThe Flavel Centre incorporates the public library and performance spaces, featuring films, live music and comedy and exhibitions.\nBayard's Cove has been used in several television productions, including \"The Onedin Line\" a popular BBC television drama series that ran from 1971 to 1980. Many of the scenes from the BBC's popular series \"Down to Earth\", starring Ricky Tomlinson, were filmed at various locations around the town.\nNotable tourist attractions include the Dartmouth Royal Naval College, Bayard's Cove Fort, Dartmouth Castle and the Dartmouth Steam Railway which terminates at Kingswear on the opposite bank of the river.\nBoat cruises to nearby places along the coast (such as Torbay and Start Bay) and up the river (to Totnes, Dittisham and the Greenway Estate) are provided by several companies. The paddlesteamer PS Kingswear Castle returned to the town in 2013. The South West Coast Path National Trail passes through the town, and also through extensive National Trust coastal properties at Little Dartmouth and Brownstone (Kingswear). The Dart Valley Trail starts in Dartmouth, with routes either side of the River Dart as far as Dittisham, and continuing to Totnes via Cornworthy, Tuckenhay and Ashprington. The area has long been well regarded for yachting, and there are extensive marinas at Sandquay, Kingswear and Noss (approximately one mile north of Kingswear).\nClimate.\nThe nearest Met Office weather station is Slapton, about 5 miles south-south west of Dartmouth and a similar distance from the coast. As with the rest of the British Isles and South West England, the area experiences a maritime climate with warm summers and mild winters\u2014this is particularly pronounced due to its position near the coast\u2014extremes range from a record low of just in January 1987 up to a record high of during June 1976.\nTransport.\nDartmouth is linked to Kingswear, on the other side of the River Dart, by three ferries. The Higher Ferry and the Lower Ferry are both vehicular ferries. The Passenger Ferry, as its name suggests, carries only passengers, principally to connect with the Dartmouth Steam Railway at Kingswear railway station. The nearest bridge across the Dart is in Totnes, some away by road.\nThe A379 road runs through Dartmouth, linking the town to Slapton and Kingsbridge to the southwest and to Torbay to the east across the Higher Ferry. The A3122 connects Dartmouth to a junction with the A381, and hence to both Totnes and a more direct route to Kingsbridge.\nStagecoach South West provides local town bus services and links to Plymouth, Totnes and Exeter, and Kingsbridge. In addition it provides links to the Torbay resorts of Brixham, Paignton and Torquay from Kingswear via the ferry.\nNo railway has ever run to Dartmouth, but the town does have a railway station, opened on 31 March 1890 to replace the original facility on the pontoon, although it is now a restaurant. In fact Dartmouth Railway Station was built while the line from Paignton to the River Dart was still being built, anticipating a bridge across the river being built near the present Greenway Halt. The railway line to Kingswear was opened in 1864. As a result of shortage of capital, a deviation from the original scheme to run the line from Churston to Greenway with a steamer service to Dartmouth was proposed, but defeated in Parliament. It had been suggested that this could, at a later date, be used as a jumping off point for a bridge to the west bank of the Dart and a line direct to Dartmouth. In 1900, a Light Railway scheme was proposed for a crossing of the Dart near Maypool to join another line from Totnes and then proceed to Kingsbridge and Yealmpton, with a branch to Salcombe. This was also defeated by lack of funds. The railway terminated at a station called \"Kingswear for Dartmouth\" (now on the Dartmouth Steam Railway) and a ferry took passengers across the river to the station at Dartmouth railway station, which had a dedicated pontoon. British Railways formally closed the line to mainline passenger trains in 1973, but it immediately re-opened as a heritage line and has run as one ever since.\nMedia.\nLocal TV coverage is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Beacon Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated south east of the town.\nLocal radio stations include BBC Radio Devon on 104.3 FM, Heart West on 96.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South Devon on 105.5 FM, and Radio Exe on 107.3 FM.\n\"The Dartmouth Chronicle\" is the town's local weekly newspaper.\nEducation.\nBritannia Royal Naval College.\nThe town is home to the Royal Navy's officer training college (Britannia Royal Naval College), where all officers of the Royal Navy and many foreign naval officers are trained.\nSchools.\nDartmouth has one primary school\u2014St John the Baptist R.C. Primary School, and one all-through school\u2014Dartmouth Academy\u2014for those aged 3\u201316. Dartmouth also has a pre-school in the centre of town, established for over 40 years and based in the old Victorian school rooms at South Ford Road. It provides care for 2- to 5-year-olds and is run as a charitable organisation.\nSport and leisure.\nDartmouth has a Non-League football club Dartmouth A.F.C. who play at Long Cross.\nDartmouth also hosts the annual \"World Indoor Rally Championship\", based on slot car racing in the late summer.\nAt the end of August and early September there is the annual Port of Dartmouth Royal Regatta.\nSince 1905 Dartmouth has had a greenhouse as part of the Royal Avenue Gardens. In May 2013 this building, used for the previous 10 years by Dartmouth in Bloom, a not-for-profit organisation affiliated with Britain in Bloom, was closed as structurally unsound. There are proposals to restore the greenhouse to its prior Edwardian style.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8420", "revid": "4280259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8420", "title": "Dodo", "text": "Extinct species of bird\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, which is east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest relative was the also-extinct and flightless Rodrigues solitaire. The two formed the subtribe Raphina, a clade of extinct flightless birds that are a part of the group that includes pigeons and doves (the family Columbidae). The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of R\u00e9union, but it is now believed that this assumption was merely confusion based on the also-extinct R\u00e9union ibis and paintings of white dodos.\nSubfossil remains show the dodo measured about in height and may have weighed in the wild. The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century. Since these portraits vary considerably, and since only some of the illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, the dodos' exact appearance in life remains unresolved, and little is known about its behaviour. It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage, yellow feet, a tuft of tail feathers, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. It used gizzard stones to help digest its food, which is thought to have included fruits, and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius. One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg. It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius. Though the dodo has historically been portrayed as being fat and clumsy, it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem. \nThe first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662. Its extinction was not immediately noticed, and some considered the bird to be a myth. In the 19th century, research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century. Among these is a dried head, the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today. Since then, a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius, mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp. The extinction of the dodo less than a century after its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species. The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", and it has since become a fixture in popular culture, often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence.\nTaxonomy.\nThe dodo was variously declared a small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture, by early scientists. In 1842, Danish zoologist Johannes Theodor Reinhardt proposed that dodos were ground pigeons, based on studies of a dodo skull he had discovered in the collection of the Natural History Museum of Denmark. This view was met with ridicule, but was later supported by English naturalists Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville in their 1848 monograph \"The Dodo and Its Kindred\", which attempted to separate myth from reality. After dissecting the preserved head and foot of the specimen at the Oxford University Museum and comparing it with the few remains then available of the extinct Rodrigues solitaire (\"Pezophaps solitaria\"), they concluded that the two were closely related. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features of the leg bones, otherwise known only in pigeons.\nStrickland and Melville established that the dodo was anatomically similar to pigeons in many features. They pointed to the very short keratinous portion of the beak, with its long, slender, naked basal part. Other pigeons also have bare skin around their eyes, almost reaching their beak, as in dodos. The forehead was high in relation to the beak, and the nostril was located low on the middle of the beak and surrounded by skin, a combination of features shared only with pigeons. The legs of the dodo were generally more similar to those of terrestrial pigeons than of other birds, both in their scales and in their skeletal features. Depictions of the large crop hinted at a relationship with pigeons, in which this feature is more developed than in other birds. Pigeons generally have very small clutches, and the dodo is said to have laid a single egg. Like pigeons, the dodo lacked the vomer and septum of the nostrils, and it shared details in the mandible, the zygomatic bone, the palate, and the hallux. The dodo differed from other pigeons mainly in the small size of the wings and the large size of the beak in proportion to the rest of the cranium.\nThroughout the 19th century, several species were classified as congeneric with the dodo, including the Rodrigues solitaire and the R\u00e9union solitaire, as \"Didus solitarius\" and \"Raphus solitarius\", respectively (\"Didus\" and \"Raphus\" being names for the dodo genus used by different authors of the time). An atypical 17th-century description of a dodo and bones found on Rodrigues, now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues solitaire, led Abraham Dee Bartlett to name a new species, \"Didus nazarenus\", in 1852. Based on solitaire remains, it is now a synonym of that species. Crude drawings of the red rail of Mauritius were also misinterpreted as dodo species; \"Didus broeckii\" and \"Didus herberti\".\nFor many years the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire were placed in a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in its own monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in the columbid subfamily Raphinae and tribe Raphini, along with their closest relatives. In 2024, the new subtribe Raphina was created to include only the dodo and the solitaire.\nEvolution.\nIn 2002, American geneticist Beth Shapiro and colleagues analysed the DNA of the dodo for the first time. Comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome \"b\" and 12S rRNA sequences isolated from a tarsal of the Oxford specimen and a femur of a Rodrigues solitaire confirmed their close relationship and their placement within the Columbidae. The genetic evidence was interpreted as showing the Southeast Asian Nicobar pigeon (\"Caloenas nicobarica\") to be their closest living relative, followed by the crowned pigeons (\"Goura\") of New Guinea, and the superficially dodo-like tooth-billed pigeon (\"Didunculus strigirostris\") from Samoa (its scientific name refers to its dodo-like beak). This clade consists of generally ground-dwelling island endemic pigeons. The following cladogram shows the dodo's closest relationships within the Columbidae, based on Shapiro and colleagues, 2002:\nA similar cladogram was published in 2007, inverting the placement of \"Goura\" and \"Didunculus\" and including the pheasant pigeon (\"Otidiphaps nobilis\") and the thick-billed ground pigeon (\"Trugon terrestris\") at the base of the clade. The DNA used in these studies was obtained from the Oxford specimen, and since this material is degraded, and no usable DNA has been extracted from subfossil remains, these findings still need to be independently verified. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the subfamily Gourinae along with the \"Goura\" pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence. In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (\"Caloenas maculata\") was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.\nThe 2002 study indicated that the ancestors of the dodo and the solitaire diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary, about 23.03\u00a0million years ago. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, R\u00e9union, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10\u00a0million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed at the base of a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes and flightlessness. Despite its divergent skull morphology and adaptations for larger size, many features of its skeleton remained similar to those of smaller, flying pigeons. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (\"Natunaornis gigoura\"), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the dodo and the solitaire, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.\nEtymology.\nOne of the original names for the dodo was the Dutch \"Walghvoghel\", first used in the journal of Dutch Vice Admiral Wybrand van Warwijck, who visited Mauritius during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia in 1598. \"Walghe\" means \"tasteless\", \"insipid\", or \"sickly\", and means \"bird\". The name was translated by Jakob Friedlib into German as \"Walchst\u00f6k\" or \"Walchv\u00f6gel\". The original Dutch report titled \"Waarachtige Beschryving\" was lost, but the English translation survived:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;On their left hand was a little island which they named Heemskirk Island, and the bay it selve they called Warwick Bay... Here they taried 12. daies to refresh themselues, finding in this place great quantity of foules twice as bigge as swans, which they call Walghstocks or Wallowbirdes being very good meat. But finding an abundance of pigeons &amp; popinnayes [parrots], they disdained any more to eat those great foules calling them Wallowbirds, that is to say lothsome or fulsome birdes.\nAnother account from that voyage, perhaps the first to mention the dodo, states that the Portuguese referred to them as penguins. The meaning may not have been derived from \"penguin\" (the Portuguese referred to those birds as \"fotilicaios\" at the time), but from \"pinion\", a reference to the small wings. The crew of the Dutch ship \"Gelderland\" referred to the bird as \"Dronte\" (meaning \"swollen\") in 1602, a name that is still used in some languages. This crew also called them \"griff-eendt\" and \"kermisgans\", in reference to fowl fattened for the Kermesse festival in Amsterdam, which was held the day after they anchored on Mauritius.\nThe etymology of the word \"dodo\" is unclear. Some ascribe it to the Dutch word \"dodoor\" for \"sluggard\", but it is more probably related to \"Dodaars\", which means either \"fat-arse\" or \"knot-arse\", referring to the knot of feathers on the hind end. The first record of the word \"Dodaars\" is in Captain Willem Van West-Zanen's journal in 1602. The English writer Sir Thomas Herbert was the first to use the word \"dodo\" in print in his 1634 travelogue claiming it was referred to as such by the Portuguese, who had visited Mauritius in 1507. Another Englishman, Emmanuel Altham, had used the word in a 1628 letter in which he also claimed its origin was Portuguese. The name \"dodar\" was introduced into English at the same time as dodo, but was only used until the 18th century. As far as is known, the Portuguese never mentioned the bird. Nevertheless, some sources still state that the word \"dodo\" derives from the Portuguese word \"doudo\" (currently \"doido\"), meaning \"fool\" or \"crazy\". It has also been suggested that \"dodo\" was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird's call, a two-note pigeon-like sound resembling \"doo-doo\".\nThe Latin name \"cucullatus\" (\"hooded\") was first used in 1635 by the Spanish Jesuit Juan Eusebio Nieremberg as \"Cygnus cucullatus\", in reference to Carolus Clusius's 1605 depiction of a dodo. In the tenth edition of his 18th-century classic work \"Systema Naturae\", the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus used \"cucullatus\" as the specific name, but combined it with the genus name \"Struthio\" (ostrich). Mathurin Jacques Brisson coined the genus name \"Raphus\" (referring to the bustards) in 1760, resulting in the current name \"Raphus cucullatus\". In 1766, Linnaeus coined the new binomial \"Didus ineptus\" (meaning \"inept dodo\"). This has become a synonym of the earlier name because of nomenclatural priority.\nDescription.\nAs no complete dodo specimens exist, its external appearance, such as plumage and colouration, is hard to determine. Illustrations and written accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction (1598\u20131662) are the primary evidence for its external appearance. According to most representations, the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage, with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end. The head was grey and naked, the beak green, black and yellow, and the legs were stout and yellowish, with black claws. A study of the few remaining feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous (downy) and most similar to those of other pigeons.\nSubfossil remains and remnants of the birds that were brought to Europe in the 17th century show that dodos were very large birds, measuring about in height. The bird was sexually dimorphic; males were larger and had proportionally longer beaks. Weight estimates have varied from study to study. In 1993, Bradley C. Livezey proposed that males would have weighed and females . Also in 1993, Andrew C. Kitchener attributed a high contemporary weight estimate and the roundness of dodos depicted in Europe to these birds having been overfed in captivity; weights in the wild were estimated to have been in the range of , and fattened birds could have weighed . A 2011 estimate by Angst and colleagues gave an average weight as low as . This has also been questioned, and there is still controversy over weight estimates. A 2016 study estimated the weight at , based on CT scans of composite skeletons. It has also been suggested that the weight depended on the season, and that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but less so during hot.\nSkeleton.\nThe skull of the dodo differed much from those of other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The upper bill was nearly twice as long as the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated along the length of the beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.\nThe dodo had about nineteen presynsacral vertebrae (those of the neck and thorax, including three fused into a notarium), sixteen synsacral vertebrae (those of the lumbar region and sacrum), six free tail (caudal) vertebrae, and a pygostyle. The neck had well-developed areas for muscle and ligament attachment, probably to support the heavy skull and beak. On each side, it had six ribs, four of which articulated with the sternum through sternal ribs. The sternum was large, but small in relation to the body compared to those of much smaller pigeons that are able to fly. The sternum was highly pneumatic, broad, and relatively thick in cross-section. The bones of the pectoral girdle, shoulder blades, and wing bones were reduced in size compared to those of flighted pigeon, and were more gracile compared to those of the Rodrigues solitaire, but none of the individual skeletal components had disappeared. The carpometacarpus of the dodo was more robust than that of the solitaire, however. The pelvis was wider than that of the solitaire and other relatives, yet was comparable to the proportions in some smaller, flighted pigeons. Most of the leg bones were more robust than those of extant pigeons and the solitaire, but the length proportions were little different.\nMany of the skeletal features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire, its closest relative, from other pigeons have been attributed to their flightlessness. The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight, and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic, meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features. The skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, meaning that they changed considerably with age. The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire, such as features of the skull, pelvis, and sternum, as well as their large size. It differed in other aspects, such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire, having a larger skull and beak, a rounded skull roof, and smaller orbits. The dodo's neck and legs were proportionally shorter, and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire's wrists.\nContemporary descriptions.\nMost contemporary descriptions of the dodo are found in ship's logs and journals of the Dutch East India Company vessels that docked in Mauritius when the Dutch Empire ruled the island. These records were used as guides for future voyages. Few contemporary accounts are reliable, as many seem to be based on earlier accounts, and none were written by scientists. One of the earliest accounts, from van Warwijck's 1598 journal, describes the bird as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Blue parrots are very numerous there, as well as other birds; among which are a kind, conspicuous for their size, larger than our swans, with huge heads only half covered with skin as if clothed with a hood. These birds lack wings, in the place of which 3 or 4 blackish feathers protrude. The tail consists of a few soft incurved feathers, which are ash coloured. These we used to call 'Walghvogel', for the reason that the longer and oftener they were cooked, the less soft and more insipid eating they became. Nevertheless their belly and breast were of a pleasant flavour and easily masticated.\nOne of the most detailed descriptions is by Herbert in \"A Relation of Some Yeares Travaille into Afrique and the Greater Asia\" from 1634:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;First here only and in Dygarrois [Rodrigues] is generated the Dodo, which for shape and rareness may antagonize the Phoenix of Arabia: her body is round and fat, few weigh less than fifty pound. It is reputed more for wonder than for food, greasie stomackes may seeke after them, but to the delicate they are offensive and of no nourishment. Her visage darts forth melancholy, as sensible of Nature's injurie in framing so great a body to be guided with complementall wings, so small and impotent, that they serve only to prove her bird. The halfe of her head is naked seeming couered with a fine vaile, her bill is crooked downwards, in midst is the thrill [nostril], from which part to the end tis a light green, mixed with pale yellow tincture; her eyes are small and like to Diamonds, round and rowling; her clothing downy feathers, her train three small plumes, short and inproportionable, her legs suiting her body, her pounces sharpe, her appetite strong and greedy. Stones and iron are digested, which description will better be conceived in her representation.\nContemporary depictions.\nThe travel journal of the Dutch ship \"Gelderland\" (1601\u20131603), rediscovered in the 1860s, contains the only known sketches of living or recently killed specimens drawn on Mauritius. They have been attributed to the professional artist Joris Joostensz Laerle, who also drew other now-extinct Mauritian birds, and to a second, less refined artist. Apart from these sketches, it is unknown how many of the twenty or so 17th-century illustrations of the dodos were drawn from life or from stuffed specimens, which affects their reliability. Since dodos are otherwise only known from limited physical remains and descriptions, contemporary artworks are important to reconstruct their appearance in life. While there has been an effort since the mid-19th century to list all historical illustrations of dodos, previously unknown depictions continue to be discovered occasionally.\nThe traditional image of the dodo is of a very fat and clumsy bird, but this view may be exaggerated. The general opinion of scientists today is that many old European depictions were based on overfed captive birds or crudely stuffed specimens. It has also been suggested that the images might show dodos with puffed feathers, as part of display behaviour. The Dutch painter Roelant Savery was the most prolific and influential illustrator of the dodo, having made at least twelve depictions, often showing it in the lower corners. A famous painting of his from 1626, now called \"Edwards's Dodo\" as it was once owned by the ornithologist George Edwards, has since become the standard image of a dodo. It is housed in the Natural History Museum, London. The image shows a particularly fat bird and is the source for many other dodo illustrations.\nAn Indian Mughal painting rediscovered in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, in 1955 shows a dodo along with native Indian birds. It depicts a slimmer, brownish bird, and its discoverer Aleksander Iwanow and British palaeontologist Julian Hume regarded it as one of the most accurate depictions of the living dodo; the surrounding birds are clearly identifiable and depicted with appropriate colouring. It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to the Mughal painter Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where the English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen two dodos sometime between 1628 and 1633. In 2014, another Indian illustration of a dodo was reported, but it was found to be derivative of an 1836 German illustration.\nAll post-1638 depictions appear to be based on earlier images, around the time reports mentioning dodos became rarer. Differences in the depictions led ornithologists such as Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans and Masauji Hachisuka to speculate about sexual dimorphism, ontogenic traits, seasonal variation, and even the existence of different species, but these theories are not accepted today. Because details such as markings of the beak, the form of the tail feathers, and colouration vary from account to account, it is impossible to determine the exact morphology of these features, whether they signal age or sex, or if they even reflect reality. Hume argued that the nostrils of the living dodo would have been slits, as seen in the \"Gelderland\", Cornelis Saftleven, Savery's Crocker Art Gallery, and Mansur images. According to this claim, the gaping nostrils often seen in paintings indicate that taxidermy specimens were used as models. Most depictions show that the wings were held in an extended position, unlike flighted pigeons, but similar to ratites such as the ostrich and kiwi.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nLittle is known of the behaviour of the dodo, as most contemporary descriptions are very brief. Based on weight estimates, it has been suggested the male could reach the age of 21, and the female 17. Studies of the cantilever strength of its leg bones indicate that it could run quite fast. The legs were robust and strong to support the bulk of the bird, and also made it agile and manoeuvrable in the dense, pre-human landscape. Though the wings were small, well-developed muscle scars on the bones show that they were not completely vestigial, and may have been used for display behaviour and balance; extant pigeons also use their wings for such purposes. Unlike the Rodrigues solitaire, there is no evidence that the dodo used its wings in intraspecific combat. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison. The dodo may instead have used its large, hooked beak in territorial disputes. Since Mauritius receives more rainfall and has less seasonal variation than Rodrigues, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the dodo would have less reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. The Rodrigues solitaire was therefore probably the more aggressive of the two. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; the brain-to-body-size ratio was similar to that of modern pigeons, indicating that dodos were probably equal in intelligence.\nThe preferred habitat of the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions suggest that it inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view is supported by the fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the \"Gelderland\" journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l'\u00eele aux B\u00e9nitiers in Tamarin Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and \"Pandanus\" trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.\nMany endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of humans, so the ecosystem of the island is badly damaged and hard to conserve. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, but very little remains of them today, because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The dodo lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the flightless red rail, the broad-billed parrot, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius scops owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink, and the Round Island burrowing boa. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail \"Tropidophora carinata\" lived on Mauritius and R\u00e9union, but vanished from both islands. Some plants, such as \"Casearia tinifolia\" and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.\nDiet and feeding.\nA 1631 Dutch letter (long thought lost, but rediscovered in 2017) is the only account of the dodo's diet, and also mentions that it used its beak for defence. The document uses word-play to refer to the animals described, with dodos presumably being an allegory for wealthy mayors:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn addition to fallen fruits, the dodo probably subsisted on nuts, seeds, bulbs, and roots. It has also been suggested that the dodo might have eaten crabs and shellfish, like their relatives the crowned pigeons. Its feeding habits must have been versatile, since captive specimens were probably given a wide range of food on the long sea journeys. Oudemans suggested that as Mauritius has marked dry and wet seasons, the dodo probably fattened itself on ripe fruits at the end of the wet season to survive the dry season, when food was scarce; contemporary reports describe the bird's \"greedy\" appetite. The Mauritian ornithologist France Staub suggested in 1996 that they mainly fed on palm fruits, and he attempted to correlate the fat-cycle of the dodo with the fruiting regime of the palms.\nSkeletal elements of the upper jaw appear to have been rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears to have been able to withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. Examination of the brain endocast found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.\nSeveral contemporary sources state that the dodo used Gastroliths (gizzard stones) to aid digestion. The English writer Sir Hamon L'Estrange witnessed a live bird in London and described it as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;About 1638, as I walked London streets, I saw the picture of a strange looking fowle hung out upon a clothe and myselfe with one or two more in company went in to see it. It was kept in a chamber, and was a great fowle somewhat bigger than the largest Turkey cock, and so legged and footed, but stouter and thicker and of more erect shape, coloured before like the breast of a young cock fesan, and on the back of a dunn or dearc colour. The keeper called it a Dodo, and in the ende of a chymney in the chamber there lay a heape of large pebble stones, whereof hee gave it many in our sight, some as big as nutmegs, and the keeper told us that she eats them (conducing to digestion), and though I remember not how far the keeper was questioned therein, yet I am confident that afterwards she cast them all again.\nIt is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. Contemporary depictions show a large crop, which was probably used to add space for food storage and to produce crop milk. It has been suggested that the maximum size attained by the dodo and the solitaire was limited by the amount of crop milk they could produce for their young during early growth.\nIn 1973, the tambalacoque, also known as the dodo tree, was thought to be dying out on Mauritius, to which it is endemic. There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. Stanley Temple hypothesised that it depended on the dodo for its propagation, and that its seeds would germinate only after passing through the bird's digestive tract. He claimed that the tambalacoque was now nearly coextinct because of the disappearance of the dodo. Temple overlooked reports from the 1940s that found that tambalacoque seeds germinated, albeit very rarely, without being abraded during digestion. Others have contested his hypothesis and suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated or seeds were also distributed by other extinct animals such as \"Cylindraspis\" tortoises, fruit bats, or the broad-billed parrot. The ecologists Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke stated in 1991 that while rare, the tree has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers several hundred, not 13 as claimed by Temple, hence, discrediting Temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.\nThe Brazilian ornithologist Carlos Yamashita suggested in 1997 that the broad-billed parrot may have depended on dodos and \"Cylindraspis\" tortoises to eat palm fruits and excrete their seeds, which became food for the parrots. \"Anodorhynchus\" macaws depended on now-extinct South American megafauna in the same way, but now rely on domesticated cattle for this service. The biologist Joanna K. Carpenter and colleagues stated in 2020 that extinct Mascarene birds like the dodo, the Rodrigues solitaire, and the broad-billed parrot could only reach seeds at low heights, and were therefore probably important seed dispersers, able to destroy the largest seeds among the native flora. In 2023, the biologist Julia H. Heinen and colleagues noted that the loss of the dodo (which probably preferred large seeds and fruits) and other native frugivores had a negative impact on seed dispersal of native plants due to the lack of species with their gape size, and that seed-handling of introduced species was ecologically different, and therefore does not restore this functionality there.\nReproduction and development.\nAs it was flightless and terrestrial and there were no mammalian predators or other kinds of natural enemy on Mauritius, the dodo probably nested on the ground. The account by Fran\u00e7ois Cauche from 1651 is the only description of the egg and the call:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have seen in Mauritius birds bigger than a Swan, without feathers on the body, which is covered with a black down; the hinder part is round, the rump adorned with curled feathers as many in number as the bird is years old. In place of wings they have feathers like these last, black and curved, without webs. They have no tongues, the beak is large, curving a little downwards; their legs are long, scaly, with only three toes on each foot. It has a cry like a gosling, and is by no means so savoury to eat as the Flamingos and Ducks of which we have just spoken. They only lay one egg which is white, the size of a halfpenny roll, by the side of which they place a white stone the size of a hen's egg. They lay on grass which they collect, and make their nests in the forests; if one kills the young one, a grey stone is found in the gizzard. We call them \"Oiseaux de Nazaret\". The fat is excellent to give ease to the muscles and nerves.\nCauche's account is problematic, since it also mentions that the bird he was describing had three toes and no tongue, unlike dodos. This led some to believe that Cauche was describing a new species of dodo (\"Didus nazarenus\"). The description was most probably mingled with that of a cassowary, and Cauche's writings have other inconsistencies. A mention of a \"young ostrich\" taken on board a ship in 1617 is the only other reference to a possible juvenile dodo. An egg claimed to be that of a dodo is stored in the East London Museum in South Africa. It was donated by the South African museum official Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer, whose great aunt had received it from a captain who claimed to have found it in a swamp on Mauritius. In 2010, the curator of the museum proposed using genetic studies to determine its authenticity. It may instead be an aberrant ostrich egg.\nBecause of the possible single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced few altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size and the fact that tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.\nA 2017 study examined the histology of thin-sectioned dodo bones, modern Mauritian birds, local ecology, and contemporary accounts, to recover information about the life history of the dodo. The study suggested that dodos bred around August, after having potentially fattened themselves, corresponding with the fat and thin cycles of many vertebrates of Mauritius. The chicks grew rapidly, reaching robust, almost adult, sizes, and sexual maturity before Austral summer or the cyclone season. Adult dodos which had just bred moulted after Austral summer, around March. The feathers of the wings and tail were replaced first, and the moulting would have completed at the end of July, in time for the next breeding season. Different stages of moulting may also account for inconsistencies in contemporary descriptions of dodo plumage.\nRelationship with humans.\nMauritius had previously been visited by Arab vessels in the Middle Ages and Portuguese ships between 1507 and 1513, but was settled by neither. No records of dodos by these are known, although the Portuguese name for Mauritius, \"Cerne (swan) Island\", may have been a reference to dodos. The Dutch Empire acquired Mauritius in 1598, renaming it after Maurice of Nassau, and it was used for the provisioning of trade vessels of the Dutch East India Company henceforward. \nThe earliest known accounts of the dodo were provided by Dutch travellers during the Second Dutch Expedition to Indonesia, led by admiral Jacob van Neck in 1598. They appear in reports published in 1601, which also contain the first published illustration of the bird. Since the first sailors to visit Mauritius had been at sea for a long time, their interest in these large birds was mainly culinary. The 1602 journal by Willem Van West-Zanen of the ship \"Bruin-Vis\" mentions that 24\u201325 dodos were hunted for food, which were so large that two could scarcely be consumed at mealtime, their remains being preserved by salting. An illustration made for the 1648 published version of this journal, showing the killing of dodos, a dugong, and possibly Mascarene grey parakeets, was captioned with a Dutch poem, here in Hugh Strickland's 1848 translation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nFor food the seamen hunt the flesh of feathered fowl,\nThey tap the palms, and round-rumped dodos they destroy,\nThe parrot's life they spare that he may peep and howl,\nAnd thus his fellows to imprisonment decoy.&lt;/poem&gt;\nSome early travellers found dodo meat unsavoury, and preferred to eat parrots and pigeons; others described it as tough, but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters had to be careful not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.\nThe appearance of the dodo and the red rail led Peter Mundy to speculate, 230 years before Charles Darwin's theory of evolution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDodos transported abroad.\nThe dodo was found interesting enough that living specimens were sent to Europe and the East. The number of transported dodos that reached their destinations alive is uncertain, and it is unknown how they relate to contemporary depictions and the few non-fossil remains in European museums. Based on a combination of contemporary accounts, paintings, and specimens, Julian Hume has inferred that at least eleven transported dodos reached their destinations alive.\nHamon L'Estrange's description of a dodo that he saw in London in 1638 is the only account that specifically mentions a live specimen in Europe. In 1626 Adriaen van de Venne drew a dodo that he claimed to have seen in Amsterdam, but he did not mention if it was alive, and his depiction is reminiscent of Savery's \"Edwards's Dodo\". Two live specimens were seen by Peter Mundy in Surat, India, between 1628 and 1634, one of which may have been the individual painted by Mansur around 1625. In 1628, Emmanuel Altham visited Mauritius and sent a letter to his brother in England:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Right wo and lovinge brother, we were ordered by ye said councell to go to an island called Mauritius, lying in 20d. of south latt., where we arrived ye 28th of May; this island having many goates, hogs and cowes upon it, and very strange fowles, called by ye portingalls Dodo, which for the rareness of the same, the like being not in ye world but here, I have sent you one by Mr. Perce, who did arrive with the ship William at this island ye 10th of June. [In the margin of the letter] Of Mr. Perce you shall receive a jarr of ginger for my sister, some beades for my cousins your daughters, and a bird called a Dodo, if it live.\nWhether the dodo survived the journey is unknown, and the letter was destroyed by fire in the 19th century.\nThe earliest known picture of a dodo specimen in Europe is from a c.\u20091610 collection of paintings depicting animals in the royal menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague. This collection includes paintings of other Mauritian animals as well, including a red rail. The dodo, which may be a juvenile, seems to have been dried or embalmed, and had probably lived in the emperor's zoo for a while together with the other animals. That whole stuffed dodos were present in Europe indicates they had been brought alive and died there; it is unlikely that taxidermists were on board the visiting ships, and spirits were not yet used to preserve biological specimens. Most tropical specimens were preserved as dried heads and feet.\nOne dodo was reportedly sent as far as Nagasaki, Japan, in 1647, but it was long unknown whether it arrived. Contemporary documents first published in 2014 proved the story, and showed that it had arrived alive. It was meant as a gift, and, despite its rarity, was considered of equal value to a white deer and a bezoar stone. It is the last recorded live dodo in captivity.\nExtinction.\nLike many animals that evolved in isolation from significant predators, the dodo was entirely fearless of humans. This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey, but predation by humans was not the main cause of extinction, contrary to popular belief. Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships' provisions, archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation. Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century, which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high, broken terrain. The human population on Mauritius (an area of ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century, but they introduced other animals, including dogs, pigs, cats, rats, and crab-eating macaques, which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources. At the same time, humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos. The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population, especially the pigs and macaques, is today considered more severe than that of hunting. Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests, since dodos would have been used to dealing with local land crabs.\nIt has been suggested that the dodo may already have been rare or localised before the arrival of humans on Mauritius, since it would have been unlikely to become extinct so rapidly if it had occupied all the remote areas of the island. A 2005 expedition found subfossil remains of dodos and other animals killed by a flash flood. Such mass mortalities would have further jeopardised a species already in danger of becoming extinct. Yet the fact that the dodo survived hundreds of years of volcanic activity and climatic changes shows the bird was resilient within its ecosystem.\nSome controversy surrounds the date of its extinction. The last widely accepted record of a dodo sighting is the 1662 report by shipwrecked mariner Volkert Evertsz of the Dutch ship \"Arnhem\", who described birds caught on a small islet off Mauritius, now suggested to be Amber Island:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These animals on our coming up to them stared at us and remained quiet where they stand, not knowing whether they had wings to fly away or legs to run off, and suffering us to approach them as close as we pleased. Amongst these birds were those which in India they call Dod-aersen (being a kind of very big goose); these birds are unable to fly, and instead of wings, they merely have a few small pins, yet they can run very swiftly. We drove them together into one place in such a manner that we could catch them with our hands, and when we held one of them by its leg, and that upon this it made a great noise, the others all on a sudden came running as fast as they could to its assistance, and by which they were caught and made prisoners also.\nThe dodos on this islet may not necessarily have been the last members of the species. The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688. A 2003 statistical analysis of these records by the biologists David L. Roberts and Andrew R. Solow gave a new estimated extinction date of 1693, with a 95% confidence interval of 1688\u20131715. These authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638, the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s, and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave could not be dismissed out of hand.\nThe British ornithologist Alfred Newton suggested in 1868 that the name of the dodo was transferred to the red rail after the former had gone extinct. Cheke also pointed out that some descriptions after 1662 use the names \"Dodo\" and \"Dodaers\" when referring to the red rail, indicating that they had been transferred to it. He therefore pointed to the 1662 description as the last credible observation. A 1668 account by English traveller John Marshall, who used the names \"Dodo\" and \"Red Hen\" interchangeably for the red rail, mentioned that the meat was \"hard\", which echoes the description of the meat in the 1681 account. Even the 1662 account has been questioned by the writer Errol Fuller, as the reaction to distress cries matches what was described for the red rail. Until this explanation was proposed, a description of \"dodos\" from 1681 was thought to be the last account, and that date still has proponents.\nCheke stated in 2014 that then recently accessible Dutch manuscripts indicate that no dodos were seen by settlers in 1664\u20131674. In 2020, Cheke and the British researcher Jolyon C. Parish suggested that all mentions of dodos after the mid-17th century instead referred to red rails, and that the dodo had disappeared due to predation by feral pigs during a hiatus in settlement of Mauritius (1658\u20131664). The dodo's extinction therefore was not realised at the time, since new settlers had not seen real dodos, but as they expected to see flightless birds, they referred to the red rail by that name instead. Since red rails probably had larger clutches than dodos and their eggs could be incubated faster, and their nests were perhaps concealed, they probably bred more efficiently, and were less vulnerable to pigs.\nIt is unlikely the issue will ever be resolved, unless late reports mentioning the name alongside a physical description are rediscovered. The IUCN Red List accepts Cheke's rationale for choosing the 1662 date, taking all subsequent reports to refer to red rails. In any case, the dodo was probably extinct by 1700, about a century after its discovery in 1598. The Dutch left Mauritius in 1710, but by then the dodo and most of the large terrestrial vertebrates there had become extinct.\nEven though the rareness of the dodo was reported already in the 17th century, its extinction was not recognised until the 19th century. This was partly because, for religious reasons, extinction was not believed possible until later proved so by Georges Cuvier, and partly because many scientists doubted that the dodo had ever existed. It seemed altogether too strange a creature, and many believed it a myth. The bird was first used as an example of human-induced extinction in \"Penny Magazine\" in 1833, and has since been referred to as an \"icon\" of extinction.\nPhysical remains.\n17th-century specimens.\nThe only extant remains of dodo specimens taken to Europe in the 17th century are a dried head and foot in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, a foot once housed in the British Museum but now lost, a skull in the University of Copenhagen Zoological Museum, and an upper jaw in the National Museum, Prague. The last two were rediscovered and identified as dodo remains in the mid-19th century. Several stuffed dodos were also mentioned in old museum inventories, but none are known to have survived. Apart from these remains, a dried foot which belonged to Dutch professor Pieter Pauw was mentioned by Carolus Clusius in 1605. Its provenance is unknown, and it is now lost, but it may have been collected during the Van Neck voyage. Purported stuffed dodos seen in museums around the world today have in fact been made from feathers of other birds; many by British taxidermist Rowland Ward's company.\nThe only known soft tissue remains, the Oxford head (specimen OUM 11605) and foot, belonged to the last known stuffed dodo, which was first mentioned as part of the Tradescant collection in 1656 and was moved to the Ashmolean Museum in 1659. It has been suggested that this might be the remains of the bird that Hamon L'Estrange saw in London, the bird sent by Emanuel Altham, or a donation by Thomas Herbert. Since the remains do not show signs of having been mounted, the specimen might instead have been preserved as a study skin. In 2018, it was reported that scans of the Oxford dodo's head showed that its skin and bone contained lead shot, which was used to hunt birds in the 17th century. This indicates that the Oxford dodo was shot either before being transported to Britain, or some time after arriving. The circumstances of its killing are unknown, and the pellets are to be examined to identify where the lead was mined from.\nMany sources state that the Ashmolean Museum burned the stuffed dodo around 1755 because of severe decay, saving only the head and leg. Statute\u00a08 of the museum states \"That as any particular grows old and perishing the keeper may remove it into one of the closets or other repository; and some other to be substituted.\" The deliberate destruction of the specimen is now believed to be a myth; it was removed from exhibition to preserve what remained of it. This remaining soft tissue has since degraded further; the head was dissected by Strickland and Melville, separating the skin from the skull in two-halves. The foot is in a skeletal state, with only scraps of skin and tendons. Very few feathers remain on the head. It is probably a female, as the foot is 11% smaller and more gracile than the London foot, yet appears to be fully grown. The specimen was exhibited at the Oxford museum from at least the 1860s and until 1998, where-after it was mainly kept in storage to prevent damage. Casts of the head can today be found in many museums worldwide.\nThe dried London foot, first mentioned in 1665, and transferred to the British Museum in the 18th century, was displayed next to Savery's \"Edwards's Dodo\" painting until the 1840s, and it too was dissected by Strickland and Melville. It was not posed in a standing posture, which suggests that it was severed from a fresh specimen, not a mounted one. By 1896 it was mentioned as being without its integuments, and only the bones are believed to remain today, though its present whereabouts are unknown.\nThe Copenhagen skull (specimen ZMUC 90-806) is known to have been part of the collection of Bernardus Paludanus in Enkhuizen until 1651, when it was moved to the museum in Gottorf Castle, Schleswig. After the castle was occupied by Danish forces in 1702, the museum collection was assimilated into the Royal Danish collection. The skull was rediscovered by J. T. Reinhardt in 1840. Based on its history, it may be the oldest known surviving remains of a dodo brought to Europe in the 17th century. It is shorter than the Oxford skull, and may have belonged to a female. It was mummified, but the skin has perished.\nThe front part of a skull (specimen NMP P6V-004389) in the National Museum of Prague was found in 1850 among the remains of the B\u00f6hmisches Museum. Other elements supposedly belonging to this specimen have been listed in the literature, but it appears only the partial skull was ever present (a partial right limb in the museum appears to be from a Rodrigues solitaire). It may be what remains of one of the stuffed dodos known to have been at the menagerie of Emperor Rudolph II, possibly the specimen painted by Hoefnagel or Savery there.\nSubfossil specimens.\nUntil 1860, the only known dodo remains were the four incomplete 17th-century specimens. Philip Burnard Ayres found the first subfossil bones in 1860, which were sent to Richard Owen at the British Museum, who did not publish the findings. In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word that he should be informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mah\u00e9bourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to \"The Ibis\", an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. Harry Pasley Higginson, a railway engineer from Yorkshire, reports discovering the Mare aux Songes bones at the same time as Clark and there is some dispute over who found them first. Higginson sent boxes of these bones to Liverpool, Leeds and York museums. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.\nClark's reports about the finds rekindled interest in the bird. Sir Richard Owen and Alfred Newton both wanted to be first to describe the post-cranial anatomy of the dodo, and Owen bought a shipment of dodo bones originally meant for Newton, which led to rivalry between the two. Owen described the bones in \"Memoir on the Dodo\" in October 1866, but erroneously based his reconstruction on the \"Edwards's Dodo\" painting by Savery, making it too squat and obese. In 1869 he received more bones and corrected its stance, making it more upright. Newton moved his focus to the R\u00e9union solitaire instead. The remaining bones not sold to Owen or Newton were auctioned off or donated to museums. In 1889, Th\u00e9odor Sauzier was commissioned to explore the \"historical souvenirs\" of Mauritius and find more dodo remains in the Mare aux Songes. He was successful, and also found remains of other extinct species.\nLouis \u00c9tienne Thirioux, an amateur naturalist at Port Louis, also found many dodo remains around 1900 from several locations. They included the first articulated specimen, which is the first subfossil dodo skeleton found outside the Mare aux Songes, and the only remains of a juvenile specimen, a now lost tarsometatarsus. The former specimen was found in 1904 in a cave near Le Pouce mountain, and is the only known complete skeleton of an individual dodo. Thirioux donated the specimen to the Museum Desjardins (now Natural History Museum, Port Louis). Thrioux's heirs sold a second mounted composite skeleton (composed of at least two skeletons, with a mainly reconstructed skull) to the Durban Museum of Natural Science in South Africa in 1918. Together, these two skeletons represent the most completely known dodo remains, including bone elements previously unrecorded (such as knee-caps and wing bones). Though some contemporary writers noted the importance of Thrioux's specimens, they were not scientifically studied, and were largely forgotten until 2011, when sought out by a group of researchers. The mounted skeletons were laser scanned, from which 3-D models were reconstructed, which became the basis of a 2016 monograph about the osteology of the dodo. In 2006, explorers discovered a complete skeleton of a dodo in a lava cave in Mauritius. This was only the second associated skeleton of an individual specimen ever found, and the only one in recent times.\nIn 2005, after a hundred years of neglect, a part of the Mare aux Songes swamp was excavated by an international team of researchers (International Dodo Research Project). To prevent malaria, the British had covered the swamp with hard core during their rule over Mauritius, which had to be removed. Many remains were found, including bones of at least 17 dodos in various stages of maturity (though no juveniles), and several bones obviously from the skeleton of one individual bird, which have been preserved in their natural position. These findings were made public in December 2005 in the Naturalis museum in Leiden. 63% of the fossils found in the swamp belonged to turtles of the extinct genus \"Cylindraspis\", and 7.1% belonged to dodos, which had been deposited within several centuries, 4,000 years ago. Subsequent excavations suggested that dodos and other animals became mired in the Mare aux Songes while trying to reach water during a long period of severe drought about 4,200 years ago. Furthermore, cyanobacteria thrived in the conditions created by the excrements of animals gathered around the swamp, which died of intoxication, dehydration, trampling, and miring. Though many small skeletal elements were found during the recent excavations of the swamp, few were found during the 19th century, probably owing to the employment of less refined methods when collecting.\nWorldwide, 26 museums have significant holdings of dodo material, almost all found in the Mare aux Songes. The Natural History Museum, American Museum of Natural History, Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, the Senckenberg Museum, and others have almost complete skeletons, assembled from the dissociated subfossil remains of several individuals. In 2011, a wooden box containing dodo bones from the Edwardian era was rediscovered at the Grant Museum at University College London during preparations for a move. They had been stored with crocodile bones until then.\nThe white dodo.\nThe supposed \"white dodo\" (or \"solitaire\") of R\u00e9union is now considered an erroneous conjecture based on contemporary reports of the R\u00e9union ibis and 17th-century paintings of white, dodo-like birds by Pieter Withoos and Pieter Holsteyn that surfaced in the 19th century. The confusion began when Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe, who visited R\u00e9union around 1619, mentioned fat, flightless birds that he referred to as \"Dod-eersen\" in his journal, though without mentioning their colouration. When the journal was published in 1646, it was accompanied by an engraving of a dodo from Savery's \"Crocker Art Gallery sketch\". A white, stocky, and flightless bird was first mentioned as part of the R\u00e9union fauna by Chief Officer J. Tatton in 1625. Sporadic mentions were subsequently made by Sieur Dubois and other contemporary writers.\nBaron Edmond de S\u00e9lys Longchamps coined the name \"Raphus solitarius\" for these birds in 1848, as he believed the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Oudemans suggested that the discrepancy between the paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.\nThe Pieter Withoos painting, which was discovered first, appears to be based on an earlier painting by Pieter Holsteyn, three versions of which are known to have existed. According to Hume, Cheke, and Valledor de Lozoya, it appears that all depictions of white dodos were based on Roelant Savery's painting \"Landscape with Orpheus and the animals\", or on copies of it. The painting has generally been dated to 1611, though a post-1614, or even post-1626, date has also been proposed. The painting shows a whitish specimen and was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in Prague; a \"walghvogel\" described as having a \"dirty off-white colouring\" was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607\u20131611). Savery's several later images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen another specimen. Cheke and Hume believe the painted specimen was white, owing to albinism. Valledor de Lozoya has instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, or simply artistic license.\nIn 1987, scientists described fossils of a recently extinct species of ibis from R\u00e9union with a relatively short beak, \"Borbonibis latipes\", before a connection to the solitaire reports had been made. Cheke suggested to one of the authors, Francois Moutou, that the fossils may have been of the R\u00e9union solitaire, and this suggestion was published in 1995. The ibis was reassigned to the genus \"Threskiornis\", now combined with the specific epithet \"\" from the binomial \"R. solitarius\". Birds of this genus are also white and black with slender beaks, fitting the old descriptions of the R\u00e9union solitaire. No fossil remains of dodo-like birds have ever been found on the island.\nCultural significance.\nThe dodo's significance as one of the best-known extinct animals and its singular appearance led to its use in literature and popular culture as a symbol of an outdated concept or object, as in the expression \"dead as a dodo,\" which has come to mean unquestionably dead or obsolete. Similarly, the phrase \"to go the way of the dodo\" means to become extinct or obsolete, to fall out of common usage or practice, or to become a thing of the past. \"Dodo\" is also a slang term for a stupid, dull-witted person, as it was said to be stupid and easily caught.\nThe dodo appears frequently in works of popular fiction, and even before its extinction, it was featured in European literature, as a symbol for exotic lands, and of gluttony, due to its apparent fatness. In 1865, the same year that George Clark started to publish reports about excavated dodo fossils, the newly vindicated bird was featured as a character in Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". It is thought that he included the dodo because he identified with it and had adopted the name as a nickname for himself because of his stammer, which made him accidentally introduce himself as \"Do-do-dodgson\", his legal surname. Carroll and the girl who served as inspiration for Alice, Alice Liddell, had enjoyed visiting the Oxford museum to see the dodo remains there. The book's popularity made the dodo a well-known icon of extinction. Popular depictions of the dodo often became more exaggerated and cartoonish following its \"Alice in Wonderland\" fame, which was in line with the inaccurate belief that it was clumsy, tragic, and destined for extinction.\nThe dodo is used as a mascot for many kinds of products, especially in Mauritius. It appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Mauritius, on Mauritius coins, is used as a watermark on all Mauritian rupee banknotes, and features as the background of the Mauritian immigration form. A smiling dodo is the symbol of the Brasseries de Bourbon, a popular brewer on R\u00e9union, whose emblem displays the white species once thought to have lived there. \nThe dodo is used to promote the protection of endangered species by environmental organisations, such as the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Durrell Wildlife Park. The Center for Biological Diversity gives an annual 'Rubber Dodo Award', to \"those who have done the most to destroy wild places, species and biological diversity\". In 2011, the nephiline spider \"Nephilengys dodo\", which inhabits the same woods as the dodo once did, was named after the bird to raise awareness of the urgent need for protection of the Mauritius biota. Two species of ant from Mauritius have been named after the dodo: \"Pseudolasius dodo\" in 1946 and \"Pheidole dodo\" in 2013. A species of isopod from a coral reef off R\u00e9union was named \"Hansenium dodo\" in 1991.\nThe name dodo has been used by scientists naming genetic elements, honouring the dodo's flightless nature. A fruitfly gene within a region of a chromosome required for flying ability was named \"dodo\". In addition, a defective transposable element family from \"Phytophthora infestans\" was named \"DodoPi\" as it contained mutations that eliminated the element's ability to jump to new locations in a chromosome.\nIn 2009, a previously unpublished 17th-century Dutch illustration of a dodo went for sale at Christie's and was expected to sell for \u00a36,000. It is unknown whether the illustration was based on a specimen or on a previous image, and the artist is unidentified. It sold for \u00a344,450. Parrish suggested it depicts a stuffed specimen, as the legs look dried.\nThe poet Hilaire Belloc included the following poem about the dodo in his \"Bad Child's Book of Beasts\" from 1896:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nThe Dodo used to walk around,\nAnd take the sun and air.\nThe sun yet warms his native ground \u2013\nThe Dodo is not there!\n&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nThe voice which used to squawk and squeak\nIs now for ever dumb \u2013\nYet may you see his bones and beak\nAll in the Mu-se-um.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is endemic to Mauritius.\nDescription.\nThe fruit of \"Sideroxylon grandiflorum\" is analogous to a peach. Each is termed a drupe because each has a hard endocarp, or pit, surrounding the seed. The plant itself superficially resembles the unrelated \"Plumeria\", but the dodo tree's flowers and fruit are cauliflorous.\nEcology.\nIn 1973, it was argued that the species was becoming extinct. There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old; the true age could not be determined because tambalacoque has no growth rings. Stanley Temple hypothesized that the dodo, which became extinct in the 17th century, ate tambalacoque fruits, and that only after passing through the digestive tract of the dodo could the seeds germinate. Temple force-fed seventeen tambalacoque fruits to wild turkeys in 1977. Seven of the fruits were crushed by the bird's gizzard, while the remaining ten were either regurgitated or passed with the bird's feces. Temple planted the remaining ten fruits, three of which germinated. Temple did not try to germinate any seeds from control fruits that had not been fed to turkeys so the effect on germination of feeding fruits to turkeys was unknown. Studies on tambalacoque seed germination by Hill (1941) and King (1946) found that the seeds germinated without abrading.\nTemple's hypothesis that the tree required the dodo was contested. Others have suggested that the decline of the tree was exaggerated or that other extinct animals, such as giant tortoises, fruit bats, or the broad-billed parrot, may also have been distributing the seeds. The decline of the tree may be due to introduction of domestic pigs and crab-eating macaques, and competition from introduced plants. Alternatively, the difference in reported tree numbers may arise from the fact that young trees are not distinct in appearance and may easily be confused with similar species. Catling (2001) in a summary cites Owadally and Temple (1979) and Witmer (1991), while Hershey (2004) reviewed the flaws in Temple's dodo-tambalacoque hypothesis.\nIn 2004, the Botanical Society of America's Plant Science Bulletin disputed Temple's research as flawed. The Bulletin published evidence as to why the dodo's extinction did not directly cause the increasing disappearance of young trees, including suggestions that the \"Cylindraspis\" giant tortoises would have been more likely to disperse the seeds than dodos, casting doubt on Temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship. More recently, the tree\u2019s decline within native forests was shown to be in fact driven by invasive introduced species: The tree\u2019s first germination in its native habitat were observed in 2001 (26 seedlings) exclusively where invasive alien weeds had been cleared and further observations and controlled experiments showed that invasive introduced macaques (Macaca fascicularis Rafles 1821) pick most of the tree\u2019s fruits when still unripe, killing the seeds, and reducing natural germination rates by up to about 40 times.\nUses.\nThe dodo tree is highly valued for its wood in Mauritius, which has led some foresters to scrape the pits by hand to make them sprout and grow.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "8429", "revid": "48643156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8429", "title": "Density", "text": "Mass per unit volume\nDensity (volumetric mass density or specific mass) is the ratio of a substance's mass to its volume. The symbol most often used for density is \"\u03c1\" (the lower case Greek letter rho), although the Latin letter \"D\" (or \"d\") can also be used: \nformula_1\nwhere \"\u03c1\" is the density, \"m\" is the mass, and \"V\" is the volume. In some cases (for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry), density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume, although this is scientifically inaccurate\u00a0\u2013 this quantity is more specifically called specific weight.\nFor a pure substance, the density is equal to its mass concentration.\nDifferent materials usually have different densities, and density may be relevant to buoyancy, purity and packaging. Osmium is the densest known element at standard conditions for temperature and pressure.\nTo simplify comparisons of density across different systems of units, it is sometimes replaced by the dimensionless quantity \"relative density\" or \"specific gravity\", i.e. the ratio of the density of the material to that of a standard material, usually water. Thus a relative density less than one relative to water means that the substance floats in water.\nThe density of a material varies with temperature and pressure. This variation is typically small for solids and liquids but much greater for gases. Increasing the pressure on an object decreases the volume of the object and thus increases its density. Increasing the temperature of a substance while maintaining a constant pressure decreases its density by increasing its volume (with a few exceptions). In most fluids, heating the bottom of the fluid results in convection due to the decrease in the density of the heated fluid, which causes it to rise relative to denser unheated material.\nThe reciprocal of the density of a substance is occasionally called its specific volume, a term sometimes used in thermodynamics. Density is an intensive property in that increasing the amount of a substance does not increase its density; rather it increases its mass.\nOther conceptually comparable quantities or ratios include specific density, relative density (specific gravity), and specific weight.\nThe concept of mass density is generalized in the International System of Quantities to volumic quantities, the quotient of any physical quantity and volume, such as charge density or volumic electric charge.\nHistory.\nDensity, floating, and sinking.\nThe understanding that different materials have different densities, and of a relationship between density, floating, and sinking must date to prehistoric times. Much later it was put in writing. Aristotle, for example, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is so great a difference in density between salt and fresh water that vessels laden with cargoes of the same weight almost sink in rivers, but ride quite easily at sea and are quite seaworthy. And an ignorance of this has sometimes cost people dear who load their ships in rivers. The following is a proof that the density of a fluid is greater when a substance is mixed with it. If you make water very salt by mixing salt in with it, eggs will float on it. ... If there were any truth in the stories they tell about the lake in Palestine it would further bear out what I say. For they say if you bind a man or beast and throw him into it he floats and does not sink beneath the surface.\u2014\u200a\nVolume vs. density; volume of an irregular shape.\nIn a well-known but probably apocryphal tale, Archimedes was given the task of determining whether King Hiero's goldsmith was embezzling gold during the manufacture of a golden wreath dedicated to the gods and replacing it with another, cheaper alloy. Archimedes knew that the irregularly shaped wreath could be crushed into a cube whose volume could be calculated easily and compared with the mass; but the king did not approve of this. Baffled, Archimedes is said to have taken an immersion bath and observed from the rise of the water upon entering that he could calculate the volume of the gold wreath through the displacement of the water. Upon this discovery, he leapt from his bath and ran naked through the streets shouting, \"Eureka! Eureka!\" (). As a result, the term \"eureka\" entered common parlance and is used today to indicate a moment of enlightenment.\nThe story first appeared in written form in Vitruvius' \"books of architecture\", two centuries after it supposedly took place. Some scholars have doubted the accuracy of this tale, saying among other things that the method would have required precise measurements that would have been difficult to make at the time.\nNevertheless, in 1586, Galileo Galilei, in one of his first experiments, made a possible reconstruction of how the experiment could have been performed with ancient Greek resources.\nUnits.\nFrom the equation for density (\"\u03c1\" = \"m\"/\"V\"), mass density has any unit that is \"mass divided by volume\". As there are many units of mass and volume covering many different magnitudes there are a large number of units for mass density in use. The SI unit of kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m3) and the cgs unit of gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm3) are probably the most commonly used units for density. In industry, other larger or smaller units of mass and or volume are often more practical and US customary units may be used. See below for a list of some of the most common units of density.\nDensities using the following metric units all have exactly the same numerical value, one-thousandth of the value in kg/m3. Liquid water has a density of about 1\u00a0g/cm3 or 1000\u00a0kg/m3, making any of these SI units numerically convenient to use as most solids and liquids have densities between 0.1 and 20\u00a0g/cm3.\nThe litre and tonne (metric ton) are not part of the SI, but are accepted for use with it, leading to the following equivalent metric units:\nIn US customary units density can be stated in:\nImperial units differing from the above (as the Imperial gallon and bushel differ from the US units) in practice are rarely used, though found in older documents. The Imperial gallon was based on the concept that an Imperial fluid ounce of water would have a mass of one Avoirdupois ounce, and indeed 1\u00a0g/cm3 \u2248 1.00224129 ounces per Imperial fluid ounce = 10.0224129 pounds per Imperial gallon. The density of precious metals could conceivably be based on Troy ounces and pounds, a possible cause of confusion.\nThe density of a crystalline material and be calculated from its formula mass (in daltons) and the volume of its unit cell, the density can be calculated. One dalton per cubic \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m is equal to a density of , based on the 2022 CODATA recommended value of the dalton.\nMeasurement.\nA number of techniques as well as standards exist for the measurement of density of materials. Such techniques include the use of a hydrometer (a buoyancy method for liquids), Hydrostatic balance (a buoyancy method for liquids and solids), immersed body method (a buoyancy method for liquids), pycnometer (liquids and solids), air comparison pycnometer (solids), oscillating densitometer (liquids), as well as pour and tap (solids). However, each individual method or technique measures different types of density (e.g. bulk density, skeletal density, etc.), and therefore it is necessary to have an understanding of the type of density being measured as well as the type of material in question.\nHomogeneous materials.\nThe density at all points of a homogeneous object equals its total mass divided by its total volume. The mass is normally measured with a scale or balance; the volume may be measured directly (from the geometry of the object) or by the displacement of a fluid. To determine the density of a liquid or a gas, a hydrometer, a dasymeter or a Coriolis flow meter may be used, respectively. Similarly, hydrostatic weighing uses the displacement of water due to a submerged object to determine the density of the object.\nHeterogeneous materials.\nIf the body is not homogeneous, then its density varies between different regions of the object. In that case the density around any given location is determined by calculating the density of a small volume around that location. In the limit of an infinitesimal volume the density of an inhomogeneous object at a point becomes: formula_2, where formula_3 is an elementary volume at position formula_4. The mass of the body then can be expressed as\nformula_5\nNon-compact materials.\nIn practice, bulk materials such as sugar, sand, or snow contain voids. Many materials exist in nature as flakes, pellets, or granules.\nVoids are regions which contain something other than the considered material. Commonly the void is air, but it could also be vacuum, liquid, solid, or a different gas or gaseous mixture.\nThe \"bulk volume\" of a material\u2014inclusive of the void space fraction\u2014is often obtained by a simple measurement (e.g. with a calibrated measuring cup) or geometrically from known dimensions.\nMass divided by bulk volume determines \"bulk density\". This is not the same thing as the material volumetric mass density. To determine the material volumetric mass density, one must first discount the volume of the void fraction. Sometimes this can be determined by geometrical reasoning. For the close-packing of equal spheres the non-void fraction can be at most about 74%. It can also be determined empirically. Some bulk materials, however, such as sand, have a \"variable\" void fraction which depends on how the material is agitated or poured. It might be loose or compact, with more or less air space depending on handling.\nIn practice, the void fraction is not necessarily air, or even gaseous. In the case of sand, it could be water, which can be advantageous for measurement as the void fraction for sand saturated in water\u2014once any air bubbles are thoroughly driven out\u2014is potentially more consistent than dry sand measured with an air void.\nIn the case of non-compact materials, one must also take care in determining the mass of the material sample. If the material is under pressure (commonly ambient air pressure at the earth's surface) the determination of mass from a measured sample weight might need to account for buoyancy effects due to the density of the void constituent, depending on how the measurement was conducted. In the case of dry sand, sand is so much denser than air that the buoyancy effect is commonly neglected (less than one part in one thousand).\nMass change upon displacing one void material with another while maintaining constant volume can be used to estimate the void fraction, if the difference in density of the two voids materials is reliably known.\nChanges of density.\nIn general, density can be changed by changing either the pressure or the temperature. Increasing the pressure always increases the density of a material. Increasing the temperature generally decreases the density, but there are notable exceptions to this generalization. For example, the density of water increases between its melting point at 0\u00a0\u00b0C and 4\u00a0\u00b0C; similar behavior is observed in silicon at low temperatures.\nThe effect of pressure and temperature on the densities of liquids and solids is small. The compressibility for a typical liquid or solid is 10\u22126\u00a0bar\u22121 (1\u00a0bar = 0.1\u00a0MPa) and a typical thermal expansivity is 10\u22125\u00a0K\u22121. This roughly translates into needing around ten thousand times atmospheric pressure to reduce the volume of a substance by one percent. (Although the pressures needed may be around a thousand times smaller for sandy soil and some clays.) A one percent expansion of volume typically requires a temperature increase on the order of thousands of degrees Celsius.\nIn contrast, the density of gases is strongly affected by pressure. The density of an ideal gas is\nformula_6\nwhere \"M\" is the molar mass, \"P\" is the pressure, \"R\" is the universal gas constant, and \"T\" is the absolute temperature. This means that the density of an ideal gas can be doubled by doubling the pressure, or by halving the absolute temperature.\nIn the case of volumic thermal expansion at constant pressure and small intervals of temperature the temperature dependence of density is\nformula_7\nwhere formula_8 is the density at a reference temperature, formula_9 is the thermal expansion coefficient of the material at temperatures close to formula_10.\nDensity of solutions.\nThe density of a solution is the sum of mass (massic) concentrations of the components of that solution.\nMass (massic) concentration of each given component formula_11 in a solution sums to density of the solution,\nformula_12\nExpressed as a function of the densities of pure components of the mixture and their volume participation, it allows the determination of excess molar volumes:\nformula_13\nprovided that there is no interaction between the components.\nKnowing the relation between excess volumes and activity coefficients of the components, one can determine the activity coefficients:\nformula_14\nList of densities.\nVarious materials.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOthers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nWater.\nNotes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneralization: volumic quantities.\nThe qualifier volumic is recommended in the International System of Quantities (ISO 80000-1) to denote the quotient of any physical quantity by volume. \nThe expressions \"per unit volume\" or \"volume ... density\" (or simply \"density\") are also often used, with resulting units involving reciprocal cubic metre (m\u22123), for example:\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He has written numerous books of humor and parody, as well as comic novels and children's novels. Barry's honors include the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary (1988) and the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism (2005).\nBarry has defined a sense of humor as \"a measurement of the extent to which we realize that we are trapped in a world almost totally devoid of reason. Laughter is how we express the anxiety we feel at this knowledge\".\nEarly life and education.\nBarry was born in Armonk, New York, where his father, David W. Barry, was a Presbyterian minister. He was educated at Wampus Elementary School, Harold C. Crittenden Junior High School (both in Armonk), and Pleasantville High School, where he was elected \"Class Clown\" in 1965. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in English from Haverford College in 1969.\nAs an alumnus of a Quaker-affiliated college, he avoided military service during the Vietnam War by registering as a religious conscientious objector. Barry decided \"early on\" that he was an atheist. He said, \"The problem with writing about religion is that you run the risk of offending sincerely religious people, and then they come after you with machetes.\"\nWriting career.\nBarry began his journalism career in 1971, working as a general-assignment reporter for the \"Daily Local News\" in West Chester, Pennsylvania. He covered local government and civic events and was promoted to city editor after about two years. He also started writing a weekly humor column for the newspaper and began to develop his unique style. He remained at the newspaper through 1974. He then worked briefly as a copy editor at the Philadelphia bureau of Associated Press before joining Burger Associates, a consulting firm.\nAt Burger, he taught effective writing to businesspeople. In his own words, he \"spent nearly eight years trying to get various businesspersons to...stop writing things like 'Enclosed please find the enclosed enclosures,' but...eventually realized that it was hopeless.\"\nIn 1981, he wrote a humorous guest column in \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" about watching the birth of his son, which attracted the attention of Gene Weingarten, then an editor of the \"Miami Herald\" Sunday magazine, \"Tropic\". Weingarten hired Barry as a humor columnist in 1983. Barry's column was syndicated nationally. Barry won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1988 for \"his consistently effective use of humor as a device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns\".\nBarry's first novel, \"Big Trouble\", was published in 1999. The book was \nadapted into a motion picture directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and starring Tim Allen, Rene Russo, and Patrick Warburton, with a cameo by Barry (deleted in post-production). The movie was originally due for release in September 2001, but was postponed following the September 11, 2001 attacks because the story involved terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon onto an airplane. The film was released in April 2002.\nIn response to a column in which Barry mocked the cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, for calling themselves the \"Grand Cities\", Grand Forks named a sewage pumping station after Barry in January 2002. Barry traveled to Grand Forks for the dedication ceremony.\nArticles written by Barry have appeared in publications such as \"Boating\", \"Home Office Computing\", and \"Reader's Digest\", in addition to the \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" inspirational book series. Two of his articles have been included in \"The Best American Sports Writing\" series. One of his columns was used as the introduction to the book \"Pirattitude!: So You Wanna Be a Pirate? Here's How!\" (), a follow-up to Barry's role in publicizing International Talk Like a Pirate Day. His books have frequently appeared on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\nOn October 31, 2004, Barry announced that he would be taking an indefinite leave of absence of at least a year from his weekly column to spend more time with his family. In December 2005, Barry said in an interview with \"Editor &amp; Publisher\" that he would not resume his weekly column, although he would continue such features as his yearly gift guide, his year-in-review feature, and his blog, as well as an occasional article or column.\nIn 2005, Barry won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.\n\"Dave's World\" television series.\nFrom 1993 to 1997, CBS broadcast the sitcom \"Dave's World\" based on the books \"Dave Barry Turns 40\" and \"Dave Barry's Greatest Hits\". The show starred Harry Anderson as Barry and DeLane Matthews as his wife Beth. In an early episode, Barry appeared in a cameo role. After four seasons, the program was canceled shortly after being moved from its \"coveted\" Monday night slot to the \"Friday night death slot\", so named because of its association with low viewership.\nMusic.\nDuring college, Barry was in a band called the Federal Duck (the band issued a self-titled album on Musicor Records in 1968, but by that time Barry was no longer in the group). While at the \"Miami Herald\", he and several of his colleagues created a band called the Urban Professionals, with Barry on lead guitar and vocals. They performed an original song called \"The Tupperware Song\" at the Tupperware headquarters in Orlando, Florida.\nBeginning in 1992, Barry played lead guitar in the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock band made up of published authors. \"Remainder\" is a publishing term for a book that does not sell. The band was founded by Barry's sister-in-law, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, for an American Booksellers Association convention, and has included Stephen King, Amy Tan, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount Jr., Barbara Kingsolver, Matt Groening, and Barry's brother Sam, among others. The band's members \"are not musically skilled, but they are extremely loud\", according to Barry. Several high-profile musicians, including Al Kooper, Warren Zevon, and Roger McGuinn have performed with the band, and Bruce Springsteen sat in at least once. The band's road tour resulted in the book, \"Mid-Life Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America with Three Chords and an Attitude\". The Rock Bottom Remainders disbanded in 2012 following Goldmark's death from breast cancer. They have reunited several times, performing at the Tucson Festival of Books in 2016 and 2018.\nOther activities.\nBeginning in 1984, Barry and \"Tropic\" editors Gene Weingarten and Tom Shroder have organized the Tropic Hunt (now the Herald Hunt), an annual puzzlehunt in Miami. A Washington, D.C., spinoff, the Post Hunt, began in 2008.\nBarry has run several mock campaigns for president of the United States, running on a libertarian platform. He has also written for the Libertarian Party's national newsletter.\nThe screen adaptation of Barry's book \"Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys\" was released in 2005; it is available on DVD.\nPersonal life.\nBarry married Lois Ann Shelnutt in 1969. He married Beth Lenox in 1976. Barry and Lenox worked together at the \"Daily Local News\", where they began their journalism careers on the same day in September 1971; they had one child, Robert, born 1980. Barry and Lenox divorced in 1993. In 1996, Barry married \"Miami Herald\" sportswriter Michelle Kaufman; they had a daughter, Sophie, in 2000.\nBarry's father and his youngest brother suffered from alcoholism, and his father died in 1984; his sister Mary Katherine was institutionalized for schizophrenia; and his mother died by suicide in 1987.\nBarry has had dogs named Goldie, Earnest, Zippy, and Lucy.

In 1983, he joined \"Cheers\" as a staff writer. In 1985, Angell joined forces with Peter Casey and David Lee as \"Cheers\" supervising producers/writers. The trio received 37 Emmy Award nominations and won 24 Emmy Awards, including the above-mentioned for \"Frasier\". They also won an Outstanding Comedy Series Emmy for \"Cheers\", in 1989, which Angell, Casey, Lee and the series' other producers shared, and an Outstanding Writing/Comedy Emmy for \"Cheers\", which Angell received in 1984. After working together as producers on \"Cheers\", Angell, Casey and Lee formed Grub Street Productions. In 1990, they created and executive-produced the comedy series \"Wings\".\nDeath.\nAngell and his wife Lynn died in the 2001 September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center in Manhattan. They were among the passengers of American Airlines Flight 11, who were all killed when the plane struck the North Tower of the complex.\nLegacy.\nThe American Screenwriters Association awards the annual David Angell Humanitarian Award to any individual in the entertainment industry who contributes to global well-being through donations of time, expertise or other support to improve the human condition.\nIn 2004, The Angell Foundation of Los Angeles, California, awarded Providence College a gift of $2 million for the Smith Center for the Arts.\nThe two-part episode of \"Frasier\" to air after the attacks, \"Don Juan in Hell\" airing on September 25, 2001, ended with the memorial tribute, \"In loving memory of our friends Lynn and David Angell\". In \"Goodnight, Seattle\", the series finale that aired May 13, 2004, Niles Crane and Daphne Moon's son was born, named David in tribute.\nAt the National September 11 Memorial, Angell and his wife are memorialized at the North Pool, on Panel N-1, along with other passengers from Flight 11.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He substantially extended and revised the work of Carl Meinhof, his teacher, although he rejected some of Meinhof's theories only implicitly. Westermann is seen as one of the founders of modern African linguistics.\nHe carried out extensive linguistic and anthropological research in the area ranging from Senegal eastwards to the Upper Nile. His linguistic publications cover a wide range of African languages, including the Gbe languages, Nuer, Kpelle, Shilluk, Hausa, and Guang.\nWestermann's comparative work, begun in 1911, initially brought together much of today's Niger\u2013Congo and Nilo-Saharan language phyla under the name Sudanic languages. His most important later publication \"Die westlichen Sudansprachen\" 1927a divided these into East and West Sudanic languages and laid the basis for what would become Niger\u2013Congo. In this book and a series of associated articles between 1925 and 1928, Westermann both identified a large number of roots that form the basis of our understanding of Niger\u2013Congo and set out the evidence for the coherence of many of the families that constitute it. Much of the classification of African languages associated with Joseph Greenberg actually derives from the work of Westermann.\nIn 1927 Westermann published a \"Practical Orthography of African Languages\", which became later known as the \"Westermann script\". Subsequently, he published the influential and oft-reprinted \"Practical Phonetics for Students of African Languages\" in collaboration with Ida C. Ward (1933).\nHe was born in Baden near Bremen and also died there."}

{"id": "8439", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8439", "title": "Diacritic", "text": "Modifier mark added to a letter\nA diacritic (also diacritical mark, diacritical point, diacritical sign, or accent) is a glyph added to a letter or to a basic glyph. The term derives from the Ancient Greek (, \"distinguishing\"), from (, \"to distinguish\"). The word \"diacritic\" is a noun, though it is sometimes used in an attributive sense, whereas \"diacritical\" is only an adjective. Some diacritics, such as the acute \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, grave \u27e8\u00f2\u27e9, and circumflex \u27e8\u00f4\u27e9 (all shown above an 'o'), are often called \"accents\". Diacritics may appear above or below a letter or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters. \nThe main use of diacritics in Latin script is to change the sound-values of the letters to which they are added. Historically, English has used the diaeresis diacritic to indicate the correct pronunciation of ambiguous words, such as \"co\u00f6perate\", without which the &lt;oo&gt; letter sequence could be misinterpreted to be pronounced . Other examples are the acute and grave accents, which can indicate that a vowel is to be pronounced differently than is normal in that position, for example not reduced to /\u0259/ or silent as in the case of the two uses of the letter e in the noun \"r\u00e9sum\u00e9\" (as opposed to the verb \"resume\") and the help sometimes provided in the pronunciation of some words such as \"dogg\u00e8d\", \"learn\u00e8d\", \"bless\u00e8d\", and especially words pronounced differently than normal in poetry (for example \"mov\u00e8d\", \"breath\u00e8d\").\nMost other words with diacritics in English are borrowings from languages such as French to better preserve the spelling, such as the diaeresis on and , the acute from , the circumflex in the word , and the cedille in . All these diacritics, however, are frequently omitted in writing, and English is the only major modern European language that does not have diacritics in common usage.\nIn Latin-script alphabets in other languages diacritics may distinguish between homonyms, such as the French (\"there\") versus (\"the\"), which are both pronounced . In Gaelic type, a dot over a consonant indicates lenition of the consonant in question. In other writing systems, diacritics may perform other functions. Vowel pointing systems, namely the Arabic harakat and the Hebrew niqqud systems, indicate vowels that are not conveyed by the basic alphabet. The Indic virama (\u2009\u094d\u2009etc.) and the Arabic suk\u016bn (\u2009\u2009) mark the absence of vowels. Cantillation marks indicate prosody. Other uses include the Early Cyrillic titlo stroke (\u2009\u25cc\u0483\u2009) and the Hebrew gershayim (\u2009\u2009), which, respectively, mark abbreviations or acronyms, and Greek diacritical marks, which showed that letters of the alphabet were being used as numerals. In Vietnamese and the Hanyu Pinyin official romanization system for Mandarin in China, diacritics are used to mark the tones of the syllables in which the marked vowels occur.\nIn orthography and collation, a letter modified by a diacritic may be treated either as a new, distinct letter or as a letter\u2013diacritic combination. This varies from language to language and may vary from case to case within a language.\nIn some cases, letters are used as \"in-line diacritics\", with the same function as ancillary glyphs, in that they modify the sound of the letter preceding them, as in the case of the \"h\" in the English pronunciation of \"sh\" and \"th\". Such letter combinations are sometimes even collated as a single distinct letter. For example, the spelling sch was traditionally often treated as a separate letter in German. Words with that spelling were listed after all other words spelled with s in card catalogs in the Vienna public libraries, for example (before digitization).\nTypes.\nAmong the types of diacritic used in alphabets based on the Latin script are:\nThe tilde, dot, comma, titlo, apostrophe, bar, and colon are sometimes diacritical marks, but also have other uses.\nNot all diacritics occur adjacent to the letter they modify. In the Wali language of Ghana, for example, an apostrophe indicates a change of vowel quality, but occurs at the beginning of the word, as in the dialects \"\u2019Bulengee\" and \"\u2019Dolimi\". Because of vowel harmony, all vowels in a word are affected, so the scope of the diacritic is the entire word. In abugida scripts, like those used to write Hindi and Thai, diacritics indicate vowels, and may occur above, below, before, after, or around the consonant letter they modify.\nThe tittle (dot) on the letter \u27e8i\u27e9 or the letter \u27e8j\u27e9, of the Latin alphabet originated as a diacritic to clearly distinguish \u27e8i\u27e9 from the minims (downstrokes) of adjacent letters. It first appeared in the 11th century in the sequence \"ii\" (as in ), then spread to \"i\" adjacent to \"m, n, u\", and finally to all lowercase \"i\"s. The \u27e8j\u27e9, originally a variant of \"i\", inherited the tittle. The shape of the diacritic developed from initially resembling today's acute accent to a long flourish by the 15th century. With the advent of Roman type it was reduced to the round dot we have today.\nSeveral languages of eastern Europe use diacritics on both consonants and vowels, whereas in western Europe digraphs are more often used to change consonant sounds. Most languages in Europe use diacritics on vowels, aside from English where there are typically none (with some exceptions).\nDiacritics specific to non-Latin alphabets.\nGreek.\nThese diacritics are used in addition to the acute, grave, and circumflex accents and the diaeresis:\nKorean.\nThe diacritics \u302e and \u302f\u00a0, known as Bangjeom (), were used to mark pitch accents in Hangul for Middle Korean. They were written to the left of a syllable in vertical writing and above a syllable in horizontal writing.\nSyriac.\nIn addition to the above vowel marks, transliteration of Syriac sometimes includes \"\u0259\", \"e\u030a\" or superscript \"e\" (or often nothing at all) to represent an original Aramaic schwa that became lost later on at some point in the development of Syriac. Some transliteration schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons.\nNon-alphabetic scripts.\nSome non-alphabetic scripts also employ symbols that function essentially as diacritics.\nAlphabetization or collation.\nDifferent languages use different rules to put diacritic characters in alphabetical order. For example, French and Portuguese treat letters with diacritical marks the same as the underlying letter for purposes of ordering and dictionaries. The Scandinavian languages and the Finnish language, by contrast, treat the characters with diacritics \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9, and \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 as distinct letters of the alphabet, and sort them after \u27e8z\u27e9. Usually \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 (a-umlaut) and \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 (o-umlaut) [used in Swedish and Finnish] are sorted as equivalent to \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 (ash) and \u27e8\u00f8\u27e9 (o-slash) [used in Danish and Norwegian]. Also, \"aa\", when used as an alternative spelling to \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9, is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9 is frequently sorted as \u27e8y\u27e9.\nLanguages that treat accented letters as variants of the underlying letter usually alphabetize words with such symbols immediately after similar unmarked words. For instance, in German where two words differ only by an umlaut, the word without it is sorted first in German dictionaries (e.g. \"schon\" and then \"sch\u00f6n\", or \"fallen\" and then \"f\u00e4llen\"). However, when names are concerned (e.g. in phone books or in author catalogues in libraries), umlauts are often treated as combinations of the vowel with a suffixed \u27e8e\u27e9; Austrian phone books now treat characters with umlauts as separate letters (immediately following the underlying vowel).\nIn Spanish, the grapheme \u27e8\u00f1\u27e9 is considered a distinct letter, different from \u27e8n\u27e9 and collated between \u27e8n\u27e9 and \u27e8o\u27e9, as it denotes a different sound from that of a plain \u27e8n\u27e9. But the accented vowels \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9 are not separated from the unaccented vowels \u27e8a\u27e9, \u27e8e\u27e9, \u27e8i\u27e9, \u27e8o\u27e9, \u27e8u\u27e9, as the acute accent in Spanish only modifies stress within the word or denotes a distinction between homonyms, and does not modify the sound of a letter.\nFor a comprehensive list of the collating orders in various languages, see Collating sequence.\nGeneration with computers.\nModern computer technology was developed mostly in countries that speak Western European languages (particularly English), and many early binary encodings were developed with a bias favoring English\u2014a language written without diacritical marks. With computer memory and computer storage at premium, early character sets were limited to the Latin alphabet, the ten digits and a few punctuation marks and conventional symbols. The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), first published in 1963, encoded just 95 printable characters. It included just four free-standing diacritics\u2014acute, grave, circumflex and tilde\u2014which were to be used by backspacing and overprinting the base letter. The ISO/IEC 646 standard (1967) defined national variations that replace some American graphemes with precomposed characters (such as \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00eb\u27e9), according to language\u2014but remained limited to 95 printable characters.\nUnicode was conceived to solve this problem by assigning every known character its own code; if this code is known, most modern computer systems provide a method to input it. For historical reasons, almost all the letter-with-accent combinations used in European languages were given unique code points and these are called precomposed characters. For other languages, it is usually necessary to use a combining character diacritic together with the desired base letter. Unfortunately, even as of 2024, many applications and web browsers remain unable to operate the combining diacritic concept properly.\nDepending on the keyboard layout and keyboard mapping, it is more or less easy to enter letters with diacritics on computers and typewriters. Keyboards used in countries where letters with diacritics are the norm, have keys engraved with the relevant symbols. In other cases, such as when the US international or UK extended mappings are used, the accented letter is created by first pressing the key with the diacritic mark, followed by the letter to place it on. This method is known as the dead key technique, as it produces no output of its own but modifies the output of the key pressed after it.\nLanguages with letters containing diacritics.\nThe following languages have letters with diacritics that are orthographically distinct from those without diacritics.\n* Latvian has the following letters: \u27e8\u0101\u27e9, \u27e8\u0113\u27e9, \u27e8\u012b\u27e9, \u27e8\u016b\u27e9, \u27e8\u010d\u27e9, \u27e8\u0123\u27e9, \u27e8\u0137\u27e9, \u27e8\u013c\u27e9, \u27e8\u0146\u27e9, \u27e8\u0161\u27e9, \u27e8\u017e\u27e9\n* Lithuanian. In general usage, where letters appear with the caron (\u27e8\u010d\u27e9, \u27e8\u0161\u27e9 and \u27e8\u017e\u27e9), they are considered as separate letters from \u27e8c\u27e9, \u27e8s\u27e9 or \u27e8z\u27e9 and collated separately; letters with the ogonek (\u27e8\u0105\u27e9, \u27e8\u0119\u27e9, \u27e8\u012f\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0173\u27e9), the macron (\u27e8\u016b\u27e9) and the overdot (\u27e8\u0117\u27e9) are considered as separate letters as well, but not given a unique collation order.\n* Welsh uses the circumflex, diaeresis, acute, and grave accents on its seven vowels \u27e8a\u27e9, \u27e8e\u27e9, \u27e8i\u27e9, \u27e8o\u27e9, \u27e8u\u27e9, \u27e8w\u27e9, \u27e8y\u27e9 (hence the composites \u27e8\u00e2\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ea\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ee\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fb\u27e9, \u27e8\u0175\u27e9, \u27e8\u0177\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00eb\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ef\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9, \u27e8\u1e85\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ff\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9, \u27e8\u1e83\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fd\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e0\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ec\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f2\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f9\u27e9, \u27e8\u1e81\u27e9, \u27e8\u1ef3\u27e9). However all except the circumflex (which is used as a macron) are fairly rare.\n* Following spelling reforms since the 1970s, Scottish Gaelic uses graves only, which can be used on any vowel (\u27e8\u00e0\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ec\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f2\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f9\u27e9). Formerly acute accents could be used on \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, which were used to indicate a specific vowel quality. With the elimination of these accents, the new orthography relies on the reader having prior knowledge of pronunciation of a given word.\n* Manx uses the cedilla diacritic \u27e8\u00e7\u27e9 combined with h to give the digraph \u27e8\u00e7h\u27e9 (pronounced ) to mark the distinction between it and the digraph \u27e8ch\u27e9 (pronounced or ). Other diacritics used in Manx included the circumflex and diaeresis, as in \u27e8\u00e2\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ea\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ef\u27e9, etc. to mark the distinction between two similarly spelled words but with slightly differing pronunciation.\n* Irish uses only acute accents to mark long vowels, following the 1948 spelling reform. Lenition is indicated using an overdot in Gaelic type (\u27e8\u010b\u27e9,\u27e8\u1e0b\u27e9,\u27e8\u1e1f\u27e9, \u27e8\u0121\u27e9, \u27e8\u1e41\u27e9, \u27e8\u1e57\u27e9, \u27e8\u1e61\u27e9, \u27e8\u1e6b\u27e9); in Roman type, a suffixed \u27e8h\u27e9 is used. Thus, is equivalent to .\n* Breton does not have a single orthography (spelling system), but uses diacritics for a number of purposes. The diaeresis is used to mark that two vowels are pronounced separately and not as a diphthong/digraph. The circumflex is used to mark long vowels, but usually only when the vowel length is not predictable by phonology. Nasalization of vowels may be marked with a tilde, or following the vowel with the letter \u27e8\u00f1\u27e9. The plural suffix -o\u00f9 is used as a unified spelling to represent a suffix with a number of pronunciations in different dialects, and to distinguish this suffix from the digraph \u27e8ou\u27e9 which is pronounced as . An apostrophe is used to distinguish \u27e8c'h\u27e9, pronounced as the digraph \u27e8ch\u27e9 is used in other Celtic languages, from the French-influenced digraph ch, pronounced .\n* Estonian has a distinct letter \u27e8\u00f5\u27e9, which contains a tilde. Estonian vowels with double-dot diacritics \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9 are similar to German, but these are also distinct letters, unlike German umlauted letters. All four have their own place in the alphabet, between \u27e8w\u27e9 and \u27e8x\u27e9. Carons in \u27e8\u0161\u27e9 or \u27e8\u017e\u27e9 appear only in foreign proper names and loanwords. Also these are distinct letters, placed in the alphabet between \"s\" and \"t\".\n* Finnish uses double-dotted vowels (\u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9). As in Swedish and Estonian, these are regarded as individual letters, rather than 'vowel + diacritic' combinations (as happens in German). It also uses the characters \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9, \u27e8\u0161\u27e9 and \u27e8\u017e\u27e9 in foreign names and loanwords. In the Finnish and Swedish alphabets, \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 collate as separate letters after \u27e8z\u27e9, the others as variants of their base letter.\n* Hungarian uses the double-dot, the acute and double acute diacritics (the last is unique to Hungarian): (\u27e8\u00f6\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9), (\u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9) and (\u27e8\u0151\u27e9, \u27e8\u0171\u27e9). The acute accent indicates the long form of a vowel (in case of \u27e8i\u27e9/\u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8o\u27e9/\u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8u\u27e9/\u27e8\u00fa\u27e9) while the double acute performs the same function for \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9. The acute accent can also indicate a different sound (more open, as in case of \u27e8a\u27e9/\u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8e\u27e9/\u27e8\u00e9\u27e9). Both long and short forms of the vowels are listed separately in the Hungarian alphabet, but members of the pairs \u27e8a\u27e9/\u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8e\u27e9/\u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8i\u27e9/\u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8o\u27e9/\u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9/\u27e8\u0151\u27e9, \u27e8u\u27e9/\u27e8\u00fa\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9/\u27e8\u0171\u27e9 are collated in dictionaries as the same letter.\n* Livonian has the following letters: \u27e8\u0101\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9, \u27e8\u01df\u27e9, \u27e8\u1e11\u27e9, \u27e8\u0113\u27e9, \u27e8\u012b\u27e9, \u27e8\u013c\u27e9, \u27e8\u0146\u27e9, \u27e8\u014d\u27e9, \u27e8\u022f\u27e9, \u27e8\u0231\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f5\u27e9, \u27e8\u022d\u27e9, \u27e8\u0157\u27e9, \u27e8\u0161\u27e9, \u27e8\u021b\u27e9, \u27e8\u016b\u27e9, \u27e8\u017e\u27e9.\n* German uses the two-dots diacritic (): letters \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9, used to indicate the fronting of back vowels (see umlaut (linguistics)).\n* Dutch uses acute, circumflex, grave and two-dots diacritics with most vowels and cedilla with c, as in French. This results in \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e0\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ea\u27e9, \u27e8\u00eb\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ee\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ef\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fb\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00e7\u27e9. This is mostly on words (and names) originating from French (like \"cr\u00e8me, caf\u00e9, g\u00eane, fa\u00e7ade\"). The acute accent is also used to stress the vowel (like \"\u00e9\u00e9n\"). The two-dots diacritic is used as a linguistic diaeresis (a vowel hiatus) that splits the two vowels, e.g., \"re\u00eble, re\u00fcnie, co\u00f6rdinatie\"), rather than to indicate a linguistic as used in German.\n* Afrikaans uses 16 additional vowel forms, both uppercase and lowercase: \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ea\u27e9, \u27e8\u00eb\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ee\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ef\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fb\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fd\u27e9. \n* Faroese uses acutes and some additional letters. All are considered separate letters and have their own place in the alphabet: \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fd\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f8\u27e9.\n* Icelandic uses acutes and other additional letters. All are considered separate letters, and have their own place in the alphabet: \u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fd\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9.\n* Danish and Norwegian use additional characters like the o-slash \u27e8\u00f8\u27e9 and the a-overring \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9. These letters come after \u27e8z\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 in the order \u27e8\u00f8\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9. Historically, the \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9 has developed from a ligature by writing a small superscript \u27e8a\u27e9 over a lowercase \u27e8a\u27e9; if an \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9 character is unavailable, some Scandinavian languages allow the substitution of a doubled \"a\", thus \u27e8aa\u27e9. The Scandinavian languages collate these letters after \u27e8z\u27e9, but have different national collation standards.\n* Swedish uses a-diaeresis (\u27e8\u00e4\u27e9) and o-diaeresis (\u27e8\u00f6\u27e9) in the place of (\u27e8\u00e6\u27e9) and slashed o (\u27e8\u00f8\u27e9) in addition to the a-overring (\u27e8\u00e5\u27e9). Historically, the two-dots diacritic for the Swedish letters \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9 developed from a small Gothic \u27e8e\u27e9 written above the letters. These letters are collated after \u27e8z\u27e9, in the order \u27e8\u00e5\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f6\u27e9.\n* In Asturian, Galician and Spanish, the character \u27e8\u00f1\u27e9 is a letter and collated between \"n\" and \"o\".\n* Asturian uses an underdot: \u27e8\u1e36\u27e9 (lower case, \u27e8\u1e37\u27e9), and \u27e8\u1e24\u27e9 (lower case \u27e8\u1e25\u27e9)\n* Catalan uses the acute accent \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9, the grave accent \u27e8\u00e0\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f2\u27e9, the diaeresis \u27e8\u00ef\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fc\u27e9, the cedilla \u27e8\u00e7\u27e9, and the interpunct \u27e8l\u00b7l\u27e9. \n* In Valencian, the circumflex \u27e8\u00e2\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ea\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ee\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f4\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fb\u27e9 may also be used.\n* Corsican uses the following in its alphabet: \u27e8\u00c0\u27e9/\u27e8\u00e0\u27e9, \u27e8\u00c8\u27e9/\u27e8\u00e8\u27e9, \u27e8\u00cc\u27e9/\u27e8\u00ec\u27e9, \u27e8\u00d2\u27e9/\u27e8\u00f2\u27e9, \u27e8\u00d9\u27e9/\u27e8\u00f9\u27e9.\n* French uses four diacritics, appearing on vowels (circumflex, acute, grave, diaeresis) and the cedilla appearing in \u27e8\u00e7\u27e9.\n* Italian uses two diacritics, appearing on vowels (acute, grave)\n* Leonese: could use \u27e8\u00f1\u27e9 or \u27e8nn\u27e9.\n* Portuguese uses a tilde with the vowels \u27e8a\u27e9 and \u27e8o\u27e9 and a cedilla with c.\n* Romanian uses a breve on the letter \"a\" (\u27e8\u0103\u27e9) to indicate the sound schwa , as well as a circumflex over the letters \"a\" (\u27e8\u00e2\u27e9) and \"i\" (\u27e8\u00ee\u27e9) for the sound . Romanian also writes a comma below the letters \"s\" (\u27e8\u0219\u27e9) and \"t\" (\u27e8\u021b\u27e9) to represent the sounds and , respectively. These characters are collated after their non-diacritic equivalent.\n* Spanish uses acute accents (\u27e8\u00e1\u27e9, \u27e8\u00e9\u27e9, \u27e8\u00ed\u27e9, \u27e8\u00f3\u27e9, \u27e8\u00fa\u27e9) to indicate stress falling on a different syllable than the one it would fall on based on default rules, and to distinguish certain one-syllable homonyms (e.g. (masculine singular definite article) and [he]). The acute accent is also used to break up sequences of vowels that would normally be pronouced as a diphthong into two syllables, as in the word . Diaeresis is used on u only, to distinguish the combinations from , e.g. . The tilde on \u27e8\u00f1\u27e9 is not considered a diacritic as \u27e8\u00f1\u27e9 is considered a distinct letter from \u27e8n\u27e9, not a mutated form of it.\n* Gaj's Latin alphabet, used in Croatian and latinized Serbian, has the symbols \u27e8\u010d\u27e9, \u27e8\u0107\u27e9, \u27e8\u0111\u27e9, \u27e8\u0161\u27e9 and \u27e8\u017e\u27e9, which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. It also has one digraph including a diacritic, \"d\u017e\", which is also alphabetized independently, and follows \u27e8d\u27e9 and precedes \u27e8\u0111\u27e9 in the alphabetical order.\n* The Czech alphabet uses the acute (lowercase \u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa \u00fd, uppercase \u00c1 \u00c9 \u00cd \u00d3 \u00da \u00dd), caron (lowercase \u010d \u010f \u011b \u0148 \u0159 \u0161 \u0165 \u017e, uppercase \u010c \u010e \u011a \u0147 \u0158 \u0160 \u0164 \u017d), and for one letter (lowercase \u016f, uppercase \u016e) the ring. (In \u010f and \u0165 the caron is modified to look rather like an apostrophe.) Letter with caron are considered separate letters, whereas vowels are considered only as longer variants of the unaccented letters. Acute does not affect alphabetical order, letters with caron are ordered after original counterparts.\n* Polish has the following letters: \u0105 \u0107 \u0119 \u0142 \u0144 \u00f3 \u015b \u017a \u017c. These are considered to be separate letters: each of them is placed in the alphabet immediately after its Latin counterpart (e.g. \u27e8\u0105\u27e9 between \u27e8a\u27e9 and \u27e8b\u27e9), \u27e8\u017a\u27e9 and \u27e8\u017c\u27e9 are placed after \u27e8z\u27e9 in that order.\n* The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet has no diacritics, instead it has a grapheme (glyph) for every letter of its Latin counterpart (including Latin letters with diacritics and the digraphs d\u017e, \"lj\" and \"nj\").\n* The Slovak alphabet uses the acute (lowercase \u00e1 \u00e9 \u00ed \u00f3 \u00fa \u00fd \u013a \u0155, uppercase \u00c1 \u00c9 \u00cd \u00d3 \u00da \u00dd \u0139 \u0154), caron (lowercase \u010d \u010f \u013e \u0148 \u0161 \u0165 \u017e d\u017e, uppercase \u010c \u010e \u013d \u0147 \u0160 \u0164 \u017d D\u017d), umlaut (\u00e4 \u00c4) and circumflex accent (\u00f4 \u00d4). All of those are considered separate letters and are placed directly after the original counterpart in the alphabet.\n* The basic Slovenian alphabet has the symbols \u27e8\u010d\u27e9, \u27e8\u0161\u27e9, and \u27e8\u017e\u27e9, which are considered separate letters and are listed as such in dictionaries and other contexts in which words are listed according to alphabetical order. Letters with a caron are placed right after the letters as written without the diacritic. The letter \u27e8\u0111\u27e9 ('d with bar') may be used in non-transliterated foreign words, particularly names, and is placed after \u27e8\u010d\u27e9 and before \u27e8d\u27e9.\n*Azerbaijani includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters \u00c7, \u011e, I, \u0130, \u00d6, \u015e and \u00dc.\n* Crimean Tatar includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters \u00c7, \u011e, I, \u0130, \u00d6, \u015e and \u00dc. Unlike Turkish, Crimean Tatar also has the letter \u00d1.\n* Gagauz includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters \u00c7, \u011e, I, \u0130, \u00d6 and \u00dc. Unlike Turkish, Gagauz also has the letters \u00c4, \u00ca \u0218 and \u021a. \u0218 and \u021a are derived from the Romanian alphabet for the same sounds. Sometime the Turkish \u015e may be used instead of \u0218.\n* Turkish uses a \u27e8G\u27e9 with a breve (\u27e8\u011e\u27e9), two letters with two dots (\u27e8\u00d6\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00dc\u27e9, representing two rounded front vowels), two letters with a cedilla (\u27e8\u00c7\u27e9 and \u27e8\u015e\u27e9, representing the affricate and the fricative ), and also possesses a dotted capital \u27e8\u0130\u27e9 (and a dotless lowercase \u27e8\u0131\u27e9 representing a high unrounded back vowel). In Turkish each of these are separate letters, rather than versions of other letters, where dotted capital \u27e8\u0130\u27e9 and lower case \u27e8i\u27e9 are the same letter, as are dotless capital \u27e8I\u27e9 and lowercase \u27e8\u0131\u27e9. Typographically, \u27e8\u00c7\u27e9 and \u27e8\u015e\u27e9 are sometimes rendered with an underdot, as in \u27e8\u1e62\u27e9. The new Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, and Gagauz alphabets are based on the Turkish alphabet and its same diacriticized letters, with some additions.\n* Turkmen includes the distinct Turkish alphabet letters \u00c7, \u00d6, \u015e and \u00dc. In addition, Turkmen uses A with diaeresis (\"\u00c4\") to represent , N with caron (\u27e8\u0147\u27e9) to represent the velar nasal , Y with acute (\u27e8\u00dd\u27e9) to represent the palatal approximant , and Z with caron (\u27e8\u017d\u27e9) to represent .\n*Albanian has two special letters \u00c7 and \u00cb upper and lowercase. They are placed next to the most similar letters in the alphabet, c and e correspondingly.\n* Esperanto has the symbols \"\u016d\", \"\u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135\" and \"\u015d\", which are included in the alphabet, and considered separate letters.\n* Filipino also has the character \"\u00f1\" as a letter and is collated between n and o.\n* Modern Greenlandic does not use any diacritics, although \"\u00f8\" and \"\u00e5\" are used to spell loanwords, especially from Danish and English. From 1851 until 1973, Greenlandic was written in an alphabet invented by Samuel Kleinschmidt, where long vowels and geminate consonants were indicated by diacritics on vowels (in the case of consonant gemination, the diacritics were placed on the vowel preceding the affected consonant). For example, the name \"Kalaallit Nunaat\" was spelled \"Kal\u00e2dlit Nun\u00e2t\". This scheme uses the circumflex (\u25cc\u0302) to indicate a long vowel (e.g. \u27e8\u00e2t, \u00eet, \u00fbt\u27e9; modern: \u27e8aat, iit, uut\u27e9), an acute accent (\u25cc\u0301) to indicate gemination of the following consonant: (i.e. \u27e8\u00e1k, \u00edk, \u00fak\u27e9; modern: \u27e8akk, ikk, ukk\u27e9) and, finally, a tilde (\u25cc\u0303) or a grave accent (\u25cc\u0300), depending on the author, indicates vowel length and gemination of the following consonant (e.g. \u27e8\u00e3t/\u00e0t, \u0129t/\u00ect, \u0169t/\u00f9t\u27e9; modern: \u27e8aatt, iitt, uutt\u27e9). \u27e8\u00ea, \u00f4\u27e9, used only before \u27e8r, q\u27e9, are now written \u27e8ee, oo\u27e9 in Greenlandic.\n* Hawaiian uses the kahak\u014d (macron) over vowels, although there is some disagreement over considering them as individual letters. The kahak\u014d over a vowel can completely change the meaning of a word that is spelled the same but without the kahak\u014d.\n*Kurdish uses the symbols \u00c7, \u00ca, \u00ce, \u015e and \u00db with other 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.\n*Lakota alphabet uses the caron for the letters \"\u010d\", \"\u021f\", \"\u01e7\", \"\u0161\", and \"\u017e\". It also uses the acute accent for stressed vowels \u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa, \u00e1\u014b, \u00ed\u014b, \u00fa\u014b.\n*Malay uses some diacritics such as \"\u00e1, \u0101, \u00e7, \u00ed, \u00f1, \u00f3, \u0161, \u00fa\". Uses of diacritics was continued until late 19th century except \"\u0101\" and \"\u0113\".\n*Maltese uses a C, G, and Z with a dot over them (\u010a, \u0120, \u017b), and also has an H with an extra horizontal bar. For uppercase H, the extra bar is written slightly above the usual bar. For lowercase H, the extra bar is written crossing the vertical, like a \"t\", and not touching the lower part (\u0126, \u0127). The above characters are considered separate letters. The letter 'c' without a dot has fallen out of use due to redundancy. '\u010a' is pronounced like the English 'ch' and 'k' is used as a hard c as in 'cat'. '\u017b' is pronounced just like the English 'Z' as in 'Zebra', while 'Z' is used to make the sound of 'ts' in English (like 'tsunami' or 'maths'). '\u0120' is used as a soft 'G' like in 'geometry', while the 'G' sounds like a hard 'G' like in 'log'. The digraph 'g\u0127' (called \"g\u0127ajn\" after the Arabic letter name \"\u02bbayn\" for \u063a) is considered separate, and sometimes ordered after 'g', whilst in other volumes it is placed between 'n' and 'o' (the Latin letter 'o' originally evolved from the shape of Phoenician \"\u02bbayin\", which was traditionally collated after Phoenician \"n\u016bn\").\n* The romanization of Syriac uses the altered letters of. \"\u0100, \u010c, \u1e0e, \u0112, \u00cb, \u0120, \u1e24, \u014c, \u0160, \u1e62, \u1e6c, \u016a, \u017d\" alongside the 26 standard Latin alphabet symbols.\n*Vietnamese uses the horn diacritic for the letters \"\u01a1\" and \"\u01b0\"; the circumflex for the letters \"\u00e2\", \"\u00ea\", and \"\u00f4\"; the breve for the letter \"\u0103\"; and a bar through the letter \"\u0111\". Separately, it also has \u00e1, \u00e0, \u1ea3, \u00e3 and \u1ea1, the five tones used for vowels besides the flat tone 'a'.\n*Belarusian and Uzbek Cyrillic have a letter \u27e8\u045e\u27e9.\n* Belarusian, Bulgarian, Russian and Ukrainian have the letter \u27e8\u0439\u27e9.\n* Belarusian and Russian have the letter \u27e8\u0451\u27e9. In Russian, this letter is usually replaced by \u27e8\u0435\u27e9, although it has a different pronunciation. The use of \u27e8\u0435\u27e9 instead of \u27e8\u0451\u27e9 does not affect the pronunciation. \"\u0401\" is always used in children's books and in dictionaries. A minimal pair is \u0432\u0441\u0435 (\"vs'e\", \"everybody\" pl.) and \u0432\u0441\u0451 (\"vs'o\", \"everything\" n. sg.). In Belarusian the replacement by \u27e8\u0435\u27e9 is a mistake; in Russian, it is permissible to use either \u27e8\u0435\u27e9 or \u27e8\u0451\u27e9 for \u27e8\u0451\u27e9 but the former is more common in everyday writing (as opposed to instructional or juvenile writing).\n* The Cyrillic Ukrainian alphabet has the letters \u27e8\u0491\u27e9, \u27e8\u0439\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0457\u27e9. Ukrainian Latynka has many more.\n* Macedonian has the letters \u27e8\u045c\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0453\u27e9.\n* In Bulgarian and Macedonian the possessive pronoun \u045d (\"\u00ec\", \"her\") is spelled with a grave accent in order to distinguish it from the conjunction \u0438 (\"i\", \"and\").\n* The acute accent \u25cc\u0301 above any vowel in Cyrillic alphabets is used in dictionaries, books for children and foreign learners to indicate the word stress, it also can be used for disambiguation of similarly spelled words with different lexical stresses.\nDiacritics that do not produce new letters.\nEnglish.\nEnglish is one of the few European languages that does not have many words that contain diacritical marks. Instead, digraphs are the main way the Modern English alphabet adapts the Latin to its phonemes. Exceptions are unassimilated foreign loanwords, including borrowings from French (and, increasingly, Spanish, like \"jalape\u00f1o\" and \"pi\u00f1ata\"); however, the diacritic is also sometimes omitted from such words. Loanwords that frequently appear with the diacritic in English include \"caf\u00e9\", \"r\u00e9sum\u00e9\" or \"resum\u00e9\" (a usage that helps distinguish it from the verb \"resume\"), \"souffl\u00e9\", and \"na\u00efvet\u00e9\" (see \"English terms with diacritical marks\"). In older practice (and even among some orthographically conservative modern writers), one may see examples such as \"\u00e9lite\", \"m\u00eal\u00e9e\" and \"r\u00f4le.\"\nEnglish speakers and writers once used the diaeresis more often than now in words such as \"co\u00f6peration\" (from Fr. \"coop\u00e9ration\"), \"zo\u00f6logy\" (from Grk. \"zoologia\"), and \"see\u00ebr\" (now more commonly \"see-er \"or simply\" seer\") as a way of indicating that adjacent vowels belonged to separate syllables, but this practice has become far less common. \"The New Yorker\" magazine is a major publication that continues to use the diaeresis in place of a hyphen for clarity and economy of space.\nA few English words, often when used out of context, especially in isolation, can only be distinguished from other words of the same spelling by using a diacritic or modified letter. These include \"expos\u00e9\", \"lam\u00e9\", \"mat\u00e9\", \"\u00f6re\", \"\u00f8re\", \"r\u00e9sum\u00e9\" and \"ros\u00e9.\" In a few words, diacritics that did not exist in the original have been added for disambiguation, as in \"mat\u00e9\" (\"from Sp. and Port.\" mate)\", sak\u00e9\" (\"the standard Romanization of the Japanese has no accent mark\")\", and\" Mal\u00e9 (\"from Dhivehi \u0789\u07a7\u078d\u07ac\")\",\" to clearly distinguish them from the English words \"mate, sake,\" and \"male.\"\nThe acute and grave accents are occasionally used in poetry and lyrics: the acute to indicate stress overtly where it might be ambiguous (\"r\u00e9bel\" vs. \"reb\u00e9l\") or nonstandard for metrical reasons (\"cal\u00e9ndar\"), the grave to indicate that an ordinarily silent or elided syllable is pronounced (\"warn\u00e8d,\" \"parl\u00ecament\").\nIn certain personal names such as \"Ren\u00e9e\" and \"Zo\u00eb\", often two spellings exist, and the person's own preference will be known only to those close to them. Even when the name of a person is spelled with a diacritic, like \"Charlotte Bront\u00eb\", this may be dropped in English-language articles, and even in official documents such as passports, due either to carelessness, the typist not knowing how to enter letters with diacritical marks, or technical reasons (California, for example, does not allow names with diacritics, as the computer system cannot process such characters). They also appear in some worldwide company names and/or trademarks, such as \"Nestl\u00e9\" and \"Citro\u00ebn\".\nOther languages.\nThe following languages have letter-diacritic combinations that are not considered independent letters.\nTransliteration.\nSeveral languages that are not written with the Roman alphabet are transliterated, or romanized, using diacritics.

{"id": "8443", "revid": "47080232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8443", "title": "Didgeridoo", "text": "Traditional Australian musical instrument\nThe didgeridoo (; also spelt didjeridu, among other variants) is a wind instrument, played with vibrating lips to produce a continuous drone while using a special breathing technique called circular breathing. The didgeridoo was developed by Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia at least 1,000 years ago, and is now in use around the world, though still most strongly associated with Indigenous Australian music. In the Yol\u014bu languages of the indigenous people of northeast Arnhem Land the name for the instrument is the yi\u1e0faki, sometimes more recently also called mandapul. In the Bininj Kunwok language of West Arnhem Land it is known as mako (pronounced, and sometimes spelt, as mago).\nA didgeridoo is usually cylindrical or conical, and can measure anywhere from long. Most are around long. Generally, the longer the instrument, the lower its pitch. Flared instruments play a higher pitch than unflared instruments of the same length.\nHistory.\nThere are no reliable sources of the exact age of the didgeridoo. Archaeological studies suggest that people of the Kakadu region in Northern Australia have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of rock art paintings. A clear rock painting in Ginga Wardelirrhmeng, on the northern edge of the Arnhem Land plateau, from the freshwater period (that had begun 1500 years ago) shows a didgeridoo player and two song-men participating in an Ubarr ceremony. It is thus thought that it was developed by Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia, possibly in Arnhem Land.\nT. B. Wilson's \"Narrative of a Voyage Round the World\" (1835) includes a drawing of an Aboriginal man from Raffles Bay on the Cobourg Peninsula (about east of Darwin) playing the instrument. Others observed such an instrument in the same area, made of bamboo and about long. In 1893, English palaeontologist Robert Etheridge, Junior observed the use of \"three very curious trumpets\" made of bamboo in northern Australia. There were then two native species of bamboo growing along the Adelaide River, Northern Territory\".\nAccording to A. P. Elkin, in 1938, the instrument was \"only known in the eastern Kimberley [region in Western Australia] and the northern third of the Northern Territory\".\nEtymology.\nThe name \"didgeridoo\" is not of Aboriginal Australian linguistic origin and is considered to be an onomatopoetic word. The earliest occurrences of the word in print include a 1908 edition of the \"Hamilton Spectator\" referring to a \"'did-gery-do' (hollow bamboo)\", a 1914 edition of \"The Northern Territory Times and Gazette\", and a 1919 issue of \"Smith's Weekly\", in which it was referred to as a \"didjerry\" and was said to produce the sound \"didjerry, didjerry, didjerry and so on ad infinitum\".\nA rival explanation, that \"didgeridoo\" is a corruption of the Irish phrase or Scottish Gaelic , is controversial. Irish or , and Scottish Gaelic , are nouns that, depending on the context, may mean \"trumpeter\", \"hummer\", \"crooner\" or \"puffer\", while Irish means \"black\", and Scottish Gaelic means \"native\".\nOther names.\nThere are numerous names for the instrument among the Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia, none of which closely resemble the word \"didgeridoo\" (see below). Some didgeridoo enthusiasts, scholars and Aboriginal people advocate using local language names for the instrument.\n\"Yi\u1e0faki\" (transcribed \"yidaki\" in English, sometimes spelt \"yirdaki\") is one of the most commonly used names although, strictly speaking, it refers to a specific type of the instrument made and used by the Yolngu peoples of north-east Arnhem Land. Some Yolngu people began using the word \"mandapul\" after 2011, out of respect for the passing of a Manggalili man who had a name sounding similar to yidaki.\nIn west Arnhem Land, it is known as a \"mako\", a name popularised by virtuoso player David Blanasi, a Bininj man, whose language was Kunwinjku, and who brought the didgeridoo to world prominence. However the mako is slightly different from the Yi\u1e0faki: usually shorter, and sounding somewhat different \u2013 a slightly fuller and richer sound, but without the \"overtone\" note. The word is pronounced \"mago\" and is sometimes spelt that way. \nThere are at least 45 names for the didgeridoo which are still used in the \"lingua franca\" by some Aboriginal people. The following are some of the more common regional names.\nDescription and construction.\nA didgeridoo is usually cylindrical or conical, and can measure anywhere from long. Most are around long. Generally, the longer the instrument, the lower its pitch or key. However, flared instruments play a higher pitch than unflared instruments of the same length.\nThe didgeridoo is classified as a wind instrument and is similar in form to a straight trumpet, but made of wood. It has also been called a dronepipe.\nTraditional.\nTraditional didgeridoos are usually made from hardwoods, especially the various eucalyptus species that are endemic to northern and central Australia. Generally the main trunk of the tree is harvested, though a substantial branch may be used instead. Traditional didgeridoo makers seek suitably hollow live trees in areas with obvious termite activity. Termites attack these living eucalyptus trees, removing only the dead heartwood of the tree, as the living sapwood contains a chemical that repels the insects. Various techniques are employed to find trees with a suitable hollow, including knowledge of landscape and termite activity patterns, and a kind of tap or knock test, in which the bark of the tree is peeled back, and a fingernail or the blunt end of a tool, such as an axe, is knocked against the wood to determine if the hollow produces the right resonance. Once a suitably hollow tree is found, it is cut down and cleaned out, the bark is taken off, the ends trimmed, and the exterior is shaped; this results in a finished instrument. A rim of beeswax may be applied to the mouthpiece end.\nModern.\nNon-traditional didgeridoos can be made from native or non-native hard woods (typically split, hollowed and rejoined), bamboo, glass, fibreglass, metal, agave, clay, resin, PVC piping and carbon fibre. These typically have an upper inside diameter of around down to a bell end of anywhere between and have a length corresponding to the desired key. The end of the pipe can be shaped and smoothed to create a comfortable mouthpiece or an added mouthpiece can be made of any shaped and smoothed material such as rubber, a rubber stopper with a hole or beeswax.\nModern didgeridoo designs are distinct from the traditional Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo, and are innovations recognised by musicologists. Didgeridoo design innovation started in the late 20th century, using non-traditional materials and non-traditional shapes. The practice has sparked, however, a good deal of debate among indigenous practitioners and non-indigenous people about its aesthetic, ethical, and legal issues.\nDecoration.\nDidgeridoos can be painted by their maker or a dedicated artist using traditional or modern paints while others retain the natural wood grain design with minimal or no decoration.\nPlaying.\nA didgeridoo can be played simply by producing a vibrating sound of the lips to produce the basic drone. More advanced playing involves the technique known as circular breathing. The circular breathing technique requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously using the muscles of the cheeks to compress the cheeks and release the stored air out of the mouth. By using this technique, a skilled player can replenish the air in their lungs, and with practice they can sustain a note for as long as desired. Recordings exist of modern didgeridoo players playing continuously for more than 40 minutes; Mark Atkins on \"Didgeridoo Concerto\" (1994) plays for over 50 minutes continuously. Although circular breathing does eliminate the need to stop playing to take a breath, discomfort might still develop during a period of extended play due to chapped lips or other oral discomfort. \nThe didgeridoo functions \"as an aural kaleidoscope of timbres\" and \"the extremely difficult virtuoso techniques developed by expert performers find no parallel elsewhere\".\nThe didgeridoo player and composer William Barton has expanded the role of the instrument in the concert hall both with his own orchestral and chamber music works and with those written or arranged for him by prominent Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe.\nPhysics and operation.\nA termite-bored didgeridoo has an irregular shape that, overall, usually increases in diameter towards the lower end. This shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies that are not harmonically spaced in frequency. This contrasts with the harmonic spacing of the resonances in a cylindrical plastic pipe, whose resonant frequencies fall in the ratio 1:3:5 etc. The second resonance of a didgeridoo (the note sounded by overblowing) is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency (a frequency ratio of 8:3).\nThe vibration produced by the player's lips has harmonics in the ratio 1:2:3 etc. However, the non-harmonic spacing of the instrument's resonances means that the harmonics of the fundamental note are not systematically assisted by instrument's resonances, as is usually the case for Western wind instruments (e.g., in the low range of the clarinet, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th harmonics of the reed are assisted by resonances of the bore).\nSufficiently strong resonances of the vocal tract can strongly influence the timbre of the instrument.\nAt some frequencies, whose values depend on the position of the player's tongue, resonances of the vocal tract inhibit the oscillatory flow of air into the instrument.\nBands of frequencies that are not thus inhibited produce formants in the output sound.\nThese formants, and especially their variation during the inhalation and exhalation phases of circular breathing, give the instrument its readily recognisable sound.\nOther variations in the didgeridoo's sound can be made by adding vocalisations to the drone. Most of the vocalisations are related to sounds emitted by Australian animals, such as the dingo or the kookaburra. To produce these sounds, the players use their vocal folds to produce the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument. The results range from very high-pitched sounds to much lower sounds involving interference between the lip and vocal fold vibrations. Adding vocalisations increases the complexity of the playing.\nIn popular culture.\nCharlie McMahon, who formed the group Gondwanaland, was one of the first non-Aboriginal players to gain fame as a professional didgeridoo player. He has toured internationally with Midnight Oil. He invented the didjeribone, a sliding didgeridoo made from two lengths of plastic tubing; its playing style is somewhat in the manner of a trombone. \nIt was featured on the British children's TV series \"Blue Peter\".\nIndustrial music bands like Test Dept use the didgeridoo. \nEarly songs by the acid jazz band Jamiroquai featured didgeridoo player Wallis Buchanan, including the band's first single \"When You Gonna Learn\", which features prominent didgeridoo in the introduction and solo sections. \nAmbient artist Steve Roach uses it in his collaborative work \"\" with Australian Aboriginal artist David Hudson and cellist Sarah Hopkins, as well as \"Dreamtime Return\". \nIt is used in the Indian song \"Jaane Kyon\" from the film \"Dil Chahta Hai\". \nChris Brooks, lead singer of the New Zealand hard rock band Like a Storm, uses the didgeridoo in some songs, including \"Love the Way You Hate Me\" from their album \"\" (2012). \nKate Bush made extensive use of the didgeridoo, played by Australian musician Rolf Harris, on her album \"The Dreaming\" (1982), which was written and recorded after a holiday in Australia. \nSinger and multi-instrumentalist Xavier Rudd plays the didgeridoo and features the instrument frequently in his recordings \nCultural significance.\nTraditionally, the didgeridoo was played as an accompaniment to ceremonial dancing and singing and for solo or recreational purposes. For Aboriginal peoples of northern Australia, the yidaki is still used to accompany singers and dancers in cultural ceremonies. For the Yolngu people, the yidaki is part of their whole physical and cultural landscape and environment, comprising the people and spirit beings which belong to their country, kinship system and the Yolngu Matha language. It is connected to Yolngu Law and underpinned by ceremony, in song, dance, visual art and stories.\nPair sticks, sometimes called clapsticks (\"bilma\" or \"bimla\" by some traditional groups), establish the beat for the songs during ceremonies. The rhythm of the didgeridoo and the beat of the clapsticks are precise, and these patterns have been handed down for many generations. In the Wangga genre, the song-man starts with vocals and then introduces \"bilma\" to the accompaniment of didgeridoo.\nSex-based traditional prohibition debate.\nTraditionally, only men play the didgeridoo and sing during ceremonial occasions; playing by women is sometimes discouraged by Aboriginal communities and elders. In 2008, publisher HarperCollins apologised for its book \"The Daring Book for Girls\", which openly encouraged girls to play the instrument, after Aboriginal academic Mark Rose described such encouragement as \"extreme cultural insensitivity\" and \"an extreme faux pas... part of a general ignorance that mainstream Australia has about Aboriginal culture.\" However, Linda Barwick, an ethnomusicologist, said that though traditionally women have not played the didgeridoo in ceremony, in informal situations there is no prohibition in the Dreaming Law. For example, in 1966, ethnomusicologist Alice Marshall Moyle made a recording in Borroloola of Jemima Wimalu, a Mara woman from the Roper River, proficiently playing the didgeridoo. In 1995, musicologist Steve Knopoff observed Yirrkala women performing \"djatpangarri\" songs that are traditionally performed by men and in 1996, ethnomusicologist Elizabeth MacKinley reported women of the Yanyuwa group giving public performances.\nAlthough there is no prohibition in the area of the didgeridoo's origin, such restrictions have been applied by other Indigenous communities. The didgeridoo was introduced to the Kimberleys in the early 20th century but it was only much later, such as in Rose's 2008 criticism of \"The Daring Book for Girls\", that Aboriginal men showed adverse reactions to women playing the instrument and prohibitions are especially evident in the South East of Australia. The belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non-Aboriginal people and is also common among Aboriginal communities in Southern Australia; some ethnomusicologists believe that the dissemination of the taboo belief and other misconceptions is a result of commercial agendas and marketing. The majority of commercial didgeridoo recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non-Aboriginal people playing a New Age style of music with liner notes promoting the instrument's spirituality which misleads consumers about the didgeridoo's secular role in traditional Aboriginal culture.\nThe taboo is particularly strong among many Aboriginal groups in the South East of Australia, where it is forbidden and considered \"cultural theft\" for non-Aboriginal women, and especially performers of New Age music regardless of sex, to play or even touch a didgeridoo.\nHealth benefits.\nA 2006 study reported in the \"British Medical Journal\" found that learning and practising the didgeridoo helped reduce snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by strengthening muscles in the upper airway, thus reducing their tendency to collapse during sleep. In the study, intervention subjects were trained in and practised didgeridoo playing, including circular breathing and other techniques. Control subjects were asked not to play the instrument. Subjects were surveyed before and after the study period to assess the effects of intervention. A small 2010 study noted marked improvements in the asthma management of 10 Aboriginal adults and children following a six-month programme of once-weekly didgeridoo lessons.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8449", "revid": "50974547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8449", "title": "Developmental biology", "text": "Study of how organisms develop and grow\nDevelopmental biology is the study of the process by which animals and plants grow and develop. Developmental biology also encompasses the biology of regeneration, asexual reproduction, metamorphosis, and the growth and differentiation of stem cells in the adult organism.\nPerspectives.\nThe main processes involved in the embryonic development of animals are: tissue patterning (via regional specification and patterned cell differentiation); tissue growth; and tissue morphogenesis.\nThe development of plants involves similar processes to that of animals. However, plant cells are mostly immotile so morphogenesis is achieved by differential growth, without cell movements. Also, the inductive signals and the genes involved are different from those that control animal development.\nGenerative biology.\nGenerative biology is the generative science that explores the dynamics guiding the development and evolution of a biological morphological form.\nDevelopmental processes.\nCell differentiation.\nCell differentiation is the process whereby different functional cell types arise in development. For example, neurons, muscle fibers and hepatocytes (liver cells) are well known types of differentiated cells. Differentiated cells usually produce large amounts of a few proteins that are required for their specific function and this gives them the characteristic appearance that enables them to be recognized under the light microscope. The genes encoding these proteins are highly active. Typically their chromatin structure is very open, allowing access for the transcription enzymes, and specific transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences in the DNA in order to activate gene expression. For example, NeuroD is a key transcription factor for neuronal differentiation, myogenin for muscle differentiation, and HNF4 for hepatocyte differentiation.\nCell differentiation is usually the final stage of development, preceded by several states of commitment which are not visibly differentiated. A single tissue, formed from a single type of progenitor cell or stem cell, often consists of several differentiated cell types. Control of their formation involves a process of lateral inhibition, based on the properties of the Notch signaling pathway. For example, in the neural plate of the embryo this system operates to generate a population of neuronal precursor cells in which NeuroD is highly expressed.\nRegeneration.\nRegeneration indicates the ability to regrow a missing part. This is very prevalent amongst plants, which show continuous growth, and also among colonial animals such as hydroids and ascidians. But most interest by developmental biologists has been shown in the regeneration of parts in free living animals. In particular four models have been the subject of much investigation. Two of these have the ability to regenerate whole bodies: \"Hydra\", which can regenerate any part of the polyp from a small fragment, and planarian worms, which can usually regenerate both heads and tails. Both of these examples have continuous cell turnover fed by stem cells and, at least in planaria, at least some of the stem cells have been shown to be pluripotent. The other two models show only distal regeneration of appendages. These are the insect appendages, usually the legs of hemimetabolous insects such as the cricket, and the limbs of urodele amphibians. Considerable information is now available about amphibian limb regeneration and it is known that each cell type regenerates itself, except for connective tissues where there is considerable interconversion between cartilage, dermis and tendons. In terms of the pattern of structures, this is controlled by a re-activation of signals active in the embryo.\nThere is still debate about the old question of whether regeneration is a \"pristine\" or an \"adaptive\" property. If the former is the case, with improved knowledge, we might expect to be able to improve regenerative ability in humans. If the latter, then each instance of regeneration is presumed to have arisen by natural selection in circumstances particular to the species, so no general rules would be expected.\nEmbryonic development of animals.\nThe sperm and egg fuse in the process of fertilization to form a fertilized egg, or zygote. This undergoes a period of divisions to form a ball or sheet of similar cells called a blastula or blastoderm. These cell divisions are usually rapid with no growth so the daughter cells are half the size of the mother cell and the whole embryo stays about the same size. They are called cleavage divisions.\nMouse epiblast primordial germ cells (see Figure: \"The initial stages of human embryogenesis\") undergo extensive epigenetic reprogramming. This process involves genome-wide DNA demethylation, chromatin reorganization and epigenetic imprint erasure leading to totipotency. DNA demethylation is carried out by a process that utilizes the DNA base excision repair pathway.\nMorphogenetic movements convert the cell mass into a three layered structure consisting of multicellular sheets called ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. These sheets are known as germ layers. This is the process of gastrulation. During cleavage and gastrulation the first regional specification events occur. In addition to the formation of the three germ layers themselves, these often generate extraembryonic structures, such as the mammalian placenta, needed for support and nutrition of the embryo, and also establish differences of commitment along the anteroposterior axis (head, trunk and tail).\nRegional specification is initiated by the presence of cytoplasmic determinants in one part of the zygote. The cells that contain the determinant become a signaling center and emit an inducing factor. Because the inducing factor is produced in one place, diffuses away, and decays, it forms a concentration gradient, high near the source cells and low further away. The remaining cells of the embryo, which do not contain the determinant, are competent to respond to different concentrations by upregulating specific developmental control genes. This results in a series of zones becoming set up, arranged at progressively greater distance from the signaling center. In each zone a different combination of developmental control genes is upregulated. These genes encode transcription factors which upregulate new combinations of gene activity in each region. Among other functions, these transcription factors control expression of genes conferring specific adhesive and motility properties on the cells in which they are active. Because of these different morphogenetic properties, the cells of each germ layer move to form sheets such that the ectoderm ends up on the outside, mesoderm in the middle, and endoderm on the inside. \nMorphogenetic movements not only change the shape and structure of the embryo, but by bringing cell sheets into new spatial relationships they also make possible new phases of signaling and response between them. In addition, first morphogenetic movements of embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, epiboly and twisting, directly activate pathways involved in endomesoderm specification through mechanotransduction processes. This property was suggested to be evolutionary inherited from endomesoderm specification as mechanically stimulated by marine environmental hydrodynamic flow in first animal organisms (first metazoa).\nGrowth in embryos is mostly autonomous. For each territory of cells the growth rate is controlled by the combination of genes that are active. Free-living embryos do not grow in mass as they have no external food supply. But embryos fed by a placenta or extraembryonic yolk supply can grow very fast, and changes to relative growth rate between parts in these organisms help to produce the final overall anatomy.\nThe whole process needs to be coordinated in time and how this is controlled is not understood. There may be a master clock able to communicate with all parts of the embryo that controls the course of events, or timing may depend simply on local causal sequences of events.\nMetamorphosis.\nDevelopmental processes are very evident during the process of metamorphosis. This occurs in various types of animal such as insects, amphibians, some fish, and many marine invertebrates. Well-known examples are seen in frogs, which usually hatch as a tadpole and metamorphoses to an adult frog, and certain insects which hatch as a larva and then become remodeled to the adult form during a pupal stage.\nAll the developmental processes listed above occur during metamorphosis. Examples that have been especially well studied include tail loss and other changes in the tadpole of the frog \"Xenopus\", and the biology of the imaginal discs, which generate the adult body parts of the fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\".\nPlant development.\nPlant development is the process by which structures originate and mature as a plant grows. It is studied in plant anatomy and plant physiology as well as plant morphology.\nPlants constantly produce new tissues and structures throughout their life from meristems located at the tips of organs, or between mature tissues. Thus, a living plant always has embryonic tissues. By contrast, an animal embryo will very early produce all of the body parts that it will ever have in its life. When the animal is born (or hatches from its egg), it has all its body parts and from that point will only grow larger and more mature.\nThe properties of organization seen in a plant are emergent properties which are more than the sum of the individual parts. \"The assembly of these tissues and functions into an integrated multicellular organism yields not only the characteristics of the separate parts and processes but also quite a new set of characteristics which would not have been predictable on the basis of examination of the separate parts.\"\nGrowth.\nA vascular plant begins from a single celled zygote, formed by fertilisation of an egg cell by a sperm cell. From that point, it begins to divide to form a plant embryo through the process of embryogenesis. As this happens, the resulting cells will organize so that one end becomes the first root, while the other end forms the tip of the shoot. In seed plants, the embryo will develop one or more \"seed leaves\" (cotyledons). By the end of embryogenesis, the young plant will have all the parts necessary to begin its life.\nOnce the embryo germinates from its seed or parent plant, it begins to produce additional organs (leaves, stems, and roots) through the process of organogenesis. New roots grow from root meristems located at the tip of the root, and new stems and leaves grow from shoot meristems located at the tip of the shoot. Branching occurs when small clumps of cells left behind by the meristem, and which have not yet undergone cellular differentiation to form a specialized tissue, begin to grow as the tip of a new root or shoot. Growth from any such meristem at the tip of a root or shoot is termed primary growth and results in the lengthening of that root or shoot. Secondary growth results in widening of a root or shoot from divisions of cells in a cambium.\nIn addition to growth by cell division, a plant may grow through cell elongation. This occurs when individual cells or groups of cells grow longer. Not all plant cells will grow to the same length. When cells on one side of a stem grow longer and faster than cells on the other side, the stem will bend to the side of the slower growing cells as a result. This directional growth can occur via a plant's response to a particular stimulus, such as light (phototropism), gravity (gravitropism), water, (hydrotropism), and physical contact (thigmotropism).\nPlant growth and development are mediated by specific plant hormones and plant growth regulators (PGRs) (Ross et al. 1983). Endogenous hormone levels are influenced by plant age, cold hardiness, dormancy, and other metabolic conditions; photoperiod, drought, temperature, and other external environmental conditions; and exogenous sources of PGRs, e.g., externally applied and of rhizospheric origin.\nMorphological variation.\nPlants exhibit natural variation in their form and structure. While all organisms vary from individual to individual, plants exhibit an additional type of variation. Within a single individual, parts are repeated which may differ in form and structure from other similar parts. This variation is most easily seen in the leaves of a plant, though other organs such as stems and flowers may show similar variation. There are three primary causes of this variation: positional effects, environmental effects, and juvenility.\nEvolution of plant morphology.\nTranscription factors and transcriptional regulatory networks play key roles in plant morphogenesis and their evolution. During plant landing, many novel transcription factor families emerged and are preferentially wired into the networks of multicellular development, reproduction, and organ development, contributing to more complex morphogenesis of land plants.\nMost land plants share a common ancestor, multicellular algae. An example of the evolution of plant morphology is seen in charophytes. Studies have shown that charophytes have traits that are homologous to land plants. There are two main theories of the evolution of plant morphology, these theories are the homologous theory and the antithetic theory. The commonly accepted theory for the evolution of plant morphology is the antithetic theory. The antithetic theory states that the multiple mitotic divisions that take place before meiosis, cause the development of the sporophyte. Then the sporophyte will development as an independent organism.\nDevelopmental model organisms.\nMuch of developmental biology research in recent decades has focused on the use of a small number of model organisms. It has turned out that there is much conservation of developmental mechanisms across the animal kingdom. In early development different vertebrate species all use essentially the same inductive signals and the same genes encoding regional identity. Even invertebrates use a similar repertoire of signals and genes although the body parts formed are significantly different. Model organisms each have some particular experimental advantages which have enabled them to become popular among researchers. In one sense they are \"models\" for the whole animal kingdom, and in another sense they are \"models\" for human development, which is difficult to study directly for both ethical and practical reasons. Model organisms have been most useful for elucidating the broad nature of developmental mechanisms. The more detail is sought, the more they differ from each other and from humans.\nOthers.\nAlso popular for some purposes have been sea urchins and ascidians. For studies of regeneration urodele amphibians such as the axolotl \"Ambystoma mexicanum\" are used, and also planarian worms such as \"Schmidtea mediterranea\".

Given the typical planet to satellite mass ratio is around 1:10,000, they are influenced heavily by the gravitational pull of the parent star and according to the giant-impact hypothesis are gravitationally stable only under particular circumstances.\nThe Solar System does not have an official double planet, however the Earth\u2013Moon system is sometimes considered to be one. In promotional materials advertising the SMART-1 mission, the European Space Agency referred to the Earth\u2013Moon system as a double planet.\nSeveral dwarf planet candidates can be described as binary planets. At its 2006 General Assembly, the International Astronomical Union considered a proposal that Pluto and Charon be reclassified as a double planet, but the proposal was abandoned in favor of the current IAU definition of planet. Other trans-Neptunian systems with proportionally large planetary-mass satellites include Eris\u2013Dysnomia, Orcus\u2013Vanth and Varda\u2013Ilmar\u00eb.\nBinary asteroids with components of roughly equal mass are sometimes referred to as double minor planets. These include binary asteroids 69230 Hermes and 90 Antiope and binary Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) 79360 Sila\u2013Nunam and .\nDefinition of \"double planet\".\nThere is debate as to what criteria should be used to distinguish a \"double planet\" from a \"planet\u2013moon system\". The following are considerations.\nBoth bodies satisfy planet criterion.\nA definition proposed in the \"Astronomical Journal\" calls for both bodies to individually satisfy an orbit-clearing criterion in order to be called a double planet.\nMass ratios closer to 1.\nOne important consideration for defining \"double planets\" is the ratio of the masses of the two bodies. A mass ratio of 1 would indicate bodies of equal mass, and bodies with mass ratios closer to 1 are more attractive to label as \"doubles\". Using this definition, the satellites of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune can all easily be excluded; they all have masses less than 0.00025 (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444000) of the planets around which they revolve. Some dwarf planets, too, have satellites substantially less massive than the dwarf planets themselves.\nThe most notable exception is the Pluto\u2013Charon system. The Charon-to-Pluto mass ratio of 0.122 (\u2248 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20448) is close enough to 1 that Pluto and Charon have frequently been described by many scientists as \"double dwarf planets\" (\"double planets\" prior to the 2006 definition of \"planet\"). The International Astronomical Union (IAU) earlier classified Charon as a satellite of Pluto, but had also explicitly expressed the willingness to reconsider the bodies as double dwarf planets in the future. However, a 2006 IAU report classified Charon\u2013Pluto as a double planet. \nThe Moon-to-Earth mass ratio of 0.01230 (\u2248 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204481) is also notably close to 1 when compared to all other satellite-to-planet ratios. Consequently, some scientists view the Earth\u2013Moon system as a double planet as well, though this is a minority view. Eris's lone satellite, Dysnomia, has a radius somewhere around &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 that of Eris; assuming similar densities (Dysnomia's compositional make-up may or may not differ substantially from Eris's), the mass ratio would be near &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204440, a value intermediate to the Moon\u2013Earth and Charon\u2013Pluto ratios.\nCenter-of-mass position.\nCurrently, the most commonly proposed definition for a double-planet system is one in which the barycenter, around which both bodies orbit, lies outside both bodies. Under this definition, Pluto and Charon are double dwarf planets, since they orbit a point clearly outside of Pluto, as visible in animations created from images of the \"New Horizons\" space probe in June 2015.\nUnder this definition, the Earth\u2013Moon system is not currently a double planet; although the Moon is massive enough to cause the Earth to make a noticeable revolution around this center of mass, this point nevertheless lies well within Earth. However, the Moon currently migrates outward from Earth at a rate of approximately per year; in a few billion years, the Earth\u2013Moon system's center of mass will lie outside Earth, which would make it a double-planet system.\nThe center of mass of the Jupiter\u2013Sun system lies outside the surface of the Sun, though arguing that Jupiter and the Sun are a double star is not analogous to arguing Pluto\u2013Charon is a double dwarf planet. Jupiter is too light to be a fusor; were it thirteen times heavier, it would achieve deuterium fusion and become a brown dwarf.\nTug-of-war value.\nIsaac Asimov suggested a distinction between planet\u2013moon and double-planet structures based in part on what he called a \"tug-of-war\" value, which does not consider their relative sizes. This quantity is simply the ratio of the force exerted on the smaller body by the larger (primary) body to the force exerted on the smaller body by the Sun. This can be shown to equal\nformula_1\nwhere \"m\"p is the mass of the primary (the larger body), \"m\"s is the mass of the Sun, \"d\"s is the distance between the smaller body and the Sun, and \"d\"p is the distance between the smaller body and the primary. The tug-of-war value does not rely on the mass of the satellite (the smaller body).\nThis formula actually reflects the relation of the gravitational effects on the smaller body from the larger body and from the Sun. The tug-of-war figure for Saturn's moon Titan is 380, which means that Saturn's hold on Titan is 380 times as strong as the Sun's hold on Titan. Titan's tug-of-war value may be compared with that of Saturn's moon Phoebe, which has a tug-of-war value of just 3.5; that is, Saturn's hold on Phoebe is only 3.5 times as strong as the Sun's hold on Phoebe.\nAsimov calculated tug-of-war values for several satellites of the planets. He showed that even the largest gas giant, Jupiter, had only a slightly better hold than the Sun on its outer captured satellites, some with tug-of-war values not much higher than one. In nearly every one of Asimov's calculations the tug-of-war value was found to be greater than one, so in those cases the Sun loses the tug-of-war with the planets. The one exception was Earth's Moon, where the Sun wins the tug-of-war with a value of 0.46, which means that Earth's hold on the Moon is less than half as strong as the Sun's. Asimov included this with his other arguments that Earth and the Moon should be considered a binary planet.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We might look upon the Moon, then, as neither a true satellite of the Earth nor a captured one, but as a planet in its own right, moving about the Sun in careful step with the Earth. From within the Earth\u2013Moon system, the simplest way of picturing the situation is to have the Moon revolve about the Earth; but if you were to draw a picture of the orbits of the Earth and Moon about the Sun exactly to scale, you would see that the Moon's orbit is everywhere concave toward the Sun. It is always \"falling toward\" the Sun. All the other satellites, without exception, \"fall away\" from the Sun through part of their orbits, caught as they are by the superior pull of their primary planets\u00a0\u2013 but not the Moon.\u2014\u200a\nSee the Path of Earth and Moon around Sun section in the \"Orbit of the Moon\" article for a more detailed explanation.\nThis definition of double planet depends on the pair's distance from the Sun. If the Earth\u2013Moon system happened to orbit farther away from the Sun than it does now, then Earth would win the tug of war. For example, at the orbit of Mars, the Moon's tug-of-war value would be 1.05. Also, several tiny moons discovered since Asimov's proposal would qualify as double planets by this argument. Neptune's small outer moons Neso and Psamathe, for example, have tug-of-war values of 0.42 and 0.44, less than that of Earth's Moon. Yet their masses are tiny compared to Neptune's, with an estimated ratio of 1.5\u00d710-9 (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u2044700,000,000) and 0.4\u00d710-9 (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442,500,000,000).\nFormation of the system.\nA final consideration is the way in which the two bodies came to form a system. Both the Earth\u2013Moon and Pluto\u2013Charon systems are thought to have been formed as a result of giant impacts: one body was impacted by a second body, resulting in a debris disk, and through accretion, either two new bodies formed or one new body formed, with the larger body remaining (but changed). However, a giant impact is not a sufficient condition for two bodies being \"double planets\" because such impacts can also produce tiny satellites, such as the four small outer satellites of Pluto.\nA now-abandoned hypothesis for the origin of the Moon was actually called the \"double-planet hypothesis\"; the idea was that the Earth and the Moon formed in the same region of the Solar System's proto-planetary disk, forming a system under gravitational interaction. This idea, too, is a problematic condition for defining two bodies as \"double planets\" because planets can \"capture\" moons through gravitational interaction. For example, the moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos) are thought to be asteroids captured long ago by Mars. Such a definition would also deem Neptune\u2013Triton a double planet, since Triton was a Kuiper belt body the same size and of similar composition to Pluto, later captured by Neptune.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nInformational notes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\nFurther reading"}

If proteins in a living cell are denatured, this results in disruption of cell activity and possibly cell death. Protein denaturation is also a consequence of cell death. Denatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics, from conformational change and loss of solubility or dissociation of cofactors to aggregation due to the exposure of hydrophobic groups. The loss of solubility as a result of denaturation is called \"coagulation\". When denatured, proteins, e.g., metalloenzymes, lose their 3D structure or metal cofactor and, therefore, cannot function.\nProper protein folding is key to whether a globular or membrane protein can do its job correctly; it must be folded into the native shape to function. However, hydrogen bonds and cofactor-protein binding, which play a crucial role in folding, are rather weak, and thus, easily affected by heat, acidity, varying salt concentrations, chelating agents, and other stressors which can denature the protein. This is one reason why cellular homeostasis is physiologically necessary in most life forms.\nCommon examples.\nWhen food is cooked, some of its proteins become denatured. This is why boiled eggs become hard and cooked meat becomes firm.\nA classic example of denaturing in proteins comes from egg whites, which are typically largely egg albumins in water. Fresh from the eggs, egg whites are transparent and liquid. Cooking the thermally unstable whites turns them opaque, forming an interconnected solid mass. The same transformation can be effected with a denaturing chemical. Pouring egg whites into a beaker of acetone will also turn egg whites translucent and solid. The skin that forms on curdled milk is another common example of denatured protein. The cold appetizer known as ceviche is prepared by chemically \"cooking\" raw fish and shellfish in an acidic citrus marinade, without heat.\nProtein denaturation.\nDenatured proteins can exhibit a wide range of characteristics, from loss of solubility to protein aggregation.\nBackground.\nProteins or polypeptides are polymers of amino acids. A protein is created by ribosomes that \"read\" RNA that is encoded by codons in the gene and assemble the requisite amino acid combination from the genetic instruction, in a process known as translation. The newly created protein strand then undergoes posttranslational modification, in which additional atoms or molecules are added, for example copper, zinc, or iron. Once this post-translational modification process has been completed, the protein begins to fold (sometimes spontaneously and sometimes with enzymatic assistance), curling up on itself so that hydrophobic elements of the protein are buried deep inside the structure and hydrophilic elements end up on the outside. The final shape of a protein determines how it interacts with its environment.\nProtein folding consists of a balance between a substantial amount of weak intra-molecular interactions within a protein (Hydrophobic, electrostatic, and Van Der Waals Interactions) and protein-solvent interactions. As a result, this process is heavily reliant on environmental state that the protein resides in. These environmental conditions include, and are not limited to, temperature, salinity, pressure, and the solvents that happen to be involved. Consequently, any exposure to extreme stresses (e.g. heat or radiation, high inorganic salt concentrations, strong acids and bases) can disrupt a protein's interaction and inevitably lead to denaturation.\nWhen a protein is denatured, secondary and tertiary structures are altered but the peptide bonds of the primary structure between the amino acids are left intact. Since all structural levels of the protein determine its function, the protein can no longer perform its function once it has been denatured. This is in contrast to intrinsically unstructured proteins, which are unfolded in their native state, but still functionally active and tend to fold upon binding to their biological target.\nHow denaturation occurs at levels of protein structure.\nLoss of function.\nMost biological substrates lose their biological function when denatured. For example, enzymes lose their activity, because the substrates can no longer bind to the active site, and because amino acid residues involved in stabilizing substrates' transition states are no longer positioned to be able to do so. The denaturing process and the associated loss of activity can be measured using techniques such as dual-polarization interferometry, CD, QCM-D and MP-SPR.\nLoss of activity due to heavy metals and metalloids.\nBy targeting proteins, heavy metals have been known to disrupt the function and activity carried out by proteins. Heavy metals fall into categories consisting of transition metals as well as a select amount of metalloid. These metals, when interacting with native, folded proteins, tend to play a role in obstructing their biological activity. This interference can be carried out in a different number of ways. These heavy metals can form a complex with the functional side chain groups present in a protein or form bonds to free thiols. Heavy metals also play a role in oxidizing amino acid side chains present in protein. Along with this, when interacting with metalloproteins, heavy metals can dislocate and replace key metal ions. As a result, heavy metals can interfere with folded proteins, which can strongly deter protein stability and activity.\nReversibility and irreversibility.\nIn many cases, denaturation is reversible (the proteins can regain their native state when the denaturing influence is removed). This process can be called renaturation. This understanding has led to the notion that all the information needed for proteins to assume their native state was encoded in the primary structure of the protein, and hence in the DNA that codes for the protein, the so-called \"Anfinsen's thermodynamic hypothesis\".\nDenaturation can also be irreversible. This irreversibility is typically a kinetic, not thermodynamic irreversibility, as a folded protein generally has lower free energy than when it is unfolded. Through kinetic irreversibility, the fact that the protein is stuck in a local minimum can stop it from ever refolding after it has been irreversibly denatured.\nProtein denaturation due to pH.\nDenaturation can also be caused by changes in the pH which can affect the chemistry of the amino acids and their residues. The ionizable groups in amino acids are able to become ionized when changes in pH occur. A pH change to more acidic or more basic conditions can induce unfolding. Acid-induced unfolding often occurs between pH 2 and 5, base-induced unfolding usually requires pH 10 or higher.\nConsequences.\nLoss of solubility.\nWhen proteins are folded, they fold so as to keep their hydrophobic parts on the inside (away from water) and their hydrophilic parts on the outside (contacting the water). This makes them soluble enough not to precipitate. However, when denatured the surface of the protein is partly hydrophobic and partly hydrophilic (as it no longer has an \"inside\" in which to hide the hydrophobic parts), causing it to become insoluble in water. The hydrophobic parts of the denatured proteins stick together, forming a network (gel): this is called \"coagulation\".\nThe coagulation of denatured proteins is the reason eggs solidify when cooked. When acid is added to milk, the protein casein denatures and coagulates (with fat and water inclusions from the milk) into curds, the first step in making cheese; although milk can also be made to curdle (i.e. casein to coagulate) by other methods, for example the addition of enzymes like chymosin.\nNucleic acid denaturation.\nNucleic acids (including RNA and DNA) are nucleotide polymers synthesized by polymerase enzymes during either transcription or DNA replication. Following 5'-3' synthesis of the backbone, individual nitrogenous bases are capable of interacting with one another via hydrogen bonding, thus allowing for the formation of higher-order structures. Nucleic acid denaturation occurs when hydrogen bonding between nucleotides is disrupted, and results in the separation of previously annealed strands. For example, denaturation of DNA due to high temperatures results in the disruption of base pairs and the separation of the double stranded helix into two single strands. Nucleic acid strands are capable of re-annealling when \"normal\" conditions are restored, but if restoration occurs too quickly, the nucleic acid strands may re-anneal imperfectly resulting in the improper pairing of bases.\nBiologically-induced denaturation.\nThe non-covalent interactions between antiparallel strands in DNA can be broken in order to \"open\" the double helix when biologically important mechanisms such as DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair or protein binding are set to occur. The area of partially separated DNA is known as the denaturation bubble, which can be more specifically defined as the opening of a DNA double helix through the coordinated separation of base pairs.\nThe first model that attempted to describe the thermodynamics of the denaturation bubble was introduced in 1966 and called the Poland-Scheraga Model. This model describes the denaturation of DNA strands as a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs are increasingly disturbed and \"denatured loops\" begin to form. However, the Poland-Scheraga Model is now considered elementary because it fails to account for the confounding implications of DNA sequence, chemical composition, stiffness and torsion.\nRecent thermodynamic studies have inferred that the lifetime of a singular denaturation bubble ranges from 1 microsecond to 1 millisecond. This information is based on established timescales of DNA replication and transcription. Currently, biophysical and biochemical research studies are being performed to more fully elucidate the thermodynamic details of the denaturation bubble.\nDenaturation due to chemical agents.\nWith polymerase chain reaction (PCR) being among the most popular contexts in which DNA denaturation is desired, heating is the most frequent method of denaturation. Other than denaturation by heat, nucleic acids can undergo the denaturation process through various chemical agents such as formamide, guanidine, sodium salicylate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), propylene glycol, and urea. These chemical denaturing agents lower the melting temperature (Tm) by competing for hydrogen bond donors and acceptors with pre-existing nitrogenous base pairs. Some agents are even able to induce denaturation at room temperature. For example, alkaline agents (e.g. NaOH) have been shown to denature DNA by changing pH and removing hydrogen-bond contributing protons. These denaturants have been employed to make Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis gel (DGGE), which promotes denaturation of nucleic acids in order to eliminate the influence of nucleic acid shape on their electrophoretic mobility.\nChemical denaturation as an alternative.\nThe optical activity (absorption and scattering of light) and hydrodynamic properties (translational diffusion, sedimentation coefficients, and rotational correlation times) of formamide denatured nucleic acids are similar to those of heat-denatured nucleic acids. Therefore, depending on the desired effect, chemically denaturing DNA can provide a gentler procedure for denaturing nucleic acids than denaturation induced by heat. Studies comparing different denaturation methods such as heating, beads mill of different bead sizes, probe sonication, and chemical denaturation show that chemical denaturation can provide quicker denaturation compared to the other physical denaturation methods described. Particularly in cases where rapid renaturation is desired, chemical denaturation agents can provide an ideal alternative to heating. For example, DNA strands denatured with alkaline agents such as NaOH renature as soon as phosphate buffer is added.\nDenaturation due to air.\nSmall, electronegative molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen, which are the primary gases in air, significantly impact the ability of surrounding molecules to participate in hydrogen bonding. These molecules compete with surrounding hydrogen bond acceptors for hydrogen bond donors, therefore acting as \"hydrogen bond breakers\" and weakening interactions between surrounding molecules in the environment. Antiparellel strands in DNA double helices are non-covalently bound by hydrogen bonding between base pairs; nitrogen and oxygen therefore maintain the potential to weaken the integrity of DNA when exposed to air. As a result, DNA strands exposed to air require less force to separate and exemplify lower melting temperatures.\nApplications.\nMany laboratory techniques rely on the ability of nucleic acid strands to separate.

Moody", "text": "American evangelist (1837\u20131899)\nDwight Lyman Moody (February 5, 1837 \u2013 December 22, 1899), also known as D.\u00a0L. Moody, was an American evangelist and publisher connected with Keswickianism, who founded the Moody Church, Northfield School and Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts (now Northfield Mount Hermon School), Moody Bible Institute, and Moody Publishers. One of his most famous quotes was \"Faith makes all things possible... Love makes all things easy.\" Moody gave up his lucrative boot and shoe business to devote his life to revivalism, working first in the Civil War with Union troops through YMCA in the United States Christian Commission. In Chicago, he built one of the major evangelical centers in the nation, which is still active. Working with singer Ira Sankey, he toured the country and the British Isles, drawing large crowds with a dynamic speaking style.\nEarly life.\nDwight Moody was born in Northfield, Massachusetts, as the seventh child of a large family. His father, Edwin J. Moody (1800\u20131841), was a small farmer and stonemason. His mother was Betsey Moody (n\u00e9e Holton; 1805\u20131896). They had five sons and a daughter before Dwight's birth. His father died when Dwight was age four; fraternal twins, a boy, and a girl were born one month after the father's death. Their mother struggled to support the nine children, but she still found it necessary to send some off to work for their room and board. Dwight too was sent off, where he received cornmeal porridge, and milk three times a day. He complained to his mother, but when she learned that he was getting all he wanted to eat, she sent him back. During this time, she continued to send the children to church. Together with his eight siblings, Dwight was raised in the Unitarian church. His oldest brother ran away and was not heard from by the family until many years later.\nWhen Moody turned 17, he moved to Boston to work (after receiving many job rejections locally) in an uncle's shoe store. One of the uncle's requirements was that Moody attend the Congregational Church of Mount Vernon, where Dr. Edward Norris Kirk served as the pastor. In April 1855 Moody was converted to evangelical Christianity when his Sunday school teacher, Edward Kimball, talked to him about how much God loved him. His conversion sparked the start of his career as an evangelist. Moody first applied to the church in May 1855, but he was not received as a church member until May 4, 1856.\nAccording to Moody's memoir, his teacher, Edward Kimball, said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I can truly say, and in saying it I magnify the infinite grace of God as bestowed upon him, that I have seen few persons whose minds were spiritually darker than was his when he came into my Sunday School class; and I think that the committee of the Mount Vernon Church seldom met an applicant for membership more unlikely ever to become a Christian of clear and decided views of Gospel truth, still less to fill any extended sphere of public usefulness.\nCivil War.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The first meeting I ever saw him at was in a little old shanty that had been abandoned by a saloon-keeper. Mr. Moody had got the place to hold the meetings at night. I went there a little late; and the first thing I saw was a man standing up with a few tallow candles around him, holding a negro boy, and trying to read to him the story of the Prodigal Son and a great many words he could not readout, and had to skip. I thought, 'If the Lord can ever use such an instrument as that for His honor and glory, it will astonish me.' As a result of his tireless labor, within a year the average attendance at his school was 650, while 60 volunteers from various churches served as teachers. It became so well known that the just-elected President Lincoln visited and spoke at a Sunday School meeting on November 25, 1860.\nD. L. Moody \"could not conscientiously enlist\" in the Union Army during the Civil War, later describing himself as \"a Quaker\" in this respect. After the Civil War started, he became involved with the United States Christian Commission of YMCA. He paid nine visits to the battlefront, being present among the Union soldiers after the Battle of Shiloh (a.k.a. Pittsburg Landing) and the Battle of Stones River; he also entered Richmond, Virginia, with the troops of General Grant.\nOn August 28, 1862, Moody married Emma C. Revell, with whom he had a daughter, Emma Reynolds Moody, and two sons, William Revell Moody and Paul Dwight Moody.\nChicago and the postwar years.\nIn 1858, he started a Sunday school.\nThe growing Sunday School congregation needed a permanent home, so Moody started a church in Chicago, the Illinois Street Church in 1864.\nIn June 1871 at an International Sunday School Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, Dwight Moody met Ira D. Sankey. He was a gospel singer, with whom Moody soon began to cooperate and collaborate.\nFour months later, in October 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed Moody's church building, as well as his house and those of most of his congregation. Many had to flee the flames, saving only their lives, and ending up completely destitute. Moody, reporting on the disaster, said about his own situation that: \"he saved nothing but his reputation and his Bible.\"\nIn the years after the fire, Moody's wealthy Chicago patron John V. Farwell tried to persuade him to make his permanent home in the city, offering to build a new house for Moody and his family. But the newly famous Moody, also sought by supporters in New York, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, chose a tranquil farm he had purchased near his birthplace in Northfield, Massachusetts. He felt he could better recover from his lengthy preaching trips in a rural setting.\nNorthfield became an important location in evangelical Christian history in the late 19th century as Moody organized summer conferences. These were led and attended by prominent Christian preachers and evangelists from around the world. Western Massachusetts has had a rich evangelical tradition including Jonathan Edwards preaching in colonial Northampton and C.I. Scofield preaching in Northfield. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Moody founded Moores Corner Church, in Leverett, Massachusetts.\nMoody founded two schools here: Northfield School for Girls, founded in 1879, and the Mount Hermon School for Boys, founded in 1881. In the late 20th century, these merged, forming today's co-educational, nondenominational Northfield Mount Hermon School.\nEvangelistic travels.\nDuring a trip to the United Kingdom in the spring of 1872, Moody became well known as an evangelist. Literary works published by the Moody Bible Institute claim that he was the greatest evangelist of the 19th century. He preached almost a hundred times and came into communion with the Plymouth Brethren. On several occasions, he filled stadia of a capacity of 2,000 to 4,000. According to his memoir, in the Botanic Gardens Palace, he attracted an audience estimated at between 15,000 and 30,000.\nThat turnout continued throughout 1874 and 1875, with crowds of thousands at all of his meetings. During his visit to Scotland, Moody was helped and encouraged by Andrew A. Bonar. The famous London Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon invited him to speak, and he promoted the American as well. When Moody returned to the US, he was said to frequently attract crowds of 12,000 to 20,000, such crowds being as common as they had been in England. President Grant and some of his cabinet officials attended a Moody meeting on January 19, 1876. Moody held evangelistic meetings from Boston to New York, throughout New England, and as far west as San Francisco, also visiting other West Coast towns from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to San Diego.\nMoody aided the work of cross-cultural evangelism by promoting \"The Wordless Book\", a teaching tool Charles Spurgeon had developed in 1866. In 1875, Moody added a fourth color to the design of the three-color evangelistic device: gold \u2014 to \"represent heaven.\" This \"book\" has been and is still used to teach uncounted thousands of illiterate people, young and old, around the globe about the gospel message.\nMoody visited Britain with Ira D. Sankey, with Moody preaching and Sankey singing at meetings. Together they published books of Christian hymns. In 1883, they visited Edinburgh and raised \u00a310,000 for the building of a new home for the Carrubbers Close Mission. Moody later preached at the laying of the foundation stone for what is now called the Carrubbers Christian Centre, one of the few buildings on the Royal Mile which continues to be used for its original purpose.\nMoody greatly influenced the cause of cross-cultural Christian missions after he met Hudson Taylor, a pioneer missionary to China. He actively supported the China Inland Mission and encouraged many of his congregation to volunteer for service overseas.\nInternational acclaim.\nHis influence was felt among Swedes. Being of English heritage, never visiting Sweden or any other Scandinavian country, and never speaking a word of Swedish, nonetheless, he became a hero revivalist among Swedish Mission Friends () in Sweden and America.\nNews of Moody's large revival campaigns in Great Britain from 1873 through 1875 traveled quickly to Sweden, making \"Mr. Moody\" a household name in homes of many Mission Friends. Moody's sermons published in Sweden were distributed in books, newspapers, and colporteur tracts, and they led to the spread of Sweden's \"Moody fever\" from 1875 through 1880.\nHe preached his last sermon on November 16, 1899, in Kansas City, Missouri. Becoming ill, he returned home by train to Northfield. During the preceding several months, friends had observed he had added some to his already ample frame. Although his illness was never diagnosed, it has been speculated that he suffered from congestive heart failure. He died on December 22, 1899, surrounded by his family. Already installed as the leader of the Chicago Bible Institute, R. A. Torrey succeeded Moody as its pastor.\nLegacy.\nReligious historian James Findlay says that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Speaking before thousands in the dark business suit, bearded, rotund Dwight L. Moody seemed the epitome of the \"businessman in clerical garb\" who typified popular religion in late 19th-century America... Earthy, unlettered, a dynamo of energy, the revivalist was very much a man of his times... Moody adapted revivalism, one of the major institutions of evangelical Protestantism, to the urban context. ... His organizational ability, demonstrated in the great revivals he conducted in England, combined to fashion his spectacular career as the creator of modern mass revivalism.\nTen years after Moody's death the Chicago Avenue Church was renamed the Moody Church in his honor, and the Chicago Bible Institute was likewise renamed the Moody Bible Institute.\nDwight D. Eisenhower, who was born in 1890, was named after him. During World War II, the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As weight loss depends on calorie intake, different kinds of calorie-reduced diets, such as those emphasising particular macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.), have been shown to be no more effective than one another. As weight regain is common, diet success is best predicted by long-term adherence. Regardless, the outcome of a diet can vary widely depending on the individual.\nThe first popular diet was \"Banting\", named after William Banting. In his 1863 pamphlet, \"Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public\", he outlined the details of a particular low-carbohydrate, low-calorie diet that led to his own dramatic weight loss.\nSome guidelines recommend dieting to lose weight for people with weight-related health problems, but not for otherwise healthy people. One survey found that almost half of all American adults attempt to lose weight through dieting, including 66.7% of obese adults and 26.5% of normal weight or underweight adults. Dieters who are overweight (but not obese), who are normal weight, or who are underweight may have an increased mortality rate as a result of dieting.\nHistory.\nThe word \"diet\" comes from the Greek \"\u03b4\u03af\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1 (diaita)\", which represents a notion of a whole way healthy lifestyle including both mental and physical health, rather than a narrow weight-loss regimen.\nOne of the first dietitians was the English doctor George Cheyne. He himself was tremendously overweight and would constantly eat large quantities of rich food and drink. He began a meatless diet, taking only milk and vegetables, and soon regained his health. He began publicly recommending his diet for everyone who was obese. In 1724, he wrote \"An Essay of Health and Long Life\", in which he advises exercise and fresh air and avoiding luxury foods.\nThe Scottish military surgeon, John Rollo, published \"Notes of a Diabetic Case\" in 1797. It described the benefits of a meat diet for those with diabetes, basing this recommendation on Matthew Dobson's discovery of glycosuria in diabetes mellitus. By means of Dobson's testing procedure (for glucose in the urine) Rollo worked out a diet that had success for what is now called type 2 diabetes.\nThe first popular diet was \"Banting\", named after the English undertaker William Banting. In 1863, he wrote a booklet called \"Letter on Corpulence, Addressed to the Public\", which contained the particular plan for the diet he had successfully followed. His own diet was four meals per day, consisting of meat, greens, fruits, and dry wine. The emphasis was on avoiding sugar, sweet foods, starch, beer, milk and butter. Banting's pamphlet was popular for years to come, and would be used as a model for modern diets. The pamphlet's popularity was such that the question \"Do you bant?\" referred to his method, and eventually to dieting in general. His booklet remains in print as of 2007.\nThe first weight-loss book to promote calorie counting, and the first weight-loss book to become a bestseller, was the 1918 \"\" by American physician and columnist Lulu Hunt Peters.\nIt was estimated that over 1000 weight-loss diets have been developed up to 2014.\nTypes.\nA restricted diet is most commonly pursued by those who want to lose weight. Some people follow a diet to gain weight (such as people who are underweight or who are attempting to gain more muscle). Diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight or to improve health.\nLow-fat.\nLow-fat diets involve the reduction of the percentage of fat in one's diet. Calorie consumption is reduced because less fat is consumed. Diets of this type include NCEP Step I and II. A meta-analysis of 16 trials of 2\u201312\u00a0months' duration found that low-fat diets (without intentional restriction of caloric intake) resulted in average weight loss of over habitual eating.\nA low-fat, plant-based diet has been found to improve control of weight, blood sugar levels, and cardiovascular health.\nLow-calorie.\nLow-calorie diets usually produce an energy deficit of 500\u20131,000 calories per day, which can result in a weight loss per week. The National Institutes of Health reviewed 34 randomized controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of low-calorie diets. They found that these diets lowered total body mass by 8% in the short term, over 3\u201312 months. Women doing low-calorie diets should have at least 1,000 calories per day and men should have approximately 1,200 calories per day. These caloric intake values vary depending on additional factors, such as age and weight.\nVery low-calorie.\nVery low calorie diets provide 200\u2013800 calories per day, maintaining protein intake but limiting calories from both fat and carbohydrates. They subject the body to starvation and produce an average loss of per week. \"2-4-6-8\", a popular diet of this variety, follows a four-day cycle in which only 200 calories are consumed the first day, 400 the second day, 600 the third day, 800 the fourth day, and then totally fasting, after which the cycle repeats. There is some evidence that these diets results in considerable weight loss. These diets are not recommended for general use and should be reserved for the management of obesity as they are associated with adverse side effects such as loss of lean muscle mass, increased risks of gout, and electrolyte imbalances. People attempting these diets must be monitored closely by a physician to prevent complications.\nThe concept of crash dieting is to drastically reduce calories, using a very-low-calorie diet. Crash dieting can be highly dangerous because it can cause various kind of issues for the human body. Crash dieting can produce weight loss but without professional supervision all along, the extreme reduction in calories and potential unbalance in the diet's composition can lead to detrimental effects, including sudden death.\nFasting.\nFasting is the act of intentional taking a long time interval between meals. Lengthy fasting (multiple days in a week) might be dangerous due to the risk of malnutrition. During prolonged fasting or very low calorie diets the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the brain, causes the body to deplete its glycogen stores. Once glycogen is depleted the body begins to fuel the brain using ketones, while also metabolizing body protein (including but not limited to skeletal muscle) to be used to synthesize sugars for use as energy by the rest of the body. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting, although some dispute this. The use of short-term fasting, or various forms of intermittent fasting, have been used as a form of dieting to circumvent the issues of long fasting.\nIntermittent fasting commonly takes the form of periodic fasting, alternate-day fasting, time-restricted feeding, and/or religious fasting. It can be a form of reduced-calorie dieting but pertains entirely to when the metabolism is activated during the day for digestion. The changes to eating habits on a regular basis do not have to be severe or absolutely restrictive to see benefits to cardiovascular health, such as improved glucose metabolism, reduced inflammation, and reduced blood pressure. Studies have suggested that for people in intensive care, an intermittent fasting regimen might \"[preserve] energy supply to vital organs and tissues... [and] powerfully activates cell-protective and cellular repair pathways, including autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defenses, which may promote resilience to cellular stress.\" The effects of decreased serum glucose and depleted hepatic glycogen causing the body to switch to ketogenic metabolism are similar to the effects of reduced carbohydrate-based diets. There is evidence demonstrating profound metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting in rodents. However, evidence is lacking or contradictory in humans and requires further investigation, especially over the long-term. Some evidence suggests that intermittent restriction of caloric intake has no weight-loss advantages over continuous calorie restriction plans. For adults, fasting diets appear to be safe and tolerable, however there is a possibility that periods of fasting and hunger could lead to overeating and to weight regain after the fasting period. Adverse effects of fasting are often moderate and include halitosis, fatigue, weakness, and headaches. Fasting diets may be harmful to children and the elderly.\nExclusion Diet.\nThis type of diet is based on the restriction of specific foods or food groups. Examples include gluten-free, Paleo, plant-based, and Mediterranean diets.\nPlant-based diets include vegetarian and vegan diets, and can range from the simple exclusion of meat products to diets that only include raw vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, and sprouted grains. Exclusion of animal products can reduce the intake of certain nutrients, which might lead to nutritional deficiencies of protein, iron, zinc, calcium, and vitamins D and B12. Therefore, long term implementation of a plant-based diet requires effective counseling and nutritional supplementation as necessary. Plant-based diets are effective for short-term treatment of overweight and obesity, likely due to the high consumption of low energy density foods. However, evidence for long-term efficacy is limited.\nThe Paleo diet includes foods that it identifies as having been available to Paleolithic peoples including meat, nuts, eggs, some oils, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Overall, it is high in protein and moderate in fats and carbohydrates. Some limited evidence suggests various health benefits and effective weight loss with this diet. However, similar to the plant-based diet, the Paleo diet has potential nutritional deficiency risks, specifically with vitamin D, calcium, and iodine.\nGluten-free diets are often used for weight loss but little has been studied about the efficacy of this diet and metabolic mechanism for its effectiveness is unclear.\nThe Mediterranean diet is characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole-grain cereals, seafood, olive oil, and nuts. Red meat, dairy and alcohol are only recommended in moderation. Studies show that the Mediterranean diet is associated with short term as well as long term weight loss in addition to health and metabolic benefits.\nDetox.\nDetox diets are promoted with unsubstantiated claims that they can eliminate \"toxins\" from the human body. Many of these diets use herbs or celery and other juicy low-calorie vegetables. Detox diets can include fasting or exclusion (as in juice fasting). Detox diets tend to result in short-term weight loss (because of calorie restriction), followed by weight gain.\nEnvironmentally sustainable.\nAnother kind of diet focuses not on the dieter's health effects, but on its environment. The One Blue Dot plan of the BDA offers recommendations towards reducing diets' environmental impacts, by:\nEffectiveness.\nSeveral diets are effective for short-term weight loss for obese individuals, with diet success most predicted by adherence and little effect resulting from the type or brand of diet. As weight maintenance depends on calorie intake, diets emphasising certain macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.) have been shown to be no more effective than one another and no more effective than diets that maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions (e.g. low-fat milk, or less salad dressing). A meta-analysis of six randomized controlled trials found no difference between low-calorie, low-carbohydrate, and low-fat diets in terms of short-term weight loss, with a 2\u20134 kilogram weight loss over 12\u201318 months in all studies. Diets that severely restrict calorie intake do not lead to long term weight loss. Extreme diets may, in some cases, lead to malnutrition.\nA major challenge regarding weight loss and dieting relates to compliance. While dieting can effectively promote weight loss in the short term, the intervention is hard to maintain over time and suppresses skeletal muscle thermogenesis. Suppressed thermogenesis accelerates weight regain once the diet stops, unless that phase is accompanied by a well-timed exercise intervention, as described by the Summermatter cycle. Most diet studies do not assess long-term weight loss.\nSome studies have found that, on average, short-term dieting results in a \"meaningful\" long-term weight-loss, although limited because of gradual 1 to 2\u00a0kg/year weight regain. Because people who do not participate in weight-loss programs also tend to gain weight over time, and baseline data from such \"untreated\" participants are typically not included in diet studies, it is possible that diets do result in lower weights in the long-term relative to people who do not diet. Others have suggested that dieting is ineffective as a long-term intervention. For each individual, the results will be different, with some even regaining more weight than they lost, while a few others achieve a tremendous loss, so that the \"average weight loss\" of a diet is not indicative of the results other dieters may achieve. A 2001 meta-analysis of 29 American studies found that participants of structured weight-loss programs maintained an average of 23% (3\u00a0kg) of their initial weight loss after five years, representing a sustained 3.2% reduction in body mass. Unfortunately, patients are generally unhappy with weight loss of &lt;10%, and reductions even as high as 10% are insufficient for changing someone with an \"obese\" BMI to a \"normal weight\" BMI.\nPartly because diets do not reliably produce long-term positive health outcomes, some argue against using weight loss as a goal, preferring other measures of health such as improvements in cardiovascular biomarkers, sometimes called a Health at Every Size (HAES) approach or a \"weight neutral\" approach.\nLong term losses from dieting are best maintained with continuing professional support, long term increases in physical activity, the use of anti-obesity medications, continued use of meal replacements, and additional periods of dieting to undo weight regain. The most effective approach to weight loss is an in-person, high-intensity, comprehensive lifestyle intervention: overweight or obese adults should maintain regular (at least monthly) contact with a trained interventionalist who can help them engage in exercise, monitor their body weight, and reduce their calorie consumption. Even with high-intensity, comprehensive lifestyle interventions (consisting of diet, physical exercise, and bimonthly or even more frequent contact with trained interventionists), gradual weight regain of 1\u20132\u00a0kg/year still occurs. For patients at high medical risk, bariatric surgery or medications may be warranted in addition to the lifestyle intervention, as dieting by itself may not lead to sustained weight loss.\nMany studies overestimate the benefits of calorie restriction because the studies confound exercise and diet (testing the effects of diet and exercise as a combined intervention, rather than the effects of diet alone).\nAdverse effects.\nIncreased mortality rate.\nA number of studies have found that intentional weight loss is associated with an increase in mortality in people without weight-related health problems. A 2009 meta-analysis of 26 studies found that \"intentional weight loss had a small benefit for individuals classified as unhealthy (with obesity-related risk factors), especially unhealthy obese, but appeared to be associated with slightly increased mortality for healthy individuals, and for those who were overweight but not obese.\"\nDietary supplements.\nDue to extreme or unbalanced diets, dietary supplements are sometimes taken in an attempt to replace missing vitamins or minerals. While some supplements could be helpful for people eating an unbalanced diet (if replacing essential nutrients, for example), overdosing on any dietary supplement can cause a range of side effects depending on the supplement and dose that is taken. Supplements should not replace foods that are important to a healthy diet.\nEating disorders.\nIn an editorial for \"Psychological Medicine\", George Hsu concludes that dieting is likely to lead to the development of an eating disorder in the presence of certain risk factors. A 2006 study found that dieting and unhealthy weight-control behaviors were predictive of obesity and eating disorders five years later, with the authors recommending a \"shift away from dieting and drastic weight-control measures toward the long-term implementation of healthful eating and physical activity\".\nMechanism.\nWhen the body is expending more energy than it is consuming (e.g. when exercising), the body's cells rely on internally stored energy sources, such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is glycogen (by glycogenolysis). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested macronutrients, mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins lipolysis, the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or fat cells, are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, which can be used to generate energy. The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.\nSet-Point Theory.\nThe Set-Point Theory, first introduced in 1953, postulated that each body has a preprogrammed fixed weight, with regulatory mechanisms to compensate. This theory was quickly adopted and used to explain failures in developing effective and sustained weight loss procedures. A 2019 systematic review of multiple weight change procedures, including alternate day fasting and time-restricted feeding but also exercise and overeating, found systematic \"energetic errors\" for all these procedures. This shows that the body cannot precisely compensate for errors in energy/calorie intake, countering the Set-Point Theory and potentially explaining both weight loss and weight gain such as obesity. This review was conducted on short-term studies, therefore such a mechanism cannot be excluded in the long term, as evidence is currently lacking on this timeframe.\nMethods.\nMeal timing.\nA meal timing schedule is known to be an important factor of any diet. Recent evidence suggest that new scheduling strategies, such as intermittent fasting or skipping meals, and strategically placed snacks before meals, may be recommendable to reduce cardiovascular risks as part of a broader lifestyle and dietary change.\nFood diary.\nA 2008 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that dieters who kept a daily food diary (or diet journal), lost twice as much weight as those who did not keep a food log, suggesting that if a person records their eating, they are more aware of what they consume and therefore eat fewer calories.\nWater.\nA 2009 review found limited evidence suggesting that encouraging water consumption and substituting energy-free beverages for energy-containing beverages (i.e., reducing caloric intake) may facilitate weight management. A 2009 article found that drinking 500\u00a0ml of water prior to meals for a 12-week period resulted in increased long-term weight reduction. (References given in main article.)\nSociety.\nIt is estimated that about 1 out of 3 Americans is dieting at any given time. 85% of dieters are women. Approximately sixty billion dollars are spent every year in the USA on diet products, including \"diet foods\", such as light sodas, gym memberships or specific regimes. 80% of dieters start by themselves, whereas 20% see a professional or join a paid program. The typical dieter attempts 4 tries per year.\nWeight loss groups.\nSome weight loss groups aim to make money, others work as charities. The former include Weight Watchers and Peertrainer. The latter include Overeaters Anonymous, TOPS Club and groups run by local organizations.\nThese organizations' customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on twelve-step programs, while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.\nAttending group meetings for weight reduction programmes rather than receiving one-on-one support may increase the likelihood that obese people will lose weight. Those who participated in groups had more treatment time and were more likely to lose enough weight to improve their health. Study authors suggested that one explanation for the difference is that group participants spent more time with the clinician (or whoever delivered the programme) than those receiving one-on-one support.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "8463", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8463", "title": "Dubnium", "text": "element with atomic number 105 (Db)\nDubnium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Db and atomic number 105. It is highly radioactive: the most stable known isotope, dubnium-268, has a half-life of about 16 hours. This greatly limits extended research on the element.\nDubnium does not occur naturally on Earth and is produced artificially. The Soviet Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) claimed the first discovery of the element in 1968, followed by the American Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1970. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the Transfermium Working Group, formed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, resulting in credit for the discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was formally named \"dubnium\" in 1997 after the town of Dubna, the site of the JINR.\nTheoretical research establishes dubnium as a member of group 5 in the 6d series of transition metals, placing it under vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Dubnium should share most properties, such as its valence electron configuration and having a dominant +5 oxidation state, with the other group 5 elements, with a few anomalies due to relativistic effects. A limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has confirmed this.\nDiscovery.\nBackground.\nUranium, element 92, is the heaviest element to occur in significant quantities in nature; heavier elements can only be practically produced by synthesis. The first synthesis of a new element\u2014neptunium, element 93\u2014was achieved in 1940 by a team of researchers in the United States. In the following years, American scientists synthesized the elements up to mendelevium, element 101, which was synthesized in 1955. From element 102, the priority of discoveries was contested between American and Soviet physicists. Their rivalry resulted in a race for new elements and credit for their discoveries, later named the Transfermium Wars.\nReports.\nThe first report of the discovery of element 105 came from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Soviet Union, in April 1968. The scientists bombarded 243Am with a beam of 22Ne ions, and reported 9.4\u00a0MeV (with a half-life of 0.1\u20133 seconds) and 9.7\u00a0MeV (\"t\"1/2\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.05\u00a0s) alpha activities followed by alpha activities similar to those of either 256103 or 257103. Based on prior theoretical predictions, the two activity lines were assigned to 261105 and 260105, respectively.\nAm + Ne \u2192 265\u2212\"x\"105 + \"x\" (\"x\" = 4, 5)\nAfter observing the alpha decays of element 105, the researchers aimed to observe spontaneous fission (SF) of the element and study the resulting fission fragments. They published a paper in February 1970, reporting multiple examples of two such activities, with half-lives of 14\u00a0ms and . They assigned the former activity to 242mfAm and ascribed the latter activity to an isotope of element 105. They suggested that it was unlikely that this activity could come from a transfer reaction instead of element 105, because the yield ratio for this reaction was significantly lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction, in accordance with theoretical predictions. To establish that this activity was not from a (22Ne,\"x\"n) reaction, the researchers bombarded a 243Am target with 18O ions; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little SF activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, in line with theoretical data. The researchers concluded that the activities observed came from SF of element 105.\nIn April 1970, a team at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL), in Berkeley, California, United States, claimed to have synthesized element 105 by bombarding californium-249 with nitrogen-15 ions, with an alpha activity of 9.1\u00a0MeV. To ensure this activity was not from a different reaction, the team attempted other reactions: bombarding 249Cf with 14N, Pb with 15N, and Hg with 15N. They stated no such activity was found in those reactions. The characteristics of the daughter nuclei matched those of 256103, implying that the parent nuclei were of 260105.\nCf + N \u2192 260105 + 4 \nThese results did not confirm the JINR findings regarding the 9.4\u00a0MeV or 9.7\u00a0MeV alpha decay of 260105, leaving only 261105 as a possibly produced isotope.\nJINR then attempted another experiment to create element 105, published in a report in May 1970. They claimed that they had synthesized more nuclei of element 105 and that the experiment confirmed their previous work. According to the paper, the isotope produced by JINR was probably 261105, or possibly 260105. This report included an initial chemical examination: the thermal gradient version of the gas-chromatography method was applied to demonstrate that the chloride of what had formed from the SF activity nearly matched that of niobium pentachloride, rather than hafnium tetrachloride. The team identified a 2.2-second SF activity in a volatile chloride portraying eka-tantalum properties, and inferred that the source of the SF activity must have been element 105.\nIn June 1970, JINR made improvements on their first experiment, using a purer target and reducing the intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This time, they were able to find 9.1\u00a0MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 256103 or 257103, implying that the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.\nNaming controversy.\nJINR did not propose a name after their first report claiming synthesis of element 105, which would have been the usual practice. This led LBL to believe that JINR did not have enough experimental data to back their claim. After collecting more data, JINR proposed the name \"bohrium\" (Bo) in honor of the Danish nuclear physicist Niels Bohr, a founder of the theories of atomic structure and quantum theory; they soon changed their proposal to \"nielsbohrium\" (Ns) to avoid confusion with boron. Another proposed name was \"dubnium\". When LBL first announced their synthesis of element 105, they proposed that the new element be named \"hahnium\" (Ha) after the German chemist Otto Hahn, the \"father of nuclear chemistry\", thus creating an element naming controversy.\nIn the early 1970s, both teams reported synthesis of the next element, element 106, but did not suggest names. JINR suggested establishing an international committee to clarify the discovery criteria. This proposal was accepted in 1974 and a neutral joint group formed. Neither team showed interest in resolving the conflict through a third party, so the leading scientists of LBL\u2014Albert Ghiorso and Glenn Seaborg\u2014traveled to Dubna in 1975 and met with the leading scientists of JINR\u2014Georgy Flerov, Yuri Oganessian, and others\u2014to try to resolve the conflict internally and render the neutral joint group unnecessary; after two hours of discussions, this failed. The joint neutral group never assembled to assess the claims, and the conflict remained unresolved. In 1979, IUPAC suggested systematic element names to be used as placeholders until permanent names were established; under it, element 105 would be \"unnilpentium\", from the Latin roots \"un-\" and \"nil-\" and the Greek root \"pent-\" (meaning \"one\", \"zero\", and \"five\", respectively, the digits of the atomic number). Both teams ignored it as they did not wish to weaken their outstanding claims.\nIn 1981, the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI; \"Society for Heavy Ion Research\") in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany, claimed synthesis of element 107; their report came out five years after the first report from JINR but with greater precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. GSI acknowledged JINR's efforts by suggesting the name \"nielsbohrium\" for the new element. JINR did not suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to determine its discoverers first.\nIn 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) formed a Transfermium Working Group (TWG) to assess discoveries and establish final names for the controversial elements. The party held meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognition of an element, and in 1991, they finished the work on assessing discoveries and disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 LBL experiment, closely followed by the June 1970 JINR experiment, so credit for the discovery of the element should be shared between the two teams.\nLBL said that the input from JINR was overrated in the review. They claimed JINR was only able to unambiguously demonstrate the synthesis of element 105 a year after they did. JINR and GSI endorsed the report.\nIn 1994, IUPAC published a recommendation on naming the disputed elements. For element 105, they proposed \"joliotium\" (Jl) after the French physicist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie, a contributor to the development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called nobelium. This recommendation was criticized by the American scientists for several reasons. Firstly, their suggestions were scrambled: the names \"rutherfordium\" and \"hahnium\", originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were respectively reassigned to elements 106 and 108. Secondly, elements 104 and 105 were given names favored by JINR, despite earlier recognition of LBL as an equal co-discoverer for both of them. Thirdly and most importantly, IUPAC rejected the name \"seaborgium\" for element 106, having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person, even though the 1993 report had given the LBL team the sole credit for its discovery.\nIn 1995, IUPAC abandoned the controversial rule and established a committee of national representatives aimed at finding a compromise. They suggested \"seaborgium\" for element 106 in exchange for the removal of all the other American proposals, except for the established name \"lawrencium\" for element 103. The equally entrenched name \"nobelium\" for element 102 was replaced by \"flerovium\" after Georgy Flerov, following the recognition by the 1993 report that that element had been first synthesized in Dubna. This was rejected by American scientists and the decision was retracted. The name \"flerovium\" was later used for element 114.\nIn 1996, IUPAC held another meeting, reconsidered all names in hand, and accepted another set of recommendations; it was approved and published in 1997. Element 105 was named \"dubnium\" (Db), after Dubna in Russia, the location of the JINR; the American suggestions were used for elements 102, 103, 104, and 106. The name \"dubnium\" had been used for element 104 in the previous IUPAC recommendation. The American scientists \"reluctantly\" approved this decision. IUPAC pointed out that the Berkeley laboratory had already been recognized several times, in the naming of berkelium, californium, and americium, and that the acceptance of the names \"rutherfordium\" and \"seaborgium\" for elements 104 and 106 should be offset by recognizing JINR's contributions to the discovery of elements 104, 105, and 106.\nEven after 1997, LBL still sometimes used the name \"hahnium\" for element 105 in their own material, doing so as recently as 2014. However, the problem was resolved in the literature as Jens Volker Kratz, editor of \"Radiochimica Acta\", refused to accept papers not using the 1997 IUPAC nomenclature.\nIsotopes.\nDubnium, having an atomic number of 105, is a superheavy element; like all elements with such high atomic numbers, it is very unstable. The longest-lasting known isotope of dubnium, 268Db, has a half-life of around a day. No stable isotopes have been seen, and a 2012 calculation by JINR suggested that the half-lives of all dubnium isotopes would not significantly exceed a day. Dubnium can only be obtained by artificial production.\nThe short half-life of dubnium limits experimentation. This is exacerbated by the fact that the most stable isotopes are the hardest to synthesize. Elements with a lower atomic number have stable isotopes with a lower neutron\u2013proton ratio than those with higher atomic number, meaning that the target and beam nuclei that could be employed to create the superheavy element have fewer neutrons than needed to form these most stable isotopes. (Different techniques based on rapid neutron capture and transfer reactions are being considered as of the 2010s, but those based on the collision of a large and small nucleus still dominate research in the area.)\nOnly a few atoms of 268Db can be produced in each experiment, and thus the measured lifetimes vary significantly during the process. As of 2022, following additional experiments performed at the JINR's Superheavy Element Factory (which started operations in 2019), the half-life of 268Db is measured to be hours. The second most stable isotope, 270Db, has been produced in even smaller quantities: three atoms in total, with lifetimes of 33.4 h, 1.3 h, and 1.6 h. These two are the heaviest isotopes of dubnium to date, and both were produced as a result of decay of the heavier nuclei 288Mc and 294Ts rather than directly, because the experiments that yielded them were originally designed in Dubna for 48Ca beams. For its mass, 48Ca has by far the greatest neutron excess of all practically stable nuclei, both quantitative and relative, which correspondingly helps synthesize superheavy nuclei with more neutrons, but this gain is compensated by the decreased likelihood of fusion for high atomic numbers.\nPredicted properties.\nAccording to the periodic law, dubnium should belong to group 5, with vanadium, niobium, and tantalum. Several studies have investigated the properties of element 105 and found that they generally agreed with the predictions of the periodic law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. These properties have remained challenging to measure for several reasons: the difficulties of production of superheavy atoms, the low rates of production, which only allows for microscopic scales, requirements for a radiochemistry laboratory to test the atoms, short half-lives of those atoms, and the presence of many unwanted activities apart from those of synthesis of superheavy atoms. So far, studies have only been performed on single atoms.\nAtomic and physical.\nA direct relativistic effect is that as the atomic numbers of elements increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus as a result of an increase of electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for the outermost s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though in dubnium they are not occupied): for example, the 7s orbital contracts by 25% in size and is stabilized by 2.6\u00a0eV.\nA more indirect effect is that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move in larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are slightly more difficult to extract than its 6d electrons.\nAnother effect is the spin\u2013orbit interaction, particularly spin\u2013orbit splitting, which splits the 6d subshell\u2014the azimuthal quantum number \u2113 of a d\u00a0shell is 2\u2014into two subshells, with four of the ten orbitals having their \u2113 lowered to 3/2 and six raised to 5/2. All ten energy levels are raised; four of them are lower than the other six. (The three 6d electrons normally occupy the lowest energy levels, 6d3/2.)\nA singly ionized atom of dubnium (Db+) should lose a 6d electron compared to a neutral atom; the doubly (Db2+) or triply (Db3+) ionized atoms of dubnium should eliminate 7s electrons, unlike its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, dubnium is still expected to have five valence electrons. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of tantalum, and Db3+ is expected to have two 6d, rather than 7s, electrons remaining, the resulting +3 oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of tantalum. The ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum +5 oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of tantalum and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium's chemistry.\nAtoms of dubnium in the solid state should arrange themselves in a body-centered cubic configuration, like the previous group 5 elements. The predicted density of dubnium is 21.6\u00a0g/cm3.\nChemical.\nComputational chemistry is simplest in gas-phase chemistry, in which interactions between molecules may be ignored as negligible. Multiple authors have researched dubnium pentachloride; calculations show it to be consistent with the periodic laws by exhibiting the properties of a compound of a group 5 element. For example, the molecular orbital levels indicate that dubnium uses three 6d electron levels as expected. Compared to its tantalum analog, dubnium pentachloride is expected to show increased covalent character: a decrease in the effective charge on an atom and an increase in the overlap population (between orbitals of dubnium and chlorine).\nCalculations of solution chemistry indicate that the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, will be more stable than those of niobium and tantalum and the +3 and +4 states will be less stable. The tendency towards hydrolysis of cations with the highest oxidation state should continue to decrease within group 5 but is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have shown a reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than tantalum.\nExperimental chemistry.\nExperimental results of the chemistry of dubnium date back to 1974 and 1976. JINR researchers used a thermochromatographic system and concluded that the volatility of dubnium bromide was less than that of niobium bromide and about the same as that of hafnium bromide. It is not certain that the detected fission products confirmed that the parent was indeed element 105. These results may imply that dubnium behaves more like hafnium than niobium.\nThe next studies on the chemistry of dubnium were conducted in 1988, in Berkeley. They examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was then compared with that of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces; the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. Surprisingly, the behavior on extraction from mixed nitric and hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketone differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that complexing behavior could not be predicted purely from simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.\nThis prompted further exploration of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium. Various labs jointly conducted thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and protactinium were extracted from concentrated hydrochloric acid; after mixing with lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. Dubnium showed behavior different from that of tantalum but similar to that of niobium and its pseudohomolog protactinium at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 moles per liter. This similarity to the two elements suggested that the formed complex was either DbOX4- or [Db(OH)2X4]-. After extraction experiments of dubnium from hydrogen bromide into diisobutyl carbinol (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than either protactinium or niobium. This was explained as an increasing tendency to form non\u2010extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation\u2010exchange columns with \u03b1\u2010hydroxyisobutyrate, like the group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested that dubnium would extract nearly as well as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.\nThe first isothermal gas chromatography experiments were performed in 1992 with 262Db (half-life 35 seconds). The volatilities for niobium and tantalum were similar within error limits, but dubnium appeared to be significantly less volatile. It was postulated that traces of oxygen in the system might have led to formation of DbOBr3, which was predicted to be less volatile than DbBr5. Later experiments in 1996 showed that group 5 chlorides were more volatile than the corresponding bromides, with the exception of tantalum, presumably due to formation of TaOCl3. Later volatility studies of chlorides of dubnium and niobium as a function of controlled partial pressures of oxygen showed that formation of oxychlorides and general volatility are dependent on concentrations of oxygen. The oxychlorides were shown to be less volatile than the chlorides.\nIn 2004\u201305, researchers from Dubna and Livermore identified a new dubnium isotope, 268Db, as a fivefold alpha decay product of the newly created element 115. This new isotope proved to be long-lived enough to allow further chemical experimentation, with a half-life of over a day. In the 2004 experiment, a thin layer with dubnium was removed from the surface of the target and dissolved in aqua regia with tracers and a lanthanum carrier, from which various +3, +4, and +5 species were precipitated on adding ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was washed and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, where it converted to nitrate form and was then dried on a film and counted. Mostly containing a +5 species, which was immediately assigned to dubnium, it also had a +4 species; based on that result, the team decided that additional chemical separation was needed. In 2005, the experiment was repeated, with the final product being hydroxide rather than nitrate precipitate, which was processed further in both Livermore (based on reverse phase chromatography) and Dubna (based on anion exchange chromatography). The +5 species was effectively isolated; dubnium appeared three times in tantalum-only fractions and never in niobium-only fractions. It was noted that these experiments were insufficient to draw conclusions about the general chemical profile of dubnium.\nIn 2009, at the JAEA tandem accelerator in Japan, dubnium was processed in nitric and hydrofluoric acid solution, at concentrations where niobium forms NbOF4- and tantalum forms TaF6-. Dubnium's behavior was close to that of niobium but not tantalum; it was thus deduced that dubnium formed DbOF4-. From the available information, it was concluded that dubnium often behaved like niobium, sometimes like protactinium, but rarely like tantalum.\nIn 2021, the volatile heavy group 5 oxychlorides MOCl3 (M = Nb, Ta, Db) were experimentally studied at the JAEA tandem accelerator. The trend in volatilities was found to be NbOCl3 &gt; TaOCl3 \u2265 DbOCl3, so that dubnium behaves in line with periodic trends.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Like monosaccharides, disaccharides are white solids that are soluble in water. Common examples are sucrose, lactose, and maltose.\nRelated to disaccharides are other carbohydrates: monosaccharides, their precursors, and the larger oligosaccharides and polysaccharides). C\nThe joining of monosaccharides into a double sugar happens by a condensation reaction, shown here in the case of two hexoses:\nBreaking apart a double sugar into its two monosaccharides is accomplished by hydrolysis with the help of a type of enzyme called a disaccharidase. As building the larger sugar ejects a water molecule, breaking it down consumes a water molecule. These reactions are vital in metabolism. Each disaccharide is broken down with the help of a corresponding disaccharidase (sucrase, lactase, and maltase).\nClassification.\nThere are two functionally different classes of disaccharides: \nFormation.\nThe formation of a disaccharide molecule from two monosaccharide molecules proceeds by displacing a hydroxy group from one molecule and a hydrogen nucleus (a proton) from the other, so that the new vacant bonds on the monosaccharides join the two monomers together. Because of the removal of the water molecule from the product, the term of convenience for such a process is \"dehydration reaction\" (also \"condensation reaction\" or \"dehydration synthesis\"). For example, milk sugar (lactose) is a disaccharide made by condensation of one molecule of each of the monosaccharides glucose and galactose, whereas the disaccharide sucrose in sugar cane and sugar beet, is a condensation product of glucose and fructose. Maltose, another common disaccharide, is condensed from two glucose molecules.\nThe dehydration reaction that bonds monosaccharides into disaccharides (and also bonds monosaccharides into more complex polysaccharides) forms what are called glycosidic bonds.\nCharacteristic reactions.\nDisaccharides can serve as functional groups by forming glycosidic bonds with other organic compounds, forming glycosides and glycoconjugates. \nDisaccarides characteristically undergo hydrolysis to give monosaccharides.\nSome disaccharides can be hydrogenated to give useful disaccharide alcohols with retention of the acetal linkage. Commercial products include lactitol, isomalt, and maltitol. Isomalt production begins with a bacterial promoted conversion of sucrose to isomaltulose.\nSucrose undergoes acid catalyzed poly-dehydration to give hydroxymethylfurfural.\nAssimilation.\nDigestion of disaccharides involves breakdown into monosaccharides.\nCommon disaccharides.\nMaltose, cellobiose, and chitobiose are hydrolysis products of the polysaccharides starch, cellulose, and chitin, respectively.\nLess common disaccharides include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first five feet contain either two long syllables, a spondee (\u2013 \u2013), or a long syllable followed by two short syllables, a dactyl (\u2013\u1d17\u1d17). However, the last foot contains either a spondee or a long syllable followed by one short syllable, a trochee(\u2013 \u1d17)12019. The six feet and their variation is symbolically represented below:\nThe hexameter is traditionally associated with classical epic poetry in both Greek1743 and Latin. Consequently, it has been considered to be \"the\" grand style of Western classical poetry. Examples of epics in hexameter are Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\"19, Apollonius of Rhodes's \"Argonautica\", Virgil's \"Aeneid\", Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", Lucan's \"Pharsalia\", Valerius Flaccus's \"Argonautica\", and Statius's \"Thebaid\".\nHowever, this meter had a wide use outside of epic. Greek works in dactylic hexameter include Hesiod's didactic \"Works and Days\" and \"Theogony\"19, some of Theocritus's \"Idylls\", and Callimachus's hymns. In Latin famous works include Lucretius's philosophical , Virgil's \"Eclogues\" and \"Georgics\", book 10 of Columella's manual on agriculture, as well as satirical works of Lucilius, Horace, Persius, and Juvenal. Later the hexameter continued to be used in Christian times, for example in the of the 5th-century Irish poet Sedulius and Bernard of Cluny's 12th-century satire among many others.\nHexameters also form part of elegiac poetry in both languages, the elegiac couplet being a dactylic hexameter line paired with a dactylic pentameter line45104. This form of verse was used for love poetry by Propertius, Tibullus, and Ovid, for Ovid's letters from exile, and for many of the epigrams of Martial.\nStructure.\nDactylic hexameter poetry consists of lines, which are divided into feet and further divided into syllables.120.\nFeet.\nA hexameter verse contains six feet439019. The first five feet can be either a dactyl or a spondee439119. However, because Latin is much richer in long syllables than Greek, spondaic feet are more common in Latin hexameter91. In both Greek and Latin hexameter the fifth foot is usually a dactyl, and a spondee is also rare in the third foot in Greek hexameter4391-92. The sixth foot can be filled by either a trochee or a spondee4391. Thus a dactylic hexameter line is scanned as follows:\n \u2014 \u1d17 \u1d17 | \u2014 \u1d17 \u1d17 | \u2014 \u1d17 \u1d17 | \u2014 \u1d17 \u1d17 | \u2014 \u1d17 \u1d17 | \u2014 \u00d7\nWhere \"\u2014\" represents an accented (hard) syllable, \"\u1d17\" represents an unaccented (soft) syllable, \"\u1d17 \u1d17\" represents either two soft syllables or one hard syllable (poet's option), and in this case \"\u00d7\" represents 'anything goes' (including a silent pause).\nAn example of this in Latin is the first line of Virgil's \"Aeneid\"1.1:\n \"I sing of arms, and of the man who first from the shores of Troy ...\"\nThe scansion is generally marked as follows, by placing long and short marks above the central vowel of each syllable:\nIn dactylic verse, short syllables always come in pairs, so words such as \"soldiers\" or \"more easily\" cannot be used in a hexameter, although the substitutes \"warrior\" and \"easier\" could be.\nSyllables.\nUnlike English verse, which is based on stress, ancient Greek and Latin poetry is based on the length, i.e. relative duration, of a syllable1191022. In scansion only the sounds are meaningful, and word boundaries do not matter11912.\nIn Greek, a long syllable is called () and a short syllable is called (). In Latin the terms are and .\nGreek.\nIn Greek, a syllable is long if it contains a long vowel, a diphthong, or two consonants follow the vowel(s) of the syllable9711922. That is to say, a syllable with a short vowel is scanned as long as it contains a long vowel, a diphthong, or if it is closed; and a syllable is closed only if it ends with a consonant, otherwise it is open12.\nFor example, all syllables in , , and are long22-23. However, there are exceptions to the rules mentioned above23.\nLatin.\nIn Latin, a syllable is long (by nature) if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong8923 and long (by position) if it contains a short vowel followed by two consonants, even if these are in different words24. For example, all syllables in and are long by nature, whereas , , , and in , are long by position.\nHowever, when a liquid \u2014 l or r \u2014 follows a plosive, a syllable containing a short vowel may remain short by position25. For example, could be scanned either as having a short first syllable or as having a long first syllable 89.\nIn scansion the letter \"h\" is ignored24, and \"qu\" counts as a single consonant24. So, for example in the phrase the syllable \"et\" remains short, and in the word the first syllable remains short too.\nThe semiconsonantal \"i\" and \"u\" are scanned as consonants24. For example, in and , \"i\" is considered a consonant, pronounced like the English \"y\". Thus has three syllables and has two. But, in the first \"I\" is a vowel and forms a separate syllable38. Additionally, an \"i\" between two or more vowels stands almost without exception for a double consonant39; so, for example , standing for has two syllables39.\nIn some editions of Latin texts the consonant \"v\" is written as \"u\", in which case \"u\" is also often consonantal. This can sometimes cause ambiguity; e.g., in the word (= ) \"he rolls\" the second \"u\" is a consonant, but in (= ) \"he wanted\" the second \"u\" is a vowel.\nElision.\nIn Latin, when a word ends in a vowel or -m and is followed by a word starting with a vowel or h, the last vowel is usually suppressed or elided27. For example, 27.\nIn Greek, short vowels elide freely24; however, long vowels are not elided, though they may be shortened in some cases24: E.g. ().\nIn modern Greek writing the elision is shown by an apostrophe. For example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n which caused countless sufferings for the Achaeans\u2014\u200a\nThe Greek style of not eliding a long vowel is sometimes imitated in Latin for special effect, for example, \"with womanly wailing\" (\"Aen\". 9.477).\nWhen a vowel is elided, it does not count in the scansion24. So, for the purposes of scansion, has four syllables.\nCaesura.\nA caesura is a word break in the middle of a foot or metron25. In Greek hexameter there is a caesura after i) the first syllable of the 3rd foot, a strong or masculine caesura, ii) the second syllable of a dactyl in the 3rd foot, a weak or feminine caesura, or iii) the first syllable of the 4th foot44; the first two being more common than the last1214493.\nIn Latin hexameter the weak caesura is rarer than in Greek hexameter94,96. On the one hand, in Virgil the strong caesura is found in ca. 85% of the time124.\nAn example of a weak caesura can be found from the first line of Homer's \"Odyssey\"44:\n\n\"Tell me, Muse, of the man of many wiles, who very much\"\nAnd an example of a strong caesura follows on the next line of Odyssey44:\n\n\"wandered, after having sacked the sacred citadel of Troy.\"\nIn Latin (but not in Greek, as the above example shows), a feminine caesura in the 3rd foot is usually accompanied with masculine caesuras in the 2nd and especially in the 4th feet96:\n2.3\n\"You are bidding me, o queen, to renew an unspeakable sorrow\"\nSometimes caesuras in the 2nd and 4th feet of a line make do, and there is no caesura in the 3rd foot96. For example:\n2.2\n\"then from his high couch Father Aeneas began as follows\"\nIn Greek.\nThe hexameter was first used by early Greek poets of the oral tradition, and the most complete extant examples of their works are the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\", which influenced the authors of all later classical epics that survive today. Early epic poetry was also accompanied by music, and pitch changes associated with the accented Greek must have highlighted the melody, though the exact mechanism is still a topic of discussion.\nThe first line of Homer's \"Iliad\" provides an example:\n\n\"Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus' son Achilles\"\nDividing the line into metrical units or feet it can be scanned as follows:\n (-\"de\u014d\" is one syllable)\nThis line also includes a masculine caesura after , a break that separates the line into two parts. Homer employs a feminine caesura more commonly than later writers. An example occurs in \"Iliad\" 1.5:\n\"... and every bird; and the plan of Zeus was fulfilled\"\n\nHomer's hexameters contain a higher proportion of dactyls than later hexameter poetry. They are also characterized by a laxer following of verse principles than later epicists almost invariably adhered to. For example, Homer allows spondaic fifth feet (albeit not often), whereas many later authors do not.\nHomer also altered the forms of words to allow them to fit the hexameter, typically by using a dialectal form: \"ptolis\" is an epic form used instead of the Attic \"polis\" as necessary for the meter. Proper names sometimes take forms to fit the meter, for example \"Pouludamas\" instead of the metrically unviable \"Poludamas\".\nSome lines require a knowledge of the digamma for their scansion, e.g. \"Iliad\" 1.108:\n\n\"you have not yet spoken a good word nor brought one to pass\"\n\nHere the word (\"epos\") was originally (\"wepos\") in Ionian; the digamma, later lost, lengthened the last syllable of the preceding (\"eipas\") and removed the apparent defect in the meter. A digamma also saved the hiatus in the third foot. This example demonstrates the oral tradition of the Homeric epics that flourished before they were written down sometime in the 7th century BC.\nMost of the later rules of hexameter composition have their origins in the methods and practices of Homer.\nIn Latin.\nThe dactylic hexameter was adapted from Greek to Latin91. Though the metre was taken from Greek unaltered, the Latin language has a higher proportion of long syllables than Greek, and so it is by nature more spondaic91. Additionally, the Roman poets did not avoid the weak caesura in the fourth foot as much as the Greeks did98.\nEnnius.\nThe earliest example of hexameter in Latin poetry is the panegyric history of Rome, \"Annales\", by Ennius137, establishing a standard for later Latin epics. Ennius experimented with different kinds of lines, for example, lines with five dactyls:\n\"Then the trumpet with terrifying sound went 'taratantara!'\"\nor lines consisting entirely of spondees:\n\"To him replied the king of Alba Longa\"\nlines without a caesura95:\n\"With scattered long spears the plain gleams and bristles\"\nlines ending in a one-syllable word or in words of more than three syllables99:\n\"A single man, by delaying, restored the situation for us.\"\n\n\"I do not demand gold for myself nor should you give me a price:\nnot buying and selling war, but waging it\"\nor even lines starting with two short syllables92:\n | u u \u2013 | \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013, u u | \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u u | \u2013 \u2013\n\"the blacktail, the rainbow wrasse, the bird wrasse, and the maigre\" (kinds of fish)\nHowever, most of these features were abandoned by later writers or used only occasionally for special effect.\nLater writers.\nLater Republican writers, such as Lucretius, Catullus, and even Cicero, wrote hexameter compositions, and it was at this time that the principles of Latin hexameter were firmly established and followed by later writers such as Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Lucan, and Juvenal. Virgil's opening line for the \"Aeneid\" is a classic example:\n\"I sing of arms and of the man who first from the shores of Troy ...\"\nIn Latin, lines were arranged so that the metrically long syllables \u2014- those occurring at the beginning of a foot -\u2014 often avoided the natural stress of a word. In the earlier feet of a line, meter and stress were expected to clash, while in the last two feet they were expected to coincide, as in above. The coincidence of word accent and meter in the last two feet could be achieved by restricting the last word to one of two or three syllables.\nMost lines (about 85% in Virgil) have a caesura or word division after the first syllable of the 3rd foot, as above . Because of the penultimate accent in Latin, this ensures that the word accent and meter will not coincide in the 3rd foot. But in those lines with a feminine or weak caesura, such as the following, there is inevitably a coincidence of meter and accent in the 3rd foot98:\n\"there follows shouting of men and rattling of ropes\"\nTo offset this, whenever there was a feminine caesura in the 3rd foot, there was usually also a masculine caesura in the 2nd and 4th feet, to ensure that in those feet at least, the word accent and meter did not coincide.\nMetrical effects.\nBy the age of Augustus, poets like Virgil closely followed the rules of the meter and approached it in a highly rhetorical way, looking for effects that can be exploited in skilled recitation. For example, the following line from the \"Aeneid\" (8.596) describes the movement and sound of galloping horses:\n\"with four-footed sound the hoof shakes the crumbling plain\"\nThis line is made up of five dactyls and a closing spondee, an unusual rhythmic arrangement that imitates the described action. A different effect is found in 8.452, where Virgil describes how the blacksmith sons of Vulcan forged Aeneas' shield. The five spondees and the word accents cutting across the verse rhythm give an impression of huge effort:\n\"They with much force raise their arms one after another\"\nA slightly different effect is found in the following line (3.658), describing the terrifying one-eyed giant Polyphemus, blinded by Ulysses. Here again there are five spondees but there are also three elisions, which cause the word accent of all the words but to coincide with the beginning of each foot:\n\"A horrendous huge shapeless monster, whose eye (lit. light) had been removed\"\nA succession of long syllables in some lines indicates slow movement, as in the following example where Aeneas and his companion the Sibyl (a priestess of Apollo) were entering the darkness of the world of the dead:\n\"they were going in the darkness beneath the lonely night through the shadow\"\nThe following example (\"Aeneid\" 2.9) describes how Aeneas is reluctant to begin his narrative, since it is already past midnight. The feminine caesura after without a following 4th-foot caesura ensures that all the last four feet have word accent at the beginning, which is unusual. The monotonous effect is reinforced by the assonance of \"dent ... dent\" and the alliteration of S ... S:\n\n\"And already the moist night is falling from the sky\nand the setting constellations are inviting sleep\"\nDactyls are associated with sleep again in the following unusual line, which describes the activity of a priestess who is feeding a magic serpent (\"Aen.\" 4.486). In this line, there are five dactyls, and every one is accented on the first syllable:\n\"sprinkling moist honey and sleep-inducing poppy\"\nA different technique, at 1.105, is used when describing a ship at sea during a storm. Here Virgil places a single-syllable word at the end of the line. This produces a jarring rhythm that echoes the crash of a large wave against the side of the ship:\n\n\"(The boat) gives its side to the waves; there immediately follows in a heap a steep mountain of water.\"\nThe Roman poet Horace uses a similar trick to highlight the comedic irony in this famous line from his \"Ars Poetica\" (line 139):\n\"The mountains will be in labor, but all that will be born is a ridiculous ... mouse\"\nUsually in Latin the 5th foot of a hexameter is a dactyl. However, in his poem 64, Catullus several times uses a 5th foot spondee, which gives a Greek flavour to his verse, as in this line describing the forested Vale of Tempe in northern Greece:\n\"Tempe, which woods surround, hanging over it\"\nVirgil also occasionally imitates Greek practice, for example, in the first line of his 3rd Eclogue:\n\"Tell me, Damoetas, whose cattle are these? Are they Meliboeus's?\"\nHere there is a break in sense after a 4th-foot dactyl, a feature known as a bucolic diaeresis, because it is frequently used in Greek pastoral poetry. In fact it is common in Homer too (as in the first line of the \"Odyssey\" quoted above), but rare in Latin epic.\nStylistic features of epic.\nCertain stylistic features are characteristic of epic hexameter poetry, especially as written by Virgil.\nEnjambment.\nHexameters are frequently enjambed\u2014the meaning runs over from one line to the next, without terminal punctuation\u2014which helps to create the long, flowing narrative of epic. Sentences can also end in different places in the line, for example, after the first foot. In this, classical epic differs from medieval Latin, where the lines are often composed individually, with a break in sense at the end of each one.\nPoetic vocabulary.\nOften in poetry ordinary words are replaced by poetic ones, for example or for water, for sea, for ship, for river, and so on. Some ordinary Latin words are avoided, e.g. etc., simply because they do not fit into a hexameter verse.\nHyperbaton.\nIt is common in poetry for adjectives to be widely separated from their nouns, and quite often one adjective\u2013noun pair is interleaved with another. This feature is known as hyperbaton \"stepping over\". An example is the opening line of Lucan's epic on the Civil War:\n\"Wars through the Emathian \u2013 more than civil \u2013 plains\"\nAnother example is the opening of Ovid's mythological poem Metamorphoses where the word \"new\" is in a different line from \"bodies\" which it describes:\n (Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.1)\n\"My spirit leads me to tell of forms transformed into new bodies.\"\nOne particular arrangement of words that seems to have been particularly admired is the golden line, a line which contains two adjectives, a verb, and two nouns, with the first adjective corresponding to the first noun such as:\n\"and the barbarian pipe was strident with horrible music\"\nCatullus was the first to use this kind of line, as in the above example. Later authors used it rarely (1% of lines in Ovid), but in silver Latin it became increasingly popular.\nAlliteration and assonance.\nVirgil in particular used alliteration and assonance frequently, although it is much less common in Ovid. Often more than one consonant was alliterated and not necessarily at the beginning of words, for example:\n\n\"But the queen, now long wounded by grave anxiety,\nfeeds the wound in her veins and is tormented by an unseen fire\"\nAlso in Virgil:\n \"places silent with night everywhere\"\n \"those ones with oars sweep the dark shallows\"\nSometimes the same vowel is repeated:\n\"on me, me, I who did it am here, turn your swords on me!\"\n\"he does not let go of the reins, but he is not strong enough to hold them back, and he does not know the names of the horses\"\nRhetorical techniques.\nRhetorical devices such as anaphora, antithesis, and rhetorical questions are frequently used in epic poetry. Tricolon is also common:\n\n\"All this crowd that you see, are the poor and unburied;\nthat ferryman is Charon; these, that the wave is carrying, are the buried.\"\nGenre of subject matter.\nThe poems of Homer, Virgil, and Ovid often vary their narrative with speeches. Well known examples are the speech of Queen Dido cursing Aeneas in book 4 of the \"Aeneid\", the lament of the nymph Juturna when she is unable to save her brother Turnus in book 12 of the \"Aeneid\", and the quarrel between Ajax and Ulysses over the arms of Achilles in book 13 of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\". Some speeches are themselves narratives, as when Aeneas tells Queen Dido about the fall of Troy and his voyage to Africa in books 2 and 3 of the \"Aeneid\". Other styles of writing include vivid descriptions, such as Virgil's description of the god Charon in \"Aeneid\" 6, or Ovid's description of Daedalus's labyrinth in book 8 of the \"Metamorphoses\"; similes, such as Virgil's comparison of the souls of the dead to autumn leaves or clouds of migrating birds in \"Aeneid\" 6; and lists of names, such as when Ovid names 36 of the dogs who tore their master Actaeon to pieces in book 3 of the \"Metamorphoses\".\nConversational style.\nRaven divides the various styles of the hexameter in classical Latin into three types: the early stage (Ennius), the fully developed type (Cicero, Catullus, Virgil, and Ovid, with Lucretius about midway between Ennius and Cicero), and the conversational type, especially Horace, but also to an extent Persius and Juvenal. One feature which marks these off is their often irregular line endings (for example, words of one syllable) and also the very conversational, un-epic style. Horace in fact called his satires (\"conversations\"). The word order and vocabulary is much as might be expected in prose. An example is the opening of the 9th satire of book 1:\n\n\n\"I was walking by chance along the Sacred Way, as is my custom,\nmeditating on some trifle or other, completely absorbed in it,\nwhen suddenly up ran a certain person known to me by name only.\nHe grabbed my hand and said 'How are you, sweetest of things?'\"\nSilver Age and Late Empire.\nThe verse innovations of the Augustan writers were carefully imitated by their successors in the Silver Age of Latin literature. The verse form itself then was little changed as the quality of a poet's hexameter was judged against the standard set by Virgil and the other Augustan poets, a respect for literary precedent encompassed by the Latin word '. Deviations were generally regarded as idiosyncrasies or hallmarks of personal style and were not imitated by later poets. Juvenal, for example, was fond of occasionally creating verses that placed a sense break between the fourth and fifth foot (instead of in the usual caesura positions), but this technique\u2014known as the bucolic diaeresis\u2014did not catch on with other poets.\nIn the late empire, writers experimented again by adding unusual restrictions to the standard hexameter. The rhopalic verse of Ausonius is a good example; besides following the standard hexameter pattern, each word in the line is one syllable longer than the previous, e.g.:\n\n\"O God, Hope of Eternal Life, Conciliator,\nif, with chaste entreaties, hoping for pardon, we keep vigil,\nlook kindly on us and grant these prayers.\"\nAlso notable is the tendency among late grammarians to thoroughly dissect the hexameters of Virgil and earlier poets. A treatise on poetry by Diomedes Grammaticus is a good example, as this work categorizes dactylic hexameter verses in ways that were later interpreted under the golden line rubric. Independently, these two trends show the form becoming highly artificial\u2014more like a puzzle to solve than a medium for personal poetic expression.\nMiddle Ages.\nBy the Middle Ages, some writers adopted more relaxed versions of the meter. Bernard of Cluny, in the 12th century, for example, employs it in his \"De Contemptu Mundi\", but ignores classical conventions in favor of accentual effects and predictable rhyme both within and between verses, e.g.:\n\n\n\"These are the last days, the worst of times: let us keep watch.\nBehold the menacing arrival of the supreme Judge.\nHe is coming, he is coming to end evil, to crown just actions,\nReward what is right, free us from anxieties, and give the heavens.\"\nNot all medieval writers are so at odds with the Virgilian standard, and with the rediscovery of classical literature, later Medieval and Renaissance writers are far more orthodox, but by then the form had become an academic exercise. Petrarch, for example, devoted much time to his \"Africa\", a dactylic hexameter epic on Scipio Africanus, completed in 1341, but this work was unappreciated in his time and remains little read today. It begins as follows:\n\n\"To me also, o Muse, tell of the man, \nconspicuous for his merits and fearsome in war,\nto whom noble Africa, broken beneath Italian arms,\nfirst gave its eternal name.\"\nIn contrast, Dante decided to write his epic, the \"Divine Comedy\" in Italian\u2014a choice that defied the traditional epic choice of Latin dactylic hexameters\u2014and produced a masterpiece beloved both then and now.\nWith the Neo-Latin period, the language itself came to be regarded as a medium only for serious and learned expression, a view that left little room for Latin poetry. The emergence of Recent Latin in the 20th century restored classical orthodoxy among Latinists and sparked a general (if still academic) interest in the beauty of Latin poetry. Today, the modern Latin poets who use the dactylic hexameter are generally as faithful to Virgil as Rome's Silver Age poets.\nIn modern languages.\nIn English.\nMany poets have attempted to write dactylic hexameters in English, though few works composed in the meter have stood the test of time. Most such works are accentual rather than quantitative. Perhaps the most famous is Longfellow's \"Evangeline\", whose first lines are as follows:\n\"This is the / forest pri/meval. The / murmuring / pines and the / hemlocks\nBearded with / moss, and in / garments / green, indis/tinct in the / twilight,\nStand like / Druids of / eld, with / voices / sad and pro/phetic...\"\nContemporary poet Annie Finch wrote her epic libretto \"Among the Goddesses\" in dactylic tetrameter, which she claims is the most accurate English accentual equivalent of dactylic hexameter. Poets who have written quantitative hexameters in English include Robert Bridges and Rodney Merrill, whose translation of part of the \"Iliad\" begins as follows (see External links below):\n\"Sing now, / goddess, the / wrath of A/chilles the / scion of / Peleus,\nRuinous / rage, which / brought the A/chaeans un/counted af/flictions;\nMany the / powerful / souls it / sent to the / dwelling of / Hades...\"\nAlthough the rules seem simple, it is hard to use classical hexameter in English because English is a stress-timed language that condenses vowels and consonants between stressed syllables, while hexameter relies on the regular timing of the phonetic sounds. Languages having the latter properties (i.e., languages that are not stress-timed) include Ancient Greek, Latin, Lithuanian and Hungarian.\nIn German.\nDactylic hexameter has proved more successful in German than in most modern languages. Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock's epic \"Der Messias\" popularized accentual dactylic hexameter in German. Subsequent German poets to employ the form include Goethe (notably in his \"Reineke Fuchs\") and Schiller.\nThe opening lines of Goethe's (\"Reynard the Fox\"), written in 1793\u20131794, are:\n\n\n\"Pentecost, the lovely festival, had come; field and forest\ngrew green and bloomed; on hills and ridges, in bushes and hedges\nThe newly encouraged birds practised a merry song;\nEvery meadow sprouted with flowers in fragrant grounds,\nThe sky shone festively cheerfully and the earth was colourful.\"\nIn French.\nJean-Antoine de Ba\u00eff (1532\u20131589) wrote poems regulated by quantity on the Greco\u2013Roman model, a system which came to be known as \"vers mesur\u00e9s\", or \"vers mesur\u00e9s \u00e0 l'antique\", which the French language of the Renaissance permitted. To do this, he invented a special phonetic alphabet. In works like his \"\u00c9tr\u00e9nes de po\u00e9zie Franzo\u0119ze an v\u0119rs mezur\u00e9s\" (1574) or \"Chansonnettes\" he used the dactylic hexameter, and other meters, in a quantitative way.\nAn example of one of his elegiac couplets is as follows. The final -e of , , and is sounded, and the word is pronounced /i/:\n\n| \u2013 u u | \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u u | \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u u | \u2013 \u2013\n| \u2013 u u | \u2013 u u | \u2013 || \u2013 u u | \u2013 u u | \u2013\n\"Let the handsome Narcissus come, who never loved another except himself,\nand let him look at your eyes, and let him try not to love you.\"\nA modern attempt at reproducing the dactylic hexameter in French is this one, by Andr\u00e9 Markowicz (1985), translating Catullus's poem 63. Again the final -e and -es of , , and are sounded:\n\n| \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u u | \u2013 u u | \u2013 u u | \u2013 u u | \u2013\u00a0\u2013 |\n| \u2013 u u | \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 u u | \u2013 u u | \u2013 u u | \u2013 \u2013 |\n\"Is it for this that you have snatched me from the altars of my ancestors,\nto abandon me, traitorous Theseus, on these deserted shores?\"\nIn Hungarian.\nHungarian is extremely suitable to hexameter (and other forms of poetry based on quantitative meter). It has been applied to Hungarian since 1541, introduced by the grammarian J\u00e1nos Sylvester.\nA hexameter can even occur spontaneously. For example, a student may extricate themselves from failing to remember a poem by saying the following, which is a hexameter in Hungarian:\n\u2015 \u222a \u222a / \u2015 \u2015 / \u2015 \u2015 / \u2015 \u222a \u222a / \u2015 \u222a \u222a / \u2015 \u2015 \n\"I'm stuck here, unfortunately the rest won't come into my mind.\"\nS\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res included an ordinary nameplate text in one of his poems (this time, a pentameter):\n\u2015 \u222a \u222a / \u2015 \u222a \u222a / \u2015 // \u2015 \u222a \u222a / \u2015 \u222a \u222a / \u2015\n\"Gyula T\u00f3th tinsmith and plumber\"\nSimilar present-day, spontaneous hexameters have been spotted by contemporary poets such as and J\u00e1nos Lackfi:\n\n\"Milk chocolate with apricot and biscuit bits\"\n\n\"Please indicate in advance your need for a VAT invoice.\"\n\n\"Issuance of driver\u2019s licenses\"\nDue to this feature, the hexameter has been widely used both in translated (Greek and Roman) and in original Hungarian poetry up to the twentieth century (e.g. by Mikl\u00f3s Radn\u00f3ti).\nIn Lithuanian.\n\"The Seasons\" (\"Metai\") by Kristijonas Donelaitis is a famous Lithuanian poem in quantitative dactylic hexameters. Because of the nature of Lithuanian, more than half of the lines of the poem are entirely spondaic save for the mandatory dactyl in the fifth foot."}

It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the mahi-mahi (\"Coryphaena hippurus\"), which is known as \"dorado\" (\"golden\") in Spanish, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation.\nEven though the name Dorado is not Latin but Spanish, astronomers give it the Latin genitive form \"Doradus\" when naming its stars; it is treated (like the adjacent asterism Argo Navis) as a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -\u014d (like \"Io\" or \"Callisto\" or \"Argo\"), which have a genitive ending \"-\u016bs\".\nHistory.\nDorado was one of twelve constellations named by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It appeared:\nDorado represents a dolphinfish; it has also been called the goldfish because Dorado are gold-colored.\nFeatures.\nStars.\nAlpha Doradus is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.3, 176 light-years from Earth. It is the brightest star in Dorado. Beta Doradus is a notably bright Cepheid variable star. It is a yellow-tinged supergiant star that has a minimum magnitude of 4.1 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5. One thousand and forty light-years from Earth, Beta Doradus has a period of 9 days and 20 hours.\nR Doradus is one of the many variable stars in Dorado. S Dor, 9.721 hypergiant in the Large Magellanic Cloud, is the prototype of S Doradus variable stars. The variable star R Doradus 5.73 has the largest-known apparent size of any star other than the Sun. Gamma Doradus is the prototype of the Gamma Doradus variable stars.\nSupernova 1987A was the closest supernova to occur since the invention of the telescope. SNR 0509-67.5 is the remnant of an unusually energetic Type Ia supernova from about 400 years ago.\nHE 0437-5439 is a hypervelocity star escaping from the Milky Way/Magellanic Cloud system.\nDorado is also the location of the South Ecliptic pole, which lies near the fish's head. The pole was called \"Polus Doradinalis\" by Philipp von Zesen, aka Caesius.\nIn early 2020, the exoplanet TOI-700 d was discovered orbiting the star TOI-700 in Dorado. This is the first potentially Earth-like exoplanet to be discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.\nDeep-sky objects.\nBecause Dorado contains part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it is rich in deep sky objects. The Large Magellanic Cloud, 25,000 light-years in diameter, is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way Galaxy, located at a distance of 179,000 light-years. It has been deformed by its gravitational interactions with the larger Milky Way. In 1987, it became host to SN 1987A, the first supernova of 1987 and the closest since 1604. This 25,000-light-year-wide galaxy contains over 10,000 million stars. All coordinates given are for Epoch J2000.0.\nEquivalents.\nIn Chinese astronomy, the stars of Dorado are in two of Xu Guangqi's Southern Asterisms (\u8fd1\u5357\u6975\u661f\u5340, \"J\u00ecnn\u00e1nj\u00edx\u012bng\u014du\"): the White Patches Attached (\u593e\u767d, \"Ji\u0101b\u00e1i\") and the Goldfish (\u91d1\u9b5a, \"J\u012bny\u00fa\").\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8467", "revid": "47846486", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8467", "title": "Draco (legislator)", "text": "First legislator of Athens in Ancient Greece\nDraco (fl.) was the first legislator of Athens in Ancient Greece, according to Athenian tradition. He replaced the system of oral law and blood feud by the Draconian constitution, a written code to be enforced only by a court of law. His laws were supposed to have been very harsh, establishing the death penalty for most offenses. Tradition held that all of his laws were repealed by Solon, save for those on homicide. An inscription from 409/8 BC contains part of the current law and refers to it as \"the law of Draco about homicide\". Nothing is known about the specifics of other laws established by Draco.\nAccording to some scholars, Draco may have been a fictional figure, entirely or in part. Biographical information about him is almost entirely lacking; he was held to have established his legal code in the year 621/620 BC. Since the 18th century, the adjective \"draconian\" (, ) refers to similarly unforgiving rules or laws.\nHistory.\nNothing is known about Draco's life except that he established his legal code during the reign of the archon Aristaechmus in the year 621/620 BC. The \"Suda\", the 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, records a folkloric story about Draco's death: he went to Aegina to establish laws and was suffocated in the theater when his supporters honored him by throwing many hats, shirts and cloaks on him. Some scholars question whether Draco was a real historical figure or consider that he may have been partially fictional. Karl Julius Beloch hypothesized that Draco was not a person; \"drakon\" means 'serpent' in Greek, and a sacred serpent on the acropolis was worshipped in the Athenian religion. Therefore, the \"laws of Draco\" may have been laws issued in the name of the sacred serpent by its priests; later, this origin was forgotten and Draco was reinterpreted as a lawgiver. Raphael Sealey notes that this hypothesis helps explain how the seemingly protracted development of Athenian homicide law could be attributed to a single source. However, most scholars believe that Draco really did establish laws on homicide and other offenses, and some accept the attribution to him of the inscription partially recording the homicide law.\nDraconian constitution.\nThe laws ( \u2013 ) that he laid were the first written constitution of Athens. So that no one would be unaware of them, they were posted on wooden tablets ( \u2013 ), where they were preserved for almost two centuries on steles of the shape of four-sided pyramids ( \u2013 ). The tablets were called , perhaps because they could be pivoted along the pyramid's axis to read any side.\nThe constitution featured several major innovations:\nThe laws were particularly harsh. For example, any debtor whose status was lower than that of his creditor was forced into slavery. The punishment was more lenient for those owing a debt to a member of a lower class. The death penalty was the punishment for even minor offences, such as stealing a cabbage. Concerning the liberal use of the death penalty in the Draconic code, Plutarch states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is said that Drakon himself, when asked why he had fixed the punishment of death for most offences, answered that he considered these lesser crimes to deserve it, and he had no greater punishment for more important ones.\nAll Draco's laws were repealed by Solon in the early 6th century BC, with the exception of the homicide law.\nHomicide law.\nAfter much debate, the Athenians decided to revise the laws, including the homicide law, in 409 BC. The text of the homicide law is partially preserved in a fragmentary inscription. It states that it is up to the victim's relatives to prosecute a killer.\nAccording to the preserved part of the inscription, unintentional homicides received a sentence of exile. It is not clear whether Draco's law specified the punishment for intentional homicide. In 409 BC, intentional homicide was punished by death, but Draco's law begins: \".\" Although ambiguous and difficult to translate, one suggested translation is: \"Even if a man not intentionally kills another, he is exiled.\"\nCouncil of Four Hundred.\nDraco introduced the lot-chosen Council of Four Hundred, distinct from the Areopagus, which evolved in later constitutions to play a large role in Athenian democracy. Aristotle notes that Draco, while having the laws written, merely legislated for an existing unwritten Athenian constitution such as setting exact qualifications for eligibility for office.\nAccording to Aristotle, Draco extended the franchise to all free men who could furnish themselves with a set of military equipment. However, this claim is not based on the authentic tradition, thus untrue as claimed by Welwei in 1998. They elected the Council of Four Hundred from among their number; nine archons and the treasurers were drawn from persons possessing an unencumbered property of not less than ten \"minas\", the generals (\"strategoi\") and commanders of cavalry (\"hipparchoi\") from those who could show an unencumbered property of not less than a hundred \"minas\" and had children born in lawful wedlock over ten years of age. Thus, in the event of their death, their estate could pass to a competent heir. These officers were required to hold to account the \"prytanes\" (councillors), \"strategoi\" (generals) and \"hipparchoi\" (cavalry officers) of the preceding year until their accounts had been audited. \"The Council of Areopagus was guardian of the laws, and kept watch over the magistrates to see that they executed their offices in accordance with the laws. Any person who felt himself wronged might lay an information before the Council of Areopagus, on declaring what law was broken by the wrong done to him. But, as has been said before, loans were secured upon the persons of the debtors, and the land was in the hands of a few.\"\nLegacy.\nBecause of his infamous legal code, Draco is the eponym of the adjective \"draconian\" (often capitalized), which describes not only excessively severe or cruel legislation, but also any such punishment or rule. With reference to legislation, the word has been used in this sense in English since 1777.\nOn the south frieze of the courtroom of the United States Supreme Court Building, designed by Adolph Alexander Weinman, Draco is depicted as one in a procession of the \"great lawgivers of history.\" Owing to his controversial legacy, the inclusion of Draco in the frieze was questioned by \"The Atlantic\".\nPunishments for breaking the code of laws created by Draco were severe, often death. The term \"draconian\", meaning excessively severe, thus derives from Draco's name and his law code. It is often applied to laws or other government measures.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8468", "revid": "42957683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8468", "title": "Determinant", "text": "In mathematics, invariant of square matrices\nIn mathematics, the determinant is a scalar-valued function of the entries of a square matrix. The determinant of a matrix \"A\" is commonly denoted det(\"A\"), det \"A\", or . Its value characterizes some properties of the matrix and the linear map represented, on a given basis, by the matrix. In particular, the determinant is nonzero if and only if the matrix is invertible and the corresponding linear map is an isomorphism. However, if the determinant is zero, the matrix is referred to as singular, meaning it does not have an inverse.\nThe determinant is completely determined by the two following properties: the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants, and the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.\nThe determinant of a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix is\nformula_1\nand the determinant of a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix is\nformula_2\nThe determinant of an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrix can be defined in several equivalent ways, the most common being Leibniz formula, which expresses the determinant as a sum of formula_3 (the factorial of n) signed products of matrix entries. It can be computed by the Laplace expansion, which expresses the determinant as a linear combination of determinants of submatrices, or with Gaussian elimination, which allows computing a row echelon form with the same determinant, equal to the product of the diagonal entries of the row echelon form.\nDeterminants can also be defined by some of their properties. Namely, the determinant is the unique function defined on the \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices that has the four following properties: \nThe above properties relating to rows (properties 2\u20134) may be replaced by the corresponding statements with respect to columns.\nThe determinant is invariant under matrix similarity. This implies that, given a linear endomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space, the determinant of the matrix that represents it on a basis does not depend on the chosen basis. This allows defining the \"determinant\" of a linear endomorphism, which does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system.\nDeterminants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the coefficients in a system of linear equations, and determinants can be used to solve these equations (Cramer's rule), although other methods of solution are computationally much more efficient. Determinants are used for defining the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix, whose roots are the eigenvalues. In geometry, the signed n-dimensional volume of a n-dimensional parallelepiped is expressed by a determinant, and the determinant of a linear endomorphism determines how the orientation and the n-dimensional volume are transformed under the endomorphism. This is used in calculus with exterior differential forms and the Jacobian determinant, in particular for changes of variables in multiple integrals.\nTwo by two matrices.\nThe determinant of a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix formula_4 is denoted either by \"det\" or by vertical bars around the matrix, and is defined as\nformula_5\nFor example,\nformula_6\nFirst properties.\nThe determinant has several key properties that can be proved by direct evaluation of the definition for formula_7-matrices, and that continue to hold for determinants of larger matrices. They are as follows: first, the determinant of the identity matrix formula_8 is 1.\nSecond, the determinant is zero if two rows are the same:\nformula_9\nThis holds similarly if the two columns are the same. Moreover,\nformula_10\nFinally, if any column is multiplied by some number formula_11 (i.e., all entries in that column are multiplied by that number), the determinant is also multiplied by that number:\nformula_12\nGeometric meaning.\nIf the matrix entries are real numbers, the matrix A represents the linear map that maps the basis vectors to the columns of A. The images of the basis vectors form a parallelogram that represents the image of the unit square under the mapping. The parallelogram defined by the columns of the above matrix is the one with vertices at (0, 0), (\"a\", \"c\"), (\"a\" + \"b\", \"c\" + \"d\"), and (\"b\", \"d\"), as shown in the accompanying diagram.\nThe absolute value of \"ad\" \u2212 \"bc\" is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by A.\nThe absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the signed area of the parallelogram. The signed area is the same as the usual area, except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the identity matrix).\nTo show that \"ad\" \u2212 \"bc\" is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors u \u2261 (\"a\", \"c\") and v \u2261 (\"b\", \"d\") representing the parallelogram's sides. The signed area can be expressed as |u| |v| sin \"\u03b8\" for the angle \"\u03b8\" between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the sine this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the cosine of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. u\u22a5 = (\u2212\"c\", \"a\"), so that |u\u22a5| |v| cos \"\u03b8\u2032\" becomes the signed area in question, which can be determined by the pattern of the scalar product to be equal to \"ad\" \u2212 \"bc\" according to the following equations:\n formula_13\nThus the determinant gives the area scale factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by \"A\". When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix preserves area and orientation.\nIf an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" real matrix \"A\" is written in terms of its column vectors formula_14, then\nformula_15\nThis means that formula_16 maps the unit \"n\"-cube to the \"n\"-dimensional parallelotope defined by the vectors formula_17 the region formula_18 (formula_19 stands for \"for all\" as a logical symbol.)\nThe determinant gives the signed \"n\"-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, formula_20 and hence describes more generally the \"n\"-dimensional volume scale factor of the linear transformation produced by \"A\". (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses orientation.) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully \"n\"-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of \"A\" is less than \"n\". This means that \"A\" produces a linear transformation which is neither onto nor one-to-one, and so is not invertible.\nDefinition.\nLet \"A\" be a square matrix with \"n\" rows and \"n\" columns, so that it can be written as\nformula_21\nThe entries formula_22 etc. are, for many purposes, real or complex numbers. As discussed below, the determinant is also defined for matrices whose entries are in a commutative ring.\nThe determinant of \"A\" is denoted by det(\"A\"), or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets:\nformula_23\nThere are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a square matrix \"A\", i.e. one with the same number of rows and columns: the determinant can be defined via the Leibniz formula, an explicit formula involving sums of products of certain entries of the matrix. The determinant can also be characterized as the unique function depending on the entries of the matrix satisfying certain properties. This approach can also be used to compute determinants by simplifying the matrices in question.\nLeibniz formula.\n3 \u00d7 3 matrices.\nThe \"Leibniz formula\" for the determinant of a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix is the following:\nformula_24\nIn this expression, each term has one factor from each row, all in different columns, arranged in increasing row order. For example, \"bdi\" has \"b\" from the first row second column, \"d\" from the second row first column, and \"i\" from the third row third column. The signs are determined by how many transpositions of factors are necessary to arrange the factors in increasing order of their columns (given that the terms are arranged left-to-right in increasing row order): positive for an even number of transpositions and negative for an odd number. For the example of \"bdi\", the single transposition of \"bd\" to \"db\" gives \"dbi,\" whose three factors are from the first, second and third columns respectively; this is an odd number of transpositions, so the term appears with negative sign.\nThe rule of Sarrus is a mnemonic for the expanded form of this determinant: the sum of the products of three diagonal north-west to south-east lines of matrix elements, minus the sum of the products of three diagonal south-west to north-east lines of elements, when the copies of the first two columns of the matrix are written beside it as in the illustration. This scheme for calculating the determinant of a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix does not carry over into higher dimensions.\n\"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrices.\nGeneralizing the above to higher dimensions, the determinant of an formula_25 matrix is an expression involving permutations and their signatures. A permutation of the set formula_26 is a bijective function formula_27 from this set to itself, with values formula_28 exhausting the entire set. The set of all such permutations, called the symmetric group, is commonly denoted formula_29. The signature formula_30 of a permutation formula_27 is formula_32 if the permutation can be obtained with an even number of transpositions (exchanges of two entries); otherwise, it is formula_33\nGiven a matrix\nformula_34\nthe Leibniz formula for its determinant is, using sigma notation for the sum,\nformula_35\nUsing pi notation for the product, this can be shortened into\nformula_36.\nThe Levi-Civita symbol formula_37 is defined on the n-tuples of integers in formula_38 as 0 if two of the integers are equal, and otherwise as the signature of the permutation defined by the \"n-\"tuple of integers. With the Levi-Civita symbol, the Leibniz formula becomes \nformula_39\nwhere the sum is taken over all n-tuples of integers in formula_40\nProperties.\nCharacterization of the determinant.\nThe determinant can be characterized by the following three key properties. To state these, it is convenient to regard an formula_25 matrix \"A\" as being composed of its formula_42 columns, so denoted as\nformula_43\nwhere the column vector formula_44 (for each \"i\") is composed of the entries of the matrix in the \"i\"-th column.\nIf the determinant is defined using the Leibniz formula as above, these three properties can be proved by direct inspection of that formula. Some authors also approach the determinant directly using these three properties: it can be shown that there is exactly one function that assigns to any formula_25 matrix \"A\" a number that satisfies these three properties. This also shows that this more abstract approach to the determinant yields the same definition as the one using the Leibniz formula.\nTo see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a standard basis vector. These determinants are either 0 (if the columns are linearly dependent, by property 3) or else \u00b11 (by property 1 and 3 - the minus sign appears when the columns are permuted according to an odd permutation), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear.\nImmediate consequences.\nThese rules have several further consequences:\nExample.\nThese characterizing properties and their consequences listed above are both theoretically significant, but can also be used to compute determinants for concrete matrices. In fact, Gaussian elimination can be applied to bring any matrix into upper triangular form, and the steps in this algorithm affect the determinant in a controlled way. The following concrete example illustrates the computation of the determinant of the matrix formula_16 using that method:\nformula_64\nCombining these equalities gives formula_65\nTranspose.\nThe determinant of the transpose of formula_16 equals the determinant of \"A\":\nformula_67.\nThis can be proven by inspecting the Leibniz formula. This implies that in all the properties mentioned above, the word \"column\" can be replaced by \"row\" throughout. For example, viewing an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrix as being composed of \"n\" rows, the determinant is an \"n\"-linear function.\nMultiplicativity and matrix groups.\nThe determinant is a \"multiplicative map\", i.e., for square matrices formula_16 and formula_69 of equal size, the determinant of a matrix product equals the product of their determinants:\nformula_70\nThis key fact can be proven by observing that, for a fixed matrix formula_69, both sides of the equation are alternating and multilinear as a function depending on the columns of formula_16. Moreover, they both take the value formula_73 when formula_16 is the identity matrix. The above-mentioned unique characterization of alternating multilinear maps therefore shows this claim.\nA matrix formula_16 with entries in a field is invertible precisely if its determinant is nonzero. This follows from the multiplicativity of the determinant and the formula for the inverse involving the adjugate matrix mentioned below. In this event, the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by\nformula_76.\nIn particular, products and inverses of matrices with non-zero determinant (respectively, determinant one) still have this property. Thus, the set of such matrices (of fixed size formula_42 over a field formula_78) forms a group known as the general linear group formula_79 (respectively, a subgroup called the special linear group formula_80. More generally, the word \"special\" indicates the subgroup of another matrix group of matrices of determinant one. Examples include the special orthogonal group (which if \"n\" is 2 or 3 consists of all rotation matrices), and the special unitary group.\nBecause the determinant respects multiplication and inverses, it is in fact a group homomorphism from formula_79 into the multiplicative group formula_82 of nonzero elements of formula_78. This homomorphism is surjective and its kernel is formula_84 (the matrices with determinant one). Hence, by the first isomorphism theorem, this shows that formula_84 is a normal subgroup of formula_79, and that the quotient group formula_87 is isomorphic to formula_82.\nThe Cauchy\u2013Binet formula is a generalization of that product formula for \"rectangular\" matrices. This formula can also be recast as a multiplicative formula for compound matrices whose entries are the determinants of all quadratic submatrices of a given matrix.\nLaplace expansion.\nLaplace expansion expresses the determinant of a matrix formula_16 recursively in terms of determinants of smaller matrices, known as its minors. The minor formula_90 is defined to be the determinant of the formula_91 matrix that results from formula_16 by removing the formula_93-th row and the formula_94-th column. The expression formula_95 is known as a cofactor. For every formula_93, one has the equality\nformula_97\nwhich is called the \"Laplace expansion along the ith row\". For example, the Laplace expansion along the first row (formula_98) gives the following formula:\nformula_99\nUnwinding the determinants of these formula_7-matrices gives back the Leibniz formula mentioned above. Similarly, the \"Laplace expansion along the formula_94-th column\" is the equality\nformula_102\nLaplace expansion can be used iteratively for computing determinants, but this approach is inefficient for large matrices. However, it is useful for computing the determinants of highly symmetric matrix such as the Vandermonde matrix\nformula_103The \"n\"-term Laplace expansion along a row or column can be generalized to write an \"n\" x \"n\" determinant as a sum of formula_104 terms, each the product of the determinant of a \"k\" x \"k\" submatrix and the determinant of the complementary (\"n\u2212k\") x (\"n\u2212k\") submatrix.\nAdjugate matrix.\nThe adjugate matrix formula_105 is the transpose of the matrix of the cofactors, that is,\n formula_106\nFor every matrix, one has\n formula_107\nThus the adjugate matrix can be used for expressing the inverse of a nonsingular matrix:\n formula_108\nBlock matrices.\nThe formula for the determinant of a formula_7 matrix above continues to hold, under appropriate further assumptions, for a block matrix, i.e., a matrix composed of four submatrices formula_110 of dimension formula_111, formula_112, formula_113 and formula_25, respectively. The easiest such formula, which can be proven using either the Leibniz formula or a factorization involving the Schur complement, is\nformula_115\nIf formula_16 is invertible, then it follows with results from the section on multiplicativity that\nformula_117\nwhich simplifies to formula_118 when formula_119 is a formula_120 matrix.\nA similar result holds when formula_119 is invertible, namely\nformula_122\nBoth results can be combined to derive Sylvester's determinant theorem, which is also stated below.\nIf the blocks are square matrices of the \"same\" size further formulas hold. For example, if formula_123 and formula_119 commute (i.e., formula_125), then\nformula_126\nThis formula has been generalized to matrices composed of more than formula_7 blocks, again under appropriate commutativity conditions among the individual blocks.\nFor formula_128 and formula_129, the following formula holds (even if formula_16 and formula_69 do not commute).\nformula_132\nSylvester's determinant theorem.\nSylvester's determinant theorem states that for \"A\", an \"m\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrix, and \"B\", an \"n\" \u00d7 \"m\" matrix (so that \"A\" and \"B\" have dimensions allowing them to be multiplied in either order forming a square matrix):\nformula_133\nwhere \"I\"\"m\" and \"I\"\"n\" are the \"m\" \u00d7 \"m\" and \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" identity matrices, respectively.\nFrom this general result several consequences follow.\nA generalization is formula_134(see Matrix determinant lemma), where \"Z\" is an \"m\" \u00d7 \"m\" invertible matrix and \"W\" is an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" invertible matrix.\nSum.\nThe determinant of the sum formula_135 of two square matrices of the same size is not in general expressible in terms of the determinants of \"A\" and of \"B\".\nHowever, for positive semidefinite matrices formula_16, formula_69 and formula_123 of equal size,\nformula_139\nwith the corollary\nformula_140\nBrunn\u2013Minkowski theorem implies that the nth root of determinant is a concave function, when restricted to Hermitian positive-definite formula_141 matrices. Therefore, if A and B are Hermitian positive-definite formula_141 matrices, one has\nformula_143 since the nth root of the determinant is a homogeneous function.\nSum identity for 2\u00d72 matrices.\nFor the special case of formula_144 matrices with complex entries, the determinant of the sum can be written in terms of determinants and traces in the following identity:\nformula_145\nProperties of the determinant in relation to other notions.\nEigenvalues and characteristic polynomial.\nThe determinant is closely related to two other central concepts in linear algebra, the eigenvalues and the characteristic polynomial of a matrix. Let formula_16 be an formula_25 matrix with complex entries. Then, by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, formula_16 must have exactly \"n\" eigenvalues formula_149. (Here it is understood that an eigenvalue with algebraic multiplicity \u03bc occurs \u03bc times in this list.) Then, it turns out the determinant of A is equal to the \"product\" of these eigenvalues,\nformula_150\nThe product of all non-zero eigenvalues is referred to as pseudo-determinant.\nFrom this, one immediately sees that the determinant of a matrix formula_16 is zero if and only if formula_152 is an eigenvalue of formula_16. In other words, formula_16 is invertible if and only if formula_152 is not an eigenvalue of formula_16.\nThe characteristic polynomial is defined as\nformula_157\nHere, formula_158 is the indeterminate of the polynomial and formula_46 is the identity matrix of the same size as formula_16. By means of this polynomial, determinants can be used to find the eigenvalues of the matrix formula_16: they are precisely the roots of this polynomial, i.e., those complex numbers formula_162 such that\nformula_163\nA Hermitian matrix is positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive. Sylvester's criterion asserts that this is equivalent to the determinants of the submatrices\nformula_164\nbeing positive, for all formula_165 between formula_166 and formula_42.\nTrace.\nThe trace tr(\"A\") is by definition the sum of the diagonal entries of A and also equals the sum of the eigenvalues. Thus, for complex matrices A,\nformula_168\nor, for real matrices A,\nformula_169\nHere exp(A) denotes the matrix exponential of A, because every eigenvalue \u03bb of A corresponds to the eigenvalue exp(\u03bb) of exp(A). In particular, given any logarithm of A, that is, any matrix L satisfying\nformula_170\nthe determinant of A is given by\nformula_171\nFor example, for \"n\" = 2, \"n\" = 3, and \"n\" = 4, respectively,\nformula_172\ncf. Cayley-Hamilton theorem. Such expressions are deducible from combinatorial arguments, Newton's identities, or the Faddeev\u2013LeVerrier algorithm. That is, for generic n, det\"A\" \n (\u22121)\"n\"\"c\"0 the signed constant term of the characteristic polynomial, determined recursively from\nformula_173\nIn the general case, this may also be obtained from\nformula_174\nwhere the sum is taken over the set of all integers \"kl\" \u2265 0 satisfying the equation\nformula_175\nThe formula can be expressed in terms of the complete exponential Bell polynomial of \"n\" arguments \"s\"\"l\" = \u2212(\"l\" \u2013 1)! tr(\"A\"\"l\") as\nformula_176\nThis formula can also be used to find the determinant of a matrix \"AIJ\" with multidimensional indices \"I\" = (\"i\"1, \"i\"2, ..., \"ir\") and \"J\" = (\"j\"1, \"j\"2, ..., \"jr\"). The product and trace of such matrices are defined in a natural way as\nformula_177\nAn important arbitrary dimension n identity can be obtained from the Mercator series expansion of the logarithm when the expansion converges. If every eigenvalue of \"A\" is less than 1 in absolute value,\nformula_178\nwhere \"I\" is the identity matrix. More generally, if\nformula_179\nis expanded as a formal power series in s then all coefficients of sm for \"m\" &gt; \"n\" are zero and the remaining polynomial is det(\"I\" + \"sA\").\nUpper and lower bounds.\nFor a positive definite matrix \"A\", the trace operator gives the following tight lower and upper bounds on the log determinant\nformula_180\nwith equality if and only if \"A\" = \"I\". This relationship can be derived via the formula for the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between two multivariate normal distributions.\nAlso,\nformula_181\nThese inequalities can be proved by expressing the traces and the determinant in terms of the eigenvalues. As such, they represent the well-known fact that the harmonic mean is less than the geometric mean, which is less than the arithmetic mean, which is, in turn, less than the root mean square.\nDerivative.\nThe Leibniz formula shows that the determinant of real (or analogously for complex) square matrices is a polynomial function from formula_182 to formula_183. In particular, it is everywhere differentiable. Its derivative can be expressed using Jacobi's formula:\nformula_184\nwhere formula_105 denotes the adjugate of formula_16. In particular, if formula_16 is invertible, we have\nformula_188\nExpressed in terms of the entries of formula_16, these are\n formula_190\nYet another equivalent formulation is\nformula_191,\nusing big O notation. The special case where formula_192, the identity matrix, yields\nformula_193\nThis identity is used in describing Lie algebras associated to certain matrix Lie groups. For example, the special linear group formula_194 is defined by the equation formula_195. The above formula shows that its Lie algebra is the special linear Lie algebra formula_196 consisting of those matrices having trace zero.\nWriting a formula_197 matrix as formula_198 where formula_199 are column vectors of length 3, then the gradient over one of the three vectors may be written as the cross product of the other two:\n formula_200\nHistory.\nHistorically, determinants were used long before matrices: A determinant was originally defined as a property of a system of linear equations.\nThe determinant \"determines\" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero).\nIn this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook \"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\" (\u4e5d\u7ae0\u7b97\u8853, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). In Europe, solutions of linear systems of two equations were expressed by Cardano in 1545 by a determinant-like entity.\nDeterminants proper originated separately from the work of Seki Takakazu in 1683 in Japan and parallelly of Leibniz in 1693. stated, without proof, Cramer's rule. Both Cramer and also were led to determinants by the question of plane curves passing through a given set of points.\nVandermonde (1771) first recognized determinants as independent functions. gave the general method of expanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors: Vandermonde had already given a special case. Immediately following, Lagrange (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of elimination theory; he proved many special cases of general identities.\nGauss (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the theory of numbers. He introduced the word \"determinant\" (Laplace had used \"resultant\"), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the discriminant of a quadratic form. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem.\nThe next contributor of importance is Binet (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of \"m\" columns and \"n\" rows, which for the special case of \"m\" = \"n\" reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, Cauchy also presented one on the subject. (See Cauchy\u2013Binet formula.) In this he used the word \"determinant\" in its present sense, summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's. With him begins the theory in its generality.\n used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the Jacobian. In his memoirs in \"Crelle's Journal\" for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called \"alternants\". About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, Sylvester (1839) and Cayley began their work. introduced the modern notation for the determinant using vertical bars.\nThe study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by Lebesgue, Hesse, and Sylvester; persymmetric determinants by Sylvester and Hankel; circulants by Catalan, Spottiswoode, Glaisher, and Scott; skew determinants and Pfaffians, in connection with the theory of orthogonal transformation, by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; Wronskians (so called by Muir) by Christoffel and Frobenius; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and Hessians by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by Trudi. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises.\nApplications.\nCramer's rule.\nDeterminants can be used to describe the solutions of a linear system of equations, written in matrix form as formula_201. This equation has a unique solution formula_202 if and only if formula_203 is nonzero. In this case, the solution is given by Cramer's rule:\nformula_204\nwhere formula_205 is the matrix formed by replacing the formula_93-th column of formula_16 by the column vector formula_208. This follows immediately by column expansion of the determinant, i.e.\nformula_209\nformula_210\nwhere the vectors formula_211 are the columns of \"A\". The rule is also implied by the identity\nformula_212\nCramer's rule can be implemented in formula_213 time, which is comparable to more common methods of solving systems of linear equations, such as LU, QR, or singular value decomposition.\nLinear independence.\nDeterminants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors: formula_214 is zero if and only if the column vectors of the matrix formula_16 are linearly dependent. For example, given two linearly independent vectors formula_216, a third vector formula_217 lies in the plane spanned by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the formula_197 matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. The same idea is also used in the theory of differential equations: given functions formula_219 (supposed to be formula_220 times differentiable), the Wronskian is defined to be\nformula_221\nIt is non-zero (for some formula_202) in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order formula_220 are linearly independent. If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of analytic functions, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See the Wronskian and linear independence. Another such use of the determinant is the resultant, which gives a criterion when two polynomials have a common root.\nCross Product.\nThe computation of a cross product is equivalent to finding the formal determinant a specific 3 by 3 matrix. Specifically, for vectors formula_224, and formula_225:\nformula_226\nOrientation of a basis.\nThe determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every sequence of \"n\" vectors in R\"n\", by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. The determinant will be nonzero if and only if the sequence of vectors is a \"basis\" for R\"n\". In that case, the sign of the determinant determines whether the orientation of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the standard basis. In the case of an orthogonal basis, the magnitude of the determinant is equal to the \"product\" of the lengths of the basis vectors. For instance, an orthogonal matrix with entries in R\"n\" represents an orthonormal basis in Euclidean space, and hence has determinant of \u00b11 (since all the vectors have length 1). The determinant is +1 if and only if the basis has the same orientation. It is \u22121 if and only if the basis has the opposite orientation.\nMore generally, if the determinant of \"A\" is positive, \"A\" represents an orientation-preserving linear transformation (if \"A\" is an orthogonal 2 \u00d7 2 or 3 \u00d7 3 matrix, this is a rotation), while if it is negative, \"A\" switches the orientation of the basis.\nVolume and Jacobian determinant.\nAs pointed out above, the absolute value of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if formula_227 is the linear map given by multiplication with a matrix formula_16, and formula_229 is any measurable subset, then the volume of formula_230 is given by formula_231 times the volume of formula_232. More generally, if the linear map formula_233 is represented by the formula_112 matrix formula_16, then the ratio between the formula_42-dimensional volumes of formula_230 and formula_232 is given by:\nformula_239\nWhen formula_240 this is zero.\nBy calculating the volume of the tetrahedron bounded by four points, they can be used to identify skew lines. The volume of any tetrahedron, given its vertices formula_241, formula_242, or any other combination of pairs of vertices that form a spanning tree over the vertices.\nFor a general differentiable function, much of the above carries over by considering the Jacobian matrix of \"f\". For\nformula_243\nthe Jacobian matrix is the \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" matrix whose entries are given by the partial derivatives\nformula_244\nIts determinant, the Jacobian determinant, appears in the higher-dimensional version of integration by substitution: for suitable functions \"f\" and an open subset \"U\" of R\"n\" (the domain of \"f\"), the integral over \"f\"(\"U\") of some other function \"\u03c6\" : R\"n\" \u2192 R\"m\" is given by\nformula_245\nThe Jacobian also occurs in the inverse function theorem.\nWhen applied to the field of Cartography, the determinant can be used to measure the rate of expansion of a map near the poles.\nAreas and Collinearity.\nThe determinant provides a convenient way to calculate the area of a triangle in the xy-plane. The area of a triangle whose vertices are formula_246, formula_247 and formula_248 is given by:\nformula_249\nwhere the sign formula_250 is chosen to yield a positive area. An immediate corollary of this result is that if the determinant is zero, there is no triangle, which implies the points are collinear. The determinant, therefore, provides a useful tool to test for collinearity.\nAbstract algebraic aspects.\nDeterminant of an endomorphism.\nThe above identities concerning the determinant of products and inverses of matrices imply that similar matrices have the same determinant: two matrices \"A\" and \"B\" are similar, if there exists an invertible matrix \"X\" such that \"A\" = \"X\"\u22121\"BX\". Indeed, repeatedly applying the above identities yields\nformula_251\nThe determinant is therefore also called a similarity invariant. The determinant of a linear transformation\nformula_252\nfor some finite-dimensional vector space \"V\" is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it, with respect to an arbitrary choice of basis in \"V\". By the similarity invariance, this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for \"V\" and therefore only depends on the endomorphism \"T\".\nSquare matrices over commutative rings.\nThe above definition of the determinant using the Leibniz rule works more generally when the entries of the matrix are elements of a commutative ring formula_253, such as the integers formula_254, as opposed to the field of real or complex numbers. Moreover, the characterization of the determinant as the unique alternating multilinear map that satisfies formula_255 still holds, as do all the properties that result from that characterization.\nA matrix formula_256 is invertible (in the sense that there is an inverse matrix whose entries are in formula_253) if and only if its determinant is an invertible element in formula_253. For formula_259, this means that the determinant is +1 or \u22121. Such a matrix is called unimodular.\nThe determinant being multiplicative, it defines a group homomorphism\nformula_260\nbetween the general linear group (the group of invertible formula_25-matrices with entries in formula_253) and the multiplicative group of units in formula_253. Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a group homomorphism.\nGiven a ring homomorphism formula_264, there is a map formula_265 given by replacing all entries in formula_253 by their images under formula_267. The determinant respects these maps, i.e., the identity\nformula_268\nholds. In other words, the displayed commutative diagram commutes.\nFor example, the determinant of the complex conjugate of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo formula_269 of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo formula_269 (the latter determinant being computed using modular arithmetic). In the language of category theory, the determinant is a natural transformation between the two functors formula_271 and formula_272. Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of algebraic groups, from the general linear group to the multiplicative group,\nformula_273\nExterior algebra.\nThe determinant of a linear transformation formula_252 of an formula_42-dimensional vector space formula_276 or, more generally a free module of (finite) rank formula_42 over a commutative ring formula_253 can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the formula_42-th exterior power formula_280 of formula_276. The map formula_282 induces a linear map\nformula_283\nAs formula_280 is one-dimensional, the map formula_285 is given by multiplying with some scalar, i.e., an element in formula_253. Some authors such as use this fact to \"define\" the determinant to be the element in formula_253 satisfying the following identity (for all formula_288):\nformula_289\nThis definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition. This can be shown using the uniqueness of a multilinear alternating form on formula_42-tuples of vectors in formula_291.\nFor this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power formula_280 (as opposed to the determinant associated to an endomorphism) is sometimes also called the determinant of formula_276 and similarly for more involved objects such as vector bundles or chain complexes of vector spaces. Minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting, by considering lower alternating forms formula_294 with formula_295.\nBerezin integral.\nThe conventional definition of the determinant, as a sum over permutations over a product of matrix elements, can be written using the somewhat surprising notation of the Berezin integral. In this notation, the determinant can be written as\nformula_296\nThis holds for any formula_141-dimensional matrix formula_298 The symbols formula_299 are two formula_42-dimensional vectors of anti-commuting Grassmann numbers (aka \"supernumbers\"), taken from the Grassmann algebra. The formula_301 here is the exponential function. The integral sign is meant to be understood as the Berezin integral. Despite the use of the integral symbol, this expression is in fact an entirely finite sum.\nThis unusual-looking expression can be understood as a notational trick that rewrites the conventional expression for the determinant\nformula_302\nby using some novel notation. The anti-commuting property of the Grassmann numbers captures the sign (signature) of the permutation, while the integral combined with the formula_301 ensures that all permutations are explored. That is, the Taylor's series for formula_301 terminates after exactly formula_42 terms, because the square of a Grassmann number is zero, and there are exactly formula_42 distinct Grassmann variables. Meanwhile, the integral is defined to vanish, if the corresponding Grassmann number does \"not\" appear in the integrand. Thus, the integral selects out only those terms in the formula_301 series that have exactly formula_42 distinct variables; all lower-order terms vanish. Thus, the somewhat magical combination of the integral sign, the use of anti-commuting variables, and the Taylor's series for formula_301 just encodes a finite sum, identical to the conventional summation.\nThis form is popular in physics, where it is often used as a stand-in for the Jacobian determinant. The appeal is that, notationally, the integral takes the form of a path integral, such as in the path integral formulation for quantized Hamiltonian mechanics. An example can be found in the theory of Fadeev\u2013Popov ghosts; although this theory may seem rather abstruse, it's best to keep in mind that the use of the ghost fields is little more than a notational trick to express a Jacobian determinant.\nThe Pfaffian formula_310 of a skew-symmetric matrix formula_16 is the square-root of the determinant: that is, formula_312 The Berezin integral form for the Pfaffian is even more suggestive; it is\nformula_313\nThe integrand has exactly the same formal structure as a normal Gaussian distribution, albeit with Grassman numbers, instead of real numbers. This formal resemblance accounts for the occasional appearance of supernumbers in the theory of stochastic dynamics and stochastic differential equations.\nGeneralizations and related notions.\nDeterminants as treated above admit several variants: the permanent of a matrix is defined as the determinant, except that the factors formula_30 occurring in Leibniz's rule are omitted. The immanant generalizes both by introducing a character of the symmetric group formula_29 in Leibniz's rule.\nDeterminants for finite-dimensional algebras.\nFor any associative algebra formula_16 that is finite-dimensional as a vector space over a field formula_317, there is a determinant map\nformula_318\nThis definition proceeds by establishing the characteristic polynomial independently of the determinant, and defining the determinant as the lowest order term of this polynomial. This general definition recovers the determinant for the matrix algebra formula_319, but also includes several further cases including the determinant of a quaternion,\nformula_320,\nthe norm formula_321 of a field extension, as well as the Pfaffian of a skew-symmetric matrix and the reduced norm of a central simple algebra, also arise as special cases of this construction.\nInfinite matrices.\nFor matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns, the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated. Functional analysis provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.\nThe Fredholm determinant defines the determinant for operators known as trace class operators by an appropriate generalization of the formula\nformula_322\nAnother infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the functional determinant.\nOperators in von Neumann algebras.\nFor operators in a finite factor, one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant using the canonical trace. In fact, corresponding to every tracial state on a von Neumann algebra there is a notion of Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant.\nRelated notions for non-commutative rings.\nFor matrices over non-commutative rings, multilinearity and alternating properties are incompatible for \"n\" \u2265 2, so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.\nFor square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring, there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings. A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other definitions of the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, such as the multiplicative property or that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix. Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero with a regular element of \"R\" as value on some pair of arguments implies that \"R\" is commutative). Nevertheless, various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated that preserve some of the properties of determinants, notably quasideterminants and the Dieudonn\u00e9 determinant. For some classes of matrices with non-commutative elements, one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs. Examples include the \"q\"-determinant on quantum groups, the Capelli determinant on Capelli matrices, and the Berezinian on supermatrices (i.e., matrices whose entries are elements of formula_323-graded rings). Manin matrices form the class closest to matrices with commutative elements.\nCalculation.\nDeterminants are mainly used as a theoretical tool. They are rarely calculated explicitly in numerical linear algebra, where for applications such as checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques. Computational geometry, however, does frequently use calculations related to determinants.\nWhile the determinant can be computed directly using the Leibniz rule this approach is extremely inefficient for large matrices, since that formula requires calculating formula_3 (formula_42 factorial) products for an formula_25 matrix. Thus, the number of required operations grows very quickly: it is of order formula_3. The Laplace expansion is similarly inefficient. Therefore, more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants.\nGaussian elimination.\nGaussian elimination consists of left multiplying a matrix by elementary matrices for getting a matrix in a row echelon form. One can restrict the computation to elementary matrices of determinant 1. In this case, the determinant of the resulting row echelon form equals the determinant of the initial matrix. As a row echelon form is a triangular matrix, its determinant is the product of the entries of its diagonal.\nSo, the determinant can be computed for almost free from the result of a Gaussian elimination.\nDecomposition methods.\nSome methods compute formula_328 by writing the matrix as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed. Such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods. Examples include the LU decomposition, the QR decomposition or the Cholesky decomposition (for positive definite matrices). These methods are of order formula_213, which is a significant improvement over formula_330.\nFor example, LU decomposition expresses formula_16 as a product\nformula_332\nof a permutation matrix formula_333 (which has exactly a single formula_166 in each column, and otherwise zeros), a lower triangular matrix formula_335 and an upper triangular matrix formula_336.\nThe determinants of the two triangular matrices formula_335 and formula_336 can be quickly calculated, since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries. The determinant of formula_333 is just the sign formula_340 of the corresponding permutation (which is formula_341 for an even number of permutations and is formula_342 for an odd number of permutations). Once such a LU decomposition is known for formula_16, its determinant is readily computed as\nformula_344\nFurther methods.\nThe order formula_213 reached by decomposition methods has been improved by different methods. If two matrices of order formula_42 can be multiplied in time formula_347, where formula_348 for some formula_349, then there is an algorithm computing the determinant in time formula_350. This means, for example, that an formula_351 algorithm for computing the determinant exists based on the Coppersmith\u2013Winograd algorithm. This exponent has been further lowered, as of 2016, to 2.373.\nIn addition to the complexity of the algorithm, further criteria can be used to compare algorithms.\nEspecially for applications concerning matrices over rings, algorithms that compute the determinant without any divisions exist. (By contrast, Gauss elimination requires divisions.) One such algorithm, having complexity formula_352 is based on the following idea: one replaces permutations (as in the Leibniz rule) by so-called closed ordered walks, in which several items can be repeated. The resulting sum has more terms than in the Leibniz rule, but in the process several of these products can be reused, making it more efficient than naively computing with the Leibniz rule. Algorithms can also be assessed according to their bit complexity, i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the Gaussian elimination (or LU decomposition) method is of order formula_213, but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long. By comparison, the Bareiss Algorithm, is an exact-division method (so it does use division, but only in cases where these divisions can be performed without remainder) is of the same order, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times formula_42.\nIf the determinant of \"A\" and the inverse of \"A\" have already been computed, the matrix determinant lemma allows rapid calculation of the determinant of \"A\" + \"uv\"T, where \"u\" and \"v\" are column vectors.\nCharles Dodgson (i.e. Lewis Carroll of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" fame) invented a method for computing determinants called Dodgson condensation. This method does not always work in its original form.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8470", "revid": "42677165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8470", "title": "David Ricardo", "text": "British economist and politician (1772\u20131823)\nDavid Ricardo (18 April 1772 \u2013 11 September 1823) was a British economist and politician of Portuguese Jewish descent. He is recognized as one of the most influential classical economists, alongside figures such as Thomas Malthus, Adam Smith and James Mill.\nRicardo was born in London as the third surviving child of a successful stockbroker and his wife. He came from a Sephardic Jewish family of Portuguese origin. At 21, he eloped with a Quaker and converted to Unitarianism, causing estrangement from his family. He made his fortune financing government borrowing and later retired to an estate in Gloucestershire. Ricardo served as High Sheriff of Gloucestershire and bought a seat in Parliament as an earnest reformer. He was friends with prominent figures like James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Thomas Malthus, engaging in debates over various topics. Ricardo was also a member of The Geological Society, and his youngest sister was an author.\nAs MP for Portarlington, Ricardo advocated for liberal political movements and reforms, including free trade, parliamentary reform, and criminal law reform. He believed free trade increased the well-being of people by making goods more affordable. Ricardo notably opposed the Corn Laws, which he saw as barriers to economic growth. His friend John Louis Mallett described Ricardo's conviction in his beliefs, though he expressed doubts about Ricardo's disregard for experience and practice. Ricardo died at 51 from an ear infection that led to septicaemia (sepsis). He left behind a considerable fortune and a lasting legacy, with his free trade views eventually becoming public policy in Britain.\nRicardo wrote his first economics article at age 37, advocating for a reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England. He was also an abolitionist and believed in the autonomy of a central bank as the issuer of money. Ricardo worked on fixing issues in Adam Smith's labour theory of value, stating that the value of a commodity depends on the labour necessary for its production. He contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits, defining rent as the difference between the produce obtained by employing equal quantities of capital and labour. Ricardo's Theory of Profit posited that as real wages increase, real profits decrease due to the revenue split between profits and wages.\nRicardian theory of international trade challenges the mercantilist concept of accumulating gold or silver by promoting industry specialization and free trade. Ricardo introduced the concept of \"comparative advantage\", suggesting that nations should concentrate resources only in industries where they have the greatest efficiency of production relative to their own alternative uses of resources. He argued that international trade is always beneficial, even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart. Ricardo opposed protectionism for national economies and was concerned about the short-term impact of technological change on labour.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in London, England, Ricardo was the third surviving of the 17 children of successful stockbroker Abraham Israel Ricardo (1733?\u20131812) and Abigail (1753\u20131801), daughter of Abraham Delvalle (also \"del Valle\"), of a respectable Sephardic Jewish family that had been settled in England for three generations as \"small but prosperous\" tobacco and snuff merchants, and had obtained British citizenship. Abigail's sister, Rebecca, was wife of the engraver Wilson Lowry, and mother of the engraver Joseph Wilson Lowry and the geologist, mineralogist, and author Delvalle Lowry. The Ricardo family were Sephardic Jews of Portuguese origin who had recently relocated from the Dutch Republic. Ricardo began working with his father at the age of 14. At the age of 21, Ricardo eloped with a Quaker, Priscilla Anne Wilkinson, and against his father's wishes, converted to Unitarianism. This religious difference resulted in estrangement from his family, and he was led to adopt a position of independence. His father disowned him and his mother apparently never spoke to him again.\nFollowing this estrangement he went into business for himself with the support of Lubbocks and Forster, an eminent banking house. He made the bulk of his fortune by profitably financing Government borrowing. A popular story states that he made his fortune as a result of speculation on the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo: in Ricardo's obituary, published on 14 September 1823,\"The Sunday Times\" reported that during the battle Ricardo \"netted upwards of a million sterling\", a huge sum at the time, and this was later popularised by the economist Paul Samuelson. In reality, Ricardo was already very rich, and in June 1815, sold his latest government stock before the result of the battle was known in London, missing half of the rise.\nHe subsequently purchased Gatcombe Park, an estate in Gloucestershire, and retired to the country. He was appointed High Sheriff of Gloucestershire for 1818\u201319. In August 1818 he bought Lord Portarlington's seat in Parliament for \u00a34,000, as part of the terms of a loan of \u00a325,000. His record in Parliament was that of an earnest reformer. He held the seat until his death five years later.\nRicardo was a close friend of James Mill. Other notable friends included Jeremy Bentham and Thomas Malthus, with whom Ricardo had a considerable debate (in correspondence) over such things as the role of landowners in a society. He also was a member of Malthus' Political Economy Club, and a member of the King of Clubs. He was one of the original members of The Geological Society. His youngest sister was author Sarah Ricardo-Porter (e.g., \"Conversations in Arithmetic\").\nParliamentary record.\nAs MP for Portarlington, Ricardo voted with the opposition in support of liberal political movements in Naples and Sicily, and for inquiry into the administration of justice in Tobago. He divided for (voted for) repeal of the Blasphemous and Seditious Libels Act; then for inquiry into the Peterloo Massacre; and, in 1821, for abolition of the death penalty for forgery.\nHe supported free trade. In 1821 he voted against renewal of the sugar duties, and objected to the higher duty on \"East\" Indian as opposed to \"West\" Indian produce. He opposed the timber duties. He voted silently for parliamentary reform and in 1822 spoke in its favour at the Westminster anniversary reform dinner; and again voted for criminal law reform.\nRicardo believed that increasing imports and free trade boosted the well-being of mankind by increasing the amount of goods cheaply available for subsistence and consumption. He was said to have \"possessed an extraordinary quickness in perceiving in the turns of the market any accidental difference which might arise between the relative price of different stocks\". He grew his wealth dealing in securities during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.\nAs the Napoleonic Wars waged on, Ricardo developed a disdain for the Corn Laws imposed by the British to encourage exports. Notably, government intervention in the grain trade can be traced as far back as the 1400s; and thereafter trade was controlled, regulated, and taxed. Meanwhile, England developed a capitalist economy involving workers and landlords generating and consuming incomes and capital accumulations that depended entirely on capitalists' profits, and these key economic elements were under perpetual pressure during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.\nPolitical reform was needed as agricultural output was struggling to keep pace with population growth. The Corn Laws imposed barriers to imports that increased subsistence/consumption costs and triggered demand for higher wages. Higher wages reduced profits for agricultural producers, and had the immediate effects of reducing capital investments and slowing the growth of a nation's economy. Rising rents, attributed by Ricardo to the Corn Laws, came at the expense of the economic profits of nations. For David Ricardo, free trade was ever the answer; he envisioned Britain as importing agriculture products in exchange for exporting manufactured goods. Eventually, after his death, the interventionist laws were repealed, and his free trade views became public policy in Britain.\nOf David Ricardo, his friend John Louis Mallett commented: \" ... he meets you upon every subject that he has studied with a mind made up, and opinions in the nature of mathematical truths. He spoke of parliamentary reform and ballot as a man who would bring such things about, and destroy the existing system tomorrow, if it were in his power, and without the slightest doubt on the result ... It is this very quality of the man's mind, his entire disregard of experience and practice, which makes me doubtful of his opinions on political economy.\"\nDeath and legacy.\nTen years after retiring and four years after entering Parliament, Ricardo died at 51 from an infection of the middle ear that spread into his brain and induced septicaemia.\nHe and his wife Priscilla had eight children together including Osman Ricardo (1795\u20131881, MP for Worcester 1847\u20131865), David Ricardo (1803\u20131864, MP for Stroud 1832\u20131833) and Mortimer Ricardo, who served as an officer in the Life Guards and was a deputy lieutenant for Oxfordshire.\nRicardo is buried in an ornate grave in the churchyard of Saint Nicholas in Hardenhuish, now a suburb of Chippenham, Wiltshire. At the time of his death, his assets were estimated at \u00a3675,000\u2013\u00a3775,000.\nIdeas.\nRicardo wrote his first economics article at 37, firstly in \"The Morning Chronicle\" advocating reduction in the note-issuing of the Bank of England and then publishing \"The High Price of Bullion, a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes\" in 1810.\nHe was also an abolitionist, speaking at a meeting of the Court of the East India Company in March 1823, where he said he regarded slavery as a stain on the character of the nation.\nBanking.\nAdam Smith argued that free commercial banking, such as the banking system in Scotland which had no central bank when \"Wealth of Nations\" was written in 1776, was favourable to economic growth. Writing just a few decades later, Ricardo argued for a central bank, a cause that was taken up by his students, including John Stuart Mill, who was known to favour the \"laissez-faire\" policies in every place but banking.\nRicardo wrote the \"Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank\" (published posthumously in 1824), which argued for the autonomy of the central bank as the issuer of money.\nRicardo proposed that a ratio of gold and Treasury bills, and a fixed claim (asset) against the government, would secure the central bank's liquidity:\nThe public, or the Government on behalf of the public, is indebted to the Bank in a sum of money larger than the whole amount of Bank notes in circulation; for the Government not only owes the Bank fifteen million, its original capital, which is lent at 3 per cent. interest, but also many more millions which are advanced on Exchequer bills, on half-pay and pension annuities, and on other securities. It is evident, therefore, that if the Government itself were to be the sole issuer of paper money instead of borrowing it of the Bank, the only difference would be with respect to the interest: the Bank would no longer receive interest and the Government would no longer pay it; but all other classes in the community would be exactly in the same position in which they now stand.\nRicardo was a man of many trades, economically and financially speaking. Ricardo was able to recognize and identify the problem presented through banking within regulations and debauched standards of approval at certain times. Ricardo knew that banks in rural areas as well as the Bank of England had increased note lending and overall lending in 1810. Through this, Ricardo proved subsequent changes in price level through the market was also affected and thus new regulations needed to be made available. Furthermore, Ricardo was able to understand and distinguish the socioeconomic makeup that created and established parameters around different classes within the economy. Ricardo advocated for the productive powers of labour to be held in high concern as the most influential of devices that played a role in the progression of the American Economy along with others. In addition, Ricardo made notable advancements in the concept build involving reactions in the open market when considering banking altercations, stock investments, or other considerable impacting events. Ricardo wanted to establish a firm ground between the bank and the control over monetary policy because there was power within the banking system that Ricardo believed needed to be considered carefully. In 1816, Ricardo said \"In the present state of the law, they have the power, without any control whatever, of increasing or reducing the circulation in any degree they may think proper: a power which should neither be entrusted to the State itself, nor to anybody in it; as there can be no security for the uniformity in the value of the currency, when its augmentation or diminution depends solely on the will of the issuers.\" Ricardo felt the circulation of money and the decision behind how much is available at any time should not be entrusted to either the State, or any individual. Ricardo argued for the most even distribution possible with the highest control readily available.\nValue theory.\nDavid Ricardo worked to fix the issues he felt were most concerning with Adam Smith's Labour Theory of Value. Both men worked with the assumption that land, labour, and capital were the three basic factors of production. However, Smith narrowed in on labour as the determinant of value. Ricardo believes that with production having three factors it is impossible for only one of them to determine value on its own. Ricardo illustrates his point by adapting Smith's deer-beaver analogy to show that even when labour is the only factor of production the hardship and tools of the labour will drive a wedge in the relative value of the good. Due to his criticisms of the Labour Theory of Value George Stigler called his theory a \"93% labor theory of value\".\nRicardo's most famous work is his \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\" (1817). He advanced a labour theory of value:\nThe value of a commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange, depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its production, and not on the greater or less compensation which is paid for that labour.\nRicardo's note to Section VI:\nMr. Malthus appears to think that it is a part of my doctrine, that the cost and value of a thing be the same;\u2014it is, if he means by cost, \"cost of production\" including profit.\nRent.\nRicardo contributed to the development of theories of rent, wages, and profits. He defined rent as \"the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and labour.\" Ricardo believed that the process of economic development, which increased land use and eventually led to the cultivation of poorer land, principally benefited landowners. According to Ricardo, such premium over \"real social value\" that is reaped due to ownership constitutes value to an individual but is at best a paper monetary return to \"society\". The portion of such purely individual benefit that accrues to scarce resources Ricardo labels \"rent\".\nIn particular, Ricardo postulates that rent is a result of increased populations which results in assets growing scarce and in some cases diminished returns of which were once abundant. Ricardo breaks down this premise by first supposing there are three fields of land \u2013 No. 1, 2, 3, \u2013 to yield corn, with an equal employment of capital and labour. Initially land No. 1 is cultivated and is very productive as measured through the abundant surplus. Over time this abundant surplus becomes diminished as the result of an increase in population, which subsequently creates an increased demand for food. The less desired land, No. 2, must now be cultivated and eventually so must land No. 3 and so on and so forth. For Ricardo each new cultivated results in diminished surplus as the quality of land fails to yield the equal of that before it. In light of such diminishing surplus landowners see opportunities to charge rent as a means to compensate for the loss of returns on output.\nModel-making.\nAccording to sociologist of quantification Mary S. Morgan David Ricardo can be considered \"one of the pioneers in economic modelling\". In studying rents, for example, Ricardo experiments numerically to determine the relative share of profit accruing to land owner, capital holder and laborers through what Morgan calls 'numerical model farming'. In his numerical and verbal accounts Ricardo tests different improvements in capital, technology or labour to increase the yield of a farm, paralleling actual experiments run by his contemporaries such as \"Turnip\" Townshend.\nRicardo's theories of wages and profits.\nIn his \"Theory of Profit\", Ricardo stated that as real wages increase, real profits decrease because the revenue from the sale of manufactured goods is split between profits and wages. He said in his \"Essay on Profits\", \"Profits depend on high or low wages, wages on the price of necessaries, and the price of necessaries chiefly on the price of food.\"\nRicardian theory of international trade.\nBetween 1500 and 1750 most economists advocated mercantilism, which promoted the idea of international trade for the purpose of earning bullion by running a trade surplus with other countries. Ricardo challenged the idea that the purpose of trade was merely to accumulate gold or silver. With \"comparative advantage\" Ricardo argued in favour of industry specialisation and free trade. He suggested that industry specialization combined with free international trade always produces positive results. This theory expanded on the concept of absolute advantage.\nRicardo suggested that there is mutual national benefit from trade even if one country is more competitive in every area than its trading counterpart and that a nation should concentrate resources only in industries where it has a comparative advantage, that is in those industries in which it has the greatest efficiency of production relative to its own alternative uses of resources, rather than industries where it holds a competitive edge compared to rival nations. Ricardo suggested that national industries which were, in fact, mildly profitable and marginally internationally competitive should be jettisoned in favour of the industries that made the best use of limited resources\u2014the assumption being that subsequent economic growth due to better resource use would more than offset any short-run economic dislocation which would result from closing mildly profitable and marginally competitive national industries.\nRicardo attempted to prove theoretically that international trade is always beneficial. Paul Samuelson called the numbers used in Ricardo's example dealing with trade between England and Portugal the \"four magic numbers\". \"In spite of the fact that the Portuguese could produce both cloth and wine with less amount of labour, Ricardo suggested that both countries would benefit from trade with each other\".\nAs for recent extensions of Ricardian models, see Ricardian trade theory extensions.\nComparative advantage.\nRicardo's theory of international trade was reformulated by John Stuart Mill in 1844. The term \"comparative advantage\" was introduced by J.S. Mill and his contemporaries.\nJohn Stuart Mill started a neoclassical turn of international trade theory, i.e. his formulation was inherited by Alfred Marshall and others, and has both contributed to the resurrection of the anti-Ricardian concept of law of supply and demand, and induced the arrival of neoclassical theory of value.\nNew interpretation.\nRicardo's four magic numbers have long been interpreted as comparison of two ratios of labour (or other input in fixed supply) coefficients. This interpretation is now considered as overly simplistic by modern economists. The point was rediscovered by Roy J. Ruffin in 2002 and re-examined and explained in detail in Andrea Maneschi in 2004. The more flexible approach is now known as the \"new interpretation\", despite having been previously mentioned by Piero Sraffa in 1930 and by Kenzo Yukizawa in 1974. The new interpretation affords a totally new reading of Ricardo's \"Principles of Political Economy and Taxation\" with regards to trade theory, although it does not change the mathematics of optimal resource allocation.\nProtectionism.\nLike Adam Smith, Ricardo was an opponent of protectionism for national economies, especially for agriculture. He believed that the British \"Corn Laws\"\u2014imposing tariffs on agricultural products\u2014ensured that less-productive domestic land would be cultivated and rents would be driven up . Thus, profits would be directed toward landlords and away from the emerging industrial capitalists. Ricardo believed landlords tended to squander their wealth on luxuries, rather than invest. He believed the Corn Laws were leading to the stagnation of the British economy. In 1846, his nephew John Lewis Ricardo, MP for Stoke-upon-Trent, advocated free trade and the repeal of the Corn Laws.\nModern empirical analysis of the Corn Laws yields mixed results. Parliament repealed the Corn Laws in 1846.\nTechnological change.\nRicardo was concerned about the impact of technological change on labour in the short-term. In 1821, he wrote that he had become \"convinced that the substitution of machinery for human labour, is often very injurious to the interests of the class of labourers\", and that \"the opinion entertained by the labouring class, that the employment of machinery is frequently detrimental to their interests, is not founded on prejudice and error, but is conformable to the correct principles of political economy.\" Ricardo's idea of technological change is now formulated in a modern form.\nCriticism of the Ricardian theory of trade.\nRicardo himself was the first to recognize that comparative advantage is a domain-specific theory, meaning that it applies only when certain conditions are met. Ricardo noted that the theory applies only in situations where capital is immobile. Regarding his famous example, he wrote:\nit would undoubtedly be advantageous to the capitalists [and consumers] of England ... [that] the wine and cloth should both be made in Portugal [and that] the capital and labour of England employed in making cloth should be removed to Portugal for that purpose.\nRicardo recognized that applying his theory in situations where capital was mobile would result in offshoring, and thereby economic decline and job loss. To correct for this, he argued that (i) \"most men of property [will be] satisfied with a low rate of profits in their own country, rather than seek[ing] a more advantageous employment for their wealth in foreign nations\", and (ii) capital was functionally immobile.\nRicardo's argument in favour of free trade has also been attacked by those who believe trade restriction can be necessary for the economic development of a nation. Utsa Patnaik claims that Ricardian theory of international trade contains a logical fallacy. Ricardo assumed that in both countries two goods are producible and actually are produced, but developed and underdeveloped countries often trade those goods which are not producible in their own country. In these cases, one cannot define which country has comparative advantage.\nCritics also argue that Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage is flawed in that it assumes production is continuous and absolute. In the real world, events outside the realm of human control (e.g. natural disasters) can disrupt production. In this case, specialisation could cripple a country that depends on imports from foreign, naturally disrupted countries. For example, if an industrially based country trades its manufactured goods with an agrarian country in exchange for agricultural products, a natural disaster in the agricultural country (e.g. drought) may cause the industrially based country to starve.\nAs Joan Robinson pointed out, following the opening of free trade with England, Portugal endured centuries of economic underdevelopment: \"the imposition of free trade on Portugal killed off a promising textile industry and left her with a slow-growing export market for wine, while for England, exports of cotton cloth led to accumulation, mechanisation and the whole spiralling growth of the industrial revolution\". Robinson argued that Ricardo's example required that economies be in static equilibrium positions with full employment and that there could not be a trade deficit or a trade surplus. These conditions, she wrote, were not relevant to the real world. She also argued that Ricardo's math did not take into account that some countries may be at different levels of development and that this raised the prospect of 'unequal exchange' which might hamper a country's development, as we saw in the case of Portugal.\nThe development economist Ha-Joon Chang challenges the argument that free trade benefits every country:\nRicardo's theory is absolutely right\u2014within its narrow confines. His theory correctly says that, \"accepting their current levels of technology as given\", it is better for countries to specialize in things that they are relatively better at. One cannot argue with that. His theory fails when a country wants to acquire more advanced technologies\u2014that is, when it wants to develop its economy. It takes time and experience to absorb new technologies, so technologically backward producers need a period of protection from international competition during this period of learning. Such protection is costly, because the country is giving up the chance to import better and cheaper products. However, it is a price that has to be paid if it wants to develop advanced industries. Ricardo's theory is, thus seen, for those who accept the \"status quo\" but not for those who want to change it.\nRicardian equivalence.\nAnother idea associated with Ricardo is Ricardian equivalence, an argument suggesting that in some circumstances a government's choice of how to pay for its spending (\"i.e.,\" whether to use tax revenue or issue debt and run a deficit) might have no effect on the economy. This is due to the fact the public saves its excess money to pay for expected future tax increases that will be used to pay off the debt. Ricardo notes that the proposition is theoretically implied in the presence of intertemporal optimisation by rational taxpayers: but that since taxpayers do not act so rationally, the proposition fails to be true in practice. Thus, while the proposition bears his name, he does not seem to have believed it. Economist Robert Barro is responsible for its modern prominence.\nInfluence and intellectual legacy.\nDavid Ricardo's ideas had a tremendous influence on later developments in economics. US economists rank Ricardo as the second most influential economic thinker, behind Adam Smith, prior to the twentieth century.\nRicardian socialists.\nDespite his laissez-faire capitalist views, Ricardo's writings fascinated a number of early socialists in the 1820s, who thought his value theory had radical implications. They argued that, in view of labour theory of value, labour produces the entire product, and the profits capitalists get are a result of exploitations of workers. These include Thomas Hodgskin, William Thompson, John Francis Bray, and Percy Ravenstone.\nGeorgists.\nGeorgists believe that rent, in the sense that Ricardo used, belongs to the community as a whole. Henry George was greatly influenced by Ricardo, and often cited him, including in his most famous work, \"Progress and Poverty\" from 1879. In the preface to the fourth edition he wrote: \"What I have done in this book, if I have correctly solved the great problem I have sought to investigate, is, to unite the truth perceived by the school of Smith and Ricardo to the truth perceived by the school of Proudhon and Lasalle; to show that laissez faire (in its full true meaning) opens the way to a realization of the noble dreams of socialism; to identify social law with moral law, and to disprove ideas which in the minds of many cloud grand and elevating perceptions.\"\nNeo-Ricardians.\nAfter the rise of the 'neoclassical' school, Ricardo's influence declined temporarily. It was Piero Sraffa, the editor of the Collected Works of David Ricardo and the author of seminal \"Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities\", who resurrected Ricardo as the originator of another strand of economic thought, which was effaced with the arrival of the neoclassical school. The new interpretation of Ricardo and Sraffa's criticism against the marginal theory of value gave rise to a new school, now named neo-Ricardian or Sraffian school. Major contributors to this school include Luigi Pasinetti (1930\u20132023), Pierangelo Garegnani (1930\u20132011), Ian Steedman (1941\u2013), Geoffrey Harcourt (1931\u20132021), Heinz Kurz (1946\u2013), Neri Salvadori (1951\u2013), Pier Paolo Saviotti (\u2013) among others. See also Neo-Ricardianism. The Neo-Ricardian school is sometimes seen to be a component of Post-Keynesian economics.\nNeo-Ricardian trade theory.\nInspired by Piero Sraffa, a new strand of trade theory emerged and was named neo-Ricardian trade theory. The main contributors include Ian Steedman and Stanley Metcalfe. They have criticised neoclassical international trade theory, namely the Heckscher\u2013Ohlin model on the basis that the notion of capital as primary factor has no method of measuring it before the determination of profit rate (thus trapped in a logical vicious circle). This was a second round of the Cambridge capital controversy, this time in the field of international trade. Depoort\u00e8re and Ravix judge that neo-Ricardian contribution failed without giving effective impact on neoclassical trade theory, because it could not offer \"a genuine alternative approach from a classical point of view.\"\nEvolutionary growth theory.\nSeveral distinctive groups have sprung out of the neo-Ricardian school. One is the evolutionary growth theory, developed notably by Luigi Pasinetti, J.S. Metcalfe, Pier Paolo Saviotti, and Koen Frenken and others.\nPasinetti argued that the demand for any commodity came to stagnate and frequently decline, demand saturation occurs. Introduction of new commodities (goods and services) is necessary to avoid economic stagnation.\nContemporary theories.\nRicardo's idea was even expanded to the case of continuum of goods by Dornbusch, Fischer, and Samuelson This formulation is employed for example by Matsuyama and others.\nRicardian trade theory ordinarily assumes that the labour is the unique input. This is a deficiency as intermediate goods occupies now a great part of international trade. The situation changed after the appearance of 's work of 2007. He has succeeded to incorporate traded input goods in his model. His theory became more useful by the discovery of new definition of regular international values (a couple of wage rates for countries and prices for products), because it is not defined as the normal vector at a facet of world production possibility set, which is the set where all countries enjoy full employment. The new definition is given in Shiozawa and Fujimoto (2018) and in Shiozawa (2020). Shiozawa's theory of international values is now the unique theory of international trade that can treat unemployment and input trade in a general form.\nYeats found that 30% of world trade in manufacturing is intermediate inputs. Bardhan and Jafee found that intermediate inputs occupy 37 to 38% in the imports to the US for the years from 1992 to 1997, whereas the percentage of intrafirm trade grew from 43% in 1992 to 52% in 1997.\nUnequal exchange.\nChris Edward includes Emmanuel's unequal exchange theory among variations of neo-Ricardian trade theory. Arghiri Emmanuel argued that the Third World is poor because of the international exploitation of labour.\nThe unequal exchange theory of trade has been influential to the (new) dependency theory.\nPublications.\nRicardo's publications included:\nHis works and writings were collected in (11 volumes)\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its name is the Latin version for the Greek word for dolphin (). It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. It is one of the smaller constellations, ranked 69th in size. Delphinus' five brightest stars form a distinctive asterism symbolizing a dolphin with four stars representing the body and one the tail. It is bordered (clockwise from north) by Vulpecula, Sagitta, Aquila, Aquarius, Equuleus and Pegasus.\nDelphinus is a faint constellation with only two stars brighter than an apparent magnitude of 4, Beta Delphini (Rotanev) at magnitude 3.6 and Alpha Delphini (Sualocin) at magnitude 3.8.\nMythology.\nDelphinus is associated with two stories from Greek mythology.\nAccording to myth, the first Greek god Poseidon wanted to marry Amphitrite, a beautiful nereid. However, wanting to protect her virginity, she fled to the Atlas Mountains. Her suitor then sent out several searchers, among them a certain Delphinus. Delphinus accidentally stumbled upon her and persuaded Amphitrite to accept Poseidon's wooing. Out of gratitude, the god placed the image of a dolphin among the stars.\nThe second story tells of the Greek poet Arion of Lesbos (7th century BC), who a dolphin saved. He was a court musician at the palace of Periander, ruler of Corinth. Arion had amassed a fortune during his travels to Sicily and Italy. On his way home from Tarentum, his wealth caused the crew of his ship to conspire against him. Threatened with death, Arion asked to be granted a last wish, which the crew granted: he wanted to sing a dirge. This he did, and while doing so, flung himself into the sea. There, he was rescued by a dolphin which had been charmed by Arion's music. The dolphin carried Arion to the coast of Greece and left.\nIn non-Western astronomy.\nIn Chinese astronomy, the stars of Delphinus are located within \"the Black Tortoise of the North\" (\u5317\u65b9\u7384\u6b66, \"B\u011bi F\u0101ng Xu\u00e1n W\u01d4\").\nIn Polynesia, two cultures recognized Delphinus as a constellation. In Pukapuka, it was called \"Te Toloa\" and in the Tuamotus, it was called \"Te Uru-o-tiki\".\nIn Hindu astrology, the Delphinus corresponds to the Nakshatra, or lunar mansion, of Dhanishta.\nCharacteristics.\nDelphinus is bordered by Vulpecula to the north, Sagitta to the northwest, Aquila to the west and southwest, Aquarius to the southeast, Equuleus to the east and Pegasus to the east. Covering 188.5\u00a0square degrees, corresponding to 0.457% of the sky, it ranks 69th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is \"Del\". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eug\u00e8ne Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 20h 14m 14.1594s and 21h 08m 59.6073s, while the declination coordinates are between \u00b0 and \u00b0. The whole constellation is visible to observers north of latitude 69\u00b0S.\nFeatures.\nStars.\nDelphinus has two stars above fourth (apparent) magnitude; its brightest star is of magnitude 3.6. The main asterism in Delphinus is Job's Coffin, nearly a 45\u00b0-apex lozenge or diamond of the four brightest stars: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta Delphini. Delphinus is in a rich Milky Way star field. Alpha and Beta Delphini have 19th-century names Sualocin and Rotanev, read backwards: Nicolaus Venator, the Latinized name of a Palermo Observatory director, Niccol\u00f2 Cacciatore (d. 1841).\nAlpha Delphini is a blue-white hued main sequence star of magnitude 3.8, 241 light-years from Earth. It is a spectroscopic binary. It is officially named Sualocin. The star has an absolute magnitude of -0.4.\nBeta Delphini is officially called Rotanev. It was found to be a binary star in 1873. The gap between its close binary stars is visible from large amateur telescopes. To the unaided eye, it appears to be a white star of magnitude 3.6. It has a period of 27 years and is 97 light-years from Earth.\nGamma Delphini is a celebrated binary star among amateur astronomers. The primary is orange-gold of magnitude 4.3; the secondary is a light yellow star of magnitude 5.1. The pair forms a true binary with an estimated orbital period of over 3,000 years. 125 light-years away, the two components are visible in a small amateur telescope. The secondary, also described as green, is 10 arcseconds from the primary. Struve 2725, called the \"Ghost Double\", is a pair that appears similar but dimmer. Its components of magnitudes 7.6 and 8.4 are separated by 6 arcseconds and are 15 arcminutes from Gamma Delphini itself. An unconfirmed exoplanet with a minimum mass of 0.7 Jupiter masses may orbit one of the stars.\nDelta Delphini is a type A-type star of magnitude 4.43. It is a spectroscopic binary, and both stars are Delta Scuti variables.\nEpsilon Delphini, Deneb Dulfim (lit. \"tail [of the] Dolphin\"), or Aldulfin, is a star of stellar class B6\u00a0III. Its magnitude is variable at around 4.03.\nZeta Delphini, an A3Va main-sequence star of magnitude 4.6, was in 2014 discovered to have a brown dwarf orbiting around it. Zeta Delphini B has a mass of 50\u00b115 MJ.\nRho Aquilae at magnitude 4.94 is at about 150 light-years away. Due to its proper motion, it has been in the (round-figure parameter) bounds of the constellation since 1992. It is an A-type main sequence star with a lower metallicity than the Sun.\nHR Delphini was a nova that brightened to magnitude 3.5 in December 1967. It took an unusually long time for the nova to reach peak brightness which indicate that it barely satisfied the conditions for a thermonuclear runaway. Another nova by the name V339 Delphini was detected in 2013; it peaked at magnitude 4.3 and was the first nova observed to produce lithium.\nMusica, also known by its Flamsteed designation 18 Delphini, is one of the five stars with known planets located in Delphinus. It has a spectral type of G6 III. Arion, the planet, is a very dense and massive planet with a mass at least 10.3 times greater than Jupiter. Arion was part of the first NameExoWorlds contest where the public got the opportunity to suggest names for exoplanets and their host stars.\nExoplanets.\nIn 2024 the planet TOI-6883 b was discovered in the constellation Delphinus. It has a 16.249 day orbital period around its host star, a radius 1.08 times Jupiter's, and a mass 4.34 times Jupiter's. It was discovered from a single transit in TESS data and it was confirmed by a network of citizen scientists. \nIn 2024, the planet TOI-6883 c was discovered in the constellation Delphinus. It has an orbital period of 7.8458 days, a radius of 0.7 times Jupiter's, and a third of Jupiter's mass. The Neptunian-size planet was discovered from an abnormality in data retrieved from TOI-6883 c.\nDeep-sky objects.\nIts rich Milky Way star field means many modestly deep-sky objects. NGC 6891 is a planetary nebula of magnitude 10.5; another is NGC 6905 or the Blue Flash Nebula. The Blue Flash Nebula shows broad emission lines. The central star in NGC 6905 has a spectral type of WO2, meaning it is rich in oxygen. \nNGC 6934 is a globular cluster of magnitude 9.75. It is about 52,000 light-years away from the Solar System. It is in the Shapley-Sawyer Concentration Class VIII and is thought to share a common origin with another globular cluster in Bo\u00f6tes. It has an intermediate metallicity for a globular cluster, but as of 2018 it has been poorly studied. At a distance of about 137,000 light-years, the globular cluster NGC 7006 is at the outer reaches of the galaxy. It is also fairly dim at magnitude 11.5 and is in Class I.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8472", "revid": "49800720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8472", "title": "Disk storage", "text": "General category of storage mechanisms\nDisk storage (also sometimes called drive storage) is a data storage mechanism based on a rotating disk. The recording employs various electronic, magnetic, optical, or mechanical changes to the disk's surface layer. A disk drive is a device implementing such a storage mechanism. Notable types are hard disk drives (HDD), containing one or more non-removable rigid platters; the floppy disk drive (FDD) and its removable floppy disk; and various optical disc drives (ODD) and associated optical disc media.\nBackground.\nAudio information was originally recorded by analog methods (see Sound recording and reproduction). Similarly, the first video disc used an analog recording method. In the music industry, analog recording has been mostly replaced by digital optical technology, where the data is recorded in a digital format with optical information.\nThe first commercial digital disk storage device was the IBM 350 which shipped in 1956 as a part of the IBM 305 RAMAC computing system. The random-access, low-density storage of disks was developed to complement the already used sequential-access, high-density storage provided by tape drives using magnetic tape. Vigorous innovation in disk storage technology, coupled with less vigorous innovation in tape storage, has reduced the difference in acquisition cost per terabyte between disk storage and tape storage; however, the total cost of ownership of data on disk including power and management remains larger than that of tape.\nDisk storage is now used in both computer storage and consumer electronic storage, e.g., audio CDs and video discs (VCD, DVD and Blu-ray).\nData on modern disks is stored in fixed length blocks, usually called sectors and varying in length from a few hundred to many thousands of bytes. Gross disk drive capacity is simply the number of disk surfaces times the number of blocks/surface times the number of bytes/block. In certain legacy IBM CKD drives the data was stored on magnetic disks with variable length blocks, called records; record length could vary on and between disks. Capacity decreased as record length decreased due to the necessary gaps between blocks.\nAccess methods.\nDigital disk drives are block storage devices. Each disk is divided into logical blocks (collection of sectors). Blocks are addressed using their logical block addresses (LBA). Read from or write to disk happens at the granularity of blocks.\nOriginally the disk capacity was quite low and has been improved in one of several ways. Improvements in mechanical design and manufacture allowed smaller and more precise heads, meaning that more tracks could be stored on each of the disks. Advancements in data compression methods permitted more information to be stored in each of the individual sectors.\nThe drive stores data onto cylinders, heads, and sectors. The sector unit is the smallest size of data to be stored in a hard disk drive, and each file will have many sector units assigned to it. The smallest entity in a CD is called a frame, which consists of 33 bytes and contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples (two bytes \u00d7 two channels \u00d7 six samples = 24 bytes). The other nine bytes consist of eight CIRC error-correction bytes and one subcode byte used for control and display.\nThe information is sent from the computer processor to the BIOS into a chip controlling the data transfer. This is then sent out to the hard drive via a multi-wire connector. Once the data is received onto the circuit board of the drive, they are translated and compressed into a format that the individual drive can use to store onto the disk itself. The data is then passed to a chip on the circuit board that controls the access to the drive. The drive is divided into sectors of data stored onto one of the sides of one of the internal disks. An HDD with two disks internally will typically store data on all four surfaces.\nThe hardware on the drive tells the actuator arm where it is to go for the relevant track, and the compressed information is then sent down to the head, which changes the physical properties, optically or magnetically, for example, of each byte on the drive, thus storing the information. A file is not stored in a linear manner; rather, it is held in the best way for quickest retrieval.\nRotation speed and track layout.\nMechanically, there are two different motions occurring inside the drive. One is the rotation of the disks inside the device. The other is the side-to-side motion of the head across the disk as it moves between tracks.\nThere are two types of disk rotation methods:\nTrack positioning also follows two different methods across disk storage devices. Storage devices focused on holding computer data, e.g., HDDs, FDDs, and Iomega zip drives, use concentric tracks to store data. During a sequential read or write operation, after the drive accesses all the sectors in a track, it repositions the head(s) to the next track. This will cause a momentary delay in the flow of data between the device and the computer. In contrast, optical audio and video discs use a single spiral track that starts at the innermost point on the disc and flows continuously to the outer edge. When reading or writing data, there is no need to stop the flow of data to switch tracks. This is similar to vinyl records, except vinyl records started at the outer edge and spiraled in toward the center.\nInterfaces.\nThe disk drive interface is the mechanism/protocol of communication between the rest of the system and the disk drive itself. Storage devices intended for desktop and mobile computers typically use ATA (PATA) and SATA interfaces. Enterprise systems and high-end storage devices will typically use SCSI, SAS, and FC interfaces in addition to some use of SATA.\n* Constant angular velocity (CAV) keeps the disk spinning at a fixed rate, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). This means the heads cover more distance per unit of time on the outer tracks than on the inner tracks. This method is typical with computer hard drives.\n*Constant linear velocity (CLV) keeps the distance covered by the heads per unit time fixed. Thus the disk has to slow down as the arm moves to the outer tracks. This method is typical for CD drives.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the British commanders who ended the Anglo-Mysore wars by defeating Tipu Sultan in 1799, and among those who ended the Napoleonic Wars in a Coalition victory when the Seventh Coalition defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\nWellesley was born into a Protestant Ascendancy family in Dublin, in the Kingdom of Ireland. He was commissioned as an ensign in the British Army in 1787, serving in Ireland as aide-de-camp to two successive lords lieutenant of Ireland. He was also elected as a member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons. Rising to the rank of colonel by 1796, Wellesley served in the Flanders campaign before being sent to India, where he fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, ending the conflict with a victory at Seringapatam in 1799. He was appointed governor of Seringapatam and Mysore and, as a newly appointed major-general, won a decisive victory over the Maratha Confederacy at the Battle of Assaye in 1803.\nRising to prominence as a general officer during the Peninsular War, Wellesley was promoted to field marshal after leading British-led forces to victory against a French army at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. Following Napoleon's first exile in 1814, he served as the British ambassador to France and was made Duke of Wellington. During the Hundred Days campaign in 1815, Wellington commanded another British-led army which, together with a Prussian army under Field Marshal Gebhard von Bl\u00fccher, defeated Napoleon at Waterloo.\nAfter the end of his active military career, Wellington returned to politics, becoming a prominent member of the British Tory party. He served as prime minister from 1828 to 1830, as well as on an interim basis for a little less than a month in 1834. Wellington oversaw the passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 and opposed the Reform Act 1832. He continued to be one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement in 1846 and remained Commander-in-Chief of the Forces until his death in 1852.\nEarly life.\nFamily.\nArthur Wellesley was born into an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family, belonging to the Protestant Ascendancy, beginning life as the Hon. Arthur Wesley. He was born the son of Anne, Countess of Mornington, and Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington. His father was himself the son of Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington, and had a short career in politics representing the constituency of Trim in the Irish House of Commons before succeeding his father as Baron Mornington in 1758. Garret Mornington was also an accomplished composer, and in recognition of his musical and philanthropic achievements was elevated to the rank of Earl of Mornington in 1760. Wellesley's mother was the eldest daughter of Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, after whom Wellesley was named. Through Elizabeth of Rhuddlan, Wellesley was a descendant of Edward I of England.\nWellesley was the sixth of nine children born to the Earl and Countess of Mornington. His siblings included Richard, Viscount Wellesley, who later became 1st Marquess Wellesley and 2nd Earl of Mornington, William, who later became 1st Baron Maryborough and 3rd Earl of Mornington, and Henry, who later became 1st Baron Cowley.\nBirth date and place.\nThe exact date and location of Wellesley's birth are not known, but biographers mostly follow the same contemporary newspaper evidence, which states that he was born on 1 May 1769, the day before he was baptised in St. Peter's Church on Aungier Street in Dublin. However, the historian Ernest Lloyd states: \"The registry of St. Peter's Church, Dublin, shows that he was christened there on 30 April 1769\".\nWellesley may have been born at his parents' townhouse, Mornington House at 6 Merrion Street (the address later became known as 24 Upper Merrion Street), Dublin, which now forms part of the Merrion Hotel. His mother, Anne, Countess of Mornington, recalled in 1815 that he had been born at 6 Merrion Street.\nHis family's home at Dangan Castle, Dangan, near Summerhill in County Meath, has also been purported to have been his birthplace. In his obituary, published in \"The Times\" in 1852, it was reported that Dangan was unanimously believed to have been the place of his birth, though suggested it was unlikely, but not impossible, that the family had travelled to Dublin for his baptism. A pillar was erected in his honour near Dangan in 1817.\nThe place of his birth has been much disputed following his death. Sir Bernard Burke wrote in 1873:\n\"Isn't it remarkable that until recently all the old memoirs of the Duke of Wellington seemed to infer that County Meath was the place of birth. Nowadays the theory that he was born in Dublin is generally accepted but by no means proved\".\nOther places that have been put forward as the location of his birth include a coach between Meath and Dublin, the Dublin packet boat and the Wellesley townhouse in Trim, County Meath.\nChildhood.\nWellesley spent most of his childhood at his family's two homes, the first a large house in Dublin, Mornington House, and the second Dangan Castle, north of Summerhill in County Meath. In 1781 his father died and his eldest brother, Richard, inherited his father's earldom.\nHe went to the diocesan school in Trim when at Dangan, Mr Whyte's Academy when in Dublin, and Brown's School in Chelsea when in London. He then enrolled at Eton College, where he studied from 1781 to 1784. His loneliness there caused him to hate it, and makes it highly unlikely that he actually said \"The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton\", a quotation which is often attributed to him. Moreover, Eton had no playing fields at the time. In 1785, a lack of success at Eton, combined with a shortage of family funds due to his father's death, forced the young Wellesley and his mother to move to Brussels. Until his early twenties, Arthur showed little sign of distinction and his mother grew increasingly concerned at his idleness, stating, \"I don't know what I shall do with my awkward son Arthur.\"\nIn 1786 he enrolled in the French Royal Academy of Equitation in Angers, where he progressed significantly, becoming a good horseman and learning French, which later proved very useful. Upon returning to England later the same year, he astonished his mother with his improvement.\nEarly military career: 1787\u20131796.\nIreland: 1787\u20131793.\nDespite his new promise, Wellesley had yet to find a job and his family was still short of money, so upon the advice of his mother, his brother Richard asked his friend the Duke of Rutland (then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland) to consider Arthur for a commission in the Army. Soon afterward, on 7 March 1787, he was gazetted ensign in the 73rd Regiment of Foot. In October, with the assistance of his brother, he was assigned as \"aide-de-camp\", on ten shillings a day (twice his pay as an ensign), to the new Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lord Buckingham. He was also transferred to the new 76th Regiment forming in Ireland and on Christmas Day, 1787, was promoted to lieutenant. During his time in Dublin his duties were mainly social; attending balls, entertaining guests and providing advice to Buckingham. While in Ireland, he overextended himself in borrowing due to his occasional gambling, but in his defence stated that \"I have often known what it was to be in want of money, but I have never got helplessly into debt\".\nOn 23 January 1788 he transferred into the 41st Regiment of Foot, then again on 25 June 1789 he transferred to the 12th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of (Light) Dragoons and, according to the military historian Richard Holmes, he also reluctantly entered politics. Shortly before the general election of 1789, he went to the rotten borough of Trim to speak against the granting of the title \"Freeman\" of Dublin to the parliamentary leader of the Irish Patriot Party, Henry Grattan. Succeeding, he was later nominated and duly elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Trim in the Irish House of Commons. Because of the limited suffrage at the time, he sat in a parliament in which at least two-thirds of the members owed their election to the landowners of fewer than a hundred boroughs. Wellesley continued to serve at Dublin Castle, voting with the government in the Irish parliament over the next two years. He became a captain on 30 January 1791 and was transferred to the 58th Regiment of Foot.\nOn 31 October, he transferred to the 18th Light Dragoons. During this period he grew increasingly attracted to Kitty Pakenham, the daughter of Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford. She was described as being full of 'gaiety and charm'. In 1793 he proposed, but was turned down by her brother Thomas, 2nd Earl of Longford, who considered Wellesley to be a young man, in debt, with very poor prospects. An aspiring amateur musician, Wellesley, devastated by the rejection, burnt his violins in anger, and resolved to pursue a military career in earnest. He became a major by purchase in the 33rd Regiment in 1793. A few months later, in September, his brother lent him more money and with it he purchased a lieutenant-colonelcy in the 33rd.\nNetherlands: 1794\u20131795.\nIn 1793 Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, was sent to Flanders in command of the British contingent of an allied force destined for the invasion of France. In June 1794 Wellesley with the 33rd regiment set sail from Cork bound for Ostend as part of an expedition bringing reinforcements for the army in Flanders. They arrived too late to participate, and joined the Duke of York as he was pulling back towards the Netherlands. On 15 September 1794, at the Battle of Boxtel, east of Breda, Wellesley, in temporary command of his brigade, had his first experience of battle. During General Ralph Abercromby's withdrawal in the face of superior French forces, the 33rd held off enemy cavalry, allowing neighbouring units to retreat safely. During the extremely harsh winter that followed, Wellesley and his regiment formed part of an allied force holding the defence line along the Waal River. The 33rd, along with the rest of the army, suffered heavy losses from attrition and illness. Wellesley's health was also affected by the damp environment.\nThough the campaign was to end disastrously, with the British army driven out of the United Provinces into the German states, Wellesley became more aware of battle tactics, including the use of lines of infantry against advancing columns, and the merits of supporting sea-power. He understood that the failure of the campaign was due in part to the faults of the leaders and the poor organisation at headquarters. He remarked later of his time in the Netherlands that \"At least I learned what not to do, and that is always a valuable lesson\".\nBrief return to Britain: 1795\u20131796.\nAfter returning to England in March 1795, he was reinstated as a member of parliament for Trim. He hoped to be given the position of secretary of war in the new Irish government but the new lord-lieutenant, Lord Camden, was only able to offer him the post of Surveyor-General of the Ordnance. Declining the post, he returned to his regiment, now at Southampton preparing to set sail for the West Indies. After seven weeks at sea, a storm forced the fleet back to Poole. The 33rd was given time to recuperate and a few months later, Whitehall decided to send the regiment to India. Wellesley was promoted full colonel by seniority on 3 May 1796 and a few weeks later set sail for Calcutta with his regiment.\nIndia: 1797\u20131805.\nArriving in Calcutta in February 1797, he spent five months there before being sent in August to a brief expedition to the Philippines, where he established a list of new hygiene precautions for his men to deal with the unfamiliar climate. Returning in November to India, he learnt that his elder brother Richard, now known as Lord Mornington, had been appointed as the new Governor-General of India.\nIn 1798 he changed the spelling of his surname to \"Wellesley\"; up to this time he was still known as Wesley, which his eldest brother considered the ancient and proper spelling.\nFourth Anglo-Mysore War: 1798\u20131799.\nAs part of the campaign to extend the rule of the British East India Company, the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War broke out in 1798 against the Sultan of Mysore, Tipu Sultan. Arthur's brother Richard ordered that an armed force be sent to capture Seringapatam and defeat Tipu. During the war, rockets were used on several occasions. Wellesley was almost defeated by Tipu's Diwan, Purnaiah, at the Battle of Sultanpet Tope. Quoting Forrest,\nAt this point (near the village of Sultanpet, Figure 5) there was a large tope, or grove, which gave shelter to Tipu's rocketmen and had obviously to be cleaned out before the siege could be pressed closer to Srirangapattana island. The commander chosen for this operation was Col. Wellesley, but advancing towards the tope after dark on the 5th April 1799, he was set upon with rockets and musket-fires, lost his way and, as Beatson politely puts it, had to \"postpone the attack\" until a more favourable opportunity should offer.\nThe following day, Wellesley launched a fresh attack with a larger force, and took the whole position without any killed in action. On 22 April 1799, twelve days before the main battle, rocketeers maneuvered to the rear of the British encampment, then 'threw a great number of rockets at the same instant' to signal the beginning of an assault by 6,000 Indian infantry and a corps of Frenchmen, all ordered by Mir Golam Hussain and Mohomed Hulleen Mir Miran. The rockets had a range of about 1,000 yards. Some burst in the air like shells. Others, called ground rockets, would rise again on striking the ground and bound along in a serpentine motion until their force was spent. According to one British observer, a young English officer named Bayly: \"So pestered were we with the rocket boys that there was no moving without danger from the destructive missiles ...\". He continued:\nThe rockets and musketry from 20,000 of the enemy were incessant. No hail could be thicker. Every illumination of blue lights was accompanied by a shower of rockets, some of which entered the head of the column, passing through to the rear, causing death, wounds, and dreadful lacerations from the long bamboos of twenty or thirty feet, which are invariably attached to them.\nUnder the command of General George Harris, some 24,000 troops were dispatched to Madras (to join an equal force being sent from Bombay in the west). Arthur and the 33rd sailed to join them in August.\nAfter extensive and careful logistic preparation (which would become one of Wellesley's main attributes) the 33rd left with the main force in December and travelled across of jungle from Madras to Mysore. On account of his brother, during the journey, Wellesley was given an additional command, that of chief advisor to Nizam Ali Khan, Asaf Jah II of Hyderabad's army (sent to accompany the British force). This position was to cause friction among many of the senior officers (some of whom were senior to Wellesley). Much of this friction was put to rest after the Battle of Mallavelly, some from Seringapatam, in which Harris' army attacked a large part of the sultan's army. During the battle, Wellesley led his men, in a line of battle of two ranks, against the enemy to a gentle ridge and gave the order to fire. After an extensive repetition of volleys, followed by a bayonet charge, the 33rd, in conjunction with the rest of Harris's force, forced Tipu's infantry to retreat.\nSeringapatam: 1799.\nImmediately after their arrival at Seringapatam on 5 April 1799, the Battle of Seringapatam began and Wellesley was ordered to lead a night attack on the village of Sultanpettah, adjacent to the fortress to clear the way for the artillery. Because of a variety of factors including the Mysorean army's strong defensive preparations and the darkness the attack failed with 25 casualties due to confusion among the British. Wellesley suffered a minor injury to his knee from a spent musket-ball. Although they re-attacked successfully the next day, after time to scout ahead the enemy's positions, the affair affected Wellesley. He resolved \"never to attack an enemy who is preparing and strongly posted, and whose posts have not been reconnoitred by daylight\".\nLewin Bentham Bowring gives this alternative account:\nOne of these groves, called the Sultanpet Tope, was intersected by deep ditches, watered from a channel running in an easterly direction about a mile from the fort. General Baird was directed to scour this grove and dislodge the enemy, but on his advancing with this object on the night of the 5th, he found the tope unoccupied. The next day, however, the Mysore troops again took possession of the ground, and as it was absolutely necessary to expel them, two columns were detached at sunset for the purpose. The first of these, under Colonel Shawe, got possession of a ruined village, which it successfully held. The second column, under Colonel Wellesley, on advancing into the tope, was at once attacked in the darkness of night by a tremendous fire of musketry and rockets. The men, floundering about amidst the trees and the water-courses, at last broke, and fell back in disorder, some being killed and a few taken prisoners. In the confusion Colonel Wellesley was himself struck on the knee by a spent ball, and narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the enemy.\nA few weeks later, after extensive artillery bombardment, a breach was opened in the main walls of the fortress of Seringapatam. An attack led by Major-General David Baird secured the fortress. Wellesley secured the rear of the advance, posting guards at the breach and then stationed his regiment at the main palace. After hearing news of the death of the Tipu Sultan, Wellesley was the first at the scene to confirm his death, checking his pulse. Over the coming day, Wellesley grew increasingly concerned over the lack of discipline among his men, who drank and pillaged the fortress and city. To restore order, several soldiers were flogged and four hanged.\nAfter battle and the resulting end of the war, the main force under General Harris left Seringapatam and Wellesley, aged 30, stayed behind to command the area as the new Governor of Seringapatam and Mysore. While in India, Wellesley was ill for a considerable time, first with severe diarrhoea from the water and then with fever, followed by a serious skin infection caused by trichophyton.\nDhoondiah Waugh insurgency: 1800.\nIn 1800, whilst serving as Governor of Mysore, Wellesley was tasked with putting down an insurgency led by Dhoondiah Waugh, formerly a Patan trooper for Tipu Sultan. Having escaped after the fall of Seringapatam he became a powerful brigand, raiding villages along the Maratha\u2013Mysore border region.\nDespite initial setbacks, the East India Company having pursued and destroyed his forces once already, forcing him into retreat in August 1799, he raised a sizeable force composed of disbanded Mysore soldiers, captured small outposts and forts in Mysore, and was receiving the support of several Maratha \"killedars\" opposed to British occupation. This drew the attention of the British administration, who were beginning to recognise him as more than just a bandit, as his raids, expansion and threats to destabilise British authority suddenly increased in 1800. The death of Tipu Sultan had created a power vacuum and Waugh was seeking to fill it.\nGiven independent command of a combined East India Company and British Army force, Wellesley ventured north to confront Waugh in June 1800, with an army of 8,000 infantry and cavalry, having learnt that Waugh's forces numbered over 50,000, although the majority (around 30,000) were irregular light cavalry and unlikely to pose a serious threat to British infantry and artillery.\nThroughout June\u2013August 1800, Wellesley advanced through Waugh's territory, his troops escalading forts in turn and capturing each one with \"trifling loss\". The forts generally offered little resistance due to their poor construction and design. Wellesley did not have sufficient troops to garrison each fort and had to clear the surrounding area of insurgents before advancing to the next fort. On 31 July, he had \"taken and destroyed Dhoondiah's baggage and six guns, and driven into the Malpoorba (where they were drowned) about five thousand people\". Dhoondiah continued to retreat, but his forces were rapidly deserting, he had no infantry and due to the monsoon weather flooding river crossings he could no longer outpace the British advance. \nOn 10 September, at the Battle of Conaghul, Wellesley personally led a charge of 1,400 British dragoons and Indian cavalry, in single line with no reserve, against Dhoondiah and his remaining 5,000 cavalry. Dhoondiah was killed during the clash; his body was discovered and taken to the British camp tied to a cannon. With this victory, Wellesley's campaign was concluded, and British authority had been restored. Wellesley then paid for the future upkeep of Dhoondiah's orphaned son.\nPlanned expedition against Batavia and Mauritius: 1801.\nWellesley was in charge of raising an Anglo-Indian expeditionary force in Trincomali in early 1801 for the capture of Batavia and Mauritius from the French. However, on the eve of its departure, orders arrived from England that it was to be sent to Egypt to co-operate with Sir Ralph Abercromby in the expulsion of the French from Egypt. Wellesley had been appointed second in command to Baird, but owing to ill health did not accompany the expedition on 9 April 1801. This was fortunate for Wellesley, since the vessel on which he was to have sailed sank in the Red Sea.\nHe was promoted to brigadier-general on 17 July 1801. He took residence within the Sultan's summer palace and reformed the tax and justice systems in his province to maintain order and prevent bribery.\nSecond Anglo-Maratha War: 1802\u20131803.\nIn September 1802 Wellesley learnt that he had been promoted to the rank of major-general. He had been gazetted on 29 April 1802, but the news took several months to reach him by sea. He remained at Mysore until November, when he was sent to command an army in the Second Anglo-Maratha War.\nWhen he determined that a long defensive war would ruin his army, Wellesley decided to act boldly to defeat the numerically larger force of the Maratha Empire. With the logistic assembly of his army complete (24,000 men in total) he gave the order to break camp and attack the nearest Maratha fort on 8 August 1803. The fort surrendered on 12 August after an infantry attack had exploited an artillery-made breach in the wall. With the fort now in British control Wellesley was able to extend control southwards to the Godavari River.\nSplitting his army into two forces to pursue and locate the main Marathas army (the second force, commanded by Colonel Stevenson was far smaller), Wellesley was preparing to rejoin his forces on 24 September. His intelligence, however, reported the location of the Marathas' main army, between two rivers near Assaye. If he waited for the arrival of his second force, the Marathas would be able to mount a retreat, so Wellesley decided to launch an attack immediately.\nOn 23 September Wellesley led his forces over a ford in the river Kaitna and the Battle of Assaye commenced. After crossing the ford the infantry was reorganised into several lines and advanced against the Maratha infantry. Wellesley ordered his cavalry to exploit the flank of the Maratha army just near the village. During the battle Wellesley himself came under fire; two of his horses were shot from under him and he had to mount a third. At a crucial moment, Wellesley regrouped his forces and ordered Colonel Maxwell (later killed in the attack) to attack the eastern end of the Maratha position while Wellesley himself directed a renewed infantry attack against the centre.\nAn officer in the attack wrote of the importance of Wellesley's personal leadership: \"The General was in the thick of the action the whole time\u00a0... I never saw a man so cool and collected as he was\u00a0... though I can assure you, till our troops got the order to advance the fate of the day seemed doubtful\u00a0...\" With some 6,000 Marathas killed or wounded, the enemy was routed, though Wellesley's force was in no condition to pursue. British casualties were heavy: the British losses amounted to 428 killed, 1,138 wounded and 18 missing (the British casualty figures were taken from Wellesley's own despatch). Wellesley was troubled by the loss of men and remarked that he hoped \"I should not like to see again such loss as I sustained on 23 September, even if attended by such gain\". Years later, however, he remarked that Assaye and not Waterloo was the best battle he ever fought.\nDespite the damage done to the Maratha army, the battle did not end the war. A few months later in November, Wellesley attacked a larger force near Argaum, leading his army to victory again, with an astonishing 5,000 enemy dead at the cost of only 361 British casualties. A further successful attack at the fortress at Gawilghur, combined with the victory of General Gerard Lake at Delhi, forced the Maratha to sign a peace settlement at Anjangaon (not concluded until a year later) called the Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon.\nMilitary historian Richard Holmes remarked that Wellesley's experiences in India had an important influence on his personality and military tactics, teaching him much about military matters that would prove vital to his success in the Peninsular War. These included a strong sense of discipline through drill and order, the use of diplomacy to gain allies, and the vital necessity of a secure supply line. He also established high regard for the acquisition of intelligence through scouts and spies. His personal tastes also developed, including dressing himself in white trousers, a dark tunic, with Hessian boots and black cocked hat (that later became synonymous as his style).\nLeaving India: 1804\u20131805.\nWellesley had grown tired of his time in India, remarking, \"I have served as long in India as any man ought who can serve anywhere else\". In June 1804 he applied for permission to return home and as a reward for his service in India he was made a Knight of the Bath in September. While in India, Wellesley had amassed a fortune of \u00a342,000 (considerable at the time, equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023), consisting mainly of prize money from his campaign. \nWhen his brother's term as Governor-General of India ended in March 1805, the brothers returned together to England on . Wellesley, coincidentally, stopped on his voyage at the island of Saint Helena and stayed in the same building in which Napoleon would live during his later exile.\nReturn to Britain: 1805\u20131808.\nMeeting Nelson.\nIn September 1805, Major-General Wellesley was newly returned from his campaigns in India and was not yet particularly well known to the public. He reported to the office of the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies to request a new assignment. In the waiting room, he met Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, already a known figure after his victories at the Nile and Copenhagen, who was briefly in England after months pursuing the French Toulon fleet to the West Indies and back. Some 30 years later, Wellington recalled a conversation that Nelson began with him which Wellesley found \"almost all on his side in a style so vain and silly as to surprise and almost disgust me\". Nelson left the room to inquire who the young general was, and on his return switched to a very different tone, discussing the war, the state of the colonies, and the geopolitical situation as between equals. On this second discussion, Wellington recalled, \"I don't know that I ever had a conversation that interested me more\". This was the only time that the two men met; Nelson was killed at his victory at Trafalgar seven weeks later.\nWellesley then served in the abortive Anglo-Russian expedition to north Germany in 1805, taking a brigade to Elbe.\nHe then took a period of extended leave from the army and was elected as a Tory member of the British parliament for Rye in January 1806. A year later, he was elected the member of Parliament for Newport on the Isle of Wight, and was then appointed to serve as Chief Secretary for Ireland under the Duke of Richmond. At the same time, he was made a privy counsellor. While in Ireland, he gave a verbal promise that the remaining Penal Laws would be enforced with great moderation, perhaps an indication of his later willingness to support Catholic emancipation. Wellesley was described as having been \"handsome, very brown, quite bald and a hooked nose\".\nMarriage to Kitty Pakenham.\nWellesley was married by his brother Gerald, a clergyman, to Kitty Pakenham in St George's Church, Dublin, on 10 April 1806. They had two children: Arthur was born in 1807 and Charles was born in 1808. The marriage proved unsatisfactory and the two spent years apart, while Wellesley was campaigning and afterwards. Kitty grew depressed, and Wellesley pursued other sexual and romantic partners. The couple largely lived apart, with Kitty spending most of her time at their country home, Stratfield Saye House, and Wellesley at their London home, Apsley House. Kitty's brother Edward Pakenham served under Wellesley throughout the Peninsular War, and Wellesley's regard for him helped to smooth his relations with Kitty, until Pakenham's death at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. \nWar against Denmark\u2013Norway.\nWellesley was in Ireland in May 1807 when he heard of the British expedition to Denmark\u2013Norway. He decided to go, while maintaining his political appointments, and was appointed to command an infantry brigade in the Second Battle of Copenhagen, which took place in August. He fought at K\u00f8ge, during which the men under his command took 1,500 prisoners, with Wellesley later present during the surrender.\nBy 30 September he had returned to England and was raised to the rank of lieutenant general on 25 April 1808. In June 1808 he accepted the command of an expedition of 9,000 men. Preparing to sail for an attack on the Spanish colonies in South America (to assist the Latin American patriot Francisco de Miranda) his force was instead ordered to sail for the Kingdom of Portugal, to take part in the Peninsular Campaign and rendezvous with 5,000 troops from Gibraltar.\nPeninsular War: 1808\u20131814.\nVimeiro and the Convention of Sintra: 1808.\nReady for battle, Wellesley left Cork on 12 July 1808 to participate in the war against French forces in the Iberian Peninsula, with his skills as a commander tested and developed. According to the historian Robin Neillands:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Wellesley had by now acquired the experience on which his later successes were founded. He knew about command from the ground up, about the importance of logistics, about campaigning in a hostile environment. He enjoyed political influence and realised the need to maintain support at home. Above all, he had gained a clear idea of how, by setting attainable objectives and relying on his own force and abilities, a campaign could be fought and won.\nWellesley defeated the French at the Battle of Roli\u00e7a and the Battle of Vimeiro in 1808 but was superseded in command immediately after the latter battle. General Dalrymple then signed the controversial Convention of Sintra, which stipulated that the Royal Navy transport the French army out of Lisbon with all their loot, and insisted on the association of the only available government minister, Wellesley.\nDalrymple and Wellesley were recalled to Britain to face a Court of Enquiry. Wellesley had agreed to sign the preliminary armistice, but had not signed the convention, and was cleared.\nSimultaneously, Napoleon entered Spain with his veteran troops to put down the revolt; the new commander of the British forces in the Peninsula, Sir John Moore, died during the Battle of Corunna in January 1809.\nAlthough overall the land war with France was not going well from a British perspective, the Peninsula was the one theatre where they, with the Portuguese, had provided strong resistance against France and her allies. This contrasted with the disastrous Walcheren expedition, which was typical of the mismanaged British operations of the time. Wellesley submitted a memorandum to Lord Castlereagh on the defence of Portugal. He stressed its mountainous frontiers and advocated Lisbon as the main base because the Royal Navy could help to defend it. Castlereagh and the cabinet approved the memo and appointed him head of all British forces in Portugal.\nTalavera campaign: 1809.\nWellesley arrived in Lisbon on 22 April 1809 on board HMS \"Surveillante\", after narrowly escaping shipwreck. Reinforced, he took to the offensive. In the Second Battle of Porto he crossed the Douro river in a daylight \"coup de main\", and routed Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult's French troops in Porto.\nWith Portugal secured, Wellesley advanced into Spain to unite with General Cuesta's forces. The combined allied force prepared for an assault on Marshal Claude-Victor Perrin's I\u00a0Corps at Talavera, 23 July. Cuesta, however, was reluctant to agree, and was only persuaded to advance on the following day. The delay allowed the French to withdraw, but Cuesta sent his army headlong after Victor, and found himself faced by almost the entire French army in New Castile\u2014Victor had been reinforced by the Toledo and Madrid garrisons. The Spanish retreated precipitously, necessitating the advance of two British divisions to cover their retreat.\nThe next day, 27 July, at the Battle of Talavera the French advanced in three columns and were repulsed several times throughout the day by Wellesley, but at a heavy cost to the British force. In the aftermath Marshal Soult's army was discovered to be advancing south, threatening to cut Wellesley off from Portugal. Wellesley moved east on 3 August to block it, leaving 1,500 wounded in the care of the Spanish, intending to confront Soult before finding out that the French were in fact 30,000 strong. The British commander sent the Light Brigade on a dash to hold the bridge over the Tagus at Almaraz. With communications and supply from Lisbon secured for now, Wellesley considered joining with Cuesta again but found out that his Spanish ally had abandoned the British wounded to the French and was thoroughly uncooperative, promising and then refusing to supply the British forces, aggravating Wellesley and causing considerable friction between the British and their Spanish allies. The lack of supplies, coupled with the threat of French reinforcement (including the possible inclusion of Napoleon himself) in the spring, led to the British deciding to retreat into Portugal.\nFollowing his victory at Talavera, Wellesley was elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 26 August 1809 as Viscount Wellington of Talavera and of Wellington, in Somerset, with the subsidiary title of Baron Douro of Wellesley.\nCiudad Rodrigo and stalemate: 1810\u20131812.\nIn 1810 a newly enlarged French army under Marshal Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na invaded Portugal. British opinion was negative and there were suggestions to evacuate Portugal. Instead, Lord Wellington first slowed the French at Bu\u00e7aco; he then prevented them from taking the Lisbon Peninsula by the construction of massive earthworks, known as the Lines of Torres Vedras, which had been assembled in complete secrecy with their flanks guarded by the Royal Navy. The baffled and starving French invasion forces retreated after six months. Wellington's pursuit was hindered by a series of reverses inflicted by Marshal Michel Ney in a much-lauded rear guard campaign.\nIn 1811 Mass\u00e9na returned towards Portugal to relieve Almeida; Wellington narrowly checked the French at the Battle of Fuentes de O\u00f1oro. Simultaneously, his subordinate, Viscount Beresford, fought Soult's 'Army of the South' to a bloody stalemate at the Battle of Albuera in May. Wellington was promoted to full general on 31 July for his services. The French abandoned Almeida, avoiding British pursuit, but retained the twin Spanish fortresses of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz, the 'Keys' guarding the roads through the mountain passes into Portugal.\nIn 1812 Wellington finally captured Ciudad Rodrigo via a rapid movement as the French went into winter quarters, storming it before they could react. He then moved south quickly, besieged the fortress of Badajoz for a month and captured it during the night on 6 April 1812. On viewing the aftermath of the Storming of Badajoz, Wellington lost his composure and cried at the sight of the British dead in the breaches.\nHis army now was a veteran British force reinforced by units of the retrained Portuguese army. Campaigning in Spain, he was made Earl of Wellington in the county of Somerset on 22 February 1812. He routed the French at the Battle of Salamanca, taking advantage of a minor French mispositioning. The victory liberated the Spanish capital of Madrid. He was later made Marquess of Wellington, in the said county on 18 August 1812.\nWellington attempted to take the vital fortress of Burgos, which linked Madrid to France. He failed, due in part to a lack of siege guns, forcing him into a headlong retreat with the loss of over 2,000 casualties.\nThe French abandoned Andalusia, and combined the troops of Soult and Auguste de Marmont. Thus combined, the French outnumbered the British, putting the British forces in a precarious position. Wellington withdrew his army and, joined by the smaller corps under the command of Rowland Hill, which had been moved to Madrid, began to retreat to Portugal. Marshal Soult declined to attack.\nVictory: 1813\u20131814.\nIn 1813 Wellington led a new offensive, this time against the French line of communications. He struck through the hills north of Burgos, the Tras os Montes, and switched his supply line from Portugal to Santander on Spain's north coast; this led to the French abandoning Madrid and Burgos. Continuing to outflank the French lines, Wellington caught up with and routed the army of King Joseph Bonaparte in the Battle of Vitoria, for which he was promoted to field marshal on 21 June. He personally led a column against the French centre, while other columns commanded by Sir Thomas Graham, Rowland Hill and the Earl of Dalhousie looped around the French right and left (this battle became the subject of Beethoven's orchestral piece \"Wellington's Victory\" (Opus 91). The British troops broke ranks to loot the abandoned French wagons instead of pursuing the beaten foe. When troops failed to return to their units and began harassing the locals, an enraged Wellington wrote in a now famous despatch to Earl Bathurst, \"We have in the service the scum of the earth as common soldiers\".\nAlthough later, when his temper had cooled, he extended his comment to praise the men under his command saying that though many of the men were, \"the scum of the earth; it is really wonderful that we should have made them to the fine fellows they are\".\nAfter taking the small fortresses of Pamplona, Wellington invested San Sebasti\u00e1n but was frustrated by the obstinate French garrison, losing 693 dead and 316 captured in a failed assault and suspending the siege at the end of July. Soult's relief attempt was blocked by the Spanish Army of Galicia at San Marcial, allowing the Allies to consolidate their position and tighten the ring around the city, which fell in September after a second spirited defence. Wellington then forced Soult's demoralised and battered army into a fighting retreat into France, punctuated by battles at the Pyrenees, Bidassoa and Nivelle. Wellington invaded southern France, winning at the Nive and Orthez. Wellington's final battle against his rival Soult occurred at Toulouse, where the Allied divisions were badly mauled storming the French redoubts, losing some 4,600 men. Despite this momentary victory, news arrived of Napoleon's defeat and abdication and Soult, seeing no reason to continue the fighting, agreed on a ceasefire with Wellington, allowing Soult to evacuate the city.\nHailed as the conquering hero by the British, on 3 May 1814 Wellington was made Duke of Wellington, in the county of Somerset, together with the subsidiary title of Marquess Douro, in said County.\nOn 21 July 1814, the Prince Regent hosted a magnificent f\u00eate in Wellington's honour at Carlton House, attended by over 2,000 guests. The celebration was held in a temporary structure designed by John Nash\u2014a 24-sided wooden rotunda with an innovative self-supporting roof that created a luminous, tent-like space for the festivities. The event marked the social pinnacle of Wellington's triumph, with the structure later being relocated to Woolwich Common to house the Royal Artillery Museum.\nHe received some recognition during his lifetime (the title of \"Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo\" and \"Grandee of Spain\") and the Spanish King Ferdinand VII allowed him to keep part of the works of art from the Royal Collection which he had recovered from the French. His equestrian portrait features prominently in the Monument to the Battle of Vitoria, in present-day Vitoria-Gasteiz.\n His popularity in Britain was due to his image and his appearance as well as to his military triumphs. His victory fitted well with the passion and intensity of the Romantic movement, with its emphasis on individuality. His personal style influenced the fashions in Britain at the time: his tall, lean figure and his plumed black hat and grand yet classic uniform and white trousers became very popular.\nIn late 1814 the Prime Minister wanted him to take command in Canada with the assignment of winning the War of 1812 against the United States. Wellesley replied that he would go to America, but he believed that he was needed more in Europe. He stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think you have no right, from the state of war, to demand any concession of territory from America... You have not been able to carry it into the enemy's territory, notwithstanding your military success, and now undoubted military superiority, and have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack. You cannot on any principle of equality in negotiation claim a cession of territory except in exchange for other advantages which you have in your power... Then if this reasoning be true, why stipulate for the uti possidetis? You can get no territory: indeed, the state of your military operations, however creditable, does not entitle you to demand any.\nHe was appointed Ambassador to France, then took Lord Castlereagh's place as first plenipotentiary to the Congress of Vienna.\nOn 2 January 1815 the title of his Knighthood of the Bath was converted to Knight Grand Cross upon the expansion of that order.\nHundred Days and aftermath: 1815\u20131818.\nFacing Napoleon.\nOn 26 February 1815 Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France. He regained control of the country by May and faced a renewed alliance against him. Wellington left Vienna for what became known as the Waterloo Campaign. He arrived in the Netherlands to take command of the British-German army and their allied Dutch, all stationed alongside the Prussian forces of Generalfeldmarschall Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher.\nNapoleon's strategy was to isolate the Allied and Prussian armies and annihilate each one separately before the Austrians and Russians arrived. In doing so the vast superiority in numbers of the Coalition would be greatly diminished. He would then seek the possibility of peace with Austria and Russia.\nThe French invaded the Netherlands, with Napoleon defeating the Prussians at Ligny, and Marshal Ney engaging indecisively with Wellington at the Battle of Quatre Bras. The Prussians retreated 18 miles north to Wavre whilst Wellington's Anglo-Allied army withdrew 15 miles north to a site he had noted the previous year as favourable for a battle: the north ridge of a shallow valley on the Brussels road, just south of the small town of Waterloo. On 17 June there was torrential rain, which severely hampered movement. and had a considerable effect the next day, 18 June, when the Battle of Waterloo was fought. This was the first time Wellington had encountered Napoleon; he commanded an Anglo-Dutch-German army that consisted of approximately 73,000 troops, 26,000 of whom were British. Approximately 30 per cent of that 26,000 were Irish.\nBattle of Waterloo.\nThe Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday 18 June 1815, near Waterloo (at that time in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, now in Belgium). It commenced with a diversionary attack on Hougoumont by a division of French soldiers. After a barrage of 80 cannons, the first French infantry attack was launched by Comte D'Erlon's I Corps. D'Erlon's troops advanced through the Allied centre, resulting in Allied troops in front of the ridge retreating in disorder through the main position. D'Erlon's corps stormed the most fortified Allied position, La Haye Sainte, but failed to take it. An Allied division under Thomas Picton met the remainder of D'Erlon's corps head to head, engaging them in an infantry duel in which Picton was killed. During this struggle Lord Uxbridge launched two of his cavalry brigades at the enemy, catching the French infantry off guard, driving them to the bottom of the slope, and capturing two French Imperial Eagles. The charge, however, over-reached itself, and the British cavalry, crushed by fresh French horsemen sent at them by Napoleon, were driven back, suffering tremendous losses.\nShortly before 16:00, Marshal Ney noted an apparent withdrawal from Wellington's centre. He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Ney at this time had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney, therefore, tried to break Wellington's centre with a cavalry charge alone.\nAt about 16:30, the first Prussian corps arrived. Commanded by Freiherr von B\u00fclow, IV Corps arrived as the French cavalry attack was in full spate. B\u00fclow sent the 15th Brigade to link up with Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont\u2013La Haie area while the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support. Napoleon sent Georges Mouton's corps to intercept the rest of B\u00fclow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area. Von Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit. Napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed by the enemy. Napoleon's Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out. Napoleon then resorted to sending two battalions of the Middle and Old Guard into Plancenoit and after ferocious fighting they recaptured the village. The French cavalry attacked the British infantry squares many times, each at a heavy cost to the French but with few British casualties. Ney himself was displaced from his horse four times. Eventually, it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks.\nMeanwhile, at approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, Napoleon ordered Ney to capture La Haye Sainte at whatever the cost. Ney accomplished this with what was left of D'Erlon's corps soon after 18:00. Ney then moved horse artillery up towards Wellington's centre and began to attack the infantry squares at short-range with canister. This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square. Wellington's centre was now on the verge of collapse and wide open to an attack from the French. Luckily for Wellington, Pirch I's and Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten's corps of the Prussian Army were now at hand. Zieten's corps permitted the two fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on Wellington's extreme left to be moved and posted behind the depleted centre. Pirch I Corps then proceeded to support B\u00fclow and together they regained possession of Plancenoit, and once more the Charleroi road was swept by Prussian round shot. The value of this reinforcement is held in high regard.\nThe French army now fiercely attacked the Coalition all along the line with the culminating point being reached when Napoleon sent forward the Imperial Guard at 19:30. The attack of the Imperial Guards was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the Grenadiers or Chasseurs of the Old Guard. Marching through a hail of canister and skirmisher fire and severely outnumbered, the 3,000 or so Middle Guardsmen advanced to the west of La Haye Sainte and proceeded to separate into three distinct attack forces. One, consisting of two battalions of Grenadiers, defeated the Coalition's first line and marched on. David Hendrik Chass\u00e9's relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them, and Allied artillery fired into the victorious Grenadiers' flank. This still could not stop the Guard's advance, so Chass\u00e9 ordered his first brigade to charge the outnumbered French, who faltered and broke.\nFurther to the west, 1,500 British Foot Guards under Peregrine Maitland were lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery. As two battalions of Chasseurs approached, the second prong of the Imperial Guard's attack, Maitland's guardsmen rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The Chasseurs deployed to counter-attack but began to waver. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke them. The third prong, a fresh Chasseur battalion, now came up in support. The British guardsmen retreated with these Chasseurs in pursuit, but the latter were halted as the 52nd Light Infantry wheeled in line onto their flank and poured a devastating fire into them and then charged. Under this onslaught, they too broke.\nThe last of the Guard retreated headlong. Mass panic ensued through the French lines as the news spread: \"La Garde recule. Sauve qui peut!\" (\"The Guard is retreating. Every man for himself!\"). Wellington then stood up in Copenhagen's stirrups, and waved his hat in the air to signal an advance of the Allied line just as the Prussians were overrunning the French positions to the east. What remained of the French army then abandoned the field in disorder. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher met at the inn of La Belle Alliance, on the north\u2013south road which bisected the battlefield, and it was agreed that the Prussians should pursue the retreating French army back to France. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815.\nAfter the victory, the Duke supported proposals that a medal be awarded to all British soldiers who participated in the Waterloo campaign, and on 28 June 1815 he wrote to the Duke of York and Albany suggesting: ... the expediency of giving to the non-commissioned officers and soldiers engaged in the Battle of Waterloo a medal. I am convinced it would have the best effect in the army, and if the battle should settle our concerns, they will well deserve it.The Waterloo Medal was duly authorised and distributed to all ranks in 1816.\nControversy.\nMuch historical discussion has been made about Napoleon's decision to send 33,000 troops under Marshal Emmanuel de Grouchy to intercept the Prussians, but\u2014having defeated Bl\u00fccher at Ligny on 16 June and forced the Allies to retreat in divergent directions\u2014Napoleon may have been strategically astute in a judgement that he would have been unable to beat the combined Allied forces on one battlefield. Wellington's comparable strategic gamble was to leave 17,000 troops and artillery, mostly Dutch, away at Hal, north-west of Mont-Saint-Jean, in case of a French advance up the Mons-Hal-Brussels road.\nThe campaign led to numerous other controversies. Issues concerning Wellington's troop dispositions prior to Napoleon's invasion of the Netherlands, whether Wellington misled or betrayed Bl\u00fccher by promising, then failing, to come directly to Bl\u00fccher's aid at Ligny, and credit for the victory between Wellington and the Prussians. These and other such issues concerning Bl\u00fccher's, Wellington's, and Napoleon's decisions during the campaign were the subject of a strategic-level study by the Prussian political-military theorist Carl von Clausewitz, \"Feldzug von 1815: Strategische Uebersicht des Feldzugs von 1815\" (English title: \"The Campaign of 1815: Strategic Overview of the Campaign\"). This study was Clausewitz's last such work and is widely considered to be the best example of Clausewitz's mature theories concerning such analyses. It attracted the attention of Wellington's staff, who prompted the Duke to write a published essay on the campaign (other than his immediate, official after-action report, \"The Waterloo Dispatch\".) This was published as the 1842 \"Memorandum on the Battle of Waterloo\". While Wellington disputed Clausewitz on several points, Clausewitz largely absolved Wellington of accusations levelled against him. This exchange with Clausewitz was quite famous in Britain in the 19th century, particularly in Charles Cornwallis Chesney's work the \"Waterloo Lectures,\" but was largely ignored in the 20th century due to hostilities between Britain and Germany.\nArmy of occupation in Paris.\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Paris, Wellington was appointed commander of the multi-national army of occupation based in Paris. The army consisted of troops from the United Kingdom, Austria, Russia and Prussia, along with contributions from five smaller European states. Although the various contingents were administered by their own commanders, they were all subordinate to Wellington, who was also responsible for liaison with the French administration. The role of the army was to prevent a resurgence of French aggression and to allow the restored King Louis XVIII to consolidate his control over the country. The army of occupation was never required to intervene militarily and was dissolved in 1818, after which Wellington returned to Britain. It was his last active military command.\nEarly political career: 1818\u20131828.\nCabinet minister under Lord Liverpool: 1818\u20131827.\nIn 1818, the prime minister Lord Liverpool invited Wellington to take up the position of Master-General of the Ordnance in his ministry, a position that the Earl of Mulgrave offered to relinquish in Wellington's favour. In accepting the position, Wellington stated that, though attached to the Tory party currently in government, he would not be willing to follow the party into opposition, and Liverpool accepted this, recognising Wellington's special position as a national figure. After taking up the position on 26 December 1818, Wellington remained Master-General of the Ordnance for over eight years, and during this period he greatly increased the efficiency of the Board of Ordnance, as well as preparing a comprehensive plan for the defence of Canada and supporting the establishment of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. Wellington was also Governor of Plymouth from 9 October 1819. \nAs a member of the cabinet, Wellington also played an important role in foreign policy. In common with the foreign secretary Lord Castlereagh, Wellington was dismayed by the liberal revolutions of 1820 in Spain and Naples, but shared his opposition to intervention by the Holy Alliance in the affairs of other countries, and so considered it unfortunate that the allies decided to undertake such an approach at the Congress of Troppau in 1820. Following Castlereagh's suicide in August 1822, King George IV was in favour of Wellington taking his place as foreign secretary, but Wellington was not eager to take a position that would make him a party-political figure, and in any case Liverpool preferred to appoint George Canning, an arrangement which the King reluctantly accepted after consulting Wellington. Wellington took Castlereagh's place at the Congress of Verona that autumn, representing the British government in strongly opposing the proposed French intervention in Spain, which the other major European powers agreed to support. \nWellington quickly grew frustrated with Canning's management of foreign policy, favouring a more conciliatory approach towards the continental powers, whereas Canning unsuccessfully attempted to deter the French invasion of Spain through impracticable threats of war. Wellington was also annoyed by Canning's unwillingness to send troops to support the King of Portugal and his moderate minister the Marquis of Palmela in restoring order following the absolutist coup that overthrew the liberal regime there in May 1823, and again following another attempted absolutist coup in April 1824. Wellington also disagreed with Canning over trade policy with South America, objecting to Canning's readiness to recognise the revolutionary governments that had recently overthrown Spanish rule there.\nFollowing the death of Emperor Alexander I of Russia, Wellington went to Russia to attend the late emperor's funeral and to discuss foreign policy with the new emperor Nicholas I, arriving in St Petersburg on 2 March 1826. With the aim of reducing the chance of war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, he attempted to reduce the severity of an ultimatum that the Russians were about to present to the Turks, and negotiated the Protocol of St Petersburg, which set out a plan to resolve the Greek War of Independence through Anglo-Russian mediation.\nAfter the death of the Duke of York, Wellington was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Army on 22 January 1827, since it was generally accepted that his military eminence made him the only candidate who could be decently appointed. He was also appointed Constable of the Tower of London on 5 February 1827.\nOut of government under Canning and Goderich: 1827\u20131828.\nFollowing the retirement of Lord Liverpool after a major stroke in February 1827, Canning was invited to form a new government by the King in April. In response to letters from Canning that invited him to remain in the government but caused him offence, Wellington refused to serve under Canning, and also wrote to the King to resign his position as Commander-in-Chief. When Parliament resumed in May, Robert Peel made a speech in the Commons justifying the conduct of the ministers who had resigned, and Wellington gave an effective speech in the Lords to the same effect, sitting on the cross benches along with the other former ministers who had refused to serve under Canning, namely Lords Eldon, Bathurst, Melville, Westmorland, and Bexley.\nAfter the death of Canning in August and his replacement by Lord Goderich, Wellington agreed to resume his position as Commander-in-Chief, since his objection had always been to Canning personally, but his interaction with the government was limited to official business and did not represent a reconciliation with the ministry.\nPrime Minister: 1828\u20131830.\nAppointment.\nAlong with Robert Peel, Wellington became an increasingly influential member of the Tory party, and in January 1828 he resigned as Commander-in-Chief and became prime minister.\nDuring his first seven months as prime minister, he chose not to live in the official residence at 10 Downing Street, finding it too small. He moved in only because his own home, Apsley House, required extensive renovations. During this time he was largely instrumental in the foundation of King's College London. On 20 January 1829 Wellington was appointed Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.\nCatholic emancipation.\nIreland presented his first major challenge. In July 1828 William Vesey Fitzgerald, President of the Board of Trade, was defeated in a County Clare by-election by the champion of Catholic emancipation, Daniel O'Connell. The electoral upset dramatised the issue of the Oath of Supremacy \u2013 the sacramental test that effectively barred Roman Catholics from Parliament (denying O'Connell his seat) and from higher offices of the judiciary and state.\nWhile an MP in the Irish Parliament, Wellington had broadly favoured relieving Catholics of their Penal Law disabilities. Following the rebellions of 1798 and 1803, in which France had colluded, he grew more cautious, suggesting that if political distinctions between Protestants and the Catholic were abolished \"all will be Irishmen alike\", equally anxious to secure their country's independence. However, in the willingness of Ireland's enfranchised forty-shilling freeholders to defy their landlords and vote for emancipation candidates, Wellington recognised a \"vast demonstration of populist political organisation, and clerical power\" more challenging than a separatist conspiracy.\nAlong with Peel, who had served as Chief Secretary for Ireland, Wellington was persuaded of the need for a new Oath of Allegiance unexceptional to Catholics. In the face of stiff opposition from the King and in the Lords, he forced the issue by threatening to resign, which would have cleared the way for a new Whig majority with designs not only on emancipation but also on parliamentary reform. The King and his brother, the Duke of Cumberland, did seek to put together a ministry united against Catholic emancipation. But recognising that such a government could not command a majority in the Commons, they soon abandoned the attempt.\nFor the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 (passed with Whig support) O'Connell accorded Wellington little credit. The Duke was no Irish patriot: \"To be sure he was born in Ireland\", the \"Emancipator\" famously remarked, \"but to be born in a stable does not make a man a horse\". This quip was widely reported and frequently attributed, mistakenly, to Wellington himself.\nWellington's government did exact a significant price for emancipation. The Relief Act was accompanied by a restriction of the Irish franchise. The property threshold for the county vote was raised five-fold to the British ten-pound standard, disenfranchising O'Connell's forty-shilling freeholders, and with them the greater part of the Irish electorate.\nDuel with Winchilsea.\nThe Earl of Winchilsea accused Wellington of \"an insidious design for the infringement of our liberties and the introduction of Popery into every department of the State\". Wellington responded by immediately challenging Winchilsea to a duel. On 21 March 1829, Wellington and Winchilsea met on Battersea fields. When the time came to fire, the Duke took aim and Winchilsea kept his arm down. The Duke fired wide to the right. Accounts differ as to whether he missed on purpose, an act known in duelling as a \"delope\". Wellington claimed he did. However, he was noted for his poor aim and reports more sympathetic to Winchilsea claimed he had aimed to kill. Winchilsea discharged his pistol into the air, a plan he and his second had almost certainly decided upon before the duel. Honour was saved and Winchilsea wrote Wellington an apology.\nThe nickname \"Iron Duke\" originated from this period, when he experienced a high degree of personal and political unpopularity. Its repeated use in \"Freeman's Journal\" throughout June 1830 appears to bear reference to his resolute political will, with taints of disapproval from its Irish editors. During this time, Wellington was greeted by a hostile reaction from the crowds at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.\nResignation and aftermath.\nWellington's government fell in 1830. In the summer and autumn of that year, a wave of riots swept the country. The Whigs had been out of power for most years since the 1770s, and saw political reform in response to the unrest as the key to their return. Wellington stuck to the Tory policy of no reform and no expansion of suffrage, and as a result, lost a vote of no confidence on 15 November 1830.\nLater political career: 1830\u20131852.\nIn opposition: 1830\u20131834.\nThe Whigs introduced a Reform Bill while Wellington and the Tories worked to prevent its passage. The Whigs could not get the bill past its second reading in the British House of Commons, and the attempt failed. An election followed in direct response and the Whigs were returned with a landslide majority. A second Reform Bill was introduced and passed in the House of Commons but was defeated in the Tory-controlled House of Lords. Another wave of near-insurrection swept the country. Wellington's residence at Apsley House was targeted by a mob of demonstrators on 27 April 1831 and again on 12 October, leaving his windows smashed. Iron shutters were installed in June 1832 to prevent further damage by crowds angry over rejection of the Reform Bill, which he strongly opposed. The Whig Government fell in 1832 and Wellington was unable to form a Tory Government partly because of a run on the Bank of England. This left King William IV no choice but to restore Earl Grey to the premiership. Eventually, the bill passed the House of Lords after the king threatened to fill that House with newly created Whig peers if it were not. Wellington was never reconciled to the change; when Parliament first met after the first election under the widened franchise, Wellington is reported to have said \"I never saw so many shocking bad hats in my life\".\nWellington opposed the Jewish Civil Disabilities Repeal Bill, and he stated in Parliament on 1 August 1833 that England \"is a Christian country and a Christian legislature, and that the effect of this measure would be to remove that peculiar character.\" The bill was defeated by 104 votes to 54.\nWellington's wife Kitty died of cancer in 1831; despite their generally unhappy relations, which had led to an effective separation, Wellington was said to have been greatly saddened by her death, his one comfort being that after \"half a lifetime together, they had come to understand each other at the end\". He had found consolation for his unhappy marriage in his warm friendship with the diarist Harriet Arbuthnot, wife of his colleague Charles Arbuthnot. Harriet's death in the cholera epidemic of 1834 was almost as great a blow to Wellington as it was to her husband. The two widowers spent their last years together at Apsley House.\nCaretaker ministry and afterwards: 1834\u20131846.\nWellington was gradually superseded as leader of the Tories by Robert Peel, while the party evolved into the Conservatives. When the Tories were returned to power in 1834, Wellington declined to become prime minister because he thought membership in the House of Commons had become essential. The king reluctantly approved Peel, who was in Italy. Hence, Wellington acted as interim leader for three weeks in November and December 1834, taking the responsibilities of prime minister and most of the other ministries. In Peel's first cabinet (1834\u20131835), Wellington became foreign secretary, while in the second (1841\u20131846) he was a minister without portfolio and Leader of the House of Lords. Wellington was also re-appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Army on 15 August 1842 following the resignation of Lord Hill.\nWellington served as the leader of the Conservative party in the House of Lords from 1828 to 1846. Some historians have belittled him as a befuddled reactionary, but a consensus in the late 20th century depicts him as a shrewd operator who hid his cleverness behind the fa\u00e7ade of a poorly informed old soldier. Wellington worked to transform the Lords from unstinting support of the Crown to an active player in political manoeuvering, with a commitment to the landed aristocracy. He used his London residence as a venue for intimate dinners and private consultations, together with extensive correspondence that kept him in close touch with party leaders in the Commons, and the main persona in the Lords. He gave public rhetorical support to Ultra-Tory anti-reform positions, but then deftly changed positions toward the party's centre, especially when Peel needed support from the upper house. Wellington's success was based on the 44 elected representative peers from Scotland and Ireland, whose elections he controlled.\nRetirement: 1846\u20131852.\nWellington retired from political life in 1846, although he remained Commander-in-Chief, and returned briefly to the public eye in 1848 when he helped organise a military force to protect London during the year of European revolution. The Conservative Party had split over the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, with Wellington and most of the former Cabinet still supporting Peel, but most of the MPs led by Lord Derby supporting a protectionist stance. Early in 1852 Wellington, by then very deaf, gave Derby's first government its nickname by shouting \"Who? Who?\" as the list of inexperienced Cabinet ministers was read out in the House of Lords. He became Chief Ranger and Keeper of Hyde Park and St James's Park on 31 August 1850. He remained colonel of the 33rd Regiment of Foot from 1 February 1806 and colonel of the Grenadier Guards from 22 January 1827. \nFrom 1834 until his death in 1852, Wellington served as Chancellor of the University of Oxford.\nDeath and funeral.\nWellington died at Walmer Castle in Kent, his residence as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and reputedly his favourite home, on 14 September 1852. He was found to be unwell on that morning and was helped from his campaign bed, which he had used throughout his military career, and seated in his chair, in which he died. His death was recorded as being due to the after-effects of a stroke culminating in a series of seizures. He was aged 83.\nAlthough in life he hated travelling by rail, having witnessed the death of William Huskisson, one of the first railway accident casualties, his body was taken by train to London, where he was given a state funeral \u2013 one of a small number of British subjects to be so honoured (other examples include Lord Nelson and Sir Winston Churchill). The funeral took place on 18 November 1852. Before the funeral, the Duke's body lay in state at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. Members of the royal family, including Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, the Prince of Wales, and the Princess Royal, visited to pay their respects. When viewing opened to the public, crowds thronged to visit and several people were killed in the crush. Queen Victoria wrote: \"He was the pride and the bon g\u00e9nie, as it were, of this country! He was the GREATEST man this country ever produced, and the most devoted and loyal subject, and the staunchest supporter the Crown ever had.\"\nHe was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, and during his funeral, there was little space to stand due to the number of attendees. A bronze memorial was sculpted by Alfred Stevens, and features two intricate supports: \"Truth tearing the tongue out of the mouth of False-hood\", and \"Valour trampling Cowardice underfoot\". Stevens did not live to see it placed in its home under one of the arches of the cathedral.\nWellington's casket was decorated with banners which were made for his funeral procession. Originally, there was one from Prussia, which was removed during the First World War and never reinstated. In the procession, the \"Great Banner\" was carried by General Sir James Charles Chatterton of the 4th Dragoon Guards on the orders of Victoria.\nMost of the book \"A Biographical Sketch of the Military and Political Career of the Late Duke of Wellington\" by the Weymouth newspaper proprietor Joseph Drew is a detailed contemporary account of his death, lying in state and funeral.\nAfter his death, Irish and English newspapers disputed whether Wellington had been born an Irishman or an Englishman. In 2002 he was number 15 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.\nOwing to its links with Wellington, as the former commanding officer and colonel of the regiment, the title \"33rd (The Duke of Wellington's) Regiment\" was granted to the 33rd Regiment of Foot, on 18 June 1853 (the 38th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo) by Queen Victoria. Wellington's battle record is exemplary; he participated in some 60 battles during the course of his military career.\nPersonality.\nWellington always rose early; he \"couldn't bear to lie awake in bed\", even if the army was not on the march. Even when he returned to civilian life after 1815, he slept in a camp bed, reflecting his lack of regard for creature comforts. General Miguel Ricardo de \u00c1lava complained that Wellington said so often that the army would march \"at daybreak\" and dine on \"cold meat\" that he began to dread those two phrases. While on campaign, he seldom ate anything between breakfast and dinner. During the retreat to Portugal in 1811, he subsisted on \"cold meat and bread\", to the despair of his staff who dined with him. He was, however, renowned for the quality of the wine that he drank and served, often drinking a bottle with his dinner (not a great quantity by the standards of his day).\n\u00c1lava was a witness to an incident just before the Battle of Salamanca. Wellington was eating a chicken leg while observing the manoeuvres of the French army through a spyglass. He spotted an overextension in the French left flank, and realised that he could launch a successful attack there. He exclaimed \"By God, that will do!\" and threw the drumstick in the air. After the Battle of Toulouse, Colonel Frederick Ponsonby brought him the news of Napoleon's abdication, and Wellington broke into an impromptu flamenco dance, spinning around on his heels and clicking his fingers.\nThe military historian Charles Dalton recorded that, after a hard-fought battle in Spain, a young officer made the comment, \"I am going to dine with Wellington tonight\", which was overheard by the Duke as he rode by. \"Give me at least the prefix of Mr. before my name,\" Wellington said. \"My Lord,\" replied the officer, \"we do not speak of Mr. Caesar or Mr. Alexander, so why should I speak of Mr. Wellington?\"\nWhile known for his stern countenance and iron-handed discipline, Wellington was by no means unfeeling. While he is said to have disapproved of soldiers cheering as \"too nearly an expression of opinion\", Wellington nevertheless cared for his men: he refused to pursue the French after the battles of Porto and Salamanca, foreseeing an inevitable cost to his army in chasing a diminished enemy through rough terrain. The only time that he ever showed grief in public was after the storming of Badajoz: he wept at the sight of the British dead in the breaches. In this context, his famous despatch after the Battle of Vitoria, calling them the \"scum of the earth\", can be seen to be fuelled as much by disappointment at their breaking ranks as by anger. He shed tears after Waterloo on the presentation of the list of British fallen by John Hume. Later with his family, unwilling to be congratulated for his victory, he broke down in tears, his fighting spirit diminished by the high cost of the battle and great personal loss.\nWellington's soldier servant, a gruff German called Beckerman, and his long-serving valet, James Kendall, who served him for 25 years and was with him when he died, were both devoted to him. (A story that he never spoke to his servants and preferred instead to write his orders on a notepad on his dressing table in fact probably refers to his son, the 2nd Duke. It was recorded by the 3rd Duke's niece, Viva Seton Montgomerie (1879\u20131959), as being an anecdote she heard from an old retainer, Charles Holman, who was said greatly to resemble Napoleon.)\nFollowing an incident when, as Master-General of the Ordnance, he had been close to a large explosion, Wellington began to experience deafness and other ear-related problems. In 1822, a botched operation on his left ear led to permanent deafness on that side and some contemporaries suggested that he never fully recovered his health.\nWellington came to enjoy the company of a variety of intellectual and attractive women and had many amorous liaisons, particularly after the Battle of Waterloo and his subsequent ambassadorial position in Paris. In the days following Waterloo he had an affair with the notorious Lady Caroline Lamb, sister of one of his severely wounded officers and favourites, Col Frederick Ponsonby. He corresponded for many years with Lady Georgiana Lennox, later Lady de Ros, 26 years his junior and daughter of the Duchess of Richmond (who held the famous ball on the eve of Waterloo) and, though there are hints, it has not been clearly determined if the relationship was ever sexual. The British press lampooned the amorous side of the national hero. In 1824, one liaison came back to haunt him, when Wellington received a letter from a publisher, John Joseph Stockdale, offering to refrain from issuing an edition of the rather racy memoirs of one of his mistresses, Harriette Wilson, in exchange for money. It is said that the Duke promptly returned the letter, after scrawling across it, \"Publish and be damned\". However, Hibbert notes in his biography that the letter can be found among the Duke's papers, with nothing written on it. It is certain that Wellington did reply, and the tone of a further letter from the publisher, quoted by Longford, suggests that he had refused in the strongest language to submit to blackmail.\nHe was also a remarkably practical man who spoke concisely. In 1851, it was discovered that there were a great many sparrows flying about in the Crystal Palace just before the Great Exhibition was to open. His advice to Queen Victoria was \"Sparrowhawks, ma'am\".\nWellington has often been portrayed as a defensive general, even though many, perhaps most, of his battles were offensive (Argaum, Assaye, Oporto, Salamanca, Vitoria, Toulouse). However, for most of the Peninsular War, where he earned his fame, his army lacked the numbers for a strategically offensive posture.\nTitles and tributes.\nNicknames.\nThe nickname \"Iron Duke\" relates to Wellington's political, rather than to his military, career. Its use is often disparaging. It is possible the term became more commonly used after 1832 when Wellington had metal shutters installed at Apsley House to prevent rioters breaking the windows. The term may have been made increasingly popular by \"Punch\" cartoons published in 1844\u201345.\nIn popular ballads of the day Wellington was called \"Nosey\" or \"Old Nosey\". More complimentary sobriquets, including \"The Beau\" and \"Beau Douro\", referenced his noted dress sense. Spanish troops called him \"The Eagle\", while Portuguese troops called him \"Douro Douro\" after his river crossing at Oporto in 1809.\nNapoleon dismissed his opponent as a \"Sepoy General\", a reference to Wellington's service in India. The name was used in the French newspaper as a means of propaganda. His allies were more enthusiastic; Tsar Alexander I of Russia calling him , the conqueror of the world's conqueror, the phrase \"the world's conqueror\" referring to Napoleon. Lord Tennyson uses a similar reference in his \"Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington\", referring to him as \"the great World-victor's victor\". Similar tags included \"Europe's Liberator\" and \"Saviour of the Nations\".\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOnline resources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJournals and magazines\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

A DOS provides a file system and a means for loading and running programs stored on the disk.\nThe term is now historical, as most if not all operating systems for general-purpose computers now require direct-access storage devices as secondary storage.\nHistory.\nBefore modern storage such as the disk drive, floppy disk, and flash storage, early computers used storage such as delay line, core memory, punched card, punched tape, magnetic tape, and magnetic drum. Early microcomputers and home computers used paper tape, audio cassette tape (such as Kansas City standard), or no permanent storage at all. Without permanent storage, programs and data are input directly into memory using front panel switches, or is input through a computer terminal or keyboard, sometimes controlled by a BASIC interpreter in ROM. When power is turned off, all information is lost.\nIn the early 1960s, as disk drives became larger and more affordable, various mainframe and minicomputer vendors introduced disk operating systems and modified existing operating systems to use disks.\nHard disks and floppy disk drives require software to manage rapid access to block storage of sequential and other data. For most microcomputers, a disk drive of any kind was an optional peripheral. Systems could be used with a tape drive or booted without a storage device at all. The disk operating system component of the operating system was only needed when a disk drive was used.\nBy the time IBM announced the System/360 mainframes, the concept of a disk operating system was well established. Although IBM did offer Basic Programming Support (BPS/360) and TOS/360 for small systems, they were out of the mainstream and most customers used either DOS/360 or OS/360.\nMost home and personal computers of the late 1970s and 1980s used a disk operating system; most often with \"DOS\" in the name and simply referred to as \"DOS\" in the context of its user community. For example, CBM DOS, Atari DOS, TRS-DOS, Apple DOS, Apple ProDOS, and MS-DOS. CP/M is also a disk operating system, despite not having \"DOS\" in the name.\nA DOS is usually loaded from a disk, but there are exceptions, such as Commodore's disk drive for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20 which contain the DOS in ROM. Some versions of AmigaDOS mostly resides in ROM, as a part of a Kickstart firmware.\nMain OSes.\nSome disk operating systems are the operating systems for the entire computer system.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "8478", "revid": "32362870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8478", "title": "Doublespeak", "text": "Language that deliberately disguises, distorts, or reverses the meaning of words\nDoublespeak is language that deliberately obscures, disguises, distorts, or reverses the meaning of words. Doublespeak may take the form of euphemisms (e.g., \"downsizing\" for layoffs and \"servicing the target\" for bombing), in which case it is primarily meant to make the truth sound more palatable. It may also refer to intentional ambiguity in language or to actual inversions of meaning. In such cases, doublespeak disguises the nature of the truth.\nDoublespeak is most closely associated with political language used by large entities such as corporations and governments.\nOrigins and concepts.\nThe term \"doublespeak\" derives from two concepts in George Orwell's novel, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", \"doublethink\" and \"Newspeak\", despite the term itself not being used in the novel. Another version of the term, \"doubletalk\", also referring to intentionally ambiguous speech, did exist at the time Orwell wrote his book, but the usage of \"doublespeak\", as well as of \"doubletalk\", in the sense of emphasizing ambiguity, clearly predates the publication of the novel. Parallels have also been drawn between doublespeak and Orwell's classic essay, \"Politics and the English Language\", which discusses linguistic distortion for purposes related to politics. In the essay, he observes that political language often serves to distort and obscure reality. Orwell's description of political speech is extremely similar to the popular definition of the term, doublespeak:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible\u2026 Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness\u2026 the great enemy of clear language is insincerity. Where there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms\u2026\nThe writer Edward S. Herman cited what he saw as examples of doublespeak and doublethink in modern society. Herman describes in his book, \"Beyond Hypocrisy,\" the principal characteristics of doublespeak:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is really important in the world of doublespeak is the ability to lie, whether knowingly or unconsciously, and to get away with it; and the ability to use lies and choose and shape facts selectively, blocking out those that don\u2019t fit an agenda or program.\nExamples.\nIn politics.\nEdward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky comment in their book \"Manufacturing Consent: the Political Economy of the Mass Media\" that Orwellian doublespeak is an important component of the manipulation of the English language in American media, through a process called \"dichotomization,\" a component of media propaganda involving \"deeply embedded double standards in the reporting of news.\" For example, the use of state funds by the poor and financially needy is commonly referred to as \"social welfare\" or \"handouts,\" which the \"coddled\" poor \"take advantage of\". These terms, however, are not as often applied to other beneficiaries of government spending such as military spending. The bellicose language used interchangeably with calls for peace towards Armenia by Azerbaijani president Aliyev after the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War were described as doublespeak in media.\nIn advertising.\nAdvertisers can use doublespeak to mask their commercial intent from users, as users' defenses against advertising become more entrenched. Some are attempting to counter this technique with a number of systems offering diverse views and information to highlight the manipulative and dishonest methods that advertisers employ.\nAccording to Jacques Ellul, \"the aim is not to even modify people\u2019s ideas on a given subject, rather, it is to achieve conformity in the way that people act.\" He demonstrates this view by offering an example from drug advertising. Use of doublespeak in advertisements resulted in aspirin production rates rising by almost 50 percent from over 23 million pounds in 1960 to over 35 million pounds in 1970.\nIn comedy.\nDoublespeak, particularly when exaggerated, can be used as a device in satirical comedy and social commentary to ironically parody political or bureaucratic establishments' intent on obfuscation or prevarication. The television series \"Yes Minister\" is notable for its use of this device. Oscar Wilde was an early proponent of this device and a significant influence on Orwell.\nIntensify/downplay pattern.\nThis pattern was formulated by Hugh Rank and is a simple tool designed to teach some basic patterns of persuasion used in political propaganda and commercial advertising. The function of the intensify/downplay pattern is not to dictate what should be discussed but to encourage coherent thought and systematic organization. The pattern works in two ways: intensifying and downplaying. All people intensify, and this is done via repetition, association and composition. Downplaying is commonly done via omission, diversion and confusion as they communicate in words, gestures, numbers, et cetera. Individuals can better cope with organized persuasion by recognizing the common ways whereby communication is intensified or downplayed, so as to counter doublespeak.\nIn social media.\nIn 2022 and 2023, it was widely reported that social media users were using a form of doublespeak \u2013 sometimes called \"algospeak\" \u2013 to subvert content moderation on platforms such as TikTok. Examples include using the word \"unalive\" instead of \"dead\" or \"kill\", or using \"leg booty\" instead of LGBT, which users believed would prevent moderation algorithms from banning or shadow banning their accounts.\nDoublespeak Award.\nDoublespeak is often used by politicians to advance their agenda. The Doublespeak Award is an \"ironic tribute to public speakers who have perpetuated language that is grossly deceptive, evasive, euphemistic, confusing, or self-centered.\" It has been issued by the US National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) since 1974. The recipients of the Doublespeak Award are usually politicians, national administration or departments. An example of this is the United States Department of Defense, which won the award three times, in 1991, 1993, and 2001. For the 1991 award, the United States Department of Defense \"swept the first six places in the Doublespeak top ten\" for using euphemisms like \"servicing the target\" (bombing) and \"force packages\" (warplanes). Among the other phrases in contention were \"difficult exercise in labor relations\", meaning a strike, and \"meaningful downturn in aggregate output\", an attempt to avoid saying the word \"recession\".\nNCTE Committee on Public Doublespeak.\nThe US National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) Committee on Public Doublespeak was formed in 1971, in the midst of the Watergate scandal. It was at a point when there was widespread skepticism about the degree of truth which characterized relationships between the public and the worlds of politics, the military, and business.\nNCTE passed two resolutions. One called for the council to find means to study dishonest and inhumane uses of language and literature by advertisers, to bring offenses to public attention, and to propose classroom techniques for preparing children to cope with commercial propaganda. The other called for the council to find means to study the relationships between language and public policy and to track, publicize, and combat semantic distortion by public officials, candidates for office, political commentators, and all others whose language is transmitted through the mass media.\nThe two resolutions were accomplished by forming NCTE's Committee on Public Doublespeak, a body which has made significant contributions in describing the need for reform where clarity in communication has been deliberately distorted.\nHugh Rank.\nHugh Rank helped form the Doublespeak committee in 1971 and was its first chairman. Under his editorship, the committee produced a book called \"Language and Public Policy\" (1974), with the aim of informing readers of the extensive scope of doublespeak being used to deliberately mislead and deceive the audience. He highlighted the deliberate public misuses of language and provided strategies for countering doublespeak by focusing on educating people in the English language so as to help them identify when doublespeak is being put into play. He was also the founder of the Intensify/Downplay pattern that has been widely used to identify instances of doublespeak being used.\nDaniel Dieterich.\nDaniel Dieterich, former chair of the National Council of Teachers of English, served as the second chairman of the Doublespeak committee after Hugh Rank in 1975. He served as editor of its second publication, \"Teaching about Doublespeak\" (1976), which carried forward the committee's charge to inform teachers of ways of teaching students how to recognize and combat language designed to mislead and misinform.\nWilliam D. Lutz.\nWilliam D. Lutz, professor emeritus at Rutgers University-Camden has served as the third chairman of the Doublespeak Committee since 1975. In 1989, both his own book \"Doublespeak\" and, under his editorship, the committee's third book, \"Beyond Nineteen Eighty-Four\", were published. \"Beyond Nineteen Eighty-Four\" consists of 220 pages and eighteen articles contributed by long-time Committee members and others whose bodies of work have contributed to public understanding about language, as well as a bibliography of 103 sources on doublespeak. Lutz was also the former editor of the now defunct \"Quarterly Review of Doublespeak\", which examined the use of vocabulary by public officials to obscure the underlying meaning of what they tell the public. Lutz is one of the main contributors to the committee as well as promoting the term \"doublespeak\" to a mass audience to inform them of its deceptive qualities. He mentions:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is more to being an effective consumer of language than just expressing dismay at dangling modifiers, faulty subject and verb agreement, or questionable usage. All who use language should be concerned whether statements and facts agree, whether language is, in Orwell's words, \"largely the defense of the indefensible\" and whether language \"is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind\".\nEducation against doublespeak.\nCharles Weingartner, one of the founding members of the NCTE committee on Public Doublespeak mentioned: \"people do not know enough about the subject (the reality) to recognize that the language being used conceals, distorts, misleads. Teachers of English should teach our students that words are not things, but verbal tokens or signs of things that should finally be carried back to the things that they stand for to be verified.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It depicts the events leading up to the brutal murder of a New York City housewife (Dickinson) before following a prostitute (Allen) who witnesses the crime, and her attempts to solve it with the help of the victim's son (Keith Gordon). It contains several direct references to Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film \"Psycho\".\nReleased in July 1980, \"Dressed to Kill\" was a box office success in the United States, grossing over $30 million. It received largely favorable reviews, and critic David Denby of \"New York\" magazine proclaimed it \"the first great American movie of the '80s\". Dickinson won the Saturn Award for Best Actress for her performance. Allen received both a Golden Globe Award nomination for New Star of the Year, as well as an inaugural first-year Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.\nPlot.\nSexually frustrated housewife Kate Miller is attending therapy sessions with New York City psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott. During an appointment, Kate attempts to seduce him, but Elliott rejects her advances, stating his unwillingness to jeopardize his happy marriage. Kate has planned to spend the day with her teenage son Peter, an inventor, but he has to cancel as he has reached a critical point in his research for his entry to the city's science fair. Thus, Kate goes alone to the Philadelphia Museum of Art where she unexpectedly flirts with a mysterious stranger. Kate and the stranger stalk each other through the museum until they finally wind up outside, where Kate joins him in a taxi, where he pleasures her. They go to his apartment and have sex.\nHours later, Kate awakens and decides to discreetly leave while the man, Warren Lockman, is asleep. Kate sits at his desk to leave him a note and finds a document from the Health Department indicating that Warren has contracted both syphilis and gonorrhea. Shocked, she leaves the apartment, but having hastily forgotten her wedding ring on the nightstand, she returns to retrieve it. The elevator doors open on the figure of a tall, blonde woman in dark sunglasses wielding a straight razor, who violently slashes Kate to death in the elevator. Upon discovering the body, Liz Blake, a high-priced call girl, notices the killer in the elevator's convex mirror, and subsequently becomes both the prime suspect and the killer's next target.\nDr. Elliott receives a bizarre message on his answering machine from \"Bobbi\", a transgender patient. Bobbi taunts the psychiatrist for ending their therapy sessions, apparently because Elliott refuses to sign the necessary papers for Bobbi to undergo sex reassignment surgery. Elliott tries to convince Dr. Levy, the patient's new doctor, that Bobbi is endangering herself and others.\nPolice Detective Marino doubts Liz's story, partly because of her profession, so Liz partners with a revenge-minded Peter to find the killer, using a series of his homemade listening devices and time-lapse cameras to track patients leaving Elliott's office. They catch Bobbi on camera, and soon a tall blonde in sunglasses starts stalking Liz, subsequently making several attempts on her life. Peter thwarts one of them in the New York City Subway by spraying Bobbi with homemade Mace.\nThe pair scheme to learn Bobbi's birth name by infiltrating Dr. Elliott's office. Liz baits the therapist by stripping to lingerie and flirting with him, distracting him long enough to briefly exit and look through his appointment book. Peter is watching through the window when a blonde pulls him away. When Liz returns, a razor-wielding blonde confronts her; the blonde outside shoots and wounds the blonde inside, knocking the wig off and revealing the razor-wielding blonde as Dr. Elliott/Bobbi. The blonde who shot Bobbi is actually a female police officer, revealing herself to be the blonde who has been trailing Liz.\nElliott is arrested and committed to a mental institution. Dr. Levy later explains to Liz that Elliott wanted to be a woman, but his male side would not allow him to proceed with the operation. Whenever a woman sexually aroused Elliott, Bobbi, representing the unstable, female side of the doctor's personality, became threatened to the point that she finally became murderous. When Dr. Levy realized this through his last conversation with Elliott, he called the police, who went to work and eventually apprehended Elliott.\nElliott escapes from the asylum after strangling a nurse, stalks Liz to Peter's house, and slashes her throat. She wakes up screaming and Peter rushes to her side, letting her realize it was merely a nightmare.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Michael Caine as Dr. Robert Elliott, a therapist\nProduction.\nCasting.\nDe Palma originally wanted Norwegian actress Liv Ullmann to play Kate Miller, but she declined because of the violence. He also approached Jill Clayburgh, who was unavailable, and the role then went to Angie Dickinson. Sean Connery was offered the role of Robert Elliott and was enthusiastic about it, but declined because of previous commitments. Connery later worked with De Palma on the 1987 Oscar-winning adaptation of \"The Untouchables\".\nFilming.\n\"Dressed to Kill\" was shot primarily in New York City, though the art gallery scene was filmed at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The film was shot between October 1979 and January 1980.\nThe naked body in the opening scene, taking place in a shower, was not that of Angie Dickinson, but of 1977 \"Penthouse\" Pet of the Year model Victoria Lynn Johnson. De Palma has referred to the elevator killing as the best murder scene he has ever done.\nCensorship.\nTwo versions of the film exist in North America, an R-rated version and an unrated version. The unrated version is around 30 seconds longer and shows more pubic hair in the shower scene, more blood in the elevator scene (including a close-up shot of the killer slitting Kate's throat), and more explicit dialogue from Liz during the scene in Elliott's office. These scenes were trimmed when the MPAA originally gave the film an X rating.\nRelease.\nBox office.\n\"Dressed to Kill\" premiered in Los Angeles and New York City on July 25, 1980. The film grossed $3,416,000 in its opening weekend from 591 theatres and improved its gross the following weekend with $3,640,000 from 596 theatres. It grossed a total of $31.9 million at the U.S. box office, and was the 21st highest-grossing film of the year.\nHome media.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], the film is owned by Amazon MGM Studios via Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer label (successor to Orion Pictures, who bought Filmways and American International Pictures in 1982). The film saw a 1984 VHS release by Warner Home Video, and later another VHS release by Goodtimes under licence from Orion. In 2001, MGM released the film in a special edition DVD. In September 2011, MGM released both R-rated and unrated versions on DVD and Blu-ray.\nThe Criterion Collection released separate deluxe Blu-ray and DVD editions of the film on September 8, 2015. On October 25, 2022, Kino Lorber issued the film for the first time in 4K UHD Blu-ray format.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Dressed to Kill\" holds a 83% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 60 reviews, with an average rating of 6.80/10. The consensus states, \"With arresting visuals and an engrossingly lurid mystery, \"Dressed to Kill\" stylishly encapsulates writer-director Brian De Palma's signature strengths.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 74 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" awarded the film three stars out of four, stating \"the museum sequence is brilliant\" and adding: \"\"Dressed to Kill\" is an exercise in style, not narrative; it would rather look and feel like a thriller than make sense, but DePalma has so much fun with the conventions of the thriller that we forgive him and go along.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" also gave it three stars out of four, writing that there were scenes \"that are as exciting and as stylish as any ever put on film. Unfortunately, a good chunk of the film is a whodunit, and its mystery is so easy to solve that we merely end up watching the film's visual pyrotechnics at a distance, never getting all that involved.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"witty, romantic,\" and \"very funny, which helps to defuse the effect of the graphically photographed violence. In addition, the film is, in its own inside-out way, peculiarly moral.\" His review added that \"The performers are excellent, especially Miss Dickinson.\" \"Variety\" declared \"Despite some major structural weaknesses, the cannily manipulated combination of mystery, gore and kinky sex adds up to a slick commercial package that stands to draw some rich blood money.\" David Denby of \"New York\" magazine proclaimed the film \"the first great American movie of the '80s.\"\nSheila Benson of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote \"The brilliance of \"Dressed to Kill\" is apparent within seconds of its opening gliding shot; it is a sustained work of terror\u2014elegant, sensual, erotic, bloody, a directorial tour de force.\" Pauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" stated of De Palma that \"his timing is so great that when he wants you to feel something he gets you every time. His thriller technique, constantly refined, has become insidious, jewelled. It's hardly possible to find a point at which you could tear yourself away from this picture.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"This elegant new murder thriller promises to revive the lagging summer box office and enhance De Palma's reputation as the most exciting and distinctive manipulator of suspense since Alfred Hitchcock.\" In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 stars out of four, calling it a \"High-tension melodrama\", and stating \"De Palma works on viewers' emotions, not logic, and maintains a fever pitch from start to finish.\" He also praised Pino Donaggio's \"chilling music score.\"\nJohn Simon, of the \"National Review\", after taking note of the two-page advertisements full of superlatives in \"The New York Times\", wrote \"What \"Dressed to Kill\" dispenses liberally, however, is sophomoric soft-core pornography, vulgar manipulation of the emotions for mere sensation, salacious but inept dialogue that is a cross between comic-strip Freudianism and sniggering double entendres, and a plot line so full of holes to be at best a dotted line\".\nControversy.\nThe film led to controversy and protests upon its release. When the film was screened, Iowa City National Organization for Women and members of other feminist organizations picketed the film as it was shown on the University of Iowa campus, distributing leaflets against the film, condemning what they saw as a depiction of violence against women as entertainment. During the film's initial release, the activist group Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media distributed a leaflet, arguing that \"The distorted image of a psychotic male transvestite makes all sexual minorities appear sick and dangerous.\" Numerous critics have since placed \"Dressed to Kill\" in a lineage of slasher movies that perpetuate the transphobic myth that trans people are mentally ill sexual predators. \"Dressed to Kill\" was featured in the 2020 documentary \"\"; in a 2020 reappraisal of the film for \"The Guardian\", the critic Scott Tobias referred to De Palma's understanding of trans issues as \"disconcertingly retrograde...There's no getting around the ugly association of gender transition with violence, other than to say that it feels thoroughly aestheticized\".\nIn a 2016 interview, De Palma said, \"I don't know what the transgender community would think [of the film now]... Obviously I realize that it's not good for their image to be transgender and also be a psychopathic murderer. But I think that [perception] passes with time. We're in a different time.\" He added that he was \"glad\" that the film had become \"a favorite of the gay community,\" which he attributed to its \"flamboyance\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In it, fuel is ignited by heat generated during the compression of air in the combustion chamber, into which fuel is then injected. This is in contrast to igniting the fuel-air mixture with a spark plug as in the Otto cycle (four-stroke/petrol) engine. Diesel engines are used in aircraft, automobiles, power generation, diesel\u2013electric locomotives, and both surface ships and submarines.\nThe Diesel cycle is assumed to have constant pressure during the initial part of the combustion phase (formula_1 to formula_2 in the diagram, below). This is an idealized mathematical model: real physical diesels do have an increase in pressure during this period, but it is less pronounced than in the Otto cycle. In contrast, the idealized Otto cycle of a gasoline engine approximates a constant volume process during that phase.\nIdealized Diesel cycle.\nThe image shows a p\u2013V diagram for the ideal Diesel cycle; where formula_3 is pressure and V the volume or formula_4 the specific volume if the process is placed on a unit mass basis. The \"idealized\" Diesel cycle assumes an ideal gas and ignores combustion chemistry, exhaust- and recharge procedures and simply follows four distinct processes:\nThe Diesel engine is a heat engine: it converts heat into work. During the bottom isentropic processes (blue), energy is transferred into the system in the form of work formula_5, but by definition (isentropic) no energy is transferred into or out of the system in the form of heat. During the constant pressure (red, isobaric) process, energy enters the system as heat formula_6. During the top isentropic processes (yellow), energy is transferred out of the system in the form of formula_7, but by definition (isentropic) no energy is transferred into or out of the system in the form of heat. During the constant volume (green, isochoric) process, some of the energy flows out of the system as heat through the right depressurizing process formula_8. The work that leaves the system is equal to the work that enters the system plus the difference between the heat added to the system and the heat that leaves the system; in other words, net gain of work is equal to the difference between the heat added to the system and the heat that leaves the system.\nThe net work produced is also represented by the area enclosed by the cycle on the p\u2013V diagram. The net work is produced per cycle and is also called the useful work, as it can be turned to other useful types of energy and propel a vehicle (kinetic energy) or produce electrical energy. The summation of many such cycles per unit of time is called the developed power. The formula_7 is also called the gross work, some of which is used in the next cycle of the engine to compress the next charge of air.\nMaximum thermal efficiency.\nThe maximum thermal efficiency of a Diesel cycle is dependent on the compression ratio and the cut-off ratio. It has the following formula under cold air standard analysis: \nformula_16\nwhere\nformula_17 is thermal efficiency\nformula_18 is the cut-off ratio formula_19 (ratio between the end and start volume for the combustion phase)\nr is the compression ratio formula_20\nformula_21 is ratio of specific heats (Cp/Cv)\nThe cut-off ratio can be expressed in terms of temperature as shown below:\nformula_22\nformula_23\nformula_24\nformula_25\nformula_26 can be approximated to the flame temperature of the fuel used. The flame temperature can be approximated to the adiabatic flame temperature of the fuel with corresponding air-to-fuel ratio and compression pressure, formula_27.\nformula_28 can be approximated to the inlet air temperature.\nThis formula only gives the ideal thermal efficiency. The actual thermal efficiency will be significantly lower due to heat and friction losses. The formula is more complex than the Otto cycle (petrol/gasoline engine) relation that has the following formula:\nformula_29\nThe additional complexity for the Diesel formula comes around since the heat addition is at constant pressure and the heat rejection is at constant volume. The Otto cycle by comparison has both the heat addition and rejection at constant volume.\nComparing efficiency to Otto cycle.\nComparing the two formulae it can be seen that for a given compression ratio (r), the \"ideal\" Otto cycle will be more efficient. However, a \"real\" diesel engine will be more efficient overall since it will have the ability to operate at higher compression ratios. If a petrol engine were to have the same compression ratio, then knocking (self-ignition) would occur and this would severely reduce the efficiency, whereas in a diesel engine, the self ignition is the desired behavior. Additionally, both of these cycles are only idealizations, and the actual behavior does not divide as clearly or sharply. Furthermore, the ideal Otto cycle formula stated above does not include throttling losses, which do not apply to diesel engines.\nApplications.\nDiesel engines.\nDiesel engines have the lowest specific fuel consumption of any large internal combustion engine employing a single cycle, 0.26\u00a0lb/hp\u00b7h (0.16\u00a0kg/kWh) for very large marine engines (combined cycle power plants are more efficient, but employ two engines rather than one). Two-stroke diesels with high pressure forced induction, particularly turbocharging, make up a large percentage of the very largest diesel engines.\nIn North America, diesel engines are primarily used in large trucks, where the low-stress, high-efficiency cycle leads to much longer engine life and lower operational costs. These advantages also make the diesel engine ideal for use in the heavy-haul railroad and earthmoving environments.\nOther internal combustion engines without spark plugs.\nMany model airplanes use very simple \"glow\" and \"diesel\" engines. Glow engines use glow plugs. \"Diesel\" model airplane engines have variable compression ratios. Both types depend on special fuels.\nSome 19th-century or earlier experimental engines used external flames, exposed by valves, for ignition, but this becomes less attractive with increasing compression. (It was the research of Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot that established the thermodynamic value of compression.) A historical implication of this is that the diesel engine could have been invented without the aid of electricity.\n See the development of the hot-bulb engine and indirect injection for historical significance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally released for Microsoft Windows, it was released for Mac OS the same year, and for PlayStation 2 in 2002. A remaster for modern platforms is set for release in 2026. The gameplay\u2014combining first-person shooter, stealth, and role-playing elements\u2014features exploration and combat in environments connected to multiple city-based levels, with quests that can be completed in a number of ways and character customization based around cybernetic enhancements. Conversations between characters feature a variety of responses, with choices at key story points affecting how some events play out. A post-release patch incorporated deathmatch-style multiplayer.\n\"Deus Ex\" is set in 2052, in a dystopian cyberpunk future beset by terrorist acts, economic inequality, and a plague dubbed the Gray Death. The player character, the cybernetically enhanced JC Denton, is an anti-terrorism agent who is deployed when a terrorist group interrupts supplies of a rare Gray Death vaccine. Investigating the incident, Denton ends up involved in a struggle between multiple factions for control of the world. The story is inspired by popular conspiracy theory motifs, incorporating groups including the Illuminati and Majestic 12.\nThe game was created by Warren Spector, who acted as director and producer, and put together a design concept during the early 1990s under the title \"Troubleshooter\". After being approached by Ion Storm about creating a project with complete creative freedom, Spector began pre-production in 1997. Staff included lead designer Harvey Smith, lead writer Sheldon Pacotti, and lead composer Alexander Brandon. The game was built using the Unreal Engine, which led to issues with coding and non-playable character behavior. Due to technical and time limitations, some planned features and areas had to be downscaled or cut entirely.\nUpon release, \"Deus Ex\" was a commercial success, selling one million copies worldwide. It saw critical acclaim from game journalists for its design and freedom of player choice. Its graphics saw more mixed reactions, and the voice acting was faulted. The PlayStation 2 port saw mixed reactions, but many praised its adaptation of the game's mechanics to console. It won multiple gaming awards, has been ranked among the best video games of all time, and fostered an active fan community. It has also been cited as a prominent example of the \"immersive sim\" genre. \"Deus Ex\" was expanded into a series of the same name, with a sequel, \"\", releasing in 2003.\nGameplay.\n\"Deus Ex\" is an action role-playing game with incorporated first-person shooter and stealth mechanics. Players take on the role of JC Denton, a man equipped with nanotechnology-based cybernetic enhancements called augmentations. At the game's opening the player chooses a combat difficulty\u2212\"Easy\", \"Medium\", \"Hard\", or \"Realistic\"\u2212and customize Denton's real name, visual appearance, and starting skills. The player moves around the environment, being able to climb ladders and jump onto crates, swim through bodies of water, and crouch to negotiate narrow spaces. The environment also has interactable objects such as computers and keypads, and certain objects in the game can be carried or thrown, from small items like boxes to human bodies.\nEach hub area of the game has a variety of missions given to the player by non-playable characters (NPCs), which the player can choose to accept or ignore; these missions include quests linked to the main story and side quests unique to each hub area. These objectives can be completed in a variety of ways; these include using stealth to infiltrate an area, opening access points using hacking, launching an armed assault, or a combination of different tactics. When talking with NPCs, the player has access to multiple dialogue options, with the option chosen influencing the course of the conversation. Short messages are also given which direct the player towards different objectives.\nThere are a variety of melee and ranged weapons in the game, both lethal and non-lethal; ranged weapons can be upgraded using kits found during gameplay. Items, weapons, ammunition, and equipment can be purchased with credits, the in-game currency either gathered in the environment or earned through quests, or found during exploration. Items that can be picked up include weapon ammunition, health restoratives, and tools for bypassing barriers; lockpicks for mechanical locks, and multitools for electronic devices. The player's health is divided between multiple body parts, each requiring healing with items or at healing stations. Inventory space is limited, with items and weapons taking up varying amounts of space.\nDenton's abilities can be enhanced over the course of the game. Skill points earned by completing quests can be spent on the eleven skill types; computers, electronics, the environment, lockpicking, medicine, swimming and five weapon proficiencies. For instance, raising environment proficiency allows for higher jumps and more resistance to hostile environmental effects. During character creation skill points can be reassigned from one skill to another, but after this point skill increases are permanent. Additionally, augmentation canisters can be found or bought throughout the game. Denton starts with three augmentations; the story-based infolink communicator, a light, and a tool for identifying hostiles. Other augmentations, such as increased movement speed, can be unlocked and upgraded using canisters a maximum of four times. One body area can only have one augmentation installed, and they are permanent. Using an augmentation costs energy, which is restored using consumable biocells.\nA post-release patch added a multiplayer option. Set across different large levels pulled from different areas of the game, multiplayer was limited to \"deathmatch\" and \"team deathmatch\" modes, where players fought to the death either individually or as allied groups. Spawn points provided players with tools and equipment to navigate the level and fight other players, although there were a stricter inventory limit. Unless specified by the match host, players only receive augmentation canisters based on their kills, and must still between different upgrades. The multiplayer mode's servers shut down in April 2014.\nSynopsis.\nSetting and characters.\n\"Deus Ex\" takes place in the year 2052 in a dystopian cyberpunk future on the brink of social and economic collapse, where multiple conspiracy theories and organizations are real. The two main factions in-game are the Illuminati, portrayed as an ancient secret society controlling civilization from the shadows, and Majestic 12, once subordinate to the Illuminati and now a splinter group. During the events of \"Deus Ex\", the world is being ravaged by a plague dubbed the Gray Death, with supplies of its Ambrosia vaccine limited. The game takes place across multiple locations including multiple parts of the United States (New York City, California, Nevada), Hong Kong, and Paris. A recurring location is Liberty Island, which houses an operating base for the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO). UNATCO's main conflict is with the National Secessionist Force (NSF), a terrorist group targeting Ambrosia shipments. Another feature of the world is \"augmentations\", artificial enhancements using mechanics and nanotechnology.\nThe main protagonist is JC Denton, an agent for UNATCO who has received advanced nanotechnology; he works at UNATCO with his brother Paul Denton, who shares the same nanotech augmentations, under the command of Joseph Manderley. Other important characters are Tracer Tong, a hacker allied with the Triads of Hong Kong; Morgan Everett, a high-ranking Illuminati member; Daedelus, an artificial intelligence construct and its successor Icarus; Walton Simons, newly appointed Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and Bob Page, a corporate CEO and current leader of Majestic 12.\nPlot.\n\"Note: While the general plot of Deus Ex follows a distinct path, many elements are subject to the player's decisions. The game also offers subplots that the player may or may not encounter, depending on their actions within the game. This synopsis concentrates on the main, unavoidable plot thread of the game.\"\nJC Denton is brought straight from training when the NSF attack Liberty Island. While he defeats them, a shipment of Ambrosia is stolen and taken to New York. JC takes on multiple missions tracking the NSF and the Ambrosia shipment, eventually finding out that Paul has defected to the NSF, acting as a mole within UNATCO after learning the Gray Death was a man-made disease used for power and population control. As punishment for his defection, Simons takes control and activates a kill switch, giving Paul just 24 hours left alive. Ordered by Manderly to eliminate Tracer Tong in Hong Kong, JC instead finds Paul's hideout in New York, learning more details about UNATCO's operations but prompting his employers to attack him. JC's kill switch is also activated, and Paul can either escape or be killed by Simons' agents.\nJC is taken to a Majestic 12 prison beneath UNATCO, but escapes with help from \"Daedalus\", initially assumed to be a hacker. JC travels to Hong Kong and finds Tong, getting help removing the kill switch in exchange for resolving a war between the Triads. Tong identifies the virus as created by VersaLife, Page's company and a former Illuminati asset. Destroying the universal constructor creating the virus and stealing the Ambrosia plans, JC is then sent by Tong to the Illuminati's remaining base in Paris. JC finds Morgan Everett, who explains the Gray Death was intended as an aid to augmentation, but was stolen and repurposed by Page and Simons. To stop Page from producing more Gray Death, JC agrees to defend against Simons's assault on Vandenberg Air Force Base, where a group of Majestic 12 defectors are hiding with a second universal constructor.\nJC learns from the Vandenberg scientists that Daedalus is an AI currently allied with Everett. When Everett attempts to defeat Majestic 12 using Daedalus, Page counters with his successor AI Icarus. The process causes Daedalus and Icarus to merge into a new entity \"Helios\", which seizes control of worldwide communication. JC must then travel to Area 51, where Page is in the process of merging with Helios to gain global power. JC is then given three options for defeating Page and resolving the situation. Tong wants the base destroyed, bringing down the world's communication network and triggering a \"Dark Age\" of free city states, Everett wants to preserve the technology and re-establish the Illuminati as the world's controllers, and Helios seeks to merge with JC and become a benevolent dictator.\nDevelopment.\nThe concept for \"Deus Ex\" was created by Warren Spector, who first started writing its design document while working on ' (1993). Initially titled \"Troubleshooter\", it laid out the basic gameplay ideas and real-world based setting. While he pitched the game concept to both Origin Systems and Looking Glass Studios, the pitch was turned down due to its ambitious nature, technical constraints of the time, and lack of interest from senior staff. Another game where he attempted these concepts, titled \"Junction Point\", was cancelled mid-production. During his work on \"System Shock\" (1994) and the project which became ' (1998), Spector became frustrated at creative limitations placed on him, and due to financial troubles Looking Glass Studio closed down their Austin branch where Spector worked. He was invited to join the newly founded Ion Storm by co-founder John Romero, who offered Spector complete creative freedom on his next project. Spector eventually agreed and led the creation of Ion Storm's Austin studio where \"Deus Ex\" would be developed.\nPublisher Eidos Interactive's former executive chairman Ian Livingstone described their decision to back \"Deus Ex\" as part of a strategy to broaden the company's portfolio away from \"Tomb Raider\". He felt Eidos were right to back the concept due to Spector's skills and ambition. Pre-production began in August 1997 under the working title \"Shooter: Majestic Revelations\". Spector led the game's team as producer and lead director. During the early stages he both helped run the new studio, and hired staff for the game. Team members included lead designer Harvey Smith, with whom Spector had worked at Looking Glass Studios, Chris Norden as lead programmer and assistant director, and level designer Steve Powers. The team eventually expanded to twenty people, split between two design teams and an art team led by Jay Lee. Development spanned a six-month pre-production period with a team of six, and twenty-eight months of full production with a staff of twenty. The game was declared gold (indicating that it was being prepared for duplication and release) in June 2000.\nGame design.\nThe original design documented cited the gameplay inspirations as \"Half-Life\", \"Fallout\", \"Thief: The Dark Project\", and \"GoldenEye 007\"; the game as a whole was meant to be \"genre-busting\" with combined elements of role-playing, first-person shooter, adventure and stealth. Spector later cited the limited choices available in the first \"Suikoden\" game as an inspiration for the broad range of story and gameplay options in \"Deus Ex\". Spector's aim with the gameplay was to allow as much player freedom as possible; his design document and personal goals included \"problems, not puzzles\", \"no forced failure\", \"players do; NPCs watch\", and \"areas with multiple entrance and exit points\". These early designs underwent extensive expansions and alterations during early production. An early commitment was making level areas open-ended, with multiple ways to resolve gameplay and story situations. The opening \"Liberty Island\" was designed as a vertical slice, showing off the various gameplay elements the team wanted to implement overall. There were some limitations put in place such as restricting what and how many augmentations the player could have access to, which Spector explained as promoting variety between players. Following early negative feedback from an industry demo with several prominent designers including Doug Church and Gabe Newell, the augmentation gameplay was reworked to incorporate the limited energy mechanic.\nThe team opted to license a third-party engine for the game rather than building their own, which ultimately gave more time for story and gameplay development. Once pre-production was completed, the team settled on the Unreal Engine as it would cover most of what they wanted to do from a design perspective, and was easy for their programmers to handle. As the Unreal Engine was designed for first-person shooters, the RPG mechanics such as leveling and inventory were added by the developers, alongside additional graphical elements like lip syncing for dialogue. Programmer Scott Martin implemented a wide range of new NPC behavior including patrols, idling, and sitting down. During early testing the enemy reactions were so acute that Martin had to adjust their behavior and detection protocols to be more forgiving. The AI coding caused problems until late into development, with the team building on Unreal Engine's existing code and causing unpredictable NPC behavior as a result. Church provided help with some of the AI programming.\nSpector described the early high-concept work on the game as the smoothest period, with later production running into repeated issues. The game's scale and conflicting suggestions from playtesters began causing problems for the team. There were also conflicts between Smith and Robert White, who both wanted to lead the gameplay design, so Spector split duties. Smith was given control of the simulation elements, while White was put in charge of the role-playing elements. The production milestones necessitated trimming or altering features; Spector recalled Smith using the phrase \"Less is more\" in reference to these elements. The conflicts between the two design teams were described by Spector as \"a bunch of knock-down drag-out fights\". The team's morale also suffered due to negative press surrounding Ion Storm from to the Dallas studio; these included controversies surrounding \"Daikatana\" (2000), and the troubled production of \"Anachronox\" (2001). The Austin team adopted what Spector described as an unhelpful \"'we'll show them' mentality\", determined to distinguish their work from the Dallas studio.\nPlanned environments needed to be scaled down due to technical issues that were appearing in early demo builds. Some content was cut entirely including a female option for JC Denton, and stages set in the White House, Russia, and on board a space station. Finished elements from those cut sections were incorporated into the final story and levels. The feature Spector most regretting dropping was plans for multiplayer that would have featured at release, describing the other dropped content as \"just kind of stupid stuff\". By contrast, Martin was upset that those sections had to be cut, but understood they had to release the game due to troubles with Ion Storm's other titles. Spector later commented that all aspects of the game's systems, except for the inventory management and NPC conversations, were redesigned in some form during production.\nScenario.\nThe storyline drew from multiple sources, including \"The X-Files\", \"\", \"The Manchurian Candidate\", \"RoboCop\", and \"Men in Black\". Inspired by his wife's liking for \"The X-Files\", Spector connected the \"real world, millennial weirdness, [and] conspiracy\" topics to appeal to a broad audience; Spector later stated the team's extensive research into conspiracies to reference in-game helped them understand how conspiracy theorists thought. The approach towards a player-driven storyline was inspired by a \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" session he was part of in 1978 with science fiction author Bruce Sterling, one of the credited originators of the cyberpunk genre. During the session a story naturally emerged within the setting Sterling created, and Spector wanted to recapture that feeling. The more grounded world design, defined as a \"real-world roleplaying game\", was a direct reaction to his fatigue with the sci-fi and fantasy worlds he had worked with on earlier projects.\nWhile the initial story plan was described as similar to \"The X-Files\", Spector felt the final product was close in tone to \"James Bond\". The story changed a lot during production, with supporting characters and antagonists changing a lot and the narrative being streamlined at the suggestion of staff members including Smith, but JC Denton's presence and role as a government agent remained consistent. The game's content, which included terrorism and cybernetically-enhanced soldiers, was also directly inspired by news stories that were starting to appear regularly in 1997. Some of the plot's references were described as being \"literally ripped from the headlines\" such as references to the Trilateral Commission and modern protest groups. Spector later felt uncomfortable with how some in-game events unintentionally mirrored later real-life developments such as the September 11 attacks.\nThe script was principally written by Sheldon Pacotti. Additional material was written by Chris Todd and Austin Grossman; Grossman focused on small verbal \"barks\" and rewriting conversations where needed, while Todd wrote in-game texts and the opening and ending cutscenes. When Pacotti joined in 1999, all the characters had names and detailed backstories, with the main job being implementing the plans of Spector and Smith into the finished game. The pre-release script was very large, and the writing team were working constantly on it for six months. Smith took the large draft script and trimmed it down, while designer Albert Yarusso created a dialogue management system. The writing team were reading several books covering popular conspiracy theories of the time, and Grossman attributed the political elements to Spector and Pacotti. After Pacotti was hired, the story's tone shifted sharply towards the \"conspiracy and socialist angle\". Pacotti enjoyed working on the story, writing for it constantly after being impressed by seeing Spector's playthrough of an early game. In hindsight, Grossman felt embarrassed by some of the character stereotypes they used for NPCs in Paris and Hong Kong.\nThe original design document had \"dozens\" of character concepts that survived into the final game, but had to be changed to fit design constraints. While Spector's original design only featured human enemies, his team persuaded him to add in robots and non-human enemies based on the game's lore, something he felt benefited the final product. Due to how characters such as Paul could die, they could not be full incorporated into the second half of the game's story, but scenes related to them were put in place later in development to resolve their plot lines if they survived. These insertions were decided a meeting between Smith, Church and the script writers. Some of the uneven character representation was explained as being due to focusing on gameplay over story, with their additions being last-minute inclusions. The endings were designed as isolated late-game choices independent from previous decisions made during within the game. Smith explained the decision as a way not to \"trap\" players into a particular route based on earlier decisions they might not understand. Plans for an ending following on from the player either dying to or siding with Page were dropped due to time constraints.\nAudio.\nThe music of \"Deus Ex\" was handled by members of Straylight Productions, a music group who had notably worked on the \"Unreal\" series. The main composer was Alexander Brandon, with additional work by Dan Gardop\u00e9e, Michiel van den Bos and Reeves Gabrels. Gabrels' contributions were the club songs for New York, Paris and Hong Kong. Speaking in 2007, Brandon remembered \"Deus Ex\" as his favorite project due to positive feedback from players. As with their earlier projects, the music used the MOD module file format. The main theme was based on an unused music track created by Brandon for a cancelled \"Unreal\" project. \"Deus Ex\" was Brandon's last game as a member of Straylight, as he moved to Ion Storm as head of their audio department.\nSpeaking about the voice acting, Brandon described it as \"really cheesy\" but effective due to it communicating the different characters' personalities quickly. Both JC and Paul Denton were voiced by Jay Anthony Franke, an aspiring voice actor who was working in QA at Ion Storm at the time. Franke estimated his lines totaled between 11,000 and 14,000 words. As he was also a QA tester for the game, his lines were added in very late by the sound team so he would not have to listen to himself during testing. Spector estimated that the game had around 150,000 lines of voiced dialogue, which was localized into European languages for its release on those regions.\nRelease.\nDuring production, the game was originally planned for a release around Christmas 1998, but was repeatedly pushed back due to production problems. By mid-1998, the title had become \"Deus Ex\", taken from the phrase \"deus ex machina\" originating in ancient theater and typically meaning an unexpected person or figure resolving a situation without warning. Spector described the title as a multilayered wordplay on the story's themes, the difficulties of game plots, the concept of a computer game, and a \"self-referential\" acceptance of trying one's best to resolve affairs. The game was shown off at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show, and first previewed at E3 1999. As part of the marketing, the team created an authentic-looking website for UNATCO and linked it to pre-existing government websites; excessive traffic from the UNATCO page caused one of those websites to crash, prompting a call from that agency's lawyers.\n\"Deus Ex\" was published by Eidos Interactive during 2000 on Microsoft Windows; June 23 in North America, July 27 in Australia, and the United Kingdom on August 4, 2000. The game was supported after release with software patches to resolve framerate issues with Direct3D, and introduce the multiplayer mode. A \"Game of the Year\" edition was released on May 8, 2001, incorporating the additions and including a soundtrack CD. The \"Game of the Year\" edition was released through Steam on March 29, 2007.\nVersions for Mac OS and Linux operating systems were being planned during the game's production. The Mac OS port was in development at Westlake Interactive prior to the PC version's release. The Mac OS port was published in North America by Aspyr on July 13, 2000, and was patched to fix technical issues and introduce multiplayer. A Linux port was in development at Loki Games before the company closed down in 2002.\n\"Deus Ex: The Conspiracy\".\nA port of the game for PlayStation 2 (PS2), titled \"Deus Ex: The Conspiracy\" outside Europe, was published by Eidos Interactive during 2002; it released in North America on March 26, in Europe on June 7, and in Australia on December 13. It was re-released on the PlayStation+ service on June 17, 2025, as a Premium exclusive. The port was developed in-house by Ion Storm with a team of fourteen people, many drawn from the original team. Spector described the largest issue with the port being the PS2's limited memory space, since Spector wanted the game ported over with as much content intact as possible. As part of porting, the level maps were streamlined or re-arranged, the difficulty and augmentation mechanics were rebalanced, and the interface had to be fully redesigned to be understandable and easily usable for console users.\nThe initial design document as described by the port's producer Bill Money called for the levels to be redesigned with ending boss fights, which caused him to \"flip\". While the original character models used a mesh-based design, the PS2 version was updated to a skeletal model for more realistic movement. Motion capture was also added for male and female models. The release was delayed by a couple of months due to the need for optimisation to decrease load times and the burden on console memory. The frame rate issues required a lot of the game's code to be moved from the Unreal-native environment into C++ format.\nMods.\nThe software development kit (SDK) for \"Deus Ex\" was released on September 22, 2000, and shortly thereafter, fans of the game began to create mods. In a press release related to the patch, Spector and other team members stated they were eager to see what the modding community would make. Notable mods include \"The Nameless Mod\" (\"TNM\"), a \"total conversion\" released in 2009; \"Deus Ex: Revision\", a publisher-endorsed mod released in 2015 that overhauled the game's graphics, gameplay and soundtrack; and \"The Lay D Denton Project\", a 2021 release which restores a female JC Denton with new voice acting and adjustments to existing voice lines to account for the gender change.\n\"Deus Ex: Remastered\".\nA modern remaster of the game, \"Deus Ex: Remastered\", was announced during the September 2025 State of Play broadcast. It is set for release on February 5, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows and Nintendo Switch. The remaster is being co-developed by Eidos-Montr\u00e9al and Aspyr, and published by Aspyr. It includes updated graphics, adjustments to the gameplay including autosaves, and controller support inspired by later \"Deus Ex\" titles.\nAudience response to the remaster's announcement trailer was negative, with users criticizing the updated graphics\u2014some comparing the visuals to \"\"\u2014and opining that the remastering was inferior to available user mods. \"PC Gamer\" called the remaster's graphics \"bafflingly shiny, alarmingly bulbous, [and] strangely smooth\".\nReception.\nSales.\nAccording to \"Computer Gaming World\"'s Stefan Janicki, \"Deus Ex\" had \"sold well in North America\" by early 2001 with regular placement in top ten best-selling lists for several weeks, and showed even better performance in Europe with similar sales position throughout the summer of 2000. The game achieved sales of 138,840 copies and revenues of $5 million in the United States by the end of 2000, according to PC Data. It received a \"Silver\" award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) in February 2002, indicating lifetime sales of at least 100,000 units in the United Kingdom. The ELSPA later raised it to \"Gold\" status, for 200,000 sales. As of April 2009, \"Deus Ex\" has sold over 1 million copies sold worldwide.\nCritical response.\n\"Deus Ex\" met with very positive reception, with review aggregation website \"Metacritic\" giving it a score of 90 out of 100 based on 28 critic reviews. Across multiple reviews, the gameplay variety and amount of player freedom met with general praise. The graphics and audio saw more mixed reactions.\nJeff Lundrigan of \"Next Generation\" lauded the title as one of the best PC titles available due to the breadth of its gameplay options. Kieron Gillen of \"PC Gamer UK\" focused on gameplay in his review, highlighting the freedom of choice with approaches and depth of its systems. The reviewer for \"Edge\" similarly praised the amount of choices offered to players and the depth of customization through the skill and augmentation systems. Rob Fahay of \"Eurogamer\" was pleased with the amount of ways he could approach and solve a problem, and that unconventional solutions did not break the game. \"GamePro\"'s Chris Patterson had similar sentiments towards the gameplay and number of approaches given to players during missions. Tal Blevins of \"IGN\" praised both the depth of gameplay options, and the strong level design, feeling that each complemented the other and that no two playthroughs would be the same. \"GameSpot\"'s Greg Kasavin similarly praised the variety of approaches available in missions, but faulted the individual parts of gameplay like combat and hacking for a lack of depth. \"GameSpy\"'s Gino Gard lauded the gameplay's core design, but noted erratic behavior in enemy AI.\nGard praised the graphics and environment design without details, and Patterson described it as one of the better-looking Unreal-powered games available. \"Edge\" enjoyed the game's visual design, putting a lot of its charm down to good level design. Kasavin was less positive about the graphics, mostly blaming low lighting levels, and further noted some space and technical issues. Blevin noted the graphics as one of the game's weak points, faulting the stiff character movement and graphical issues that appeared during gameplay. Lundrigan similarly noted stiff character animations, but otherwise praised the graphics as complementing the urban environment design. There was a recurring concern about the game's high graphical requirements.\nPatterson positively noted the sound design, but felt the voice acting was \"a mixed bag\", praising supporting characters while faulting NPC accents used in the Paris and Hong Kong sections. Kasavin described the soundtrack as engaging but forgettable, and summed up the voice acting as \"mediocre or at best inconsistent\". Fahay praised the voice work as good by video game standards, Lundrigan noted the voice acting let down the writing, while \"Edge\" summed up the voice acting as \"appalling\".\nBlevins summed up the story as \"one of the finest crafted in any game\", comparing it positively to a season of \"The X-Files\" in game form. Gillen described the story as having satisfying and optional depth, and praised the lack of traditional cutscenes. Kasavin enjoyed the overarching narrative, but faulted a lack of character development as they undermined later plot twists. Lundrigan enjoyed the writing and found it \"remarkably fluid\" in its detail variations, while Fahay summed up the story as \"highly derivative\". \"Edge\" enjoyed the opening premise, but criticized the use of \"third-rate sci-fi nonsense\" by its conclusion.\nThe PS2 port also saw positive reviews from critics, earning a score of 81 out of 100 \"Metacritic\" based on 25 reviews. Several reviewers described it as a good port. John Davison, writing for \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\", was impressed by how well the PC original's mechanics and depth had been adapted for a console game experience. Justin Leeper of \"Game Informer\" was generally positive about the game, but faulted the graphics as low quality for the time. In a second opinion, Matthew Kato praised the adaptation of the PC original's controls to the PS2's DualShock controller, but faulted the lack of improvements to environments and AI behavior. \"GameSpy\"'s Christopher Buecheler positively noted new character models and accurate gameplay adaptation from PC, but noted some frame rate drops and felt the graphics looked poor compared to other PS2 games of the time. \"GamePro\" gave high praise to the control conversion with both movement and inventory management, but noted long load times between areas. Kasavin similarly faulted the long load times when going between different areas. \"IGN\"'s David Smith was far less positive, praising the pre-established gameplay elements and sound design, but faulting its redone controls and lack of graphical upgrades.\nLegacy.\nAccording to Spector, \"Deus Ex\" received over thirty \"Best of\" awards from various outlets during 2001, something of which he remains proud. The game has also ranked high in lists of the best video games of all time compiled by various publications. \"1UP.com\" listed it as one of the most important games of all time, calling its influence \"too massive to properly gauge\". Several articles and retrospectives have cited \"Deus Ex\" as a prominent example of the \"immersive sim\", a type of video game that promotes realism and freedom of player choice. A movie adaptation was also licensed by Columbia Pictures in 2002.\nSpeaking in 2015, Spector recalled that he never expected the game to sell well, but was pleased it gained a strong cult following and continued to receive fan letters about it. Several former staff workers including Smith, Paccotti, and others associated with Ion Storm recall their time with the game fondly as both a team effort and an informative experience.\nFuture games.\nA sequel to \"Deus Ex\" was announced in 2001, with Ion Storm and Eidos Interactive returning as developer and publisher respectively; the next game was designed as a console-focused release. Many of the original staff returned, with Smith acting as director, and Pacotti and Brandon returning as lead writer and composer. Titled ', the game released in 2003 for Windows and the original Xbox. Ion Storm made multiple attempts to create a third \"Deus Ex\" title before closing in 2005. The \"Deus Ex\" series was revived at new developer Eidos-Montr\u00e9al, which would go on to develop or supervise multiple titles beginning with the prequel ' (2011).\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award, alongside Pel\u00e9.\nAn advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave him a low centre of gravity and allowed him to manoeuvre better than most other players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname (\"The Golden Boy\"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career.\nMaradona was the first player to set the world record transfer fee twice: in 1982 when he transferred to Barcelona for \u00a35\u00a0million, and in 1984 when he moved to Napoli for a fee of \u00a36.9\u00a0million. He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla and Newell's Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades and led the club to their first Serie A title win only to do it all over again one year later. Maradona also had a troubled off-field life and his time with Napoli ended after he was banned for taking cocaine.\nIn his international career with Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals. Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups, including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. In the 1986 World Cup quarter final, he scored both goals in a 2\u20131 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the \"Hand of God\", while the second goal followed a dribble past five England players, voted \"Goal of the Century\" by \"FIFA.com\" voters in 2002.\nMaradona also had a career in management. He became the coach of Argentina's national football team in November 2008. He was in charge of the team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament. He then coached Dubai-based club Al Wasl in the UAE Pro-League for the 2011\u201312 season. In 2017, Maradona became the coach of Fujairah before leaving at the end of the season. From May to September 2018, he was the chairman of Dynamo Brest. From September 2018 to June 2019, Maradona was coach of Mexican club Dorados, and was the coach of Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Gimnasia de La Plata from September 2019 until his death in 2020. In 2022, he was ranked as the third best football player of all time by football magazine \"FourFourTwo\". In August 2024, the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) voted him as the second best footballer of the past 100 years after Pel\u00e9.\nEarly years.\nDiego Armando Maradona was born on 30 October 1960, at the Policl\u00ednico (Polyclinic) Evita Hospital in Lan\u00fas, Buenos Aires Province, to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province; he was raised in Villa Fiorito, a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was the first son after four daughters. He has two younger brothers, Hugo (\"el Turco\") and Ra\u00fal (Lalo), both of whom were also professional football players. His father Diego Maradona \"Chitoro\" (1927\u20132015), who worked at a chemicals factory, was of Guaran\u00ed (Indigenous) and Galician (Spanish) descent, and his mother Dalma Salvadora Franco, \"Do\u00f1a Tota\" (1929\u20132011), was of Italian and Croatian descent.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Diego came to Argentinos Juniors for trials, I was really struck by his talent and couldn't believe he was only eight years old. In fact, we asked him for his ID card so we could check it, but he told us he didn't have it on him. We were sure he was having us on because, although he had the physique of a child, he played like an adult. When we discovered he'd been telling us the truth, we decided to devote ourselves purely to him.\u2014\u200a\nMaradona's parents were both born and brought up in the town of Esquina in the north-east province of Corrientes on the banks of the Corriente River. In the 1950s, they left Esquina and settled in Buenos Aires. Maradona received his first football as a gift at age three and quickly became devoted to the game. At age eight, he was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his local club Estrella Roja. In March 1969 he was recommended to \"Los Cebollitas\" (The Little Onions), the junior team of Buenos Aires's Argentinos Juniors by his close friend and football rival Gregorio Carrizo who had already been picked by coach Francis Gregorio Cornejo. Maradona became a star for the Cebollitas, and as a 12-year-old ball boy he amused spectators by showing his ball skills during the halftime breaks of Argentinos Juniors' first division games. During 1973 and 1974, Maradona led Cebollitas to two \"Evita Tournament\" wins and 141 undefeated games in a row, playing alongside players like Adrian Domenech and Claudio Rodr\u00edguez, in what is regarded as the best youth team in the history of Argentine football. Maradona named Brazilian playmaker Rivellino and Manchester United winger George Best among his inspirations growing up.\nClub career.\nArgentinos Juniors.\nOn 20 October 1976, Maradona made his professional debut for Argentinos Juniors, 10 days before his 16th birthday, versus Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba. He entered to the pitch wearing the number 16 jersey, and became the youngest player in the history of the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n. A few minutes into his debut, Maradona kicked the ball through the legs of Juan Domingo Cabrera, a nutmeg that would become symbolic of his talent. After the game, Maradona said: \"That day I felt I had held the sky in my hands.\" Thirty years later, Cabrera remembered Maradona's debut: \"I was on the right side of the field and went to press him, but he didn't give me a chance. He made the nutmeg and when I turned around, he was far away from me.\"\nMaradona scored his first goal as a professional against Marplatense team San Lorenzo on 14 November 1976, two weeks after turning 16, and added another goal in the match as well. Maradona made 11 appearances that season, with the two goals scored on his debut being the only ones he scored.\nIn the 1977 season, Maradona played 49 matches and scored 19 goals, and started to get on the radar of other South American clubs. In the 1978 season, Maradona scored 26 goals in 35 matches, and had the 1978 World Cup in his sights. However, when the squads were released on 19 May, he was not selected by coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti to the surprise of many. Two days after being left out, he scored a brace in a victory against his Chacarita Juniors. In 1979, Maradona scored 26 goals in 26 games, and finished top scorer in both Metropolitan and Nacional tournaments. in 1980, he scored 43 goals in 45 appearances and was the top scorer again for the last four consecutive tournaments.\nBoca Juniors.\nMaradona spent five years at Argentinos Juniors, from 1976 to 1981, scoring 115 goals in 167 appearances before his US$4-million transfer to Boca Juniors in February 1981. Maradona received offers to join other clubs, including River Plate who offered to make him the club's best paid player. However, River decided to drop its bid due to its large payroll in keeping Daniel Passarella and Ubaldo Fillol.\nMaradona signed a contract with Boca Juniors on 20 February 1981. He made his debut two days later against Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba, scoring twice in the club's 4\u20131 win. On 10 April, Maradona played his first \"Supercl\u00e1sico\" against River Plate at La Bombonera stadium. Boca defeated River 3\u20130 with Maradona scoring a goal after dribbling past Alberto Tarantini and Fillol. Despite the distrustful relationship between Maradona and Boca Juniors manager, Silvio Marzolini, Boca had a successful season, winning the league title after securing a point against Racing Club. That would be the only title won by Maradona in the Argentine domestic league.\nBarcelona.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"He had complete mastery of the ball. When Maradona ran with the ball or dribbled through the defence, he seemed to have the ball tied to his boots. I remember our early training sessions with him: the rest of the team were so amazed that they just stood and watched him. We all thought ourselves privileged to be witnesses of his genius.\"\n\u2014Barcelona teammate Lobo Carrasco\nAfter the 1982 World Cup, Maradona was transferred to Barcelona for a then world record fee of \u00a35\u00a0million ($7.6\u00a0million). In the 1982\u201383 season, under coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, Barcelona and Maradona won two trophies, the Copa del Rey and Copa de la Liga, both of them coming against Real Madrid.\nOn 26 June 1983, in the 1st leg of the Copa de la Liga finals at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu, Maradona scored and became the first Barcelona player to be applauded by arch-rival Real Madrid fans. Maradona dribbled past Madrid goalkeeper Agust\u00edn, and as he approached the empty goal, he stopped just as Madrid defender Juan Jos\u00e9 came sliding in an attempt to block the shot. Jos\u00e9 ended up crashing into the post, before Maradona slotted the ball into the net. With the manner in which the goal was scored resulting in applause from opposition fans, only Ronaldinho (in November 2005) and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta (in November 2015) have since been granted such an ovation as Barcelona players from Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Three days later, Barcelona won the second leg 2\u20131, with Maradona scoring a penalty and helping his club win another title against their archrivals.\nDue to illness and injury as well as controversial incidents on the field, Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona. First a bout of hepatitis, then a broken ankle in a La Liga game at the Camp Nou in September 1983 caused by a reckless tackle by Athletic Bilbao's Andoni Goikoetxea\u2014nicknamed \"the Butcher of Bilbao\"\u2014threatened to jeopardize Maradona's career, but with treatment and rehabilitation, it was possible for him to return to the pitch after a three-month recovery period.\nMaradona was directly involved in a violent fight during the 1984 Copa del Rey Final in Madrid against Athletic Bilbao. After receiving another hard tackle by Goikoetxea, as well as being taunted with racist insults related to his father's Native American ancestry throughout the match by Bilbao fans, and being provoked by Bilbao's Miguel Sola at full time after Barcelona lost 1\u20130, Maradona snapped. He aggressively got up, stood inches from Sola's face and the two exchanged words. This started a chain reaction of emotional reactions from both teams. Using expletives, Sola mimicked a gesture from the crowd towards Maradona by using a xenophobic term. Maradona then headbutted Sola, elbowed another Bilbao player in the face and kneed another player in the head, knocking him out cold. The Bilbao squad surrounded Maradona to exact some retribution, with Goikoetxea connecting with a high kick to his chest, before the rest of the Barcelona squad joined in to help Maradona. From this point, Barcelona and Bilbao players brawled on the field with Maradona in the centre of the action, kicking and punching anyone in a Bilbao shirt.\nThe mass brawl was played out in front of the Spanish King Juan Carlos and an audience of 100,000 fans inside the stadium, and more than half of Spain watching on television. After fans began throwing solid objects on the field at the players, coaches and even photographers, sixty people were injured, with the incident effectively sealing Maradona's transfer out of the club in what was his last game in a Barcelona shirt. One Barcelona executive stated: \"When I saw those scenes of Maradona fighting and the chaos that followed I realized we couldn't go any further with him.\" Maradona got into frequent disputes with Barcelona executives, particularly club president Josep Llu\u00eds N\u00fa\u00f1ez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of the Camp Nou in 1984. During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games. Maradona transferred to Napoli in Italy's Serie A for another world record fee, \u00a36.9\u00a0million ($10.48\u00a0million).\nNapoli.\nMaradona arrived in Naples and was presented to the world media as a Napoli player on 5 July 1984, where he was welcomed by 75,000 fans at his presentation at the Stadio San Paolo. Sports writer David Goldblatt commented, \"They [the fans] were convinced that the saviour had arrived.\" A local newspaper stated that despite the lack of a \"mayor, houses, schools, buses, employment and sanitation, none of this matters because we have Maradona\". Prior to Maradona's arrival, Italian football was dominated by teams from the north and centre of the country, such as AC Milan, Juventus, Inter Milan and Roma, and no team in the south of the Italian Peninsula had ever won a league title. This was perhaps the perfect scenario for Maradona and his working-class-sympathetic image, as he joined a once-great team that was facing relegation at the end of the 1983\u201384 Serie A season, in what was the toughest and most highly regarded football league in Europe.\nAt Napoli, Maradona reached the peak of his professional career: he soon inherited the captain's armband from Napoli veteran defender Giuseppe Bruscolotti and quickly became an adored star among the club's fans; in his time there he elevated the team to the most successful era in its history. Maradona played for Napoli at a period when north\u2013south tensions in Italy were at a peak due to a variety of issues, notably the economic differences between the two.\nLed by Maradona, Napoli won their first ever Serie A Championship in 1986\u201387. Regarding the celebrations, Goldblatt wrote, \"The celebrations were tumultuous. A rolling series of impromptu street parties and festivities broke out contagiously across the city in a round-the-clock carnival which ran for over a week. The world was turned upside down. The Neapolitans held mock funerals for Juventus and Milan, burning their coffins, their death notices announcing 'May 1987, the other Italy has been defeated. A new empire is born.'\" Murals of Maradona were painted on the city's ancient buildings, and newborn children were named in his honour. Napoli completed a double that year, when they won the 1987 Coppa Italia final on aggregate against Atalanta. Maradona had been one of the key players of the campaign, scoring seven goals in ten matches, including a brace in the team's first group game against SPAL.\nThe following season, the team's prolific attacking trio, formed by Maradona, Bruno Giordano, and Careca, was later dubbed the \"Ma-Gi-Ca\" (\"magical\") front-line. Despite the team's failing to defend their league title, losing out to AC Milan after a collapse in the final four matches, Maradona was the Serie A top scorer in the 1987\u201388 season with 15 goals, and was the all-time leading goalscorer for Napoli, with 115 goals, until his record was broken by Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk in 2017. He was also the top scorer for that season's Coppa Italia, scoring six goals, despite being eliminated in the quarter-finals by Torino, with Maradona's two goals in the second leg not enough to prevent the elimination. In the 1988\u201389 season, Napoli finished runner-up in the league and in the Coppa Italia, losing to Sampdoria in the final. However the team avenged these runner-up finishes with the UEFA Cup title, won over two legs in the final against Stuttgart. During the second leg of the quarterfinals against rivals Juventus, Maradona scored a penalty, and Napoli eventually qualified to the next round after extra time. During the first leg of the finals, Maradona scored from a penalty in a 2\u20131 home victory and later assisted Careca's match-winning goal, while in the second leg on 17 May\u2014a 3\u20133 away draw\u2014he assisted Ciro Ferrara's goal with a header.\nNapoli would win their second league title in 1989\u201390, and later won the 1990 Italian Supercup, beating rivals Juventus 5\u20131. When asked who was the toughest player he ever faced, AC Milan central defender Franco Baresi stated it was Maradona, a view shared by his Milan teammate Paolo Maldini.\nAlthough Maradona was successful on the field during his time in Italy, his personal problems increased. His cocaine use continued, and he received US$70,000 in fines from his club for missing games and practices, ostensibly because of \"stress\". He faced a scandal there regarding an illegitimate son, and he was also the object of some suspicion over an alleged friendship with the Camorra crime syndicate. He also faced intense backlash and harassment from some local fans after the 1990 World Cup, in which he and Argentina beat Italy in a semi-final match at the San Paolo stadium.\nIn 2000, the number 10 jersey of Napoli was officially retired, but in 2011, Maradona stated that he wanted Ezequiel Lavezzi to use it. In a poll on Il Mattino, 54% of fans voted to keep the shirt retired, and the change ultimately did not occur. On 4 December 2020, nine days after Maradona's death, Napoli's home stadium was renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.\nLate career.\nAfter serving a 15-month ban for failing a drug test for cocaine, Maradona left Napoli in disgrace in 1992. Despite interest from Real Madrid and Marseille, he signed for Sevilla, where he stayed for one year. In 1993, he played for Newell's Old Boys and in 1995 returned to Boca Juniors for a two-year stint. Maradona also appeared for Tottenham Hotspur in a testimonial match for Osvaldo Ardiles against Internazionale, shortly before the 1986 World Cup. In 1996, he played in a friendly match alongside his brother Raul for Toronto Italia against the Canadian National Soccer League All-Stars. In 2000, he captained Bayern Munich in a friendly against the German national team in the farewell game of Lothar Matth\u00e4us. Maradona was himself given a testimonial match on 10 November 2001, played between an all-star World XI and the Argentina national team, scoring two penalty kicks in a 6\u20133 win at La Bombonera.\nInternational career.\nDebut at age 16.\nMaradona made his full international debut at age 16, against Hungary, on 27 February 1977, only four months after his professional debut for Argentinos Juniors.\nHe was left off the Argentine squad for the 1978 World Cup on home soil by coach C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti who felt he was too young at age 17. On 3 November 1978, just a few days after turning 18, Maradona played for the U20 Argentina team in a friendly match against Franz Beckenbauer's New York Cosmos, scoring twice in a 2\u20131 win.\n1979 World Youth Championship and Copa Am\u00e9rica.\nAt age 18, Maradona played the 1979 FIFA World Youth Championship in Japan and emerged as the star of the tournament, shining in Argentina's 3\u20131 final win over the Soviet Union, scoring a total of six goals in six appearances in the tournament. On 2 June 1979, Maradona scored his first senior international goal in a 3\u20131 win against Scotland at Hampden Park.\nHe went on to play for Argentina in two 1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica ties during August 1979, a 2\u20131 loss against Brazil and a 3\u20130 win over Bolivia in which he scored his side's third goal. Speaking thirty years later on the impact of Maradona's performances in 1979, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated, \"Everyone has an opinion on Diego Armando Maradona, and that's been the case since his playing days. My most vivid recollection is of this incredibly gifted kid at the second FIFA U-20 World Cup in Japan in 1979. He left everyone open-mouthed every time he got on the ball.\" Maradona and his compatriot Lionel Messi are the only players to win the Golden Ball at both the FIFA U-20 World Cup and FIFA World Cup. Maradona did so in 1979 and 1986, which Messi emulated in 2005 and 2014 (and again in 2022).\nMaradona appeared at the 1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where Argentina had a poor performance, being knocked out in the first round. Maradona exited the tournament having scored once in a 3\u20130 victory against Bolivia.\n1982 World Cup.\nMaradona played his first World Cup tournament in 1982 in his new country of residence, Spain. Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. Maradona did not perform to expectations, as Argentina, the defending champions, lost 1\u20130. Although the team convincingly beat both Hungary and El Salvador in Alicante to progress to the second round, there were internal tensions within the team, with the younger, less experienced players at odds with the older, more experienced players. With a team that also included such players as Mario Kempes, Osvaldo Ardiles, Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz, Daniel Bertoni, Alberto Tarantini, Ubaldo Fillol and Daniel Passarella, the Argentine side was defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners Italy. The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile, as Italy beat Argentina at the Sarri\u00e0 Stadium in Barcelona, 2\u20131.\nMaradona played in all five matches without being substituted, scoring twice against Hungary. He was fouled repeatedly in all five games and particularly in the last one against Brazil at the Sarri\u00e0, a game that was blighted by poor officiating and violent fouls. With Argentina already down 3\u20130 to Brazil, Maradona's temper eventually got the better of him and he was sent off with five minutes remaining for a serious retaliatory foul against Batista.\n1986 World Cup.\nMaradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, winning the final in Mexico City against West Germany. Throughout the tournament, Maradona asserted his dominance and was the most dynamic player of the competition. He played every minute of every Argentina game, scoring five goals and making five assists; three of the assists came in the opening match against South Korea at the Ol\u00edmpico Universitario Stadium in Mexico City. His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game in Puebla. Argentina eliminated Uruguay in the first knockout round in Puebla, setting up a match against England at the Azteca Stadium, also in Mexico City.\nAfter scoring two contrasting goals in the 2\u20131 quarter-final win against England, his legend was cemented. The majesty of his second goal and the notoriety of his first led to the French newspaper \"L'\u00c9quipe\" describing Maradona as \"half-angel, half-devil\". This match was played with the background of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom. Replays showed that the first goal was scored by striking the ball with his hand. Maradona was coyly evasive, describing it as \"a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God\". It became known as the \"Hand of God\". Ultimately, on 22 August 2005, Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his hand purposely, and no contact with his head was made, and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate. This became known as an international fiasco in World Cup history. The goal stood, much to the wrath of the English players.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Maradona, turns like a little eel and comes away from trouble, little squat man... comes inside Butcher and leaves him for dead, outside Fenwick and leaves him for dead, and puts the ball away... and that is why Maradona is the greatest player in the world.\"\n\u2014Bryon Butler's BBC Radio commentary on Maradona's second goal against England.\nMaradona's second goal, just four minutes after the hotly disputed hand-goal, was later voted by FIFA as the greatest goal in the history of the World Cup. He received the ball in his own half, swivelled around and with 11 touches ran more than half the length of the field, dribbling past five English outfield players (Peter Beardsley, Steve Hodge, Peter Reid, Terry Butcher and Terry Fenwick) before he left goalkeeper Peter Shilton on his backside with a feint, and slotted the ball into the net. This goal was voted \"Goal of the Century\" in a 2002 online poll conducted by FIFA. A 2002 Channel 4 poll in the UK saw his performance ranked number 6 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.\nMaradona followed this with two more goals in a semi-final match against Belgium at the Azteca, including another virtuoso dribbling display for the second goal. In the final match, West Germany attempted to contain him by double-marking him, but in the 84th minute he nevertheless found space past West German player Lothar Matth\u00e4us to give the final pass to Jorge Burruchaga for the winning goal. Argentina beat West Germany 3\u20132 in front of 115,000 fans at the Azteca with Maradona lifting the World Cup as captain.\nDuring the tournament, Maradona attempted or created more than half of Argentina's shots, attempted a tournament-best 90 dribbles\u2014three times more than any other player\u2014and was fouled a record 53 times, winning his team twice as many free kicks as any player. Maradona scored or assisted ten of Argentina's 14 goals (71%), including the assist for the winning goal in the final, ensuring that he would be remembered as one of the greatest names in football history. By the end of the World Cup, Maradona went on to win the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament by unanimous vote and was widely regarded to have won the World Cup virtually single-handedly, something that he later stated he did not entirely agree with. Zinedine Zidane, watching the 1986 World Cup as a 14-year-old, stated Maradona \"was on another level\". In a tribute to him, Azteca Stadium authorities built a statue of him scoring the \"Goal of the Century\" and placed it at the entrance of the stadium.\nRegarding Maradona's performance at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, in 2014, Roger Bennett of \"ESPN FC\" described it as \"the most virtuoso performance a World Cup has ever witnessed,\" while Kevin Baxter of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history,\" with Steven Goff of \"The Washington Post\" dubbing his performance as \"one of the finest in tournament annals.\" In 2002, Russell Thomas of \"The Guardian\" described Maradona's second goal against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals as \"arguably the greatest individual goal ever.\" In a 2009 article for \"CBC Sports\", John Molinaro described the goal as \"the greatest ever scored in the tournament \u2013 and, maybe, in soccer.\" In a 2018 article for \"Sportsnet\", he added: \"No other player, not even Pel[\u00e9] in 1958 nor Paolo Rossi in 1982, had dominated a single competition the way Maradona did in Mexico.\" He also went on to say of Maradona's performance: \"The brilliant Argentine artist single-handedly delivered his country its second World Cup.\" Regarding his two memorable goals against England in the quarter-finals, he commented: \"Yes, it was Maradona's hand, and not God's, that was responsible for the first goal against England. But while the 'Hand of God' goal remains one of the most contentious moments in World Cup history, there can be no disputing that his second goal against England ranks as the greatest ever scored in the tournament. It transcended mere sports \u2013 his goal was pure art.\"\n1987 and 1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica.\nAt the 1987 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Argentina, he scored three goals in four matches, including a brace in a 3\u20130 victory against Ecuador, but Argentina lost the semi-final 0\u20131 against eventual winners Uruguay.\nIn the 1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil, Maradona played six games but would not score any goals. Argentina would finish the tournament third.\n1990 World Cup.\nMaradona captained Argentina again in the 1990 World Cup in Italy to yet another World Cup final. An ankle injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier, and the team were missing three of their best players due to injury.\nAfter losing their opening game to Cameroon at the San Siro in Milan, Argentina were almost eliminated in the group stage, only qualifying in third position from their group. In the round of 16 match against Brazil in Turin, Claudio Caniggia scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona.\nIn the quarter-final, Argentina faced Yugoslavia in Florence; the match ended 0\u20130 after 120 minutes, with Argentina advancing in a penalty shootout even though Maradona's kick, a weak shot to the goalkeeper's right, was saved. The semi-final against the host nation Italy at Maradona's club stadium in Naples, the Stadio San Paolo, was also resolved on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw. This time, however, Maradona was successful with his effort, daringly rolling the ball into the net with an almost exact replica of his unsuccessful kick in the previous round.\nAt the final in Rome, Argentina lost 1\u20130 to West Germany, the only goal being a controversial penalty scored by Andreas Brehme in the 85th minute, after Rudi V\u00f6ller was adjudged to be fouled. At the final whistle, Maradona burst into tears and blamed the referee for the loss.\n1993 Artemio Franchi Cup.\nOn 24 February 1993, Maradona returned to the national team when Argentina played the 1993 Artemio Franchi Cup against Denmark in Mar del Plata. Argentina won 5\u20134 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1\u20131 draw.\n1994 World Cup.\nAt the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Maradona played in only two games (both at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston), scoring one goal against Greece, before being sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping. After scoring Argentina's third goal against Greece, Maradona had one of the most remarkable World Cup goal celebrations as he ran towards one of the sideline cameras shouting with a distorted face and bulging eyes, in sheer elation of his return to international football. This turned out to be Maradona's last international goal for Argentina. In the second game, a 2\u20131 victory over Nigeria which was to be his last game for Argentina, he set up both of his team's goals on free kicks, the second an assist to Caniggia, in what were two very strong showings by the Argentine team.\nIn his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the energy drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA expelled him from USA '94, and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the round of 16 by Romania in Los Angeles, having been a weaker team without Maradona, even with players like Gabriel Batistuta and Claudio Caniggia on the squad. Maradona also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play. His failed drug test at the 1994 World Cup signalled the end of his international career, which lasted 17 years and yielded 34 goals from 91 games, including one winner's medal and one runners-up medal in the World Cup.\nUnofficial internationals.\nAlongside official internationals, Maradona also played and scored for an Argentina XI against the World XI in 1978 to mark the first anniversary of their first World Cup win, scored for The Americas against the World in a UNICEF fundraiser a short time after the 1986 triumph, a year after that captained the 'Rest of the World' against the English Football League XI to celebrate the organization's centenary (after reportedly securing a \u00a3100,000 appearance fee)\nPlayer profile.\nStyle of play.\nDescribed as a \"classic number 10\" in the media, Maradona was a traditional playmaker who usually played in a free role, either as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards, or as a second striker in a front\u2013two, although he was also deployed as an offensive\u2013minded central midfielder in a 4\u20134\u20132 formation on occasion. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname \"El Pibe de Oro\" (\"The Golden Boy\"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career. He was renowned for his dribbling ability, vision, close ball control, passing and creativity, and is considered to have been one of the most skilful players in the sport. He had a compact physique, and with his strong legs, low center of gravity, and resulting balance, he could withstand physical pressure well while running with the ball, despite his small stature, while his acceleration, quick feet, and agility, combined with his dribbling skills and close control at speed, allowed him to change direction quickly, making him difficult for opponents to defend against.\nOn his dribbling ability, former Dutch player Johan Cruyff saw similarities between Maradona and Lionel Messi with the ball seemingly attached to their boot. His physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup. Although he was known for his penchant for undertaking individual runs with the ball, he was also a strategist and an intelligent team player, with excellent spatial awareness, as well as being highly technical with the ball. He was effective in limited spaces, and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee (as in the second goal against England in 1986), or give an assist to a free teammate. Being short, but strong, he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot. He showed leadership qualities on the field and captained Argentina in their World Cup campaigns of 1986, 1990 and 1994. While he was primarily a creative playmaker, Maradona was also known for his finishing and goalscoring ability. Former Milan manager Arrigo Sacchi also praised Maradona for his defensive work-rate off the ball in a 2010 interview with \"Il Corriere dello Sport\".\nThe team leader on and off the field \u2013 he would speak up on a range of issues on behalf of the players \u2013 Maradona's ability as a player and his overpowering personality had a major positive effect on his team, with his 1986 World Cup teammate Jorge Valdano stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Maradona was a technical leader: a guy who resolved all difficulties that may come up on the pitch. Firstly, he was in charge of making the miracles happen, that's something that gives team-mates a lot of confidence. Secondly, the scope of his celebrity was such that he absorbed all the pressures on behalf of his team-mates. What I mean is: one slept soundly the night before a game not just because you knew you were playing next to Diego and Diego did things no other player in the world could do, but also because unconsciously we knew that if it was the case that we lost then Maradona would shoulder more of the burden, would be blamed more, than the rest of us. That was the kind of influence he exercised on the team. Lauding the \"charisma\" of Maradona, another of his Argentina teammates, prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta, stated, \"Diego could command a stadium, have everyone watch him. I played with him and I can tell you how technically decisive he was for the team\". Napoli's former president \u2013 Corrado Ferlaino \u2013 commented on Maradona's leadership qualities during his time with the club in 2008, describing him as \"a coach on the pitch.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Even if I played for a million years, I'd never come close to Maradona. Not that I'd want to anyway. He's the greatest there's ever been.\"\n\u2014Lionel Messi, the player most closely identified with the \"New Maradona\" label. \nOne of Maradona's trademark moves was dribbling full-speed on the right wing, and on reaching the opponent's goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the \"rabona\", a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight. This manoeuvre led to several assists, such as the cross for Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz's header against Switzerland in 1980. Moreover, he was also a well\u2013known proponent of the \"roulette\", a feint which involved him dragging the ball back first with one foot and then the other, while simultaneously performing a 360\u00b0 turn; due to his penchant for using this move, it has even occasionally been described as the \"Maradona turn\" in the media. He was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker, who was renowned for his ability to bend the ball from corners and direct set pieces. Regarded as one of the best dead-ball specialists of all time, his free kick technique, which often saw him raise his knee at a high angle when striking the ball, thus enabling him to lift it high over the wall, allowed him to score free kicks even from close range, within 22 to 17 yards (20 to 16 metres) from the goal, or even just outside the penalty area. His style of taking free kicks influenced several other specialists, including Gianfranco Zola, Andrea Pirlo, and Lionel Messi.\nMaradona was famous for his cunning personality. Some critics view his controversial \"Hand of God\" goal at the 1986 World Cup as a clever manoeuvre, with one of the opposition players, Glenn Hoddle, admitting that Maradona had disguised it by flicking his head at the same time as palming the ball. The goal itself has been viewed as an embodiment of the Buenos Aires shanty town Maradona was brought up in and its concept of \"viveza criolla\"\u2014\"cunning of the criollos\". Although critical of the illegitimate first goal, England striker Gary Lineker conceded, \"When Diego scored that second goal against us, I felt like applauding. It was impossible to score such a beautiful goal. He's the greatest player of all time, by a long way. A genuine phenomenon.\" Maradona used his hand in the 1990 World Cup, again without punishment, and this time on his own goal line, to prevent the Soviet Union from scoring. A number of publications have referred to Maradona as the Artful Dodger, the urchin pickpocket from Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist\".\nMaradona was dominantly left-footed, often using his left foot even when the ball was positioned more suitably for a right-footed connection. His first goal against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi-final is a worthy indicator of such; he had run into the inside right channel to receive a pass but let the ball travel across to his left foot, requiring more technical ability. During his run past several England players in the previous round for the \"Goal of the Century\" he did not use his right foot once, despite spending the whole movement on the right-hand side of the pitch. In the 1990 World Cup second-round tie against Brazil, he used his right foot to set up the winning goal for Claudio Caniggia due to two Brazilian markers forcing him into a position that made use of his left foot less practical.\nReception.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Pel\u00e9 scored more goals. Lionel Messi has won more trophies. Both have lived more stable lives than the overweight former cocaine addict who tops this list, whose relationship with football became increasingly strained the longer his career continued. If you've seen Diego Maradona with a football at his feet, you'll understand.\u2014\u200a\nMaradona is widely regarded as the best player of his generation. He is considered one of the greatest players of all time by pundits, players, and managers, and by some as the best player ever. Known as one of the most skilful players in the game, he is regarded as one of the greatest dribblers and free kick takers in history. A precocious talent in his youth, in addition to his playing ability, Maradona also drew praise from his former manager Menotti for his dedication, determination, and the work-ethic he demonstrated in order to improve the technical aspect of his game in training, despite his natural gifts, with the manager noting: \"I'm always cautious about using the word 'genius'. I find it hard to apply that even to Mozart. The beauty of Diego's game has a hereditary element \u2013 his natural ease with the ball \u2013 but it also owes a lot to his ability to learn: a lot of those brushstrokes, those strokes of 'genius', are in fact a product of his hard work. Diego worked very hard to be the best.\" Maradona's former Napoli manager \u2013 Ottavio Bianchi \u2013 also praised his discipline in training, commenting: \"Diego is different to the one that they depict. When you got him on his own he was a very good kid. It was beautiful to watch him and coach him. They all speak of the fact that he did not train, but it was not true because Diego was the last person to leave the pitch, it was necessary to send him away because otherwise he would stay for hours to invent free kicks.\" However, although, as Bianchi noted, Maradona was known for making \"great plays\" and doing \"unimaginable\" and \"incredible things\" with the ball during training sessions, and would even go through periods of rigorous exercise, he was equally known for his limited work-rate in training without the ball, and even gained a degree of infamy during his time in Italy for missing training sessions with Napoli, while he often trained independently instead of with his team.\nIn a 2019 documentary film on his life, \"Diego Maradona\", Maradona confessed that his weekly regime consisted of \"playing a game on Sunday, going out until Wednesday, then hitting the gym on Thursday.\" Regarding his inconsistent training regimen, the film's director, Asif Kapadia, commented in 2020: \"He had a metabolism. He would look so incredibly out of shape, but then he'd train like crazy and sweat it off by the time matchday came along. His body shape just didn't look like a footballer, but then he had this ability and this balance. He had a way of being, and that idea of talking to him honestly about how a typical week transpired was pretty amazing.\" He also revealed that Maradona was ahead of his time in the fact that he had a personal fitness coach \u2013 Fernando Signorini \u2013 who trained him in a variety of areas, in addition to looking after his physical conditioning, adding: \"While he [Maradona] was in a football team he had his own regime. How many players would do that? How many players would even know to think like that? 'I'm different to anyone else so I need to train at what I'm good at and what I'm weak at.' Signorini is very well read and very intelligent. He would literally say, 'This is the way I'm going to train you, read this book.' He would help him psychologically, talk to him about philosophy, and things like that.\" Moreover, Maradona was notorious for his poor diet and extreme lifestyle off the pitch, including his use of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse, which along with personal issues, his metabolism, medication that he was prescribed, and periods of inactivity due to injuries and suspensions, led to his significant weight\u2013gain and physical decline as his career progressed; his lack of discipline and difficulties in his turbulent personal life are thought by some in the sport to have negatively impacted his performances and longevity in the later years of his playing career.\nA controversial figure in the sport, while he earned critical acclaim from players, pundits and managers over his playing style, he also drew criticism in the media for his temper and confrontational behaviour, both on and off the pitch. However, in 2005, Paolo Maldini described Maradona both as the greatest player he ever faced, and also as the most honest, stating: \"He was a model of good behaviour on the pitch \u2013 he was respectful of everyone, from the great players down to the ordinary team member. He was always getting kicked around and he never complained \u2013 not like some of today's strikers.\" Franco Baresi stated when he was asked who was his greatest opponent: \"Maradona; when he was on form, there was almost no way of stopping him,\" while fellow former Italy defender Giuseppe Bergomi described Maradona as the greatest player of all time in 2018. Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 said that his off-field antics did not matter, and that he should only be judged for the impact he made on the field. \"For me Maradona is more than football. What he did as a footballer, in my opinion, he will be remembered forever. When you see number 10 who do you think about? Maradona. It is a symbol, even today there are those who choose that number for him.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Today his skills would afford him greater protection. Back then they merely served as the red rag of provocation that would guarantee he would be the victim of brutal challenges wherever he played. The rules changed as a direct result of some of the injuries Maradona received. When I interviewed him a few years ago, he told me he thought players such as Lionel Messi owed him a great deal because some of the tackles he had endured would never be allowed today.\u2014\u200a\nIn 1999, Maradona was placed second behind Pel\u00e9 by \"World Soccer\" in the magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Players of the 20th Century\". Along with Pel\u00e9, Maradona was one of the two joint winners of the \"FIFA Player of the Century\" award in 2000, and also placed fifth in \"IFFHS' Century Elections\". In a 2014 FIFA poll, Maradona was voted the second-greatest number 10 of all time, behind only Pel\u00e9, and later that year, was ranked second in \"The Guardian\"'s list of the 100 greatest World Cup players of all time, ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, once again behind Pel\u00e9. In 2017, \"FourFourTwo\" ranked him in first place in their list of \"100 greatest players\", while in 2018 he was ranked in first place by the same magazine in their list of the \"Greatest Football Players in World Cup History\"; in March 2020, he was also ranked first by Jack Gallagher of \"90min.com\" in their list of \"Top 50 Greatest Players of All Time\". In May 2020, Sky Sports ranked Maradona as the best player never to have won the UEFA Champions League/European Cup.\nRetirement and tributes.\nHounded for years by the press, Maradona once fired a compressed-air rifle at reporters whom he claimed were invading his privacy. This quote from former teammate Jorge Valdano summarises the feelings of many:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He is someone many people want to emulate, a controversial figure, loved, hated, who stirs great upheaval, especially in Argentina... Stressing his personal life is a mistake. Maradona has no peers inside the pitch, but he has turned his life into a show, and is now living a personal ordeal that should not be imitated.\nIn 1990, the Konex Foundation from Argentina granted him the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious culture awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in sports in the last decade in his country.\nIn April 1996, Maradona had a three-round exhibition boxing match with Santos Laciar for charity. In 2000, Maradona published his autobiography \"Yo Soy El Diego\" (\"I am \"The Diego\"\"), which became a bestseller in Argentina. Two years later, Maradona donated the Cuban royalties of his book to \"the Cuban people and Fidel\".\nIn 2000, he won FIFA Player of the Century award which was to be decided by votes on their official website, their official magazine and a grand jury. Maradona won the Internet-based poll, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pel\u00e9. In spite of this, and shortly before the ceremony, FIFA added a second award and appointed a \"Football Family\" committee composed of football journalists that also gave to Pel\u00e9 the title of best player of the century to make it a draw. Maradona also came fifth in the vote of the IFFHS (International Federation of Football History and Statistics). In 2001, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) asked FIFA for authorization to retire the jersey number 10 for Maradona. FIFA did not grant the request, even though Argentine officials have maintained that FIFA hinted that it would.\nMaradona has topped a number of fan polls, including a 2002 FIFA poll in which his second goal against England was chosen as the best goal ever scored in a World Cup; he also won the most votes in a poll to determine the All-Time Ultimate World Cup Team. On 22 March 2010, Maradona was chosen number 1 in 'The Greatest 10 World Cup Players of All Time' by the London-based newspaper \"The Times\". Argentinos Juniors named its stadium after Maradona on 26 December 2003. In 2003, Maradona was employed by the Libyan footballer Al-Saadi Gaddafi, the third son of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, as a \"technical consultant\", while Al-Saadi was playing for the Italian club, Perugia, which was playing in Serie A at the time.\nIn January 2005, Maradona became a member of Olympiacos and appeared in the Karaiskakis stadium to accept his member card. He reappeared in the stadium in 2006, this time wearing an Olympiacos shirt.\nOn 22 June 2005, it was announced that Maradona would return to former club Boca Juniors as a sports vice-president in charge of managing the First Division roster (after a disappointing 2004\u201305 season, which coincided with Boca's centenary). His contract began 1 August 2005, and one of his first recommendations proved to be very effective: advising the club to hire Alfio Basile as the new coach. With Maradona fostering a close relationship with the players, Boca won the 2005 Apertura, the 2006 Clausura, the 2005 Copa Sudamericana, and the 2005 Recopa Sudamericana.\nOn 15 August 2005, Maradona made his debut as host of a talk-variety show on Argentine television, \"La Noche del 10\" (\"The Night of the no. 10\"). His main guest on opening night was Pel\u00e9; the two had a friendly chat, showing no signs of past differences. However, the show also included a cartoon villain with a clear physical resemblance to Pel\u00e9. In subsequent evenings, \"La Noche del 10\" led the ratings on all occasions but one. Most guests were drawn from the worlds of football and show business, including Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, but also included interviews with other notable friends and personalities such as Cuban leader Fidel Castro and boxers Roberto Dur\u00e1n and Mike Tyson. Maradona gave each of his guests a signed Argentina jersey, which Tyson wore when he arrived in Brazil, Argentina's biggest rivals. In November 2005, however, Maradona rejected an offer to work with Argentina's national football team.\nIn May 2006, Maradona agreed to take part in UK's Soccer Aid (a program to raise money for UNICEF). In September 2006, Maradona, in his famous blue and white number 10, was the captain for Argentina in a three-day World Cup of Indoor Football tournament in Spain. On 26 August 2006, it was announced that Maradona was quitting his position in the club Boca Juniors because of disagreements with the AFA, who selected Alfio Basile to be the new coach of the Argentina national team. In 2008, Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica made \"Maradona\", a documentary about Maradona's life.\nOn 1 September 2014, Maradona, along with many current and former footballing stars, took part in the \"Match for Peace\", which was played at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, with the proceeds being donated entirely to charity. Maradona set up a goal for Roberto Baggio during the first half of the match, with a chipped through-ball over the defence with the outside of his left foot. Unusually, both Baggio and Maradona wore the number 10 shirt, despite playing on the same team. On 17 August 2015, Maradona visited Ali Bin Nasser, the Tunisian referee of the Argentina\u2013England quarter-final match at the 1986 World Cup where Maradona scored his Hand of God, and paid tribute to him by giving him a signed Argentine jersey.\nManagerial career.\nClub management.\nMaradona began his managerial career alongside former Argentinos Juniors midfield teammate Carlos Fren. The pair led Mandiy\u00fa of Corrientes in 1994 and Racing Club in 1995, with little success. In May 2011 he became manager of Dubai club Al Wasl FC in the United Arab Emirates.\nMaradona was sacked on 10 July 2012. In August 2013, Maradona moved on to become 'spiritual coach' at Argentine club Deportivo Riestra. Maradona departed this role in 2017 to become the head coach of Fujairah, in the UAE second division, before leaving at the end of the season upon failure to secure promotion at the club. In May 2018, Maradona was announced as the new chairman of Belarusian club Dynamo Brest. He arrived in Brest and was presented by the club to start his duties in July. In September 2018, he was appointed manager of Mexican second division side Dorados. He made his debut with Dorados on 17 September with a 4\u20131 victory over Cafetaleros de Tapachula. On 13 June 2019, after Dorados failed to clinch promotion to the Mexican top flight, Maradona's lawyer announced that he would be stepping down from the role, citing health reasons.\nOn 5 September 2019, Maradona was unveiled as the new head coach of Gimnasia de La Plata, signing a contract until the end of the season. After two months in charge he left the club on 19 November. However, two days later, Maradona rejoined the club as manager saying that \"we finally achieved political unity in the club\". Maradona insisted that Gabriel Pellegrino remain club president if he were to stay with Gimnasia de La Plata. However it was still not clear if Pellegrino, who declined to run for re-election, would stay on as club President. Originally scheduled to be held on 23 November, the election was delayed 15 days. On 15 December, Pellegrino, who was encouraged by Maradona to seek re-election, was re-elected to a three-year term. Despite having a bad record during the 2019\u201320 season, Gimnasia renewed Maradona's contract on 3 June 2020 for the 2020\u201321 season. In November 2020, Maradona died in post. His coaching staff resigned from the club following his death.\nInternational management.\nAfter the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role. According to several press sources, his major challengers included; Diego Simeone, Carlos Bianchi, Miguel \u00c1ngel Russo, and Sergio Batista. On 29 October 2008, AFA chairman Julio Grondona confirmed that Maradona would be the head coach of the national team. On 19 November, Maradona managed Argentina for the first time when they played against Scotland at Hampden Park in Glasgow, which Argentina won 1\u20130.\nAfter winning his first three matches as the coach of the national team, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to Bolivia, equalling the team's worst ever margin of defeat. With two matches remaining in the qualification tournament for the 2010 World Cup, Argentina was in fifth place and faced the possibility of failing to qualify, but victory in the last two matches secured qualification for the finals. After Argentina's qualification, Maradona used abusive language at the live post-game press conference, telling members of the media to \"suck it and keep on sucking it\". FIFA responded with a two-month ban on all footballing activity, which expired on 15 January 2010, and a CHF 25,000 fine, with a warning as to his future conduct. The friendly match scheduled to take place at home to the Czech Republic on 15 December, during the period of the ban, was cancelled. The only match Argentina played during Maradona's ban was a friendly away to Catalonia, which they lost 4\u20132.\nAt the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Argentina started by winning 1\u20130 against Nigeria, followed by a 4\u20131 victory over South Korea on the strength of a Gonzalo Higua\u00edn hat-trick. In the final match of the group stage, Argentina won 2\u20130 against Greece to win the group and advance to a second round, meeting Mexico. After defeating Mexico 3\u20131, however, Argentina was routed by Germany 4\u20130 in the quarter-finals to go out of the competition. Argentina was ranked fifth in the tournament. After the defeat to Germany, Maradona admitted that he was reconsidering his future as Argentina's coach, stating, \"I may leave tomorrow.\" On 15 July, the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil staged the World Cup. On 27 July, however, the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract. Afterwards, on 29 July, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams (as well as his former Argentine national team and Sevilla coach) Carlos Bilardo had \"lied to\", \"betrayed\", and effectively sacked him from the role. He said, \"They wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on, if he told me that, it meant he did not want me to keep working.\"\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nBorn to a Roman Catholic family, his parents were Diego Maradona Senior and Dalma Salvadora Franco. Maradona married long-time fianc\u00e9e Claudia Villafa\u00f1e on 7 November 1989 in Buenos Aires, and they had two daughters, Dalma Nerea (born 2 April 1987) and Gianinna Dinorah (born 16 May 1989), by whom he became a grandfather in 2009 after she married Sergio Ag\u00fcero (now divorced).\nMaradona and Villafa\u00f1e divorced in 2004. Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all as her parents remained on friendly terms. They travelled together to Naples for a series of homages in June 2005 and were seen together on other occasions, including the Argentina games during 2006 World Cup. During the divorce proceedings, Maradona admitted that he was the father of Diego Sinagra (born in Naples on 20 September 1986). The Italian courts had already ruled so in 1993, after Maradona refused to undergo DNA tests to prove or disprove his paternity. Diego Junior met Maradona for the first time in May 2003 after tricking his way onto a golf course in Italy where Maradona was playing. Sinagra played professional football until 2020.\nAfter the divorce, Claudia embarked on a career as a theatre producer, and Dalma sought an acting career; she previously had expressed her desire to attend the Actors Studio West in Los Angeles.\nMaradona's relationship with his immediate family was a close one. In a 1990 interview with \"Sports Illustrated\", he showed phone bills where he had spent a minimum of $15,000 US per month calling his parents and siblings. Maradona's mother, Dalma, died on 19 November 2011. He was in Dubai at the time, and desperately tried to fly back in time to see her, but was too late. She was 81 years old. His father, \"Don\" Diego, died on 25 June 2015 at age 87.\nIn 2014, Maradona was accused of assaulting his girlfriend, Roc\u00edo Oliva, allegations which he denied. In 2017, he gifted her a house in Bella Vista, but in December 2018 they split up. Maradona's great-nephew Hern\u00e1n L\u00f3pez is also a professional footballer.\nHabits.\nMaradona was known for frequently referring to himself in the third person as \"Maradona\" and \"El Diego\".\nDrug abuse and health problems.\nFrom the mid-1980s until 2004, Maradona was addicted to cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983. By the time he was playing for Napoli, he had a full-blown addiction, which interfered with his ability to play football. In the midst of his drug crisis in 1991, Maradona was asked by journalists if the hit song \"Mi enfermedad\" (lit.\u2009'My Disease') was dedicated to him. Maradona was banned from football in both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs.\nMaradona had a tendency to put on weight and suffered increasingly from obesity, at one point weighing . He was obese from the end of his playing career until undergoing gastric bypass surgery in a clinic in Cartagena, Colombia, on 6 March 2005. His surgeon said that Maradona would follow a liquid diet for three months in order to return to his normal weight. When Maradona resumed public appearances shortly thereafter, he displayed a notably thinner figure.\nOn 29 March 2007, Maradona was readmitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires. He was treated for hepatitis and effects of alcohol abuse and was released on 11 April, but readmitted two days later. In the following days, there were constant rumours about his health, including three false claims of his death within a month. After being transferred to a psychiatric clinic specializing in alcohol-related problems, Maradona was discharged on 7 May. On 8 May, Maradona appeared on Argentine television and stated that he had quit drinking and had not used drugs in two and a half years. During the 2018 World Cup match between Argentina and Nigeria, Maradona was shown on television cameras behaving extremely erratically, with an abundance of white residue visible on the glass in front of his seat in the stands. The smudges could have been fingerprints, and he later blamed his behaviour on consuming lots of wine. In January 2019, Maradona underwent surgery after a hernia caused internal bleeding in his stomach.\nPolitical views.\nMaradona was ideologically left-wing. He supported the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and condemned Israel's military strikes in the Gaza Strip during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, saying: \"What Israel is doing to the Palestinians is shameful.\" He became friends with Cuban president Fidel Castro while receiving treatment on the island, with Castro stating, \"Diego is a great friend and very noble, too. There's also no question he's a wonderful athlete and has maintained a friendship with Cuba to no material gain of his own.\" Maradona had a portrait of Castro tattooed on his left leg and one of Fidel's second in command, fellow Argentine Che Guevara on his right arm. In his autobiography, \"El Diego\", he dedicated the book to various people, including Castro. He wrote: \"To Fidel Castro and, through him, all the Cuban people.\" In 1990, he visited Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square.\nMaradona voiced support for Bolivia's president Evo Morales and was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. In 2005, he came to Venezuela to meet Ch\u00e1vez, who received him in the presidential Miraflores Palace. After the meeting, Maradona said that he had come to meet a \"great man\" (\"un grande\", which can also mean \"a big man\", in Spanish), but had instead met a gigantic man (\"un gigante\"). He also stated, \"I believe in Ch\u00e1vez, I am a Chavista. Everything Fidel does, everything Ch\u00e1vez does, for me is the best.\" Maradona was Ch\u00e1vez's guest of honour at the opening game of the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica held in Venezuela. In a 2017 interview, Maradona praised Russian president Vladimir Putin and considered him, along with Chavez and Castro, to be among the best political leaders in the world, stating: \"Putin is a man who can bring peace to many in this world. He\u2019s a phenomenon; simply a phenomenon\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Many sportsmen claim to be champions of the people, but Maradona's populism is underwritten by his itinerary \u2014 the proletarian strongholds of Buenos Aires, Naples, and now Havana.\u2014\u200a\nIn 2004, Maradona participated in a protest against the U.S.-led war in Iraq. Maradona declared his opposition to what he identified as imperialism, particularly during the 2005 Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina. There he protested George W. Bush's presence in Argentina, wearing a T-shirt labelled \"STOP BUSH\" (with the \"s\" in \"Bush\" being replaced with a swastika) and referring to Bush as \"human garbage\". In August 2007, Maradona went further, making an appearance on Ch\u00e1vez's weekly television show \"Al\u00f3 Presidente\" and saying, \"I hate everything that comes from the United States. I hate it with all my strength.\" By December 2008, Maradona seemed to adopt a more positive U.S. attitude and expressed admiration for Bush's successor, then-President-elect Barack Obama, for whom he had great expectations. However, in 2017, Maradona was critical of President Donald Trump and called him \"a cartoon character\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I asked myself, 'Who is this man? Who is this footballing magician, this Sex Pistol of international football, this cocaine victim who kicked the habit, looked like Falstaff and was as weak as spaghetti?' If Andy Warhol had still been alive, he would have definitely put Maradona alongside Marilyn Monroe and Mao Tse-tung. I'm convinced that if he hadn't been a footballer, he'd've become a revolutionary.\"\n\u2014Emir Kusturica, film director\nWith his poor shanty town (villa miseria) upbringing, Maradona cultivated a man-of-the-people persona. During a meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1987, they clashed on the issue of wealth disparity, with Maradona stating, \"I argued with him because I was in the Vatican and I saw all these golden ceilings and afterwards I heard the Pope say the Church was worried about the welfare of poor kids. Sell your ceiling then, amigo, do something!\" In September 2014, Maradona met with Pope Francis in Rome, crediting Francis for inspiring him to return to religion after many years away; he stated: \"We should all imitate Pope Francis. If each one of us gives something to someone else, no one in the world would be starving.\"\nIn December 2007, Maradona presented a signed shirt with a message of support to the people of Iran: it is displayed in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' museum. In April 2013, Maradona visited the tomb of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and urged Venezuelans to elect the late leader's designated successor, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, to continue the socialist leader's legacy; \"Continue the struggle,\" Maradona said on television. Maradona attended Maduro's final campaign rally in Caracas, signing footballs and kicking them to the crowd, and presented Maduro with an Argentina jersey. Having visited Ch\u00e1vez's tomb with Maradona, Maduro said, \"Speaking with Diego was very emotional because comandante Ch\u00e1vez also loved him very much.\" Maradona participated and danced at the electoral campaign rally during the 2018 presidential elections in Venezuela. During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis, the Mexican Football Federation fined him for violating their code of ethics and dedicating a team victory to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\nMaradona in his 2000 autobiography \"Yo Soy El Diego\", linked the \"Hand of God\" goal against England at the 1986 World Cup to the Falklands War: \"Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas [Falklands] War, we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there, killed them like little birds. And this was revenge.\" In October 2015, Maradona thanked Queen Elizabeth II and the Houses of Parliament in London for giving him the chance to provide \"true justice\" as head of an organization designed to help young children. In a video released on his official Facebook page, Maradona confirmed he would accept their nomination for him to become Latin American director for the non-governmental organization Football for Unity.\nFailure to pay tax.\nIn March 2009, Italian officials announced that Maradona still owed the Italian government \u20ac37\u00a0million in local taxes, \u20ac23.5\u00a0million of which was accrued interest on his original debt. They reported that at that point, Maradona had paid only \u20ac42,000, two luxury watches and a set of earrings. He was posthumously cleared of the accusations in January 2024 by the Supreme Court of Cassation.\nDeath.\nOn 2 November 2020, Maradona was admitted to a hospital in La Plata, supposedly for psychological reasons. A representative of the ex-footballer said his condition was not serious. A day later, he underwent emergency brain surgery to treat a subdural hematoma. He was released on 12 November after successful surgery and was supervised by doctors as an outpatient. On 25 November, at the age of 60, Maradona suffered cardiac arrest and died in his sleep at his home in Dique Luj\u00e1n, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Maradona's coffin \u2013 draped in Argentina's national flag and three Maradona number 10 shirts (Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors and Argentina) \u2013 lay in state at the Presidential Palace, the Casa Rosada, with mourners filing past his coffin. On 26 November, Maradona's wake, which was attended by tens of thousands of people, was cut short by his family as his coffin was relocated from the rotunda of the Presidential Palace after fans took over an inner courtyard and also clashed with police. The same day, a private funeral service was held and Maradona was buried next to his parents at the Jard\u00edn de Bella Vista cemetery in Bella Vista, Buenos Aires.\nTributes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"I have lost a great friend and the world has lost a legend. There's still so much to be said, but for now, may God give strength to his relatives. One day I hope we can play football together in heaven.\"\n\u2014 Pel\u00e9 paying tribute following Maradona's death\nIn a statement on social media, the Argentine Football Association expressed \"its deepest sorrow for the death of our legend\", adding: \"You will always be in our hearts.\" President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez announced three days of national mourning. UEFA and CONMEBOL announced that every match in the Champions League, Europa League, Copa Libertadores, and Copa Sudamericana would hold a moment of silence prior to kickoff. Boca Juniors' game was postponed in respect to Maradona. Subsequently, other confederations around the world followed suit, with every fixture observing a minute of silence, starting with the AFC Champions League's fixtures. In addition to the minute of silence in Serie A, an image of Maradona was projected on stadium screens in the 10th minute of play.\nIn Naples, the Stadio San Paolo\u2014officially renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on 4 December 2020\u2014was illuminated at night in honour of Maradona, with numerous fans gathering outside the stadium placing murals and paintings as a tribute. Both Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and the mayor of Naples Luigi de Magistris expressed their desire to rename their stadium after Maradona, which was unanimously approved by Naples City Council. Prior to Napoli's Europa League match against Rijeka the day after Maradona's death, all of the Napoli players wore shirts with \"Maradona 10\" on the back of them, before observing a minute of silence. Figures in the sport from every continent around the world also paid tribute to him. Celebrities and other sports people outside football also paid tribute to Maradona.\nOn 27 November 2020, the Aditya School of Sports in Barasat, Kolkata, India named their cricket stadium after Maradona. Three years earlier Maradona had conducted a workshop with 100 kids in the stadium and played a charity match at the same venue with former Indian cricket captain, Sourav Ganguly. The AFA announced that the 2020 Copa de la Liga Profesional, which is the debut season of Copa de la Liga Profesional, would be renamed \"Copa Diego Armando Maradona\". On 28 November, Pakistan Football Federation's main cup PFF National Challenge Cup honoured Maradona along with Wali Mohammad. In a rugby union test match between Argentina and New Zealand on 28 November, as the New Zealand team lined up to perform the haka their captain Sam Cane presented a black jersey with Maradona's name and his number 10. On 29 November, compatriot Lionel Messi scored in Barcelona's 4\u20130 home win over Osasuna in La Liga, dedicating his goal to Maradona by revealing a Newell's Old Boys shirt worn by the latter under his own, and subsequently pointing to the sky.\nOn 30 November, after Boca Juniors opened the scoring against Newell's Old Boys at La Bombonera, the club's players paid an emotional tribute by laying a Maradona jersey in front of his private suite where his daughter Dalma was present.\nAftermath.\nIn May 2021, seven medical professionals were charged with homicide over Maradona's death, in violation of their duties, and could face between eight and 25 years in prison if convicted. On 25 June, psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov was summoned by the Prosecution Office of San Isidro and faced a formal questioning, where she agreed to answer more than 100 queries regarding the medical treatment given to Maradona in that medical field. After seven hours of questioning, Cosachov's lawyer Vadim Mischanchuk addressed the press and denied that Cosachov's prescription medication could have worsened Maradona's heart condition, and Cosachov further denied any responsibility in the death. On 28 June, multiple arrest warrants were requested by a plaintiff lawyer against Cosachov, personal doctor Leopoldo Luque, psychologist Carlos D\u00edaz, and doctor Nancy Forlini in direct connection with Maradona's alleged negligent death. On 1 July, the prosecutors in the case refused to ask a judge to issue arrest warrants against all the aforementioned professionals, on the basis that they considered the request had been a media stunt (\"incursi\u00f3n medi\u00e1tica\") for the case, coinciding with personal doctor Luque's interrogation.\nIn June 2022, a judge ruled that eight medical personnel should face trial for criminal negligence and homicide in regards to Maradona's death.\nOn 18 April 2023, the Court of Appeals and Guarantees of San Isidro upheld the June 2022 ruling where eight medical personnel, including physician Luque and psychiatrist Cosachov, should face trial on the charge of \"simple homicide with malice aforethought\". The accused face between eight and 25 years in prison if found guilty.\nIn September 2024, a criminal court in San Isidro, set the trial date for Luque, Cosachov, and other medical personnel to start on 11 March 2025. In May 2025, a mistrial was declared after one of the judges hearing the case recused after she appeared in a documentary featuring the issue.\nIn popular culture.\nIn Argentina, Maradona is considered an icon. Concerning the idolatry that exists in his country, former teammate Jorge Valdano said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At the time that Maradona retired from active football, he left Argentina traumatized. Maradona was more than just a great footballer. He was a special compensation factor for a country that in a few years lived through several military dictatorships and social frustrations of all kinds. Maradona offered to Argentines a way out of their collective frustration, and that's why people there love him as a divine figure. In leading his nation to the 1986 World Cup, and in particular his performance and two goals in the quarter-final against England, Guillem Balagu\u00e9 writes: \"That Sunday in Mexico City, the world saw one man single-handedly \u2013 in more than one sense of the phrase \u2013 lift the mood of a depressed and downtrodden nation into the stratosphere. With two goals in the space of four minutes, he allowed them to dare to dream that they, like him, could be the best in the world. He did it first by nefarious and then spellbindingly brilliant means. In those moments, he went from star player to legend.\"\nSince 1986, it has been common for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona's name as a token of recognition, even in remote places. The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England. In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms reserved for legends. In the Argentine film \"El hijo de la novia\" (\"Son of the Bride\"), somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron, \"They idolized him and then crucified him.\" When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts, \"But I was talking about Maradona.\" He is the subject of the film \"El camino de San Diego\", though he himself only appears in archive footage.\nMaradona was included in many cameos in the Argentine comic book \"El Cazador de Aventuras\". After the closing of it, the authors started a new short-lived comic book titled \"El Die\", using Maradona as the main character. Maradona has had several online Flash games that are entirely dedicated to his legacy. In Rosario, Argentina, locals organized the parody religion of the \"Church of Maradona\". The organization reformulates many elements from Christian tradition, such as Christmas or prayers, reflecting instead details from Maradona. It had 200 founding members, and tens of thousands more have become members via the church's official web site.\nMany Argentine and international artists performed songs in tribute to Diego, such as \"La Mano de Dios\" by El Potro Rodrigo, \"Maradona\" by Andr\u00e9s Calamaro, \"Para siempre Diego\" (Diego Forever) by Los Ratones Paranoicos, \"Francotirador\" (Sniper) by Attaque 77, \"Maradona Blues\" by Charly Garc\u00eda, \"Santa Maradona (Larchuma Football Club)\u201d (Saint Maradona) by Mano Negra, and \"La Vida T\u00f3mbola\" by Mano Negra frontman Manu Chao, among others. There are also other films, such as: \"Maradona, La Mano de Dios\" (Maradona, the Hand of God), \"Amando a Maradona\" (Loving Maradona), and \"Maradona by Kusturica\". In March 1981, Queen were introduced to Maradona backstage during their concert at the V\u00e9lez Sarsfield Stadium.\nBy 1982, Maradona had become one of the biggest sports stars in the world and had endorsements with many companies, including Puma and Coca-Cola, earning him an additional $1.5\u00a0million per year on top of his club salary. In 1982, he featured in a World Cup commercial for Coca-Cola, and a Japanese commercial for Puma. In 1984 he earned $7m a year at Napoli, and sponsorships included $5m from Hitachi. In 1984, a poll from IMG named Maradona the best known person in the world. In 2010 he appeared in a commercial for French fashion house Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with fellow World Cup winners Pel\u00e9 and Zinedine Zidane. Maradona featured in the music video to the 2010 World Cup song \"Waka Waka\" by Shakira, with footage shown of him celebrating Argentina winning the 1986 World Cup.\nA 2006 television commercial for Brazilian soft drink Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica portrayed Maradona as a member of the Brazil national team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian players Ronaldo and Kak\u00e1. Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it was a nightmare after having too much of the drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air for the Argentine market, fans could see it online). Maradona replied that he had no problem wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil's tense football rivalry, but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate, Boca Juniors' traditional rival. There is a documented phenomenon of Brazilians being named in honour of Maradona, an example being footballer Diego Costa.\nIn 2017, Maradona featured as a legendary player in the football video games \"FIFA 18\" and \"Pro Evolution Soccer 2018\". In 2019, a documentary film titled \"Diego Maradona\" was released by Academy Award and BAFTA Award winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia, director of \"Amy\" (on singer Amy Winehouse) and \"Senna\" (on motor racing driver Ayrton Senna). Kapadia stated that \"\n...Maradona is the third part of a trilogy about child geniuses and fame.\" He added, \"...I was fascinated by his journey, wherever he went there were moments of incredible brilliance and drama. He was a leader, taking his teams to the very top, but also many lows in his career. He was always the little guy fighting against the system... and he was willing to do anything, to use all of his cunning and intelligence to win.\"\nCareer statistics.\nMaradona made 680 appearances and scored 345 goals for club and country combined, with a goalscoring average of .\nHonours.\nBoca Juniors\nBarcelona\nNapoli\nArgentina U20\nArgentina\nIndividual\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8487", "revid": "48953105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8487", "title": "David Brewster", "text": "British astronomer and mathematician (1781\u20131868)\nSir David Brewster (11 December 1781\u00a0\u2013 10 February 1868) was a British scientist, inventor, author, and academic administrator. In science he is principally remembered for his experimental work in physical optics, mostly concerned with the study of the polarization of light and including the discovery of Brewster's angle. He studied the birefringence of crystals under compression and discovered photoelasticity, thereby creating the field of optical mineralogy. For this work, William Whewell dubbed him the \"father of modern experimental optics\" and \"the Johannes Kepler of optics.\"\nBrewster was a pioneer in photography. He invented an improved stereoscope, which he called \"lenticular stereoscope\" and which became the first portable 3D-viewing device. He also invented the stereoscopic camera, two types of polarimeters, the polyzonal lens, the lighthouse illuminator, and the kaleidoscope.\nBrewster was a devout Presbyterian and marched arm-in-arm with his brother during the events of the Disruption of 1843, which led to the formation of the Free Church of Scotland. As a historian of science, Brewster focused on the life and work of his hero, Isaac Newton. Brewster published a detailed biography of Newton in 1831 and later became the first scholar to examine many of the papers in Newton's \"Nachlass\" (the unpublished documents left after his death). Brewster also wrote numerous works of popular science, and was one of the founders of the British Science Association, of which he was elected president in 1849. He became the public face of higher education in Scotland, serving as Principal of the University of St Andrews (1837\u20131859) and later of the University of Edinburgh (1859\u20131868). Brewster also edited the 18-volume \"Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia\".\nLife.\nDavid Brewster was born in the Canongate in Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, to Margaret Key (1753\u20131790) and James Brewster (c. 1735\u20131815), the rector of Jedburgh Grammar School and a teacher of high reputation. David was the third of six children, two daughters and four sons: James (1777\u20131847), minister at Craig, Ferryden; David; George (1784\u20131855), minister at Scoonie, Fife; and Patrick (1788\u20131859), minister at the abbey church, Paisley.\nAt the age of 12, David Brewster matriculated at the University of Edinburgh with the intention of becoming a clergyman. He received his MA in 1800, was licensed as a minister of the Church of Scotland, and then preached around Edinburgh on several occasions. By then, Brewster had already shown a strong inclination for the natural sciences and had established a close association with James Veitch of Inchbonny. Veitch, who enjoyed a local reputation as a man of science and was particularly skilled in making telescopes, was characterized by Sir Walter Scott as a \"self-taught philosopher, astronomer and mathematician\".\nBrewster is buried in the grounds of Melrose Abbey, in Roxburghshire.\nCareer.\nWork on optics.\nThough Brewster duly finished his theological studies and was licensed to preach, his other interests distracted him from the duties of his profession. In 1799 fellow-student Henry Brougham persuaded him to study the diffraction of light. The results of his investigations were communicated from time to time in papers to the \"Philosophical Transactions\" of London and other scientific journals. The fact that other scientists \u2013 notably \u00c9tienne-Louis Malus and Augustin Fresnel \u2013 were pursuing the same investigations contemporaneously in France does not invalidate Brewster's claim to independent discovery, even though in one or two cases the priority must be assigned to others. A lesser-known classmate of his, Thomas Dick, also went on to become a popular astronomical writer.\nThe most important subjects of his inquiries can be enumerated under the following five headings:\nIn this line of investigation, the prime importance belongs to the discovery of\nThese discoveries were promptly recognised. As early as 1807 the degree of LL.D. was conferred upon Brewster by Marischal College, Aberdeen; in 1815 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and received the Copley Medal; and in 1816 the French Institute awarded him one-half of the prize of three thousand francs for the two most important discoveries in physical science made in Europe during the two preceding years. In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and in 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\nAmong the non-scientific public, his fame spread more effectually by his invention in about 1815 of the kaleidoscope, for which there was a great demand in both the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. As a reflection of this fame, Brewster's portrait was later printed in some cigar boxes. Brewster chose renowned achromatic lens developer Philip Carpenter as the sole manufacturer of the kaleidoscope in 1817. Although Brewster patented the kaleidoscope in 1817 (GB 4136), a copy of the prototype was shown to London opticians and copied before the patent was granted. As a consequence, the kaleidoscope became produced in large numbers, but yielded no direct financial benefits to Brewster. It proved to be a massive success with two hundred thousand kaleidoscopes sold in London and Paris in just three months.\nAn instrument of more significance, the stereoscope, which \u2013 though of much later date (1849) \u2013 along with the kaleidoscope did more than anything else to popularise his name, was not as has often been asserted the invention of Brewster. Sir Charles Wheatstone discovered its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the construction of a cumbersome but effective instrument, in which the binocular pictures were made to combine by means of mirrors. A dogged rival of Wheatstone's, Brewster was unwilling to credit him with the invention, however, and proposed that the true author of the stereoscope was a Mr. Elliot, a \"Teacher of Mathematics\" from Edinburgh, who, according to Brewster, had conceived of the principles as early as 1823 and had constructed a lensless and mirrorless prototype in 1839, through which one could view drawn landscape transparencies, since photography had yet to be invented. Brewster's personal contribution was the suggestion to use prisms for uniting the dissimilar pictures; and accordingly the lenticular stereoscope may fairly be said to be his invention.\nA much more valuable and practical result of Brewster's optical researches was the improvement of the British lighthouse system. Although Fresnel, who had also the satisfaction of being the first to put it into operation, perfected the dioptric apparatus independently, Brewster was active earlier in the field than Fresnel, describing the dioptric apparatus in 1812. Brewster pressed its adoption on those in authority at least as early as 1820, two years before Fresnel suggested it, and it was finally introduced into lighthouses mainly through Brewster's persistent efforts.\nOther work.\nAlthough Brewster's own discoveries were important, they were not his only service to science. He began writing in 1799 as a regular contributor to the \"Edinburgh Magazine\", of which he acted as editor 1802\u20131803 at the age of twenty. In 1807, he undertook the editorship of the newly projected \"Edinburgh Encyclop\u00e6dia\", of which the first part appeared in 1808, and the last not until 1830. The work was strongest in the scientific department, and many of its most valuable articles were from the pen of the editor. At a later period he was one of the leading contributors to the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" (seventh and eighth editions) writing, among others, the articles on electricity, hydrodynamics, magnetism, microscope, optics, stereoscope, and voltaic electricity. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.\nIn 1819 Brewster undertook further editorial work by establishing, in conjunction with Robert Jameson (1774\u20131854), the \"Edinburgh Philosophical Journal\", which took the place of the \"Edinburgh Magazine\". The first ten volumes (1819\u20131824) were published under the joint editorship of Brewster and Jameson, the remaining four volumes (1825\u20131826) being edited by Jameson alone. After parting company with Jameson, Brewster started the \"Edinburgh Journal of Science\" in 1824, 16 volumes of which appeared under his editorship during the years 1824\u20131832, with very many articles from his own pen.\nHe contributed around three hundred papers to the transactions of various learned societies, and few of his contemporaries wrote as much for the various reviews. In the \"North British Review\" alone, seventy-five articles of his appeared. A list of his larger separate works will be found below. Special mention, however, must be made of the most important of them all: his biography of Sir Isaac Newton. In 1831 he published the \"Life of Sir Isaac Newton\", a short popular account of the philosopher's life, in \"Murray's Family Library\", followed by an 1832 American edition in Harper's Family Library; but it was not until 1855 that he was able to issue the much fuller \"Memoirs of the Life, Writings and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton\", a work which embodied the results of more than 20 years' investigation of original manuscripts and other available sources.\nBrewster's position as editor brought him into frequent contact with the most eminent scientific men, and he was naturally among the first to recognise the benefit that would accrue from regular communication among those in the field of science. In a review of Charles Babbage's book \"Decline of Science in England\" in \"John Murray's Quarterly Review\", he suggested the creation of \"an association of our nobility, clergy, gentry and philosophers\". This was taken up by various \"Declinarians\" and found speedy realisation in the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Its first meeting was held at York in 1831; and Brewster, along with Babbage and Sir John Herschel, had the chief part in shaping its constitution.\nIn the same year in which the British Association held its first meeting, Brewster received the honour of knighthood and the decoration of the Royal Guelphic Order. In 1838, he was appointed Principal of the united colleges of St Salvator and St Leonard, University of St Andrews. In 1849, he acted as president of the British Association and was elected one of the eight foreign associates of the Institute of France in succession to J. J. Berzelius; and ten years later, he accepted the office of principal of the University of Edinburgh, the duties of which he discharged until within a few months of his death. In 1855, the government of France made him an Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\nHe was a close friend of William Henry Fox Talbot, inventor of the calotype process, who sent Brewster early examples of his work. It was Brewster who suggested Talbot only patent his process in England, initiating the development of early photography in Scotland and eventually allowing for the formation of the first photographic society in the world, the Edinburgh Calotype Club, in 1843. Brewster was a prominent member of the club until its dissolution sometime in the mid-1850s; however, his interest in photography continued, and he was elected the first President of the Photographic Society of Scotland when it was founded in 1856.\nOf a high-strung and nervous temperament, Brewster was somewhat irritable in matters of controversy; but he was repeatedly subjected to serious provocation. He was a man of highly honourable and fervently religious character. In estimating his place among scientific discoverers, the chief thing to be borne in mind is that his genius was not characteristically mathematical. His method was empirical, and the laws that he established were generally the result of repeated experiment. To the ultimate explanation of the phenomena with which he dealt he contributed nothing, and it is noteworthy although he did not maintain to the end of his life the corpuscular theory he never explicitly adopted the wave theory of light. Few would dispute the verdict of James David Forbes, an editor of the eighth edition of the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\": \"His scientific glory is different in kind from that of Young and Fresnel; but the discoverer of the law of polarization of biaxial crystals, of optical mineralogy, and of double refraction by compression, will always occupy a foremost rank in the intellectual history of the age.\" In addition to the various works of Brewster already mentioned, the following may be added: \"Notes and Introduction to Carlyle's translation of Legendre's Elements of Geometry\" (1824); \"Treatise on Optics\" (1831); http:// \"The Martyrs of Science, or the Lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler\" (1841); \"More Worlds than One\" (1854).\nIn his \"Treatise\" he demonstrated that vegetal colors were related with the absorption spectra and he described for the first time the red fluorescence of chlorophyll.\nHistory of Scottish Freemasonry.\nAs well as his many scientific works and biographies of notable scientists, Brewster also wrote \"The History of Free Masonry, Drawn from Authentic Sources of Information; with an Account of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, from Its Institution in 1736, to the Present Time\", published in 1804, when he was only 23. The work was commissioned by Alexander Lawrie, publisher to the Grand Lodge of Scotland, to whom the work has been, frequently, mis-attributed. Given that the book bears Lawrie's name and not Brewster's this is understandable. The book became one of the standard works on early Scottish freemasonry although it has been largely superseded by later works. There is no evidence that Brewster was a Freemason at the time he wrote the book, nor any that he became one later.\nOpposition to evolution.\nBrewster's Christian beliefs stirred him to respond against the idea of the transmutation of species and the theory of evolution. His opinion was that \"science and religion must be one since each dealt with Truth, which had only one and the same Author.\" In 1845 he wrote a highly critical review of the evolutionist work \"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\", in the \"North British Review\". which he considered to be an insult to Christian revelation and a dangerous example of materialism.\nIn 1862, he responded to Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\" and published the article \"\" in \"Good Words\". He stated that Darwin's book combined both \"interesting facts and idle fancies\" which made up a \"dangerous and degrading speculation\". He accepted adaptive changes, but he strongly opposed Darwin's statement about the \"primordial form\", which he considered an offensive idea to \"both the naturalist and the Christian.\"\nFamily.\nBrewster married twice. His first wife, Juliet Macpherson (c. 1776\u20131850), was a daughter of James Macpherson (1736\u20131796), a probable translator of Ossian poems. They married on 31 July 1810 in Edinburgh and had four sons and a daughter:\nIn 1833, Brewster's sister-in-law, Ann Macpherson, became laird of Belleville on the death of her half-brother, James. Brewster interested himself in the affairs of the estate with a view to promoting agricultural improvement. He gave the tenants the security of seven-year leases but his overbearing behaviour towards both them and their laird made him unpopular locally.\nBrewster married a second time in Nice, on 26 (or 27) March 1857, to Jane Kirk Purnell (b. 1827), the second daughter of Thomas Purnell of Scarborough. Lady Brewster famously fainted at the Oxford evolution debate of 30 June 1860. Brewster died in 1868, and was buried at Melrose Abbey, next to his first wife and second son.\nRecognition and modern references.\nA bust of Brewster is placed in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling, Scotland. A street within the Kings Buildings complex, which houses most of the Edinburgh University's science buildings, was named in his memory in 2015. The physics building at Heriot-Watt University is also named in his honour.\nEdwin H. Land's invention of the Polaroid film was inspired by the account of the optical properties of herapathite that he encountered in Brewster's book \"The Kaleidoscope, Its History, Theory, and Construction\", which Land first read while an undergraduate at Harvard University in 1926.\nBrewster's views on the possibility of evolution of intelligence on other planets, contrasted with the opinion of William Whewell, are cited in the novel \"Barchester Towers\".\nHe appears as a minor antagonist in the 2015 video game \"Assassin's Creed Syndicate\" as a scientist working for the game's opposing faction. He is assassinated by one of the protagonists, Evie Frye. He features as a character in Ali Bacon's novel, \"In the Blink of an Eye\" (2018).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

DTMF was first developed in the Bell System in the United States,\nand became known under the trademark Touch-Tone for use in push-button telephones, starting in 1963. The DTMF frequencies are standardized in ITU-T Recommendation Q.23. The signaling system is also known as \"MF4\" in the United Kingdom, as \"MFV\" in Germany, and \"Digitone\" in Canada.\nTouch-tone dialing with a telephone keypad gradually replaced the use of rotary dials and has become the industry standard in telephony to control equipment and signal user intent. The signaling on trunks in the telephone network uses a different type of multi-frequency signaling.\nMultifrequency signaling.\nBefore the development of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed with rotary dials for loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, also known as pulse dialing. It functions by interrupting the current in the local loop between the telephone exchange and the calling party's telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that operates the dial spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired digit. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays or by storing the digits in a register that records the dialed telephone number. Pulse dialing was possible only on direct metallic lines and was limited in physical distance by the amount of electrical distortions present. For signaling over trunks between switching systems, operators used a different type of multi-frequency signaling.\nMulti-frequency signaling (MF) is a group of signaling methods that use a mixture of two pure tone (pure sine wave) sounds. Various MF signaling protocols were devised by the Bell System and CCITT. The earliest of these were for in-band signaling between switching centers, where long-distance telephone operators used a 16-digit keypad to input the next portion of the destination telephone number in order to contact the next downstream long-distance telephone operator. This semi-automated signaling and switching proved successful in both speed and cost effectiveness. Based on this prior success with using MF by specialists to establish long-distance telephone calls, dual-tone multi-frequency signaling was developed for end-user signaling without the assistance of operators.\nThe DTMF system uses two sets of four frequencies in the voice frequency range transmitted in pairs to represent sixteen signals, representing the ten digits and six additional signals identified as the letters A to D, and the symbols \"#\" and \"*\". As the signals are audible tones, they can be transmitted through line repeaters and amplifiers, and over radio and microwave links.\nAT&amp;T described the product as \"a method for pushbutton signaling from customer stations using the voice transmission path\". To prevent consumer telephones from interfering with the MF-based routing and switching between telephone switching centers, DTMF frequencies differ from all of the pre-existing MF signaling protocols between switching centers: MF/R1, R2, CCS4, CCS5, and others that were later replaced by SS7 digital signaling. DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark \"Touch-Tone\". The term was first used by AT&amp;T in commerce on July 5, 1960, and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963, when the first push-button telephone was made available to the public. As the parent company of Bell Systems, AT&amp;T held the trademark from September 4, 1962, to March 13, 1984. It is standardized by ITU-T Recommendation Q.23.\nOther vendors of compatible telephone equipment called the Touch-Tone feature \"tone dialing\" or \"DTMF\". Automatic Electric (GTE) referred to it as \"Touch-calling\" in their marketing. Other trade names such as \"Digitone\" were used by the Northern Electric Company in Canada.\nAs a method of in-band signaling, DTMF signals were also used by cable television broadcasters as cue tones to indicate the start and stop times of local commercial insertion points during station breaks for the benefit of cable companies. Until out-of-band signaling equipment was developed in the 1990s, fast, unacknowledged DTMF tone sequences could be heard during the commercial breaks of cable channels in the United States and elsewhere. Previously, terrestrial television stations used DTMF tones to control remote transmitters. In IP telephony, DTMF signals can also be delivered as either in-band or out-of-band tones, or even as a part of signaling protocols, as long as both endpoints agree on a common approach to adopt.\nKeypad.\nThe DTMF telephone keypad is laid out as a matrix of push buttons in which each row represents the low-frequency component and each column represents the high-frequency component of the DTMF signal. The commonly used keypad has four rows and three columns, but a fourth column is present for some applications. Pressing a key sends a combination of the row and column frequencies. For example, the \"1\" key produces a superimposition of a 697 Hz low tone and a 1209\u00a0Hz high tone. Initial pushbutton designs employed levers, enabling each button to activate one row and one column contact. The tones are decoded by the switching center to determine the keys pressed by the user.\nSquare, star, A, B, C, and D.\nEngineers had envisioned telephones being used to access computers and automated response systems. They consulted with companies to determine the requirements. This led to the addition of the \"square sign\" which is typically approximated by the number sign (#) (alternatively \"pound\", \"diamond\", \"hash\", \"gate\" (UK), or \"octothorpe\") in the fourth row of the third column of keys, and the star (*) key, or asterisk (France) in the fourth row of the first column. In addition, a fourth column of keys was added for menu selection: A, B, C and D. The lettered keys were dropped from most keypads and it was many years before the two symbol keys became widely used for vertical service codes such as *67 in the United States and Canada to suppress caller ID.\nPublic payphones that accept credit cards use these additional codes to send the information from the magnetic strip.\nThe AUTOVON telephone system of the United States Armed Forces used signals A, B, C, and D to assert certain privilege and priority levels when placing telephone calls. Precedence is still a feature of military telephone networks, but using number combinations. For example, entering 93 before a number is a priority call.\nPresent-day uses of the signals A, B, C and D are rare in telephone networks, and are exclusive to network control. For example, \"A\" is used in some networks for cycling through a list of carriers. The signals are used in radio phone patch and repeater operations to allow, among other uses, control of the repeater while connected to an active telephone line.\nThe signals star, square, A, B, C, and D are still widely used worldwide by amateur radio operators and commercial two-way radio systems for equipment control, repeater control, remote-base operations and some telephone communications systems.\nDTMF signaling tones may also be heard at the start and/or end of some prerecorded VHS videocassettes. Information on the master version of the videotape is encoded in the DTMF tones. The encoded tones provide information to automatic duplication machines, such as format, duration and volume levels in order to replicate the original video as closely as possible.\nDTMF tones are used in some caller ID systems to transfer the caller ID information, a function that is performed in the United States by Bell 202 modulated frequency-shift keying (FSK) signaling.\nDecoding.\nDTMF was originally decoded by tuned electrical filter banks. By the end of the 20th century, digital signal processing became the predominant technology for decoding. DTMF decoding algorithms typically use the Goertzel algorithm, although application of the MUSIC algorithm to DTMF decoding has been shown to outperform Goertzel and being the only possibility in cases when the number of available samples is limited. As DTMF signaling is often transmitted in-band with voice or other audio signals present simultaneously, the DTMF signal definition includes strict limits for timing (minimum duration and interdigit spacing), frequency deviations, harmonics, and amplitude relation of the two components with respect to each other (\"twist\").\nOther multiple frequency signals.\nTelephone systems typically define other tones, outside the DTMF specification, that indicate the status of lines, equipment, or the result of calls, and for control of equipment for troubleshooting or service purposes. Such call-progress tones are often also composed of multiple frequencies and are standardized in each country. The Bell System defined them in the Precise Tone Plan.\nSome early modems were based on touch-tone frequencies, such as Bell 400-style modems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In contrast, modern Rabbinic Judaism and Protestantism regard the DC as Apocrypha.\nSeven books are accepted as deuterocanonical by all the ancient churches: Tobit, Judith, Baruch with the Letter of Jeremiah, Sirach or Ecclesiasticus, Wisdom, First and Second Maccabees and also the Greek additions to Esther and Daniel. In addition to these, the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Church include other books in their canons.\nThe deuterocanonical books are included in the Septuagint, the earliest extant Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. They date from 300 BC to 100 AD, before the separation of the Christian church from Judaism, and they are regularly found in old manuscripts and cited frequently by the Church Fathers, such as Clement of Rome, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Irenaeus, and Tertullian.\nAccording to the Gelasian Decree, the Council of Rome (382 AD) defined a list of books of scripture as canonical. It included most of the deuterocanonical books. Patristic and synodal lists from the 200s, 300s and 400s usually include selections of the deuterocanonical books.\nList of deuterocanonicals.\nCanonical for the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, and the Church of the East:\nCanonical only for the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Oriental Orthodox Church:\nHistorical background.\n\"Deuterocanonical\" is a term coined in 1566 by the theologian Sixtus of Siena, who had converted to Catholicism from Judaism, to describe scriptural texts considered canonical by the Catholic Church, but which recognition was considered \"secondary\". For Sixtus, this term included portions of both Old and New Testaments. Sixtus considers the final chapter of the Gospel of Mark to be deuterocanonical. He also applies the term to the Book of Esther from the canon of the Hebrew Bible.\nThe term was then taken up by other writers to apply specifically to those books of the Old Testament which had been recognised as canonical by the Councils of Rome (382 AD), Hippo (393 AD), Carthage (397 AD and 419 AD), Florence (1442 AD) and Trent (1546 AD), but which were not in the Hebrew canon.\nForms of the term \u201cdeuterocanonical\u201d were adopted after the 16th century by the Eastern Orthodox Church to denote canonical books of the Septuagint not in the Hebrew Bible, a wider selection than that adopted by the Council of Trent, and also by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church to apply to works believed to be of Jewish origin translated in the Old Testament of the Ethiopic Bible, a wider selection still.\nThe acceptance of some of these books among early Christians was widespread, though not universal, and surviving Bibles from the early Church always include, with varying degrees of recognition, books now called \"deuterocanonical\". Some say that their canonicity seems not to have been doubted in the Church until it was challenged by Jews after 100 AD, sometimes postulating a hypothetical Council of Jamnia. Regional councils in the West published official canons that included these books as early as the 4th and 5th centuries.\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The official attitude of the Latin Church, always favourable to them, kept the majestic tenor of its way. Two documents of capital importance in the history of the canon constitute the first formal utterance of papal authority on the subject. The first is the so-called \"Decretal of Gelasius\", the essential part of which is now generally attributed to a synod convoked by Pope Damasus in the year 382. The other is the Canon of Innocent I, sent in 405 to a Gallican bishop in answer to an inquiry. Both contain all the deuterocanonicals, without any distinction, and are identical with the catalogue of Trent. The African Church, always a staunch supporter of the contested books, found itself in entire accord with Rome on this question. Its ancient version, the Vetus Latina, had admitted all the Old Testament Scriptures. St. Augustine seems to theoretically recognize degrees of inspiration; in practice he employs protos and deuteros without any discrimination whatsoever. Moreover in his \"De Doctrin\u00e2 Christian\u00e2\" he enumerates the components of the complete Old Testament. The Synod of Hippo (393) and the three of Carthage (393, 397, and 419), in which, doubtless, Augustine was the leading spirit, found it necessary to deal explicitly with the question of the Canon, and drew up identical lists from which no sacred books are excluded. These councils base their canon on tradition and liturgical usage.\nDead Sea scrolls.\nThe Book of Sirach, whose Hebrew text was already known from the Cairo Geniza, has been found in two of the Dead Sea Scrolls (2QSir or 2Q18, 11QPs_a or 11Q5) in Hebrew. Another Hebrew scroll of \"Sirach\" has been found in Masada (MasSir). Five fragments from the Book of Tobit have been found in Qumran written in Aramaic and in one written in Hebrew (papyri 4Q, nos. 196\u2013200). The \"Letter of Jeremiah\" (or \"Baruch\" chapter 6) has been found in cave 7 (papyrus 7Q2) in Greek.\nRecent scholars have suggested that the Qumran library of approximately 1,100 manuscripts found in the eleven caves at Qumran was not entirely produced at Qumran, but may have included part of the library of the Jerusalem Temple, that may have been hidden in the caves for safekeeping at the time the Temple was destroyed by Romans in 70\u00a0AD.\nInfluence of the Septuagint.\nDeuterocanonical and Apocryphal books included in the Septuagint are:\nThe large majority of Old Testament references in the New Testament are taken from the Koine Greek Septuagint (LXX), editions of which include the deuterocanonical books, as well as apocrypha \u2013 both of which are called collectively (\"readable, worthy of reading\"). No two Septuagint codices contain the same apocrypha.\nGreek Psalm manuscripts from the fifth century contain three New Testament \"psalms\": the Magnificat, the Benedictus, the Nunc dimittis from Luke's birth narrative, and the conclusion of the hymn that begins with the \"Gloria in Excelsis\". Beckwith states that manuscripts of anything like the capacity of Codex Alexandrinus were not used in the first centuries of the Christian era, and believes that the comprehensive codices of the Septuagint, which start appearing in the 4th century AD, are all of Christian origin.\nIn the New Testament, Hebrews 11:35 is understood by some as referring to an event that was recorded in one of the deuterocanonical books, 2 Maccabees. For instance, the author of Hebrews references oral tradition which spoke of an Old Testament prophet who was sawn in half in Hebrews 11:37, two verses after the 2nd Maccabees reference. Other New Testament authors such as Paul also reference or quote period literature.\nInfluence of early authors.\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (c.\u200994 AD) wrote that the Hebrew Bible contained 22 canonical books. The same number of 22 books was reported also by the Christian bishop Athanasius, but they might differ on the exact content (see below for Athanasius), as Josephus did not provide a detailed list.\nOrigen of Alexandria (c.\u2009240 AD), cited by Eusebius, described the Hebrew Bible as containing 22 canonical books. Among these books he listed the Epistle of Jeremiah and the Maccabees.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The twenty-two books of the Hebrews are the following: That which is called by us Genesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers; Jesus, the son of Nave (Joshua book); Judges and Ruth in one book; the First and Second of Kings (1 Samuel and 2 Samuel) in one; the Third and Fourth of Kings (1 Kings and 2 Kings) in one; of the Chronicles, the First and Second in one; Esdras, First and Second (Ezra\u2013Nehemiah) in one; the book of Psalms; the Proverbs of Solomon; Ecclesiastes; the Song of Songs; Isaiah; Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the epistle (of Jeremiah) in one; Daniel; Ezekiel; Job; Esther. And besides these there are the Maccabees.\nEusebius wrote in his \"Church History\" (c.\u2009324 AD) that Bishop Melito of Sardis in the 2nd century AD considered the deuterocanonical Wisdom of Solomon as part of the Old Testament and that it was considered canonical by Jews and Christians. On the other hand, the contrary claim has been made: \"In the catalogue of Melito, presented by Eusebius, after Proverbs, the word Wisdom occurs, which nearly all commentators have been of opinion is only another name for the same book, and not the name of the book now called 'The Wisdom of Solomon'.\"\nCyril of Jerusalem (c.\u2009350 AD) in his \"Catechetical Lectures\" cites as canonical books \"Jeremiah one, including Baruch and Lamentations and the Epistle (of Jeremiah)\".\nIn Athanasius's canonical books list (367 AD) the Book of Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah are included while Esther is omitted. At the same time, he mentioned that the Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of Sirach, Judith and Tobit, the book of Esther and also the Didache and The Shepherd of Hermas, while not being part of the Canon, \"were appointed by the Fathers to be read\". He excluded what he called \"apocryphal writings\" entirely.\nEpiphanius of Salamis (c.\u2009385 AD) mentions that \"there are 27 books given the Jews by God, but they are counted as 22, however, like the letters of their Hebrew alphabet, because ten books are doubled and reckoned as five\". He wrote in his that Jews had in their books the deuterocanonical Epistle of Jeremiah and Baruch, both combined with Jeremiah and Lamentations in only one book. While Wisdom of Sirach and the Wisdom of Solomon were books of disputed canonicity.\nAugustine of Hippo (c.\u2009397 AD), in his book \"On Christian Doctrine (Book II Chapter 8)\", cites a list of the canon of the Old Testament and the New Testament, including the deuterocanonical books as canonical:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Now the whole canon of Scripture on which we say this judgment is to be exercised, is contained in the following books: \u2013 Five books of Moses, that is, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; one book of Joshua the son of Nun; one of Judges; one short book called Ruth; next, four books of Kings [the two Books of Samuel and the two books of Kings], and two of Chronicles, Job, and Tobias, and Esther, and Judith, and the two books of Maccabees, and the two of Ezra [Ezra, Nehemiah]; one book of the Psalms of David; and three books of Solomon, that is to say Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. For two books, one called Wisdom and the other Ecclesiasticus. Twelve separate books of the prophets which are connected with one another, and having never been disjoined, are reckoned as one book; the names of these prophets are as follows: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi; then there are the four greater prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel.\nAccording to the monk Rufinus of Aquileia (c.\u2009400 AD) the deuterocanonical books were not called canonical but ecclesiastical books. In this category Rufinus includes the Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Judith, Tobit and two books of Maccabees. Baruch is not specified by name in Rufinus's list, but it is in Cyril's, as though a part of Jeremiah, \"Jeremiah, with Baruch, and the Lamentations and the Epistle.\" (Catech. 4, \u00a736.)\nPope Innocent I (405 AD) sent a letter to the bishop of Toulouse citing deuterocanonical books as a part of the Old Testament canon.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn the 7th century Latin document the Muratorian fragment, which some scholars actually believe to be a copy of an earlier 170 AD Greek original, the book of the Wisdom of Solomon is counted by the church.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Moreover, the epistle of Jude and two of the above-mentioned (or, bearing the name of) John are counted (or, used) in the catholic [Church]; and [the book of] Wisdom, written by the friends of Solomon in his honour.\nSynods.\nIn later copyings of the canons of the Council of Laodicea (from 364 AD) a canon list became appended to Canon 59, likely before the mid fifth century, which affirmed that Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations, and the Epistle (of Jeremiah) were canonical, while excluding the other deuterocanonical books.\nAccording to Decretum Gelasianum, which is a work written by an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553, the Council of Rome (382 AD) cites a list of books of scripture presented as having been made canonical. This list mentions all the deuterocanonical books as a part of the Old Testament canon:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Synod of Hippo (in 393 AD), followed by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419), may be the first councils that explicitly accepted the first canon which includes a selection of books that did not appear in the Hebrew Bible; the councils were under significant influence of Augustine of Hippo, who regarded the canon as already closed.\nCanon XXIV from the Synod of Hippo (in 393 AD) records the scriptures which are considered canonical; the Old Testament books as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Genesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers; Deuteronomy; Joshua the Son of Nun; The Judges; Ruth; The Kings, iv. books [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings]; The Chronicles, ii. books; Job; The Psalter; The Five books of Solomon [Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus]; The Twelve Books of the Prophets [Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi]; Isaiah; Jeremiah; Ezechiel; Daniel; Tobit; Judith; Esther; Ezra, ii. books [Ezra, Nehemiah]; Maccabees, ii. books.\nOn 28 August 397, the Council of Carthage confirmed the canon issued at Hippo; the recurrence of the Old Testament part is stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua the son of Nun, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings], two books of Paraleipomena [1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter, five books of Solomon [ Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus ], the books of the twelve prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, two books of Esdras [Ezra, Nehemiah], two Books of the Maccabees.\nIn 419 AD, the Council of Carthage in its canon 24 lists the deuterocanonical books as canonical scripture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Canonical Scriptures are as follows: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua the son of Nun, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings], two books of Chronicles, Job, the Psalter, five books of Solomon [Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus], the books of the twelve prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezechiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, two books of Esdras [Ezra, Nehemiah], two Books of the Maccabees.\nThe Apostolic Canons approved by the Eastern Council in Trullo in 692 AD (not recognized by the Catholic Church) states as venerable and sacred the first three books of Maccabees and Wisdom of Sirach.\nThe Council of Florence (1442) promulgated a list of the books of the Bible, including the books of Judith, Esther, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch and two books of the Maccabees as Canonical books:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Council of Trent (1546) adopted an understanding of the canons of these previous councils as corresponding to its own list of deuterocanonical books:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of the Old Testament, the five books of Moses, namely, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; Josue, Judges, Ruth, the four books of Kings [1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings], two of Paralipomenon [1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles], the first and second of Esdras [Ezra, Nehemiah], Tobias, Judith, Esther, Job, the Davidic Psalter of 150 Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Canticle of Canticles [Song of Songs], Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaias, Jeremias, with Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, the twelve minor Prophets, namely, Osee, Joel, Amos, Abdias, Jonas, Micheas, Nahum, Habacuc, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zacharias, Malachias; two books of Machabees, the first and second.\nInfluence of Jerome.\nJerome in one of his Vulgate prologues describes a canon which excludes the deuterocanonical books. In these prologues, Jerome mentions all of the deuterocanonical and apocryphal works by name as being apocryphal or \"not in the canon\" except for \"Prayer of Manasses\" and \"Baruch\". He mentions \"Baruch\" by name in his \"Prologue to Jeremiah\" and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or \"not in the canon\". The inferior status to which the deuterocanonical books were relegated by authorities like Jerome is seen by some as being due to a rigid conception of canonicity, one demanding that a book, to be entitled to this supreme dignity, must be received by all, must have the sanction of Jewish antiquity, and must moreover be adapted not only to edification, but also to the \"confirmation of the doctrine of the Church\".\nJ. N. D. Kelly states that \"Jerome, conscious of the difficulty of arguing with Jews on the basis of books they spurned and anyhow regarding the Hebrew original as authoritative, was adamant that anything not found in it was 'to be classed among the apocrypha', not in the canon; later he grudgingly conceded that the Church read some of these books for edification, but not to support doctrine.\"\nJerome's Vulgate included the deuterocanonical books as well as apocrypha. Jerome referenced and quoted from some as scripture despite describing them as \"not in the canon\". Michael Barber asserts that, although Jerome was once suspicious of the apocrypha, he later viewed them as scripture. Barber argues that this is clear from Jerome's epistles; he cites Jerome's letter to Eustochium, in which Jerome quotes Sirach 13:2. Elsewhere Jerome apparently also refers to Baruch, the Story of Susannah and Wisdom as scripture. Henry Barker states that Jerome quotes the Apocrypha with marked respect, and even as \"Scripture\", giving them an ecclesiastical if not a canonical position and use. Luther also wrote introductions to the books of the Apocrypha, and occasionally quoted from some to support an argument.\nIn his prologue to Judith, without using the word canon, Jerome mentioned that Judith was held to be scriptural by the First Council of Nicaea.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Among the Hebrews the Book of Judith is found among the Hagiographa. ...But because this book is found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures, I have acquiesced to your request. \nIn his reply to Rufinus, Jerome affirmed that he was consistent with the choice of the church regarding which version of the deuterocanonical portions of Daniel to use, which the Jews of his day did not include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What sin have I committed in following the judgment of the churches? But when I repeat what the Jews say against the Story of Susanna and the Hymn of the Three Children, and the fables of Bel and the Dragon, which are not contained in the Hebrew Bible, the man who makes this a charge against me proves himself to be a fool and a slanderer; for I explained not what I thought but what they commonly say against us. (\"Against Rufinus\", II:33 [402 AD])\nThus Jerome acknowledged the principle by which the canon would be settled\u2014the judgment of the Church (at least the local churches in this case) rather than his own judgment or the judgment of Jews; though concerning translation of Daniel to Greek, he wondered why one should use the version of a translator whom he regarded as a heretic and judaizer (Theodotion).\nThe Vulgate is also important as the touchstone of the canon concerning which parts of books are canonical. When the Council of Trent confirmed the books included in the first canon, it qualified the books as being \"entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be read in the Catholic Church, and as they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition\". This decree was clarified somewhat by Pope Pius XI on 2 June 1927, who allowed that the Comma Johanneum was open to dispute.\nThe Council of Trent also ratified the Vulgate Bible as the official Latin version of the Bible for the Roman Catholic Church.\nDeuterocanonical and Apocryphal books included in the Latin Vulgate are:\nMasoretic Text.\nThe existence of the Septuagint, Samaritan Pentateuch, and the Peshitta versions of the Hebrew scriptures demonstrate that different versions of Judaism used different texts, and it is debated which is closest to the Urtext (a theoretical \"original\" text from which all of these emerged). The Dead Sea Scrolls contain some of the deuterocanonical books, while the Masoretic Text excludes them. Since the Enlightenment, it was wrongly believed that the Masoretic Text was the \"original\" Hebrew Bible when this was in fact a medieval version created by the Masoretes. The oldest nearly-complete manuscripts of the Old Testament include the Codex Vaticanus (4th century) and the Codex Alexandrinus (5th century), while the oldest complete manuscript of the Masoretic text is the Codex Leningradensis from 1008.\nThe Septuagint was the version of the Hebrew Bible from which the early Christians emerged. The Christian Bible contained these deuterocanonical books until Martin Luther, assuming the Masoretic text to be the original, removed them to match this new Jewish canon. Rabbinic Judaism is a newer form of Judaism that created the Masoretic text in part to deter a Christian reading of the Old Testament.\nIn Judaism.\nAlthough there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Hebrew Bible canon was fixed, some scholars hold that the Hebrew canon was established well before the 1st century AD \u2013 even as early as the 4th century BC, or by the Hasmonean dynasty (140\u201340 BC).\nThe canon of modern Rabbinic Judaism excludes the deuterocanonical books. Albert J. Sundberg writes that Judaism did not exclude from their scriptures the deuterocanonicals and the additional Greek texts listed here.\nThe Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which the early Christian church used as its Old Testament, included all of the deuterocanonical books. The term distinguished these books from both the protocanonical books (the books of the Hebrew canon) and the biblical apocrypha (books of Jewish origin that were sometimes read in Christian churches as scripture but which were not regarded as canonical).\nSome commentators see texts from these particular books being paraphrased, referred, or alluded to many times in the New Testament, depending in large measure on what is counted as a reference; other scholars point to a correspondence of thought.\nIn the Catholic Church.\nThe Catholic Church considers that in the Council of Rome in 382 AD, under the Papacy of Damasus I, was defined the complete canon of the Bible, accepting 46 books for the Old Testament, including what the Reformed Churches consider as deuterocanonical books, and 27 books for the New Testament. Based in this first canon, Saint Jerome compiled and translated the 73 books of the Bible into Latin, later known as the Vulgate Bible version, which has been considered during many centuries as one of the official Bible translations of the Catholic Church.\nThe Synod of Hippo (in 393 AD), followed by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419), also explicitly accepted the first canon from the Council of Rome. These councils were under significant influence of Augustine of Hippo, who also regarded the Biblical canon as already closed. The Roman Catholic Council of Florence (1442) confirmed the first canon too, while the Council of Trent (1546) elevated the first canon to dogma.\nProtestant theologian Philip Schaff states that \"the Council of Hippo in 393, and the third (according to another reckoning the sixth) Council of Carthage in 397, under the influence of Augustine, who attended both, fixed the catholic canon of the Holy Scriptures, including the Apocrypha of the Old Testament, ...This decision of the transmarine church, however, was subject to ratification; and the concurrence of the Roman See it received when Innocent I and Gelasius I (AD 414) repeated the same index of biblical books.\"\nSchaff says that this canon remained undisturbed till the 16th century, and was sanctioned by the Council of Trent at its fourth session, although as the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" reports, \"in the Latin Church, all through the Middle Ages we find evidence of hesitation about the character of the deuterocanonicals. ... Few are found to unequivocally acknowledge their canonicity,\" but that the countless manuscript copies of the Vulgate produced by these ages, with a slight, probably accidental, exception, uniformly embrace the complete Roman Catholic Old Testament.\nSubsequent research qualifies this latter statement, in that a distinct tradition of large format pandect bibles has been identified as having been promoted by the 11th and 12th century reforming Papacy for presentation to monasteries in Italy; and now commonly termed 'Atlantic Bibles' on account of their very great size. While not all these bibles present a consistent reformed Vulgate text, they generally exclude the deuterocanonical books.\nThe Paris Bible was a new fairly standard format for portable personal Bibles developed by preaching friars in the 13th century; these included the deuterocanonical books but not the previously common apocryphal Epistle to the Laodiceans or the Fourth Book of Esdras.\nBaruch and the Letter of Jeremiah.\nAccording to the canon lists of the Council of Laodicea, Athanasius (367 AD), Cyril of Jerusalem (c.\u2009350 AD), and Epiphanius of Salamis (c.\u2009385 AD), the Book of Jeremiah forms a single book together with Baruch, Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah (also called Epistle of Jeremiah).\nIn the Old Latin version of the Bible, Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah appear to have been incorporated into the Book of Jeremiah, and Latin Fathers of the 4th century and earlier always cite their texts as being from that book. However, when Jerome translated Jeremiah afresh from the Hebrew text, which is considerably longer than the Greek Septuagint text and with chapters in a different order, he steadfastly refused to incorporate either Baruch or the Letter of Jeremiah from the Greek.\nIn the 9th century these two works were reintroduced into the Vulgate Bibles produced under the influence of Theodulf of Orleans, originally as additional chapters to the Vulgate book of Jeremiah. Subsequently, and especially in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century, they are found together as a single, combined book after Lamentations.\nEsdras.\nFor the Roman Catholic Church and Protestant Churches, Greek Esdras is now considered apocryphal. The Orthodox Church considers it as canonical. The earlier canonical status of this book in the Western church can be less easy to track, as references to Esdras in canon lists and citations may refer either to this book, or to Greek Ezra\u2013Nehemiah, or both together. In the surviving Greek pandect Bibles of the 4th and 5th centuries, Greek Esdras always stands as 'Esdras A' while the Greek translation of the whole of canonical Ezra\u2013Nehemiah stands as 'Esdras B'. The same is found in the surviving witness of the Old Latin Bible.\nWhen Latin fathers of the early church cite quotations from the biblical 'Book of Ezra' it is overwhelmingly 'First Ezra/Esdras A' to which they refer, as in Augustine 'City of God' 18:36. Citations of the 'Nehemiah' sections of Old Latin Second Ezra/'Esdras B' are much rarer. No Old Latin citations from the 'Ezra' sections of Second Ezra/'Esdras B' are known before Bede in the 8th century. Consequently Gallagher and Meade conclude that \"when the ancient canon lists, whether Greek or Latin, mention two books of Esdras, they must have in mind the books known in the LXX and Old Latin as Esdras A and Esdras B; i.e. our 1 Esdras and Ezra-Nehemiah.\"\nIn his prologue to Ezra Jerome refers to four books of Ezra in the Latin tradition. Jerome's first and second Latin books of Ezra are those of the Old Latin Bible - corresponding to Greek Esdras and Ezra-Nehemiah in the Septuagint. These two books he considers each to be a corrupt version of the single Hebrew book of Ezra, so he claims that his Vulgate version of Ezra from the Hebrew replaces both of them. Jerome condemns the third and fourth Latin books of Ezra as apocrypha. His third book must correspond to the Jewish Apocalypse of Ezra while the fourth book is likely to comprise other material from Latin Ezra.\nFrom the 9th century, occasional Latin Vulgate manuscripts are found in which Jerome's single Ezra text is split to form the separate books of Ezra and Nehemiah. In the Paris Bibles of the 13th century this split has become universal, with Esdras A being reintroduced as '3 Esdras' and Latin Esdras being added as '4 Esdras'. At the Council of Trent neither '3 Esdras' nor '4 Esdras' were accepted as canonical books, but were eventually printed in the section of 'Apocrypha' in the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, along with the Prayer of Manasses.\nThe Council of Trent in 1546 stated the list of books included in the canon as it had been set out in the Council of Florence. In respect to the deuterocanonical books this list conformed with the canon lists of Western synods of the late 4th century, other than including Baruch with the Letter of Jeremiah (Baruch chapter 6) as a single book. While the majority at Trent supported this decision there were participants in the minority who disagreed with accepting any other than the protocanonical books in the canon. Among the minority, at Trent, were Cardinals Seripando and Cajetan, the latter an opponent of Luther at Augsburg.\nIn Eastern Orthodoxy.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Churches have traditionally included all the books of the Septuagint in their Old Testaments. The Greeks use the word (, \"readable, worthy to be read\") to describe the books of the Greek Septuagint that are not present in the Hebrew Bible. When Eastern Orthodox theologians use the term \"deuterocanonical\", it is important to note that the meaning is not identical to the Roman Catholic usage. In Eastern Orthodox Christianity, deuterocanonical means that a book is part of the corpus of the Old Testament (i.e. is read during the services) but has secondary authority. In other words, deutero (second) applies to authority or witnessing power, whereas in Roman Catholicism, deutero applies to chronology (the fact that these books were confirmed later), not to authority.\nThe Eastern Orthodox Churches canon includes the deuterocanonical books accepted by the Catholic Church plus 1 Esdras, 3 Maccabees, Psalm 151, and the Prayer of Manasseh, while Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah are separated.\nThe Eastern Orthodox synod, the Synod of Jerusalem, held in 1672 receive as its canon the books found in the Septuagint, and in the Patristic, Byzantine, and liturgical tradition. The Synod declared the Eastern Orthodox canon as follows:\nspecifically, \"The Wisdom of Solomon,\" \"Judith,\" \"Tobit,\" \"The History of the Dragon\" [Bel and the Dragon], \"The History of Susanna,\" \"The Maccabees,\" and \"The Wisdom of Sirach.\" For we judge these also to be with the other genuine Books of Divine Scripture genuine parts of Scripture. For ancient custom, or rather the Catholic Church, which has delivered to us as genuine the Sacred Gospels and the other Books of Scripture, has undoubtedly delivered these also as parts of Scripture, and the denial of these is the rejection of those. And if, perhaps, it seems that not always have all of these been considered on the same level as the others, yet nevertheless these also have been counted and reckoned with the rest of Scripture, both by Synods and by many of the most ancient and eminent Theologians of the Universal Church. All of these we also judge to be Canonical Books, and confess them to be Sacred Scripture.\nOther texts printed in Eastern Orthodox Bibles are included as an appendix, which is not the same in all churches; the appendix contains 4 Maccabees in Greek-language bibles, while it contains 2 Esdras in Slavonic-language and Russian-language.\nIn Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\nIn the Bible used by the Eritrean and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, those books of the Old Testament that are still counted as canonical, but which are not agreed upon by all other Churches, are often set in a separate section titled \u201cdeuterocanonical\u201d (\u12f2\u12e9\u1275\u122e\u12ab\u1296\u1292\u12ab\u120d). The Ethiopian Orthodox Deuterocanon, in addition to the standard set listed above, and with the books of Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh, also includes some books that are still held canonical by only the Ethiopian Church, including the Book of Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, and the three books of Meqabyan (which are sometimes wrongly confused with the Books of the Maccabees).\nThe Book of Enoch is unusual as it was quoted in the New Testament. 1 Enoch 1:9 is directly and explicitly quoted in Jude 1:14-15 and may be alluded to in Galatians 5:19. It is not part of the canon of any other churches.\nIn Protestantism.\nFor churches which espouse \"sola scriptura\", it is necessary and critical to have a clear and complete list of the canonical books.\nThe early Christian church largely relied upon the Septuagint in the canonization of the Christian Bible.\nIn the 16th century, Martin Luther argued that many of the received texts of the New Testament lacked the authority of the Gospels, and therefore proposed removing a number of books from the New Testament, including Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Book of Revelation.\nThe deuterocanonical books\u2014which had previously been deprecated by Jewish scholars\u2014were moved by Luther into an intertestamental section of the Bible called the Apocrypha.\nLutherans and Anglicans do not consider these books to be canonical but do consider them worthy of reverence. Today, readings from the Protestant apocrypha are found in the lectionaries of some of these churches.\nAnabaptist Churches.\nAnabaptists use the Luther Bible, which contains the Apocrypha as intertestamental books, which has much overlap with the Catholic deuterocanonical books; Amish wedding ceremonies include \"the retelling of the marriage of Tobias and Sarah in the Apocrypha\".\nThe fathers of Anabaptism, such as Menno Simons, quoted \"them [the Apocrypha] with the same authority and nearly the same frequency as books of the Hebrew Bible\" and the texts regarding the martyrdoms under Antiochus IV in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees are held in high esteem by the Anabaptists, who faced persecution in their history.\nAnglican Communion.\nThe Thirty-nine Articles of Religion of the Church of England lists the deuterocanonical books as suitable to be read for \"example of life and instruction of manners, but yet doth not apply them to establish any doctrine\". The early lectionaries of the Anglican Church (as included in the Book of Common Prayer of 1662) included the deuterocanonical books amongst the cycle of readings, and passages from them were used regularly in services (such as the Kyrie Pantokrator and the Benedicite).\nReadings from the deuterocanonical books are now included in many modern lectionaries in the Anglican Communion, based on the Revised Common Lectionary (in turn based on the post-conciliar Roman Catholic lectionary), though alternative readings from protocanonical books are also provided.\nThere is a great deal of overlap between the Apocrypha section of the original 1611 King James Bible and the Catholic deuterocanon, but the two are distinct.\nThe Apocrypha section of the original 1611 King James Bible includes, in addition to the deuterocanonical books, the following three books, which were not included in the list of the canonical books by the Council of Trent:\nThese books make up the Apocrypha section of the Clementine Vulgate: 3 Esdras (a.k.a. 1 Esdras); 4 Esdras (a.k.a. 2 Esdras); and the Prayer of Manasseh, where they are specifically described as \"outside of the series of the canon\". The 1609 Douai Bible includes them in an appendix, but they have not been included in English Catholic Bibles since the Challoner revision of the Douai Bible in 1750.\nUsing the word \"apocrypha\" (Greek: \"hidden away\") to describe texts, although not necessarily pejorative, implies that the writings in question should not be included in the canon of the Bible. This classification commingles them with certain non-canonical gospels and New Testament apocrypha. \"The Society of Biblical Literature\" recommends the use of the term \"deuterocanonical books\" instead of \"Apocrypha\" in academic writing.\nLutheran Churches.\nLuther termed the deuterocanonical books \"Apocrypha, that is, books which are not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but are useful and good to read.\" These are included in copies of the Luther Bible as intertestamental books between the Old Testament and New Testament.\nMethodist Churches and Moravian Churches.\nThe first Methodist liturgical book, \"The Sunday Service of the Methodists\", employs verses from the deuterocanonical books, such as in the Eucharistic liturgy.\nThe Revised Common Lectionary, in use by most mainline Protestants including Methodists and Moravians, lists readings from the deuterocanonical books in the liturgical kalendar, although alternate Old Testament scripture lessons are provided.\nPresbyterian Churches.\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith, a Calvinist document that serves as a systematic summary of doctrine for the Church of Scotland and other Presbyterian Churches worldwide, recognizes only the sixty-six books of the Protestant canon as authentic scripture. Chapter 1, Article 3 of the Confession reads: \"The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.\"\nReformed Churches.\nThe Belgic Confession, used in Reformed churches, devotes a section (Article 6) to \"the difference between the canonical and apocryphal books\" and says of them: \"All which the Church may read and take instruction from, so far as they agree with the canonical books; but they are far from having such power and efficacy as that we may from their testimony confirm any point of faith or of the Christian religion; much less to detract from the authority of the other sacred books.\"\nNew Testament deuterocanonicals.\nThe term \"deuterocanonical\" is sometimes used to describe the canonical antilegomena, those books of the New Testament which, like the deuterocanonicals of the Old Testament, were not universally accepted by the early Church. The antilegomena or \"disputed writings\" were widely read in the Early Church and include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is an ancient sport, as demonstrated by the fifth-century-BC Myron statue \"Discobolus\". Although not part of the current pentathlon, it was one of the events of the ancient Greek pentathlon, which can be dated back to at least 708\u00a0BC, and it is part of the modern decathlon.\nHistory.\nThe sport of throwing the discus traces back to it being an event in the original Olympic Games of Ancient Greece. The discus as a sport was resurrected in Magdeburg, Germany, by gymnastics teacher Christian Georg Kohlrausch and his students in the 1870s. Organized men's competition was resumed in the late 19th century, and has been a part of the modern Summer Olympic Games since the first modern competition, the 1896 Summer Olympics. Images of discus throwers figured prominently in advertising for early modern Games, such as fundraising stamps for the 1896 Games, and the main posters for the 1920 and 1948 Summer Olympics. Today the sport of discus is a routine part of modern track-and-field meets at all levels, and retains a particularly iconic place in the Olympic Games.\nThe first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Franti\u0161ek Janda-Suk from Bohemia (the present Czech Republic). Janda-Suk invented this technique when studying the position of the statue of \"Discobolus\". After a year of developing the technique, he earned a silver medal in the 1900 Olympics.\nWomen's competition began in the first decades of the 20th century. Following competition at national and regional levels, it was added to the Olympic program for the 1928 games.\nRegulations.\nThe event consists of throwing a heavy disc, with the weight or size depending on the competitor. Men and women throw different sized discs, with varying sizes and weights depending on age. The weight of the discus is either governed by World Athletics for international or USA Track &amp; Field for the United States.\nIn the United States, Henry Canine advocated for a lighter-weight discus in high school competition. His suggestion was adopted by the National High School Athletic Association in 1938.\nThe typical discus has sides made of plastic, wood, fiberglass, carbon fiber or metal with a metal rim and a metal core to attain the weight. The rim must be smooth, with no roughness or finger holds. A discus with more weight in the rim produces greater angular momentum for any given spin rate, and thus more stability, although it is more difficult to throw. However, a higher rim weight, if thrown correctly, can lead to a longer throw. In some competitions, a solid rubber discus is used (see in the United States).\nTo make a throw, the competitor starts in a circle of 2.50\u00a0m () diameter, which is recessed in a concrete pad by . The thrower typically takes an initial stance facing away from the direction of the throw. They then spin anticlockwise (for right-handers) &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 times while staying within the circle to build momentum before releasing the discus. The discus must land within a 34.92\u00ba circular sector that is centered on the throwing circle. The rules of competition for discus are virtually identical to those of shot put, except that the circle is larger, a stop board is not used and there are no form rules concerning how the discus is to be thrown.\nThe basic motion is a fore-handed sidearm movement. The discus is spun off the index finger or the middle finger of the throwing hand. In flight the disc spins clockwise when viewed from above for a right-handed thrower, and anticlockwise for a left-handed thrower. As well as achieving maximum momentum in the discus on throwing, the discus' distance is also determined by the trajectory the thrower imparts, as well as the aerodynamic behavior of the discus. Generally, throws into a moderate headwind achieve the maximum distance. Also, a faster-spinning discus imparts greater gyroscopic stability. The technique of discus throwing is quite difficult to master and needs much experience to perfect; thus most top throwers are 30 years old or more.\nThe discus throw is sometimes contested indoors, but it is not included at the World Athletics Indoor Championships. World Athletics used to keep \"world indoor best\" discus records, but since 2023 they now combine both indoor and outdoor marks.\nPhases.\nThe discus technique can be broken down into phases. The purpose is to transfer from the back to the front of the throwing circle while turning through one and a half circles. The speed of delivery is high, and speed is built up during the throw (slow to fast). Correct technique involves the buildup of torque so that maximum force can be applied to the discus on delivery.\nInitially, the thrower takes up their position in the throwing circle, distributing their body weight evenly over both feet, which are roughly shoulder width apart. They crouch in order to adopt a more efficient posture to start from whilst also isometrically preloading their muscles; this will allow them to start faster and achieve a more powerful throw. They then begin the wind-up, which sets the tone for the entire throw; the rhythm of the wind-up and throw is very important.\nFocusing on rhythm can bring about the consistency to get in the right positions that many throwers lack. Executing a sound discus throw with solid technique requires perfect balance. This is due to the throw being a linear movement combined with a one and a half rotation and an implement at the end of one arm. Thus, a good discus thrower needs to maintain balance within the circle.\nFor a right handed thrower, the next stage is to move the weight over the left foot. From this position the right foot is raised, and the athlete 'runs' across the circle. There are various techniques for this stage where the leg swings out to a small or great extent, some athletes turn on their left heel (e.g. Ilke Wylluda) but turning on the ball of the foot is far more common.\nThe aim is to land in the 'power position', the right foot should be in the center and the heel should not touch the ground at any point. The left foot should land very quickly after the right. Weight should be mostly over the back foot with as much torque as possible in the body\u2014so the right arm is high and far back. This is very hard to achieve.\nThe critical stage is the delivery of the discus, from this 'power position' the hips drive through hard, and will be facing the direction of the throw on delivery. Athletes employ various techniques to control the end-point and recover from the throw, such as fixing feet (to pretty much stop dead), or an active reverse spinning onto the left foot (e.g. Virgilijus Alekna).\nSports scientist Richard Ganslen researched the \"Aerodynamics of the Discus\", reporting the discus will stall at an angle of 29\u00b0.\nCulture.\nThe discus throw has been the subject of a number of well-known ancient Greek statues and Roman copies such as the \"Discobolus\" and \"Discophoros\". The discus throw also appears repeatedly in ancient Greek mythology, featured as a means of manslaughter in the cases of Hyacinth, Crocus, Phocus, and Acrisius, and as a named event in the funeral games of Patroclus.\nDiscus throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the \u20ac10 Greek Discus commemorative coin, minted in 2003 to commemorate the 2004 Summer Olympics. On the obverse of the coin a modern athlete is seen in the foreground in a half-turned position, while in the background an ancient discus thrower has been captured in a lively bending motion, with the discus high above his head, creating a vivid representation of the sport.\nAll-time top 25.\nMen.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSeason's bests.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8492", "revid": "14462949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8492", "title": "Discrete mathematics", "text": "Study of discrete mathematical structures\nDiscrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered \"discrete\" (in a way analogous to discrete variables, having a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) with natural numbers), rather than \"continuous\" (analogously to continuous functions). Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, graphs, and statements in logic. By contrast, discrete mathematics excludes topics in \"continuous mathematics\" such as real numbers, calculus or Euclidean geometry. Discrete objects can often be enumerated by integers; more formally, discrete mathematics has been characterized as the branch of mathematics dealing with countable sets (finite sets or sets with the same cardinality as the natural numbers). However, there is no exact definition of the term \"discrete mathematics\".\nThe set of objects studied in discrete mathematics can be finite or infinite. The term finite mathematics is sometimes applied to parts of the field of discrete mathematics that deal with finite sets, particularly those areas relevant to business.\nResearch in discrete mathematics increased in the latter half of the twentieth century partly due to the development of digital computers which operate in \"discrete\" steps and store data in \"discrete\" bits. Concepts and notations from discrete mathematics are useful in studying and describing objects and problems in branches of computer science, such as computer algorithms, programming languages, cryptography, automated theorem proving, and software development. Conversely, computer implementations are significant in applying ideas from discrete mathematics to real-world problems.\nAlthough the main objects of study in discrete mathematics are discrete objects, analytic methods from \"continuous\" mathematics are often employed as well.\nIn university curricula, discrete mathematics appeared in the 1980s, initially as a computer science support course; its contents were somewhat haphazard at the time. The curriculum has thereafter developed in conjunction with efforts by ACM and MAA into a course that is basically intended to develop mathematical maturity in first-year students; therefore, it is nowadays a prerequisite for mathematics majors in some universities as well. Some high-school-level discrete mathematics textbooks have appeared as well. At this level, discrete mathematics is sometimes seen as a preparatory course, like precalculus in this respect.\nThe Fulkerson Prize is awarded for outstanding papers in discrete mathematics.\nTopics.\nTheoretical computer science.\nTheoretical computer science includes areas of discrete mathematics relevant to computing. It draws heavily on graph theory and mathematical logic. Included within theoretical computer science is the study of algorithms and data structures. Computability studies what can be computed in principle, and has close ties to logic, while complexity studies the time, space, and other resources taken by computations. Automata theory and formal language theory are closely related to computability. Petri nets and process algebras are used to model computer systems, and methods from discrete mathematics are used in analyzing VLSI electronic circuits. Computational geometry applies algorithms to geometrical problems and representations of geometrical objects, while computer image analysis applies them to representations of images. Theoretical computer science also includes the study of various continuous computational topics.\nInformation theory.\nInformation theory involves the quantification of information. Closely related is coding theory which is used to design efficient and reliable data transmission and storage methods. Information theory also includes continuous topics such as: analog signals, analog coding, analog encryption.\nLogic.\nLogic is the study of the principles of valid reasoning and inference, as well as of consistency, soundness, and completeness. For example, in most systems of logic (but not in intuitionistic logic) Peirce's law (((\"P\"\u2192\"Q\")\u2192\"P\")\u2192\"P\") is a theorem. For classical logic, it can be easily verified with a truth table. The study of mathematical proof is particularly important in logic, and has accumulated to automated theorem proving and formal verification of software.\nLogical formulas are discrete structures, as are proofs, which form finite trees or, more generally, directed acyclic graph structures (with each inference step combining one or more premise branches to give a single conclusion). The truth values of logical formulas usually form a finite set, generally restricted to two values: \"true\" and \"false\", but logic can also be continuous-valued, e.g., fuzzy logic. Concepts such as infinite proof trees or infinite derivation trees have also been studied, e.g. infinitary logic.\nSet theory.\nSet theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets, which are collections of objects, such as {blue, white, red} or the (infinite) set of all prime numbers. Partially ordered sets and sets with other relations have applications in several areas.\nIn discrete mathematics, countable sets (including finite sets) are the main focus. The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is usually marked by Georg Cantor's work distinguishing between different kinds of infinite set, motivated by the study of trigonometric series, and further development of the theory of infinite sets is outside the scope of discrete mathematics. Indeed, contemporary work in descriptive set theory makes extensive use of traditional continuous mathematics.\nCombinatorics.\nCombinatorics studies the ways in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged.\nEnumerative combinatorics concentrates on counting the number of certain combinatorial objects - e.g. the twelvefold way provides a unified framework for counting permutations, combinations and partitions.\nAnalytic combinatorics concerns the enumeration (i.e., determining the number) of combinatorial structures using tools from complex analysis and probability theory. In contrast with enumerative combinatorics which uses explicit combinatorial formulae and generating functions to describe the results, analytic combinatorics aims at obtaining asymptotic formulae.\nTopological combinatorics concerns the use of techniques from topology and algebraic topology/combinatorial topology in combinatorics.\nDesign theory is a study of combinatorial designs, which are collections of subsets with certain intersection properties.\nPartition theory studies various enumeration and asymptotic problems related to integer partitions, and is closely related to q-series, special functions and orthogonal polynomials. Originally a part of number theory and analysis, partition theory is now considered a part of combinatorics or an independent field.\nOrder theory is the study of partially ordered sets, both finite and infinite.\nGraph theory.\nGraph theory, the study of graphs and networks, is often considered part of combinatorics, but has grown large enough and distinct enough, with its own kind of problems, to be regarded as a subject in its own right. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics. They are among the most ubiquitous models of both natural and human-made structures. They can model many types of relations and process dynamics in physical, biological and social systems. In computer science, they can represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, the flow of computation, etc. In mathematics, they are useful in geometry and certain parts of topology, e.g. knot theory. Algebraic graph theory has close links with group theory and topological graph theory has close links to topology. There are also continuous graphs; however, for the most part, research in graph theory falls within the domain of discrete mathematics.\nNumber theory.\nNumber theory is concerned with the properties of numbers in general, particularly integers. It has applications to cryptography and cryptanalysis, particularly with regard to modular arithmetic, diophantine equations, linear and quadratic congruences, prime numbers and primality testing. Other discrete aspects of number theory include geometry of numbers. In analytic number theory, techniques from continuous mathematics are also used. Topics that go beyond discrete objects include transcendental numbers, diophantine approximation, p-adic analysis and function fields.\nAlgebraic structures.\nAlgebraic structures occur as both discrete examples and continuous examples. Discrete algebras include: Boolean algebra used in logic gates and programming; relational algebra used in databases; discrete and finite versions of groups, rings and fields are important in algebraic coding theory; discrete semigroups and monoids appear in the theory of formal languages.\nDiscrete analogues of continuous mathematics.\nThere are many concepts and theories in continuous mathematics which have discrete versions, such as discrete calculus, discrete Fourier transforms, discrete geometry, discrete logarithms, discrete differential geometry, discrete exterior calculus, discrete Morse theory, discrete optimization, discrete probability theory, discrete probability distribution, difference equations, discrete dynamical systems, and discrete vector\u00a0measures.\nCalculus of finite differences, discrete analysis, and discrete calculus.\nIn discrete calculus and the calculus of finite differences, a function defined on an interval of the integers is usually called a sequence. A sequence could be a finite sequence from a data source or an infinite sequence from a discrete dynamical system. Such a discrete function could be defined explicitly by a list (if its domain is finite), or by a formula for its general term, or it could be given implicitly by a recurrence relation or difference equation. Difference equations are similar to differential equations, but replace differentiation by taking the difference between adjacent terms; they can be used to approximate differential equations or (more often) studied in their own right. Many questions and methods concerning differential equations have counterparts for difference equations. For instance, where there are integral transforms in harmonic analysis for studying continuous functions or analogue signals, there are discrete transforms for discrete functions or digital signals. As well as discrete metric spaces, there are more general discrete topological spaces, finite metric spaces, finite topological spaces.\nThe time scale calculus is a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of differential equations, which has applications to fields requiring simultaneous modelling of discrete and continuous data. Another way of modeling such a situation is the notion of hybrid dynamical systems.\nDiscrete geometry.\nDiscrete geometry and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of \"discrete collections\" of geometrical objects. A long-standing topic in discrete geometry is tiling of the plane.\nIn algebraic geometry, the concept of a curve can be extended to discrete geometries by taking the spectra of polynomial rings over finite fields to be models of the affine spaces over that field, and letting subvarieties or spectra of other rings provide the curves that lie in that space. Although the space in which the curves appear has a finite number of points, the curves are not so much sets of points as analogues of curves in continuous settings. For example, every point of the form formula_1 for formula_2 a field can be studied either as formula_3, a point, or as the spectrum formula_4 of the local ring at (x-c), a point together with a neighborhood around it. Algebraic varieties also have a well-defined notion of tangent space called the Zariski tangent space, making many features of calculus applicable even in finite settings.\nDiscrete modelling.\nIn applied mathematics, discrete modelling is the discrete analogue of continuous modelling. In discrete modelling, discrete formulae are fit to data. A common method in this form of modelling is to use recurrence relation. Discretization concerns the process of transferring continuous models and equations into discrete counterparts, often for the purposes of making calculations easier by using approximations. Numerical analysis provides an important example.\nChallenges.\nThe history of discrete mathematics has involved a number of challenging problems which have focused attention within areas of the field. In graph theory, much research was motivated by attempts to prove the four color theorem, first stated in 1852, but not proved until 1976 (by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, using substantial computer assistance).\nIn logic, the second problem on David Hilbert's list of open problems presented in 1900 was to prove that the axioms of arithmetic are consistent. G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem, proved in 1931, showed that this was not possible \u2013 at least not within arithmetic itself. Hilbert's tenth problem was to determine whether a given polynomial Diophantine equation with integer coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved that this could not be done.\nThe need to break German codes in World War II led to advances in cryptography and theoretical computer science, with the first programmable digital electronic computer being developed at England's Bletchley Park with the guidance of Alan Turing and his seminal work, On Computable Numbers. The Cold War meant that cryptography remained important, with fundamental advances such as public-key cryptography being developed in the following decades. The telecommunications industry has also motivated advances in discrete mathematics, particularly in graph theory and information theory. Formal verification of statements in logic has been necessary for software development of safety-critical systems, and advances in automated theorem proving have been driven by this need.\nComputational geometry has been an important part of the computer graphics incorporated into modern video games and computer-aided design tools.\nSeveral fields of discrete mathematics, particularly theoretical computer science, graph theory, and combinatorics, are important in addressing the challenging bioinformatics problems associated with understanding the tree of life.\nCurrently, one of the most famous open problems in theoretical computer science is the P = NP problem, which involves the relationship between the complexity classes P and NP. The Clay Mathematics Institute has offered a $1 million USD prize for the first correct proof, along with prizes for six other mathematical problems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Originally developed as an insecticide, it became infamous for its environmental impacts. DDT was first synthesized in 1874 by the Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler. DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by the Swiss chemist Paul Hermann M\u00fcller in 1939. DDT was used in the second half of World War II to limit the spread of the insect-borne diseases malaria and typhus among civilians and troops. M\u00fcller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1948 \"for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods\". The WHO's anti-malaria campaign of the 1950s and 1960s relied heavily on DDT and the results were promising, though there was a resurgence in developing countries afterwards.\nBy October 1945, DDT was available for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning. Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book \"Silent Spring\". It talked about environmental impacts that correlated with the widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environmental and health effects. The book cited claims that DDT and other pesticides caused cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Although Carson never directly called for an outright ban on the use of DDT, its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States. Along with the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the United States ban on DDT is a major factor in the comeback of the bald eagle (the national bird of the United States) and the peregrine falcon from near-extinction in the contiguous United States.\nThe evolution of DDT resistance and the harm both to humans and the environment led many governments to curtail DDT use. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which has been in effect since 2004. Recognizing that total elimination in many malaria-prone countries is currently unfeasible in the absence of affordable/effective alternatives for disease control, the convention exempts public health use within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines from the ban.\nDDT still has limited use in disease vector control because of its effectiveness in killing mosquitos and thus reducing malarial infections, but that use is controversial due to environmental and health concerns. DDT is one of many tools to fight malaria, which remains the primary public health challenge in many countries. WHO guidelines require that absence of DDT resistance must be confirmed before using it. Resistance is largely due to agricultural use, in much greater quantities than required for disease prevention.\nProperties and chemistry.\nDDT is similar in structure to the insecticide methoxychlor and the acaricide dicofol. It is highly hydrophobic and nearly insoluble in water but has good solubility in most organic solvents, fats and oils. DDT does not occur naturally and is synthesised by consecutive Friedel\u2013Crafts reactions between chloral (CCl3CHO) and two equivalents of chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl), in the presence of an acidic catalyst. DDT has been marketed under trade names including Anofex, Cezarex, Chlorophenothane, Dicophane, Dinocide, Gesarol, Guesapon, Guesarol, Gyron, Ixodex, Neocid, Neocidol and Zerdane; INN is clofenotane.\nIsomers and related compounds.\nCommercial DDT is a mixture of several closely related compounds. Due to the nature of the chemical reaction used to synthesize DDT, several combinations of \"ortho\" and \"para\" arene substitution patterns are formed. The major component (77%) is the desired \"p\",\"p'\" isomer. The \"o\",\"p'\" isomeric impurity is also present in significant amounts (15%). Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) make up the balance of impurities in commercial samples. DDE and DDD are also the major metabolites and environmental breakdown products. DDT, DDE and DDD are sometimes referred to collectively as DDX.\nProduction and use.\nDDT has been formulated in multiple forms, including solutions in xylene or petroleum distillates, emulsifiable concentrates, water-wettable powders, granules, aerosols, smoke candles and charges for vaporizers and lotions.\nFrom 1950 to 1980, DDT was extensively used in agriculture\u00a0\u2013 more than 40,000 tonnes each year worldwide\u00a0\u2013 and it has been estimated that a total of 1.8 million tonnes have been produced globally since the 1940s. In the United States, it was manufactured by some 15 companies, including Monsanto, Ciba, Montrose Chemical Company, Pennwalt, and Velsicol Chemical Corporation. Production peaked in 1963 at 82,000 tonnes per year. More than 600,000 tonnes (1.35 billion pounds) were applied in the US before the 1972 ban. Usage peaked in 1959 at about 36,000 tonnes.\nChina ceased production in 2007, leaving India the only country still manufacturing DDT; it is the largest consumer.&lt;ref name=\"DDTBP.1/2\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 3,314 tonnes were produced for malaria control and visceral leishmaniasis. In recent years, in addition to India, just seven other countries, all in Africa, are still using DDT.\nMechanism of insecticide action.\nIn insects, DDT opens voltage-sensitive sodium ion channels in neurons, causing them to fire spontaneously, which leads to spasms and eventual death. Insects with certain mutations in their sodium channel gene are resistant to DDT and similar insecticides. DDT resistance is also conferred by up-regulation of genes expressing cytochrome P450 in some insect species, as greater quantities of some enzymes of this group accelerate the toxin's metabolism into inactive metabolites. Genomic studies in the model genetic organism \"Drosophila melanogaster\" revealed that high level DDT resistance is polygenic, involving multiple resistance mechanisms. In the absence of genetic adaptation, Roberts and Andre 1994 find behavioral avoidance nonetheless provides insects with some protection against DDT. The M918T mutation event produces dramatic \"kdr\" for pyrethroids but Usherwood et al. 2005 find it is entirely ineffective against DDT. Scott 2019 believes this test in \"Drosophila\" oocytes holds for oocytes in general.\nHistory.\nDDT was first synthesized in 1874 by Othmar Zeidler under the supervision of Adolf von Baeyer. It was further described in 1929 in a dissertation by W. Bausch and in two subsequent publications in 1930. The insecticide properties of \"multiple chlorinated aliphatic or fat-aromatic alcohols with at least one trichloromethane group\" were described in a patent in 1934 by Wolfgang von Leuthold. DDT's insecticidal properties were not, however, discovered until 1939 by the Swiss scientist Paul Hermann M\u00fcller, who was awarded the 1948 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for his efforts.\nUse in the 1940s and 1950s.\nDDT is the best-known of several chlorine-containing pesticides used in the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, the use of DDT was driven by protecting American soldiers from diseases in tropical areas. Both British and American scientists hoped to use it to control spread of malaria, typhus, dysentery, and typhoid fever among overseas soldiers, especially considering that the pyrethrum was harder to access since it came mainly from Japan. Due to the potency of DDT, it was not long before America's War Production Board placed it on military supply lists in 1942 and 1943 and encouraged its production for overseas use. Enthusiasm regarding DDT became obvious through the American government's advertising campaigns of posters depicting Americans fighting the Axis powers and insects and through media publications celebrating its military uses. In the South Pacific, it was sprayed aerially for malaria and dengue fever control with spectacular effects. While DDT's chemical and insecticidal properties were important factors in these victories, advances in application equipment coupled with competent organization and sufficient manpower were also crucial to the success of these programs.\nIn 1945, DDT was made available to farmers as an agricultural insecticide and played a role in the elimination of malaria in Europe and North America. Despite concerns emerging in the scientific community, and lack of research, the FDA considered it safe up to 7 parts per million in food. There was a large economic incentive to push DDT into the market and sell it to farmers, governments, and individuals to control diseases and increase food production.\nDDT was also a way for American influence to reach abroad through DDT-spraying campaigns. In the 1944 issue of Life magazine there was a feature regarding the Italian program showing pictures of American public health officials in uniforms spraying DDT on Italian families.\nIn 1955, the World Health Organization commenced a program to eradicate malaria in countries with low to moderate transmission rates worldwide, relying largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to reduce transmission. The program eliminated the disease in \"North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union\", and in \"Taiwan, much of the Caribbean, the Balkans, parts of northern Africa, the northern region of Australia, and a large swath of the South Pacific\" and dramatically reduced mortality in Sri Lanka and India.\nHowever, failure to sustain the program, increasing mosquito tolerance to DDT, and increasing parasite tolerance led to a resurgence. In many areas early successes partially or completely reversed, and in some cases rates of transmission increased. The program succeeded in eliminating malaria only in areas with \"high socio-economic status, well-organized healthcare systems, and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission\".\nDDT was less effective in tropical regions due to the continuous life cycle of mosquitoes and poor infrastructure. It was applied in sub-Saharan Africa by various colonial states, but the 'global' WHO eradication program didn't include the region. Mortality rates in that area never declined to the same dramatic extent, and now constitute the bulk of malarial deaths worldwide, especially following the disease's resurgence as a result of resistance to drug treatments and the spread of the deadly malarial variant caused by \"Plasmodium falciparum\". Eradication was abandoned in 1969 and attention instead focused on controlling and treating the disease. Spraying programs (especially using DDT) were curtailed due to concerns over safety and environmental effects, as well as problems in administrative, managerial and financial implementation. Efforts shifted from spraying to the use of bednets impregnated with insecticides and other interventions.\nUnited States ban.\nBy October 1945, DDT was available for public sale in the United States, used both as an agricultural pesticide and as a household insecticide. Although its use was promoted by government and the agricultural industry, US scientists such as FDA pharmacologist Herbert O.\u00a0Calvery expressed concern over possible hazards associated with DDT as early as 1944. In 1947, Bradbury Robinson, a physician and nutritionist practicing in St.\u00a0Louis, Michigan, warned of the dangers of using the pesticide DDT in agriculture. DDT had been researched and manufactured in St.\u00a0Louis by the Michigan Chemical Corporation, later purchased by Velsicol Chemical Corporation, and had become an important part of the local economy. Citing research performed by Michigan State University in 1946, Robinson, a past president of the local Conservation Club, opined that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;perhaps the greatest danger from D.D.T. is that its extensive use in farm areas is most likely to upset the natural balances, not only killing beneficial insects in great number but by bringing about the death of fish, birds, and other forms of wild life either by their feeding on insects killed by D.D.T. or directly by ingesting the poison.\nAs its production and use increased, public response was mixed. At the same time that DDT was hailed as part of the \"world of tomorrow\", concerns were expressed about its potential to kill harmless and beneficial insects (particularly pollinators), birds, fish, and eventually humans. The issue of toxicity was complicated, partly because DDT's effects varied from species to species, and partly because consecutive exposures could accumulate, causing damage comparable to large doses. A number of states attempted to regulate DDT. In the 1950s the federal government began tightening regulations governing its use. These events received little attention. Women like Dorothy Colson and Mamie Ella Plyler of Claxton, Georgia, gathered evidence about DDT's effects and wrote to the Georgia Department of Public Health, the National Health Council in New York City, and other organizations.\nIn 1957 \"The New York Times\" reported an unsuccessful struggle to restrict DDT use in Nassau County, New York, and the issue came to the attention of the popular naturalist-author Rachel Carson when a friend, Olga Huckins, wrote to her including an article she had written in the Boston Globe about the devastation of her local bird population after DDT spraying. William Shawn, editor of \"The New Yorker\", urged her to write a piece on the subject, which developed into her 1962 book \"Silent Spring\". The book argued that pesticides, including DDT, were poisoning both wildlife and the environment and were endangering human health. \"Silent Spring\" was a best seller, and public reaction to it launched the modern environmental movement in the United States. The year after it appeared, President John F. Kennedy ordered his Science Advisory Committee to investigate Carson's claims. The committee's report \"add[ed] up to a fairly thorough-going vindication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring thesis\", in the words of the journal \"Science\", and recommended a phaseout of \"persistent toxic pesticides\". In 1965, the U.S. military removed DDT from the military supply system due in part to the development of resistance by body lice to DDT; it was replaced by lindane.\nIn the mid-1960s, DDT became a prime target of the burgeoning environmental movement, as concern about DDT and its effects began to rise in local communities. In 1966, a fish kill in Suffolk County, New York, was linked to a 5,000-gallon DDT dump by the county's mosquito commission, leading a group of scientists and lawyers to file a lawsuit to stop the county's further use of DDT. A year later, the group, led by Victor Yannacone and Charles Wurster, founded the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), along with scientists Art Cooley and Dennis Puleston, and brought a string of lawsuits against DDT and other persistent pesticides in Michigan and Wisconsin. \nAround the same time, evidence was mounting further about DDT causing catastrophic declines in wildlife reproduction, especially in birds of prey like peregrine falcons, bald eagles, ospreys, and brown pelicans, whose eggshells became so thin that they often cracked before hatching. Toxicologists like David Peakall were measuring DDE levels in the eggs of peregrine falcons and California condors and finding that increased levels corresponded with thinner shells. Compounding the effect was DDT's persistence in the environment, as it was unable to dissolve in water, and ended up accumulating in animal fat and disrupting hormone metabolism across a wide range of species.\nIn response to an EDF suit, the U.S. District Court of Appeals in 1971 ordered the EPA to begin the de-registration procedure for DDT. After an initial six-month review process, William Ruckelshaus, the Agency's first Administrator rejected an immediate suspension of DDT's registration, citing studies from the EPA's internal staff stating that DDT was not an imminent danger. However, these findings were criticized, as they were performed mostly by economic entomologists inherited from the United States Department of Agriculture, who many environmentalists felt were biased towards agribusiness and understated concerns about human health and wildlife. The decision thus created controversy.\nThe EPA held seven months of hearings in 1971\u20131972, with scientists giving evidence for and against DDT. In the summer of 1972, Ruckelshaus announced the cancellation of most uses of DDT\u00a0\u2013 exempting public health uses under some conditions. Again, this caused controversy. Immediately after the announcement, both the EDF and the DDT manufacturers filed suit against EPA. Many in the agricultural community were concerned that food production would be severely impacted, while proponents of pesticides warned of increased breakouts of insect-borne diseases and questioned the accuracy of giving animals high amounts of pesticides for cancer potential. Industry sought to overturn the ban, while the EDF wanted a comprehensive ban. The cases were consolidated, and in 1973 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the EPA had acted properly in banning DDT. During the late 1970s, the EPA also began banning organochlorines, pesticides that were chemically similar to DDT. These included aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane, heptachlor, toxaphene, and mirex.\nSome uses of DDT continued under the public health exemption. For example, in June 1979, the California Department of Health Services was permitted to use DDT to suppress flea vectors of bubonic plague. DDT continued to be produced in the United States for foreign markets until 1985, when over 300 tons were exported.\nInternational usage restrictions.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, agricultural use was banned in most developed countries, beginning with Hungary in 1968 \u2013 although in practice it continued to be used through at least 1970. This was followed by Norway and Sweden in 1970, West Germany and the United States in 1972, but not in the United Kingdom until 1984.\nIn contrast to West Germany, in the German Democratic Republic DDT was used until 1988. Especially of relevance were large-scale applications in forestry in the years 1982\u20131984, with the aim to combat bark beetle and pine moth. As a consequence, DDT-concentrations in eastern German forest soils are still significantly higher compared to soils in the former western German states.\nBy 1991, total bans, including for disease control, were in place in at least 26 countries; for example, Cuba in 1970, the US in the 1980s, Singapore in 1984, Chile in 1985, and the Republic of Korea in 1986.\nThe Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which took effect in 2004, put a global ban on several persistent organic pollutants, and restricted DDT use to vector control. The convention was ratified by more than 170 countries. Recognizing that total elimination in many malaria-prone countries is currently unfeasible in the absence of affordable/effective alternatives, the convention exempts public health use within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines from the ban. Resolution 60.18 of the World Health Assembly commits WHO to the Stockholm Convention's aim of reducing and ultimately eliminating DDT. Malaria Foundation International states, \"The outcome of the treaty is arguably better than the status quo going into the negotiations. For the first time, there is now an insecticide which is restricted to vector control only, meaning that the selection of resistant mosquitoes will be slower than before.\"\nDespite the worldwide ban, agricultural use continued in India, North Korea, and possibly elsewhere. As of 2013, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tons of DDT were produced for disease vector control, including 2,786 tons in India. DDT is applied to the inside walls of homes to kill or repel mosquitoes. This intervention, called indoor residual spraying (IRS), greatly reduces environmental damage. It also reduces the incidence of DDT resistance. For comparison, treating of cotton during a typical U.S. growing season requires the same amount of chemical to treat roughly 1,700 homes.\nEnvironmental impact.\nDDT is a persistent organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on environmental conditions, its soil half-life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water (however, its half-life in aquatic environments is listed by the National Pesticide Information Center as 150 years). Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.\nMedical researchers in 1974 found a measurable and significant difference in the presence of DDT in human milk between mothers who lived in New Brunswick and mothers who lived in Nova Scotia, \"possibly because of the wider use of insecticide sprays in the past\".\nBecause of its lipophilic properties, DDT can bioaccumulate, especially in predatory birds. DDT is toxic to a wide range of living organisms, including marine animals such as crayfish, daphnids, sea shrimp and many species of fish. DDT, DDE and DDD magnify through the food chain, with apex predators such as raptor birds concentrating more chemicals than other animals in the same environment. They are stored mainly in body fat. DDT and DDE are resistant to metabolism; in humans, their half-lives are 6 and up to 10 years, respectively. In the United States, these chemicals were detected in almost all human blood samples tested by the Centers for Disease Control in 2005, though their levels have sharply declined since most uses were banned. Estimated dietary intake has declined, although FDA food tests commonly detect it.\nDespite being banned for many years, in 2018 research showed that DDT residues are still present in European soils and Spanish rivers.\nEggshell thinning.\nThe chemical and its breakdown products DDE and DDD caused eggshell thinning and population declines in multiple North American and European bird of prey species. Both laboratory experiments and field studies confirmed this effect. The effect was first conclusively proven at Bellow Island in Lake Michigan during University of Michigan-funded studies on American herring gulls in the mid-1960s. DDE-related eggshell thinning is considered a major reason for the decline of the bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon and osprey. However, birds vary in their sensitivity to these chemicals, with birds of prey, waterfowl and song birds being more susceptible than chickens and related species. Even in 2010, California condors that feed on sea lions at Big Sur that in turn feed in the Palos Verdes Shelf area of the Montrose Chemical Superfund site exhibited continued thin-shell problems, though DDT's role in the decline of the California condor is disputed.\nThe biological thinning mechanism is not entirely understood, but DDE appears to be more potent than DDT, and strong evidence indicates that \"p\",\"p'\"-DDE inhibits calcium ATPase in the membrane of the shell gland and reduces the transport of calcium carbonate from blood into the eggshell gland. This results in a dose-dependent thickness reduction. Other evidence indicates that o,p'-DDT disrupts female reproductive tract development, later impairing eggshell quality. Multiple mechanisms may be at work, or different mechanisms may operate in different species.\nHuman health.\nDDT is an endocrine disruptor. It is considered likely to be a human carcinogen although the majority of studies suggest it is not directly genotoxic. DDE acts as a weak androgen receptor antagonist, but not as an estrogen. \"p\",\"p'\"-DDT, DDT's main component, has little or no androgenic or estrogenic activity. The minor component \"o\",\"p'\"-DDT has weak estrogenic activity.\nAcute toxicity.\nDDT is classified as \"moderately toxic\" by the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) and \"moderately hazardous\" by WHO, based on the rat oral LD50 of 113\u00a0mg/kg. Indirect exposure is considered relatively non-toxic for humans.\nChronic toxicity.\nPrimarily through the tendency for DDT to build up in areas of the body with high lipid content, chronic exposure can affect reproductive capabilities and the embryo or fetus.\nCarcinogenicity.\nIn 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified DDT as Group 2A \"probably carcinogenic to humans\". Previous assessments by the U.S. National Toxicology Program classified it as \"reasonably anticipated to be a carcinogen\" and by the EPA classified DDT, DDE and DDD as class B2 \"probable\" carcinogens; these evaluations were based mainly on animal studies. \nA 2005 Lancet review stated that occupational DDT exposure was associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk in 2 case control studies, but another study showed no DDE dose-effect association. Results regarding a possible association with liver cancer and biliary tract cancer are conflicting: workers who did not have direct occupational DDT contact showed increased risk. White men had an increased risk, but not white women or black men. Results about an association with multiple myeloma, prostate and testicular cancer, endometrial cancer and colorectal cancer have been inconclusive or generally do not support an association. A 2017 review of liver cancer studies concluded that \"organochlorine pesticides, including DDT, may increase hepatocellular carcinoma risk\".\nA 2009 review, whose co-authors included persons engaged in DDT-related litigation, reached broadly similar conclusions, with an equivocal association with testicular cancer. Case\u2013control studies did not support an association with leukemia or lymphoma.\nBreast cancer.\nThe question of whether DDT or DDE are risk factors in breast cancer has not been conclusively answered. Several meta analyses of observational studies have concluded that there is no overall relationship between DDT exposure and breast cancer risk. The United States Institute of Medicine reviewed data on the association of breast cancer with DDT exposure in 2012 and concluded that a causative relationship could neither be proven nor disproven.\nA 2007 case-control study using archived blood samples found that breast cancer risk was increased 5-fold among women who were born prior to 1931 and who had high serum DDT levels in 1963. Reasoning that DDT use became widespread in 1945 and peaked around 1950, they concluded that the ages of 14\u201320 were a critical period in which DDT exposure leads to increased risk. This study, which suggests a connection between DDT exposure and breast cancer that would not be picked up by most studies, has received variable commentary in third-party reviews. One review suggested that \"previous studies that measured exposure in older women may have missed the critical period\". The National Toxicology Program notes that while the majority of studies have not found a relationship between DDT exposure and breast cancer that positive associations have been seen in a \"few studies among women with higher levels of exposure and among certain subgroups of women\".\nA 2015 case control study identified a link (odds ratio 3.4) between \"in-utero\" exposure (as estimated from archived maternal blood samples) and breast cancer diagnosis in daughters. The findings \"support classification of DDT as an endocrine disruptor, a predictor of breast cancer, and a marker of high risk\".\nMalaria control.\nMalaria remains the primary public health challenge in many countries. In 2015, there were 214 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 438,000 deaths, 90% of which occurred in Africa. DDT is one of many tools to fight the disease. Its use in this context has been called everything from a \"miracle weapon [that is] like Kryptonite to the mosquitoes\", to \"toxic colonialism\".\nBefore DDT, eliminating mosquito breeding grounds by drainage or poisoning with Paris green or pyrethrum was sometimes successful. In parts of the world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation. A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include antimalarial drugs to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; bednets and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and vector control strategies such as larviciding with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of interior walls and ceilings with insecticides. It is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO\u2013approved IRS insecticides.\nThe WHO's anti-malaria campaign of the 1950s and 1960s relied heavily on DDT and the results were promising, though temporary in developing countries. Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased irrigation. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. chloroquine) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation. Resistance was largely fueled by unrestricted agricultural use. Resistance and the harm both to humans and the environment led many governments to curtail DDT use in vector control and agriculture. In 2006 WHO reversed a longstanding policy against DDT by recommending that it be used as an indoor pesticide in regions where malaria is a major problem.\nOnce the mainstay of anti-malaria campaigns, as of 2019 only five countries used DDT for Indoor Residual Spraying \nInitial effectiveness.\nWhen it was introduced in World War II, DDT was effective in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. WHO's anti-malaria campaign, which consisted mostly of spraying DDT and rapid treatment and diagnosis to break the transmission cycle, was initially successful as well. For example, in Sri Lanka, the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963 and 29 in 1964. Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and the first quarter of 1969. The country resumed DDT vector control but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use. The program switched to malathion, but despite initial successes, malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s.\nDDT remains on WHO's list of insecticides recommended for IRS. After the appointment of Arata Kochi as head of its anti-malaria division, WHO's policy shifted from recommending IRS only in areas of seasonal or episodic transmission of malaria, to advocating it in areas of continuous, intense transmission. WHO reaffirmed its commitment to phasing out DDT, aiming \"to achieve a 30% cut in the application of DDT world-wide by 2014 and its total phase-out by the early 2020s if not sooner\" while simultaneously combating malaria. WHO plans to implement alternatives to DDT to achieve this goal.\nSouth Africa continues to use DDT under WHO guidelines. In 1996, the country switched to alternative insecticides and malaria incidence increased dramatically. Returning to DDT and introducing new drugs brought malaria back under control. Malaria cases increased in South America after countries in that continent stopped using DDT. Research data showed a strong negative relationship between DDT residual house sprayings and malaria. In a research from 1993 to 1995, Ecuador increased its use of DDT and achieved a 61% reduction in malaria rates, while each of the other countries that gradually decreased its DDT use had large increases.\nMosquito resistance.\nIn some areas, resistance reduced DDT's effectiveness. WHO guidelines require that absence of resistance must be confirmed before using the chemical. Resistance is largely due to agricultural use, in much greater quantities than required for disease prevention.\nResistance was noted early in spray campaigns. Paul Russell, former head of the Allied Anti-Malaria campaign, observed in 1956 that \"resistance has appeared after six or seven years\". Resistance has been detected in Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Turkey and Central America and it has largely been replaced by organophosphate or carbamate insecticides, e.g. malathion or bendiocarb.\nIn many parts of India, DDT is ineffective. Agricultural uses were banned in 1989 and its anti-malarial use has been declining. Urban use ended. One study concluded that \"DDT is still a viable insecticide in indoor residual spraying owing to its effectivity in well supervised spray operation and high excito-repellency factor.\"\nStudies of malaria-vector mosquitoes in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa found susceptibility to 4% DDT (WHO's susceptibility standard), in 63% of the samples, compared to the average of 87% in the same species caught in the open. The authors concluded that \"Finding DDT resistance in the vector \"An. arabiensis\", close to the area where we previously reported pyrethroid-resistance in the vector \"An. funestus\" Giles, indicates an urgent need to develop a strategy of insecticide resistance management for the malaria control programmes of southern Africa.\"\nDDT can still be effective against resistant mosquitoes and the avoidance of DDT-sprayed walls by mosquitoes is an additional benefit of the chemical. For example, a 2007 study reported that resistant mosquitoes avoided treated huts. The researchers argued that DDT was the best pesticide for use in IRS (even though it did not afford the most protection from mosquitoes out of the three test chemicals) because the other pesticides worked primarily by killing or irritating mosquitoes \u2013 encouraging the development of resistance. Others argue that the avoidance behavior slows eradication. Unlike other insecticides such as pyrethroids, DDT requires long exposure to accumulate a lethal dose; however its irritant property shortens contact periods. \"For these reasons, when comparisons have been made, better malaria control has generally been achieved with pyrethroids than with DDT.\" In India outdoor sleeping and night duties are common, implying that \"the excito-repellent effect of DDT, often reported useful in other countries, actually promotes outdoor transmission\".\nResidents' concerns.\nIRS is effective if at least 80% of homes and barns in a residential area are sprayed. Lower coverage rates can jeopardize program effectiveness. Many residents resist DDT spraying, objecting to the lingering smell, stains on walls, and the potential exacerbation of problems with other insect pests. Pyrethroid insecticides (e.g. deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin) can overcome some of these issues, increasing participation.\nHuman exposure.\nA 1994 study found that South Africans living in sprayed homes have levels that are several orders of magnitude greater than others. Breast milk from South African mothers contains high levels of DDT and DDE. It is unclear to what extent these levels arise from home spraying vs food residues. Evidence indicates that these levels are associated with infant neurological abnormalities.\nMost studies of DDT's human health effects have been conducted in developed countries where DDT is not used and exposure is relatively low.\nIllegal diversion to agriculture is also a concern as it is difficult to prevent and its subsequent use on crops is uncontrolled. For example, DDT use is widespread in Indian agriculture, particularly mango production and is reportedly used by librarians to protect books. Other examples include Ethiopia, where DDT intended for malaria control is reportedly used in coffee production, and Ghana where it is used for fishing. The residues in crops at levels unacceptable for export have been an important factor in bans in several tropical countries. Adding to this problem is a lack of skilled personnel and management.\nCriticism of restrictions on DDT use.\nRestrictions on DDT usage have been criticized by some organizations opposed to the environmental movement, including Roger Bate of the pro-DDT advocacy group Africa Fighting Malaria and the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute; these sources oppose restrictions on DDT and attribute large numbers of deaths to such restrictions, sometimes in the millions. These arguments were rejected as \"outrageous\" by former WHO scientist Socrates Litsios. May Berenbaum, University of Illinois entomologist, says, \"to blame environmentalists who oppose DDT for more deaths than Hitler is worse than irresponsible\". More recently, Michael Palmer, a professor of chemistry at the University of Waterloo, has pointed out that DDT is still used to prevent malaria, that its declining use is primarily due to increases in manufacturing costs, and that in Africa, efforts to control malaria have been regional or local, not comprehensive.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe question that\u00a0... malaria control experts must ask is not \"Which is worse, malaria or DDT?\" but rather \"What are the best tools to deploy for malaria control in a given situation, taking into account the on-the-ground challenges and needs, efficacy, cost, and collateral effects\u00a0\u2013 both positive and negative\u00a0\u2013 to human health and the environment, as well as the uncertainties associated with all these considerations?\"\nHans Herren &amp; Charles Mbogo\nCriticisms of a DDT \"ban\" often specifically reference the 1972 United States ban (with the erroneous implication that this constituted a worldwide ban and prohibited use of DDT in vector control). Reference is often made to \"Silent Spring\", even though Carson never pushed for a DDT ban. John Quiggin and Tim Lambert wrote, \"the most striking feature of the claim against Carson is the ease with which it can be refuted\".\nInvestigative journalist Adam Sarvana and others characterize these notions as \"myths\" promoted principally by Roger Bate of the pro-DDT advocacy group Africa Fighting Malaria (AFM).\nAlternatives.\nInsecticides.\nOrganophosphate and carbamate insecticides, e.g. malathion and bendiocarb, respectively, are more expensive than DDT per kilogram and are applied at roughly the same dosage. Pyrethroids such as deltamethrin are also more expensive than DDT, but are applied more sparingly (0.02\u20130.3\u00a0g/m2 vs 1\u20132\u00a0g/m2), so the net cost per house per treatment is about the same. DDT has one of the longest residual efficacy periods of any IRS insecticide, lasting 6 to 12 months. Pyrethroids will remain active for only 4 to 6 months, and organophosphates and carbamates remain active for 2 to 6 months. In many malaria-endemic countries, malaria transmission occurs year-round, meaning that the high expense of conducting a spray campaign (including hiring spray operators, procuring insecticides, and conducting pre-spray outreach campaigns to encourage people to be home and to accept the intervention) will need to occur multiple times per year for these shorter-lasting insecticides.\nIn 2019, the related compound difluorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DFDT) was described as a potentially more effective and therefore potentially safer alternative to DDT.\nNon-chemical vector control.\nBefore DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or curtailed in several tropical areas by removing or poisoning mosquito breeding grounds and larva habitats, for example by eliminating standing water. These methods have seen little application in Africa for more than half a century. According to CDC, such methods are not practical in Africa because \"\"Anopheles gambiae\", one of the primary vectors of malaria in Africa, breeds in numerous small pools of water that form due to rainfall\u00a0... It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict when and where the breeding sites will form, and to find and treat them before the adults emerge.\"\nThe relative effectiveness of IRS versus other malaria control techniques (e.g. bednets or prompt access to anti-malarial drugs) varies and is dependent on local conditions.\nA WHO study released in January 2008 found that mass distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets and artemisinin\u2013based drugs cut malaria deaths in half in malaria-burdened Rwanda and Ethiopia. IRS with DDT did not play an important role in mortality reduction in these countries.\nVietnam has enjoyed declining malaria cases and a 97% mortality reduction after switching in 1991 from a poorly funded DDT-based campaign to a program based on prompt treatment, bednets and pyrethroid group insecticides.\nIn Mexico, effective and affordable chemical and non-chemical strategies were so successful that the Mexican DDT manufacturing plant ceased production due to lack of demand.\nA review of fourteen studies in sub-Saharan Africa, covering insecticide-treated nets, residual spraying, chemoprophylaxis for children, chemoprophylaxis or intermittent treatment for pregnant women, a hypothetical vaccine and changing front\u2013line drug treatment, found decision making limited by the lack of information on the costs and effects of many interventions, the small number of cost-effectiveness analyses, the lack of evidence on the costs and effects of packages of measures and the problems in generalizing or comparing studies that relate to specific settings and use different methodologies and outcome measures. The two cost-effectiveness estimates of DDT residual spraying examined were not found to provide an accurate estimate of the cost-effectiveness of DDT spraying; the resulting estimates may not be good predictors of cost-effectiveness in current programs.\nHowever, a study in Thailand found the cost per malaria case prevented of DDT spraying (US$1.87) to be 21% greater than the cost per case prevented of lambda-cyhalothrin\u2013treated nets (US$1.54), casting some doubt on the assumption that DDT was the most cost-effective measure. The director of Mexico's malaria control program found similar results, declaring that it was 25% cheaper for Mexico to spray a house with synthetic pyrethroids than with DDT. However, another study in South Africa found generally lower costs for DDT spraying than for impregnated nets.\nA more comprehensive approach to measuring the cost-effectiveness or efficacy of malarial control would not only measure the cost in dollars, as well as the number of people saved, but would also consider ecological damage and negative human health impacts. One preliminary study found that it is likely that the detriment to human health approaches or exceeds the beneficial reductions in malarial cases, except perhaps in epidemics. It is similar to the earlier study regarding estimated theoretical infant mortality caused by DDT and subject to the criticism also mentioned earlier.\nA study in the Solomon Islands found that \"although impregnated bed nets cannot entirely replace DDT spraying without substantial increase in incidence, their use permits reduced DDT spraying\".\nA comparison of four successful programs against malaria in Brazil, India, Eritrea and Vietnam does not endorse any single strategy but instead states, \"Common success factors included conducive country conditions, a targeted technical approach using a package of effective tools, data-driven decision-making, active leadership at all levels of government, involvement of communities, decentralized implementation and control of finances, skilled technical and managerial capacity at national and sub-national levels, hands-on technical and programmatic support from partner agencies, and sufficient and flexible financing.\"\nDDT resistant mosquitoes may be susceptible to pyrethroids in some countries. However, pyrethroid resistance in \"Anopheles\" mosquitoes is on the rise with resistant mosquitoes found in multiple countries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column of a table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as for example height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set. Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files.\nIn the open data discipline, a data set is a unit used to measure the amount of information released in a public open data repository. The European data.europa.eu portal aggregates more than a million data sets.\nProperties.\nSeveral characteristics define a data set's structure and properties. These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various statistical measures applicable to them, such as standard deviation and kurtosis.\nThe values may be numbers, such as real numbers or integers, for example representing a person's height in centimeters, but may also be nominal data (i.e., not consisting of numerical values), for example representing a person's ethnicity. More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a level of measurement. For each variable, the values are normally all of the same kind. Missing values may exist, which must be indicated somehow.\nIn statistics, data sets usually come from actual observations obtained by sampling a statistical population, and each row corresponds to the observations on one element of that population. Data sets may further be generated by algorithms for the purpose of testing certain kinds of software. Some modern statistical analysis software such as SPSS still present their data in the classical data set fashion. If data is missing or suspicious an imputation method may be used to complete a data set.\nApplications and use cases.\nData sets are widely used across various fields to support data analysis, research, and decision-making. In the sciences, data sets provide the empirical foundation for studies in disciplines such as biology, physics, and social science, enabling discoveries in medicine, environmental science, and social research. In machine learning and artificial intelligence, data sets are essential for training, validating, and testing algorithms for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling. Governments and organizations publish open data sets to promote transparency, inform policy-making, and facilitate urban and social planning. The business sector uses data sets for market analysis, customer segmentation, and operational improvements. Additionally, healthcare relies on data sets for clinical research and improving patient outcomes. These varied applications demonstrate the critical role data sets play in enabling evidence-based insights and driving technological progress.\nClassics.\nSeveral classic data sets have been used extensively in the statistical literature:\nExample.\nLoading data sets using Python:\n$ pip install datasets\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ndataset = load_dataset(NAME OF DATASET)\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "8498", "revid": "50977797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8498", "title": "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "text": "American psychiatric classification\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; latest edition: \"DSM-5-TR\", published in March 2022) is a publication by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) for the classification of mental disorders using a common language and standard criteria. It is an internationally accepted manual on the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, though it may be used in conjunction with other documents. Other commonly used principal guides of psychiatry include the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD), and the \"Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual\". However, not all providers rely on the DSM-5 as a guide, since the ICD's mental disorder diagnoses are used around the world, and scientific studies often measure changes in symptom scale scores rather than changes in DSM-5 criteria to determine the real-world effects of mental health interventions.\nIt is used by researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policymakers. Some mental health professionals use the manual to determine and help communicate a patient's diagnosis after an evaluation. Hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies in the United States may require a DSM diagnosis for all patients with mental disorders. Health-care researchers use the DSM to categorize patients for research purposes.\nThe DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, as well as from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, while removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.\nRecent editions of the DSM have received praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnosis grounded in empirical evidence, as opposed to the theory-bound nosology (the branch of medical science that deals with the classification of diseases) used in DSM-III. However, it has also generated controversy and criticism, including ongoing questions concerning the reliability and validity of many diagnoses; the use of arbitrary dividing lines between mental illness and \"normality\"; possible cultural bias; and the medicalization of human distress. The APA itself has published that the inter-rater reliability is low for many disorders in the DSM-5, including major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\nDistinction from ICD.\nAn alternate, widely used classification publication is the \"International Classification of Diseases\" (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The ICD has a broader scope than the DSM, covering overall health as well as mental health; chapter 6 of the ICD specifically covers mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, while the DSM is the most popular diagnostic system for mental disorders in the US, the ICD is used more widely in Europe and other parts of the world, giving it a far larger reach than the DSM. An international survey of psychiatrists in sixty-six countries compared the use of the ICD-10 and DSM-IV. It found the former was more often used for clinical diagnosis while the latter was more valued for research. This may be because the DSM tends to put more emphasis on clear diagnostic criteria, while the ICD tends to put more emphasis on clinician judgement and avoiding diagnostic criteria unless they are independently validated. That is, the ICD descriptions of psychiatric disorders tend to be more qualitative information, such as general descriptions of what various disorders tend to look like. The DSM focuses more on quantitative and operationalized criteria; e.g., to be diagnosed with X disorder, one must fulfill 5 of 9 criteria for at least 6 months.\nSince 1980, every code that has been listed in the DSM has been an ICD-9 code. However, DSM-5, unlike previous versions of DSM, contains both ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Though recent editions of the DSM and ICD have become more similar due to collaborative agreements, each one contains information absent from the other. For instance, the two manuals contain overlapping but substantially different lists of recognized culture-bound syndromes. The ICD also tends to focus more on primary-care and low and middle-income countries, as opposed to the DSM's focus on secondary psychiatric care in high-income countries.\nAntecedents (1840\u20131949).\nCensus Office, AMA and ISI (1840\u20131911).\nThe initial impetus for developing a classification of mental disorders in the United States was the need to collect statistical information. The first official attempt was the 1840 census, which used a single category: \"idiocy/insanity\". Three years later, the American Statistical Association made an official protest to the U.S. House of Representatives, stating that \"the most glaring and remarkable errors are found in the statements respecting nosology, prevalence of insanity, blindness, deafness, and dumbness, among the people of this nation\", pointing out that, in many towns, African Americans were all marked as insane, and calling the statistics essentially useless.\nThe Association of Medical Superintendents of American Institutions for the Insane (\"The Superintendents' Association\") was formed in 1844.\nIn 1860, during the international statistical congress held in London, Florence Nightingale made a proposal that was to result in the development of the first international model of systematic collection of hospital data. \nIn 1872, the American Medical Association (AMA) published its \"Nomenclature of Diseases\", which included various \"Disorders of the Intellect\". However, its use was short-lived.\nEdward Jarvis and later Francis Amasa Walker helped expand the census, from two volumes in 1870 to twenty-five volumes in 1880.\nIn 1888, the Census Office published Frederick H. Wines' 582-page volume called \"Report on the Defective, Dependent, and Delinquent Classes of the Population of the United States, As Returned at the Tenth Census (June 1, 1880)\". Wines used seven categories of mental illness, which were also adopted by the Superintendents: dementia, dipsomania (uncontrollable craving for alcohol), epilepsy, mania, melancholia, monomania, and paresis.\nIn 1892, the Superintendents' Association expanded its membership to include other mental health workers, and renamed to the American Medico-Psychological Association (AMPA).\nIn 1893, a French physician, Jacques Bertillon, introduced the \"Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death\" at a congress of the International Statistical Institute (ISI) in Chicago. (The ISI had commissioned him to create it in 1891). A number of countries adopted the ISI's system. In 1898, the American Public Health Association (APHA) recommended that United States registrars also adopt the system.\nIn 1900, an ISI conference in Paris reformed the Bertillion Classification, and created the \"International List of Causes of Death\" (ILCD)\".\" Another conference would be held every ten years, and a new edition of the ILCD would be released. Five were ultimately issued. Non-fatal conditions were not included.\nIn 1903, New York's Bellevue Hospital published \"The Bellevue Hospital nomenclature of diseases and conditions\", which included a section on \"Diseases of the Mind\". Revisions were released in 1909 and 1911. It was produced with the assistance of the AMA and Bureau of the Census.\nAPA Statistical Manual (1917) and AMA Standard (1933).\nIn 1917, together with the National Commission on Mental Hygiene (now Mental Health America), the American Medico-Psychological Association developed a new guide for mental hospitals called the \"Statistical Manual for the Use of Institutions for the Insane\". This guide included twenty-two diagnoses. It would be revised several times by the Association, and by the tenth edition in 1942, was titled \"Statistical Manual for the Use of Hospitals of Mental Diseases\".\nIn 1921, the AMPA became the present American Psychiatric Association (APA).\nThe first edition of the DSM notes in its foreword: \"In the late twenties, each large teaching center employed a system of its own origination, no one of which met more than the immediate needs of the local institution.\"\nIn 1933, the AMA's general medical guide the \"Standard Classified Nomenclature of Disease\", (referred to as the \"Standard),\" was released. Along with the New York Academy of Medicine, the APA provided the psychiatric nomenclature subsection. It became well adopted in the US within two years. A major revision of the Statistical Manual was made in 1934, to bring it in line with the new Standard. A number of revisions of the Standard were produced, with the last in 1961.\nMedical 203 (1945).\nWorld War II saw the large-scale involvement of U.S. psychiatrists in the selection, processing, assessment, and treatment of soldiers. This moved the focus away from mental institutions and traditional clinical perspectives. The U.S. armed forces initially used the Standard, but found it lacked appropriate categories for many common conditions that troubled troops. The United States Navy made some minor revisions but \"the Army established a much more sweeping revision, abandoning the basic outline of the Standard and attempting to express present-day concepts of mental disturbance.\"\nUnder the direction of James Forrestal, a committee headed by psychiatrist Brigadier General William C. Menninger, with the assistance of the Mental Hospital Service, developed a new classification scheme in 1944 and 1945.\nIssued in War Department Technical Bulletin, Medical, 203 (TB MED 203); \"Nomenclature and Method of Recording Diagnoses\" was released shortly after the war in October 1945 under the auspices of the Office of the Surgeon General. It was reprinted in the Journal of Clinical Psychology for civilian use in July 1946 with the new title \"Nomenclature of Psychiatric Disorders and Reactions\". This system came to be known as \"Medical 203\".\nThis nomenclature eventually was adopted by all the armed forces, and \"assorted modifications of the Armed Forces nomenclature [were] introduced into many clinics and hospitals by psychiatrists returning from military duty.\" The Veterans Administration also adopted a slightly modified version of the standard in 1947.\nThe further developed \"Joint Armed Forces Nomenclature and Method of Recording Psychiatric Conditions\" was released in 1949.\nICD-6 (1948).\nIn 1948, the newly formed World Health Organization took over the maintenance of the ILCD. They greatly expanded it, included non-fatal conditions for the first time, and renamed it the \"International Statistical Classification of Diseases\" (ICD). The foreword to the DSM-I states the ICD-6 \"categorized mental disorders in rubrics similar to those of the Armed Forces nomenclature.\"\nEarly versions (20th century).\nDSM-I (1952).\nThe APA Committee on Nomenclature and Statistics was empowered to develop a version of Medical 203 specifically for use in the United States, to standardize the diverse and confused usage of different documents. In 1950, the APA committee undertook a review and consultation. It circulated an adaptation of Medical 203, the \"Standard\"'s nomenclature, and the VA system's modifications of the \"Standard\" to approximately 10% of APA members. 46% of members replied, with 93% approving the changes. After some further revisions, the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" was approved in 1951 and published in 1952. The structure and conceptual framework were the same as in Medical 203, and many passages of text were identical. The manual was 130 pages long and listed 106 mental disorders. These included several categories of \"personality disturbance\", generally distinguished from \"neurosis\" (nervousness, egodystonic).\nThe foreword to this edition describes itself as being a continuation of the \"Statistical Manual for the Use of Hospitals of Mental Diseases.\" Each item was given an ICD-6 equivalent code, where applicable.\nThe DSM-I centers on three classes of symptoms: psychotic, neurotic, and behavioral.\u00a0 Within each class of mental disorder, classifying information is provided to differentiate conditions with similar symptoms.\u00a0 Under each broad class of disorder (e.g. \"Psychoneurotic Disorders\" or \"Personality Disorders\"), all possible diagnoses are listed, generally from least to most severe. The 1952 DSM version also includes sections detailing how to record patients' disorders along with their demographic details.\u00a0 The form includes information like a patient's area of residence, admission status, discharge date/condition, and severity of disorder. See Figure 1. for the form that psychiatrists were asked to utilize for recording preliminary diagnostic information.\nFurthermore, the APA listed homosexuality in the DSM as a sociopathic personality disturbance. \"\", a large-scale 1962 study of homosexuality by Irving Bieber and other authors, was used to justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear of the opposite sex caused by traumatic parent\u2013child relationships. This view was influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study comparing the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a heroine to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until May 1974.\nDSM-II (1968).\nIn the 1960s, there were many challenges to the concept of mental illness itself. These challenges came from psychiatrists like Thomas Szasz, who argued mental illness was a myth used to disguise moral conflicts; from sociologists such as Erving Goffman, who said mental illness was another example of how society labels and controls non-conformists; from behavioural psychologists who challenged psychiatry's fundamental reliance on unobservable phenomena; and from gay rights activists who criticised the APA's listing of homosexuality as a mental disorder.\nThe APA was closely involved in the next significant revision of the mental disorder section of the ICD (version 8 in 1968). It decided to go ahead with a revision of the DSM, which was published in 1968. DSM-II was similar to DSM-I, listed 182 disorders, and was 134 pages long. The term \"reaction\" was dropped, but the term \"neurosis\" was retained. Both the DSM-I and the DSM-II reflected the predominant psychodynamic psychiatry, although both manuals also included biological perspectives and concepts from Kraepelin's system of classification. Symptoms were not specified in detail for specific disorders. Many were seen as reflections of broad underlying conflicts or maladaptive reactions to life problems that were rooted in a distinction between neurosis and psychosis (roughly, anxiety/depression broadly in touch with reality, as opposed to hallucinations or delusions disconnected from reality). Sociological and biological knowledge was incorporated, under a model that did not emphasize a clear boundary between normality and abnormality. The idea that personality disorders did not involve emotional distress was discarded.\nA study published in \"Science\" in 1973, the Rosenhan experiment, received much publicity and was viewed as an attack on the efficacy of psychiatric diagnosis.\nAn influential 1974 paper by Robert Spitzer and Joseph L. Fleiss demonstrated that the second edition of the DSM (DSM-II) was an unreliable diagnostic tool. Spitzer and Fleiss found that different practitioners using the DSM-II rarely agreed when diagnosing patients with similar problems. In reviewing previous studies of eighteen major diagnostic categories, Spitzer and Fleiss concluded that \"there are no diagnostic categories for which reliability is uniformly high. Reliability appears to be only satisfactory for three categories: mental deficiency, organic brain syndrome (but not its subtypes), and alcoholism. The level of reliability is no better than fair for psychosis and schizophrenia and is poor for the remaining categories\".\nSeventh printing of the DSM-II (1974).\nAs described by Ronald Bayer, a psychiatrist and gay rights activist, specific protests by gay rights activists against the APA began in 1970, when the organization held its convention in San Francisco. The activists disrupted the conference by interrupting speakers and shouting down and ridiculing psychiatrists who viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 1971, gay rights activist Frank Kameny worked with the Gay Liberation Front collective to demonstrate at the APA's convention. At the 1971 conference, Kameny grabbed the microphone and yelled: \"Psychiatry is the enemy incarnate. Psychiatry has waged a relentless war of extermination against us. You may take this as a declaration of war against you.\"\nThis gay activism occurred in the context of a broader anti-psychiatry movement that had come to the fore in the 1960s and was challenging the legitimacy of psychiatric diagnosis. Anti-psychiatry activists protested at the same APA conventions, with some shared slogans and intellectual foundations as gay activists.\nTaking into account data from researchers such as Alfred Kinsey and Evelyn Hooker, the seventh printing of the DSM-II, in 1974, no longer listed homosexuality as a category of disorder. After a vote by the APA trustees in 1973, and confirmed by the wider APA membership in 1974, the diagnosis was replaced with the category of \"sexual orientation disturbance\".\nDSM-III (1980).\nThe emergence of DSM-III represented a \"quantum leap\" in terms of the scale and reach of the manual. In 1974, the decision to revise the DSM was made, and psychiatrist Robert Spitzer was selected as chair of the task force. The initial impetus was to make the DSM nomenclature consistent with that of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). The revision took on a far wider mandate under the influence and control of Spitzer and his chosen committee members. One added goal was to improve the uniformity and validity of psychiatric diagnosis in the wake of a number of critiques, including the famous Rosenhan experiment. There was also felt a need to standardize diagnostic practices within the United States and with other countries, after research showed that psychiatric diagnoses differed between Europe and the United States. The establishment of consistent criteria was an attempt to facilitate the pharmaceutical regulatory process.\nThe criteria adopted for many of the mental disorders were influenced by the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) and Feighner Criteria, which had just been developed by a group of research-orientated psychiatrists based primarily at Washington University School of Medicine and the New York State Psychiatric Institute. However, the influence of clinical psychiatrists, themselves often working with psychoanalytic ideas, were still strong. Other criteria, and potential new categories of disorder, were established by debate, argument and consensus during meetings of the committee chaired by Spitzer. A key aim was to base categorization on colloquial English (which would be easier to use by federal administrative offices), rather than by assumption of cause, although its categorical approach still assumed each particular pattern of symptoms in a category reflected a particular underlying pathology (an approach described as \"neo-Kraepelinian\"). The psychodynamic view was marginalised, although still influential, in favor of a regulatory or legislative model that emphasised observable symptoms. A new \"multiaxial\" system attempted to yield a picture more amenable to a statistical population census, rather than a simple diagnosis. Spitzer argued \"mental disorders are a subset of medical disorders\", but the task force decided on this statement for the DSM: \"Each of the mental disorders is conceptualized as a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome.\" Personality disorders were placed on axis II along with \"mental retardation\".\nThe first draft of DSM-III was ready within a year. It introduced many new categories of disorder, while deleting or changing others. A number of unpublished documents discussing and justifying the changes have recently come to light. Field trials sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) were conducted between 1977 and 1979 to test the reliability of the new diagnoses. A controversy emerged regarding deletion of the concept of neurosis, a mainstream of psychoanalytic theory and therapy but seen as vague and unscientific by the DSM task force. Faced with enormous political opposition, DSM-III was in serious danger of not being approved by the APA Board of Trustees unless \"neurosis\" was included in some form; a political compromise reinserted the term in parentheses after the word \"disorder\" in some cases. Additionally, the diagnosis of ego-dystonic homosexuality replaced the DSM-II category of \"sexual orientation disturbance\". The gender identity disorder in children (GIDC) diagnosis was introduced in the DSM-III; prior to the DSM-III's publication in 1980, there was no diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.\nFinally published in 1980, DSM-III listed 265 diagnostic categories and was 494 pages long. It rapidly came into widespread international use and has been termed a revolution, or transformation, in psychiatry.\nWhen DSM-III was published, the developers made extensive claims about the reliability of the radically new diagnostic system they had devised, which relied on data from special field trials. However, according to a 1994 article by Stuart A. Kirk:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDSM-III-R (1987).\nIn 1987, DSM-III-R was published as a revision of the DSM-III, under the direction of Spitzer. Categories were renamed and reorganized, with significant changes in criteria. Six categories were deleted while others were added. Controversial diagnoses, such as Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder and Masochistic Personality Disorder, were considered and discarded. (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder was later reincorporated in the DSM-5, published in 2013). \"Ego-dystonic homosexuality\" was also removed and was largely subsumed under \"sexual disorder not otherwise specified\", which could include \"persistent and marked distress about one's sexual orientation.\" Altogether, the DSM-III-R contained 292 diagnoses and was 567 pages long. Further efforts were made for the diagnoses to be purely descriptive, although the introductory text stated for at least some disorders, \"particularly the Personality Disorders, the criteria require much more inference on the part of the observer\" [page\u00a0xxiii].\nDSM-IV (1994).\nIn 1994, DSM-IV was published, listing 410 disorders in 886 pages. The task force was chaired by Allen Frances and was overseen by a steering committee of twenty-seven people, including four psychologists. The steering committee created thirteen work groups of five to sixteen members, each work group having about twenty advisers in addition. The work groups conducted a three-step process: first, each group conducted an extensive literature review of their diagnoses; then, they requested data from researchers, conducting analyses to determine which criteria required change, with instructions to be conservative; finally, they conducted multi-center field trials relating diagnoses to clinical practice. A major change from previous versions was the inclusion of a clinical-significance criterion to almost half of all the categories, which required symptoms causing \"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\". Some personality-disorder diagnoses were deleted or moved to the appendix.\nDSM-IV definitions.\nThe DSM-IV characterizes a mental disorder as \"a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress or disability or with a significant increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom\". It also notes that \"although this manual provides a classification of mental disorders it must be admitted that no definition adequately specifies precise boundaries for the concept of 'mental disorder.\"\nDSM-IV categorization.\nThe DSM-IV is a categorical classification system. The categories are prototypes, and a patient with a close approximation to the prototype is said to have that disorder. DSM-IV states, \"there is no assumption each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries\" but isolated, low-grade, and non-criterion (unlisted for a given disorder) symptoms are not given importance. Qualifiers are sometimes used: for example, to specify mild, moderate, or severe forms of a disorder. For nearly half the disorders, symptoms must be sufficient to cause \"clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\", although DSM-IV-TR removed the distress criterion from tic disorders and several of the paraphilias due to their egosyntonic nature. Each category of disorder has a numeric code taken from the ICD coding system, used for health service (including insurance) administrative purposes.\nDSM-IV multi-axial system.\nThe DSM-IV was organized into a five-part axial system:\nDSM-IV sourcebooks.\nThe DSM-IV does not specifically cite its sources, but there are four volumes of \"sourcebooks\" intended to be APA's documentation of the guideline development process and supporting evidence, including literature reviews, data analyses, and field trials. The sourcebooks have been said to provide important insights into the character and quality of the decisions that led to the production of DSM-IV, and the scientific credibility of contemporary psychiatric classification.\nDSM-IV-TR (2000).\nA text revision of DSM-IV, titled DSM-IV-TR, was published in 2000. The diagnostic categories were unchanged as were the diagnostic criteria for all but nine diagnoses. The majority of the text was unchanged; however, the text of two disorders, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified and Asperger's disorder, had significant and/or multiple changes made. An editorial change in DSM-IV's description of PDDNOS had had an unintended effect on the definition of this disorder, which was revised in DSM-IV-TR. The text for Asperger's disorder was practically entirely rewritten. Most other changes were to the associated features sections of diagnoses that contained additional information such as lab findings, demographic information, prevalence, and course. Also, some diagnostic codes were changed to maintain consistency with ICD-9-CM.\nDSM-5 (2013).\nThe fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the DSM-5, was approved by the Board of Trustees of the APA on December 1, 2012. Published on May 18, 2013, the DSM-5 contains extensively revised diagnoses and, in some cases, broadens diagnostic definitions while narrowing definitions in other cases. The DSM-5 is the first major edition of the manual in 20 years. DSM-5, and the abbreviations for all previous editions, are registered trademarks owned by the American Psychiatric Association.\nA significant change in the fifth edition is the deletion of the subtypes of schizophrenia: paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual. The deletion of the subsets of autistic spectrum disorder\u00a0\u2013 namely, Asperger's syndrome, classic autism, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified\u00a0\u2013 was also implemented, with specifiers regarding intensity: mild, moderate, and severe.\nSeverity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, with three levels:\nDuring the revision process, the APA website periodically listed several sections of the DSM-5 for review and discussion.\nThe National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), which is responsible for creating and publishing board exams for medical students around the United States, conforms to the use of DSM-5 criteria.\nFuture revisions and updates.\nAfter the release of the fifth edition, the APA communicated that they intended to add subsequent revisions more often, to keep up with research in the field. It is notable that DSM-5 uses Arabic rather than Roman numerals. Beginning with DSM-5, the APA planned to use decimals to identify incremental updates (e.g., DSM-5.1, DSM-5.2) and whole numbers for new editions (e.g., DSM-5, DSM-6), similar to the scheme used for software versioning.\nDSM-5-TR (2022).\nA revision of DSM-5, titled DSM-5-TR, was published in March 2022, updating diagnostic criteria and ICD-10-CM codes. The diagnostic criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder was changed, along with adding entries for prolonged grief disorder, unspecified mood disorder and stimulant-induced mild neurocognitive disorder. Prolonged grief disorder, which had been present in the ICD-11, had criteria agreed upon by consensus in a one day in-person workshop sponsored by the APA. A 2022 study found that higher rates of diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder in the ICD-11 could be explained by the DSM-5-TR criteria requiring symptoms persist for 12 months, and the ICD-11 requiring only 6 months.\nThree review groups for sex and gender, culture and suicide, along with an \"ethnoracial equity and inclusion work group\" were involved in the creation of the DSM-5-TR which led to additional sections for each mental disorder discussing sex and gender, racial and cultural variations, and adding diagnostic codes for specifying levels of suicidality and nonsuicidal self-injury for mental disorders.\nOther changed disorders included:\nDSM Library.\nThe APA have supplemented the DSM with supporting works, collectively forming the \"DSM Library.\" As of 2022, the other books in the library are \"DSM-5 Handbook of Differential Diagnosis\", \"DSM-5 Clinical Cases\", \"DSM-5 Handbook on the Cultural Formulation Interview\" and \"Gu\u00eda De Consulta De Los Criterios Diagn\u00f3sticos Del DSM-5\".\nCriticisms.\nMany criticisms have been leveled against the DSM and its usefulness as a diagnostic manual.\nReliability and validity.\nThe revisions of the DSM from the 3rd Edition forward have been mainly concerned with diagnostic reliability\u00a0\u2013 the degree to which different diagnosticians agree on a diagnosis. Henrik Walter argued that psychiatry as a science can only advance if diagnosis is reliable. If clinicians and researchers frequently disagree about the diagnosis of a patient, then research into the causes and effective treatments of those disorders cannot advance. Hence, diagnostic reliability was a major concern of DSM-III. When the diagnostic reliability problem was thought to be solved, subsequent editions of the DSM were concerned mainly with \"tweaking\" the diagnostic criteria. Neither the issue of reliability or validity was settled.\nIn 2013, shortly before the publication of DSM-5, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Thomas R. Insel, declared that the agency would no longer fund research projects that relied exclusively on DSM diagnostic criteria, due to its lack of validity. Insel questioned the validity of the DSM classification scheme because \"diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms\" as opposed to \"collecting the genetic, imaging, physiologic, and cognitive data to see how all the data \u2013 not just the symptoms \u2013 cluster and how these clusters relate to treatment response.\"\nField trials of DSM-5 brought the debate of reliability back into the limelight, as the diagnoses of some disorders showed poor reliability. For example, a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, a common mental illness, had a poor reliability kappa statistic of 0.28, indicating that clinicians frequently disagreed on diagnosing this disorder in the same patients. The most reliable diagnosis was major neurocognitive disorder, with a kappa of 0.78.\nDiagnosis based on superficial symptoms.\nBy design, the DSM is primarily concerned with the signs and symptoms of mental disorders, rather than the underlying causes. It claims to collect these disorders based on statistical or clinical patterns. As such, it has been compared to a naturalist's field guide to birds, with similar advantages and disadvantages. The lack of a causative or explanatory basis, however, is not specific to the DSM, but rather reflects a general lack of pathophysiological understanding of psychiatric disorders. Proponents argue this absence of explanatory classification is necessary, but it presents a problem for researchers as it results in the grouping of individuals who may have little in common except superficial criteria. As DSM-III chief architect Robert Spitzer and DSM-IV editor Michael First outlined in 2005, \"little progress has been made toward understanding the pathophysiological processes and cause of mental disorders. If anything, the research has shown the situation is even more complex than initially imagined, and we believe not enough is known to structure the classification of psychiatric disorders according to etiology.\"\nWhile there is generally a lack of consensus on underlying causation for most psychiatric disorders, some proponents of specific psychopathological paradigms have faulted the DSM for failing to incorporate evidence from other disciplines. For instance, evolutionary psychology distinguishes between genuine cognitive malfunctions and malfunctions due to psychological adaptations (that is learned behaviors may be adaptive in one context but maladaptive in another). However, this distinction is one that is challenged within general psychology.\nThere is also criticism of the strong operationalist viewpoint of the DSM. The DSM relies on operational definitions, which means that intuitive concepts like depression are defined by specific measurable criteria (observable behavior, specific timelines). Some have argued that instead of replacing metaphysical terms like \"desire\" or \"purpose\" the DSM chose to legitimize them by giving them operational definitions. However, this may have served only to provide a \"reassurance fetish\" for mainstream methodological practice, rather than representing a substantial and meaningful alteration of mainstream psychiatric practice.\nA central problem with the use of superficial symptoms is that psychiatry deals with the phenomena of consciousness, which adds much more complexity than the somatic symptoms and signs used by most of medicine. A 2013 review published in the \"European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience\" gives the example of the problem of superficial characterization of psychiatric signs and symptoms. If a patient says they \"feel depressed, sad, or down\" there are actually a wide variety of underlying experiences they could be referencing: \"not only depressed mood but also, for instance, irritation, anger, loss of meaning, varieties of fatigue, ambivalence, ruminations of different kinds, hyper-reflectivity, thought pressure, psychological anxiety, varieties of depersonalization, and even voices with negative content, and so forth.\" This criticism is especially pertinent to the structured interview, as simple \"yes or no\" questions may not be specific enough to truly confirm or deny the diagnostic criterion at issue. That is, whether a patient says yes or no will rely on their own understanding of the meaning of the various words in the question as well as their own interpretation of their experience. There is thus danger in being overconfident in the face value of the answers. The authors of the 2013 review give an example: A patient who was being administered the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV Axis I Disorders denied thought insertion, but during a \"conversational, phenomenological interview\", a semi-structured interview tailored to the patient, the same patient admitted to experiencing thought insertion, along with a delusional elaboration. The authors suggested 2 reasons for this discrepancy: either the patient did not \"recognize his own experience in the rather blunt, implicitly either/or formulation of the structured-interview question\", or the experience did not \"fully articulate itself\" until the patient started talking about his experiences.\nObscuring root causes.\nEconomic causes.\nThe DSM-5 has been criticized for overlooking capitalism's interconnectivity with pathology. One example is the development and treatment of diagnoses: around 69% of psychiatrists involved in the development of the DSM-5 were reported to have financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. These ties situate many care services within the medical-industrial complex, a framework that prioritizes profit instead of the care of individuals. Lane found the medical-industrial complex intertwined with setting the parameters to diagnose conditions such as social anxiety disorder. Other authors have supported similar findings. Kincaid and Sullivan estimate that the cost of the industry surrounding diagnosis will rise to around six trillion dollars by 2030.\nScholars differ in the extent of capitalism's influence on diagnosis. Davies supports the social model of disability in explaining that diagnosis at present relies on considering conditions a consequence of a \"broken brain.\" His wider logic on mental illness in response to societal issues problematizes diagnosis as a tool of the . His previous book, \"Cracked\", demonstrates the market interactions within the , as diagnosis becomes a source for monetization.\nOthers find that the dependency of patients on their psychiatric care providers makes the industry vulnerable to economic exploitation under capitalism. These individuals argue that diagnosis is manipulated, but not caused, by capitalistic forces. Academics have critiqued the directness of the association between the medical model, capitalism, and diagnosis, but generally agree that characteristics of the capitalist system contribute to poor mental health.\nInstitutional causes.\nDiagnoses of mental conditions have been used to obscure institutional practices of discrimination. Late nineteenth-century diagnoses of white women with hysteria, for instance, were said to be caused by \"overcivilization,\" shaped by racially discriminatory Social Darwinism. Similarly, American physician Samuel Cartwright coined \"drapetomania\" in 1851 as a mental condition which \"caused\" slaves to escape captivity. In the present day, Brinkmann finds that \"contemporary diagnostic cultures,\" whereby humans assess their conditions through a psychiatric lens, can \"risk losing sight of the larger historical and social forces that affect [their] lives.\" Contemporary diagnostic cultures help explain how diagnosis reflect larger historical biases.\nCritics have argued that the DSM-5's criteria pathologize a wide range of people with distress or impairment. Chapman et al. discuss the implications for obscuring distress in the incarceration and confinement of \"intellectually disabled\" populations; they argue that \"differentiation based on psychiatric and intellectual disability\" is arbitrarily set and altered based on capitalism's needs for \"mobile and free workers.\" Metzl demonstrates that the shifting diagnostic parameters of schizophrenia became a method for institutionalizing Black men during the Civil Rights Movement. In sum, those who have experienced \"domination\" or \"exploitation\" based on an identity trait are more likely to be pathologized through diagnosis.\nOverdiagnosis.\nAllen Frances, an outspoken critic of DSM-5, states that \"normality is an endangered species,\" because of \"fad diagnoses\" and an \"epidemic\" of over-diagnosing, and suggests that the \"DSM-5 threatens to provoke several more [epidemics].\" Some researchers state that changes in diagnostic criteria, following each published version of the DSM, reduce thresholds for a diagnosis, which results in increases in prevalence rates for ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. Bruchm\u00fcller, et al. (2012) suggest that as a factor that may lead to overdiagnosis are situations when the clinical judgment of the diagnostician regarding a diagnosis (ADHD) is affected by heuristics.\nDividing lines.\nDespite caveats in the introduction to the DSM, it has long been argued that its system of classification makes unjustified categorical distinctions between disorders and uses arbitrary cut-offs between normal and abnormal. A 2009 psychiatric review noted that attempts to demonstrate natural boundaries between related DSM syndromes, or between a common DSM syndrome and normality, have failed. Some argue that rather than a categorical approach, a fully dimensional, spectrum or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evidence.\nIn addition, it is argued that the current approach based on exceeding a threshold of symptoms does not adequately take into account the context in which a person is living, and to what extent there is internal disorder of an individual versus a psychological response to adverse situations. The DSM does include a step (\"Axis IV\") for outlining \"Psychosocial and environmental factors contributing to the disorder\" once someone is diagnosed with that particular disorder.\nBecause an individual's degree of impairment is often not correlated with symptom counts and can stem from various individual and social factors, the DSM's standard of distress or disability can often produce false positives. On the other hand, individuals who do not meet symptom counts may nevertheless experience comparable distress or disability in their life.\nCultural bias.\nPsychiatrists have argued that published diagnostic standards rely on an exaggerated interpretation of neurophysiological findings and so understate the scientific importance of social-psychological variables. Advocating a more culturally sensitive approach to psychology, critics such as Carl Bell and Marcello Maviglia contend that researchers and service-providers often discount the cultural and ethnic diversity of individuals. In addition, current diagnostic guidelines have been criticized as having a fundamentally Euro-American outlook. Although these guidelines have been widely implemented, opponents argue that even when a diagnostic criterion-set is accepted across different cultures, it does not necessarily indicate that the underlying constructs have any validity within those cultures; even reliable application can only demonstrate consistency, not legitimacy. Cross-cultural psychiatrist Arthur Kleinman contends that Western bias is ironically illustrated in the introduction of cultural factors to the DSM-IV: the fact that disorders or concepts from non-Western or non-mainstream cultures are described as \"culture-bound\", whereas standard psychiatric diagnoses are given no cultural qualification whatsoever, is to Kleinman revelatory of an underlying assumption that Western cultural phenomena are universal. Other cross-cultural critics largely share Kleinman's negative view toward the culture-bound syndrome, common responses included both disappointment over the large number of documented non-Western mental disorders still left out, and frustration that even those included were often misinterpreted or misrepresented.\nMainstream psychiatrists have also been dissatisfied with these new culture-bound diagnoses, although not for the same reasons. Robert Spitzer, a lead architect of DSM-III, has held the opinion that the addition of cultural formulations was an attempt to placate cultural critics, and that they lack any scientific motivation or support. Spitzer also posits that the new culture-bound diagnoses are rarely used in practice, maintaining that the standard diagnoses apply regardless of the culture involved. In general, the mainstream psychiatric opinion remains that if a diagnostic category is valid, cross-cultural factors are either irrelevant or are only significant to specific symptom presentations.\nHistorically, the DSM tended to avoid issues involving religion; the DSM-5 relaxed this attitude somewhat.\nMedicalization and financial conflicts of interest.\nThere was extensive analysis and comment on DSM-IV (published in 1994) in the years leading up to the 2013 publication of DSM-5. It was alleged that the way the categories of DSM-IV were structured, as well as the substantial expansion of the number of categories within it, represented increasing medicalization of human nature, very possibly attributable to disease mongering by psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies, the power and influence of the latter having grown dramatically in recent decades. In 2005, then APA President Steven Sharfstein released a statement in which he conceded that psychiatrists had \"allowed the biopsychosocial model to become the bio-bio-bio model\". It was reported that of the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, roughly half had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry during the period 1989\u20132004, raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest. The same article concluded that the connections between panel members and the drug companies were particularly strong involving those diagnoses where drugs are the first line of treatment, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, where 100% of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry.\nWilliam Glasser referred to DSM-IV as having \"phony diagnostic categories\", arguing that \"it was developed to help psychiatrists \u2013 to help them make money\". A 2012 article in \"The New York Times\" commented sharply that DSM-IV (then in its 18th year), through copyrights held closely by the APA, had earned the Association over $100\u00a0million.\nHowever, although the number of identified diagnoses had increased by more than 200% (from 106 in DSM-I to 365 in DSM-IV-TR), psychiatrists such as Zimmerman and Spitzer argued that this almost entirely represented greater specification of the forms of pathology, thereby allowing better grouping of similar patients.\nPotential harm of labels.\nA core function of the DSM is the categorization of people's experiences into diagnoses based on symptoms. However, there is disagreement about the use of diagnoses as labels. Some individuals are relieved to find they have a recognized condition that they can apply a name to, and this has led to many people self-diagnosing. Others, however, question the accuracy of diagnosis, or feel they have been given a label that invites social stigma and discrimination (the terms \"mentalism\" and \"sanism\" have been used to describe such discriminatory treatment).\nDiagnoses can become internalized and affect an individual's self-identity, and some psychotherapists have found that the healing process can be inhibited and symptoms can worsen as a result. Some members of the psychiatric survivors movement (more broadly the consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement) actively campaign against their diagnoses, or the assumed implications, or against the DSM system in general. Additionally, it has been noted that the DSM often uses definitions and terminology that are inconsistent with a recovery model, and such content can erroneously imply excess psychopathology (e.g. multiple \"comorbid\" diagnoses) or chronicity.\nCritiques of DSM-5.\nPsychiatrist Allen Frances has been critical of proposed revisions to the DSM\u20135. In a 2012 \"New York Times\" editorial, Frances warned that if this DSM version is issued unamended by the APA, \"it will medicalize normality and result in a glut of unnecessary and harmful drug prescription.\"\nIn a December 2012, blog post on \"Psychology Today\", Frances provides his \"list of DSM 5's ten most potentially harmful changes:\"\nA group of 25 psychiatrists and researchers, among whom were Frances and Thomas Szasz, have published debates on what they see as the six most essential questions in psychiatric diagnosis:\nIn 2011, psychologist Brent Robbins co-authored a national letter for the Society for Humanistic Psychology that has brought thousands into the public debate about the DSM. Over 15,000 individuals and mental health professionals have signed a petition in support of the letter. Thirteen other APA divisions have endorsed the petition. Robbins has noted that under the new guidelines, certain responses to grief could be labeled as pathological disorders, instead of being recognized as being normal human experiences.\nCultural responses to the DSM.\nThere are several works written in recent years by scholars of the disabled community that specifically critique the cultural impact of the DSM-5. These pieces criticize the DSM-5 from different cultural perspectives, integrating the experiences of disabled people identifying as crip, feminists, Asian Americans, Black Americans and other marginalized viewpoints.\n\"DSM CRIP\".\nDSM CRIP is a collection of essays by various authors that explore the critiques of the DSM-5 from feminist and crip perspectives. These essays tackle the critiques of the DSM using specific diagnoses\u00a0such as gender dysphoria, transvestic disorder, complex somatic symptom disorder, hypoactive sexual desire disorder, schizophrenia and autism. These are used as case studies to tackle the topics of the potential harm of labels, overmedicalization, overdiagnosis, pathologizing normality and various other critiques informed by the feminist and crip lens.\n\"Open in Emergency\".\nOpen in Emergency is a multimedia collaborative project of the Asian American Literary Review that takes the lens of an Asian American Experience and redefines wellness in terms of care instead of focusing on diagnosis, unlike the original DSM V.\u00a0This included mock versions of DSM diagnoses such as gender dysphoria, social anxiety disorder and cannabis use disorder that mean to recharacterize the disorders under the lens of wellness and care. The project was said to contextualize mental disorders with their relationship to structures of power like patriarchy, colonialism and violence (here).\n\"The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia became a Black disease\".\nThe Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia became a Black disease is a critically acclaimed book that was written to analyze the history of schizophrenia and how perceptions of the condition have changed. In this book, Metzl shows how the condition of schizophrenia was experienced against the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement. This book was recognized by the Disability Studies Quarterly academic journal as an excellent analysis of schizophrenia's link to black history.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is located on the Swahili coast. With a population of over 7 million people, Dar es Salaam is the largest city in East Africa by population and the fifth-largest in Africa. Dar es Salaam is an important economic centre and one of the fastest-growing cities in the world. Experts predict that the city's population will grow to over 10 million before 2030.\nThe city was founded in the mid-19th century. It was the main administrative and commercial centre of German East Africa, Tanganyika, and Tanzania. The decision was made in 1974 to move the capital to Dodoma which was officially completed in 1996.\nDar es Salaam is Tanzania's most prominent city for arts, fashion, media, film, television, and finance. It is the capital of the co-extensive Dar es Salaam Region, one of Tanzania's 31 administrative regions, and consists of five districts: Kinondoni in the north; Ilala in the centre; Ubungo and Temeke in the south; and Kigamboni in the east across the Kurasini estuary.\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century, 'Mzizima (Swahili for \"healthy town\") was a coastal fishing village on the periphery of Indian Ocean trade routes. In 1865 or 1866, Sultan Majid bin Said of Zanzibar began building a new city very close to Mzizima and named it Dar es Salaam. The name is commonly translated from Arabic as \"abode (home) of peace\", from \"dar\" (\"house\"), and \"es salaam\" (\"of peace\"). Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887 when the German East Africa Company established a station there. The town's growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of German East Africa and industrial expansion following the construction of the Central Railway Line in the early 1900s.\nIn the East African campaign of World War I, British and Empire forces captured German East Africa. The Royal Navy bombarded the city with the monitor on 21 July 1916 and battleship on 21 August. The German colonial authorities surrendered the city on 3 September. German East Africa became the British Tanganyika Territory.\nDar es Salaam remained the administrative and commercial centre. Under British indirect rule, European areas such as Oyster Bay and African areas (e.g., Kariakoo and Ilala) developed separately from the city centre. The city's population also included a large number of workers from British India, many of whom came to take advantage of trade and commercial opportunities. After World War II, Dar es Salaam experienced a period of rapid growth.\nPolitical developments, including the formation and growth of the Tanganyika African National Union, led to Tanganyika's independence from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to serve as its capital, even when Tanganyika and the People's Republic of Zanzibar merged to form Tanzania in 1964. In 1973, provisions were made to relocate the capital to Dodoma, a more centrally located city in the interior. The relocation process to Dodoma was completed, although Dar es Salaam continued to be the location of most government offices.\nIn 1967, the Tanzanian government declared the \"ujamaa\" policy, which made Tanzania lean towards socialism. The move hampered the potential growth of the city as the government encouraged people not to move into cities and instead remain in Ujamaa socialist villages. By the 1980s, the policy failed to combat the increasing poverty and hunger that Tanzania faced, and had delayed necessary development. This situation led to the liberalisation policy of the 1980s that essentially ended socialism and silenced its proponents within Tanzania's government through political repression.\nUntil the late 1990s, Dar es Salaam was not regarded in the same echelon as Africa's leading cities like Cairo, Nairobi, Johannesburg, Lagos, or Addis Ababa. During the 2000s, businesses opened and prospered; growth expanded in the construction sector, with new multi-storey buildings, bridges and roads; Tanzanian banks headquartered in the city became better regulated; and the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange expanded. The port is prominent for entrepot trade with landlocked countries like Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, and the eastern portion of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city's skyline features tall buildings, among them the 35-storey PSPF Tower (finished in 2015) and the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) Tower, the tallest in the country (completed in 2016).\nA number of historical buildings and elements of urban planning, such as parts of the harbour and streets going back to colonial times, still exist. The Old Boma, one of the city's oldest buildings, was built in 1866\u201367 by Majid bin Said, sultan of Zanzibar, and enlarged under German rule. The Botanical Gardens now are close to the National Museum of Tanzania. The present-day State House goes back to Majid bin Said, and were the seat of the German and later the British colonial governments. Along with the Azania Front Lutheran Church, built between 1899 and 1902, and the Roman Catholic St. Joseph's Cathedral, constructed around the same period, Ocean Road Hospital are early historical buildings in Dar es Salaam.\nGeography.\nDar es Salaam is located at 6\u00b048'\u00a0S, 39\u00b017'\u00a0E (\u22126.8000, 39.2833), on a natural harbour on the coast of East Africa, with sandy beaches in some areas.\nDistricts of Dar es Salaam region.\nDar es Salaam Region is divided into five administrative districts, four of which are governed by municipal councils that are affiliated with the city's suburbs or wards.\nKinondoni.\nKinondoni is the most populated of the districts. It houses half of the city's population and several high-income suburbs.\nIlala.\nThe administrative district of Ilala contains almost all government offices, ministries, and the Central Business District. It is the transportation hub of the city, as the Julius Nyerere International Airport, Central Railway Station and Tazara Railway Station are all within the district's boundaries. The residential areas are mainly middle- to high-income, among them:\nTemeke.\nTemeke is the main industrial district of the city, where manufacturing (both heavy and light industry) is located. To the east is the Port of Dar es Salaam, the largest port in the country. Temeke is believed to have the largest concentration of low-income residents due to industry. It is home to military and police officers as well as port officials.\nUbungo.\nThe Ubungo terminal serves as a transportation link to most large Dar es Salaam urban nodes. The narrow-gauge commuter rail runs from there to the city centre, with ten level crossings along the route.\nThis district is characterised with a lot of potential social and economic centres such as industries i.e. Urafiki textile industry, bus station and various institutes and universities such as National Institute of Transport(NIT)\nKigamboni.\nKigamboni (also known as South Beach), a beachfront suburb on a peninsula, is home to an economically diverse population. Access to the suburb is mainly by ferry, although the Kigamboni Bridge provides an alternative.\nClimate.\nDar es Salaam experiences tropical climatic conditions, typified by hot and humid weather throughout much of the year due to its proximity to the equator and the warm Indian Ocean. It has a tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Aw\"/\"As\"). Annual rainfall is approximately , and in a normal year there are two rainy seasons: the \"long rains\" in April and May, and the \"short rains\" in November and December.\nClimate change.\nA 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a \"moderate\" scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Dar es Salaam in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Barquisimeto in Venezuela. The annual temperature and temperatures of the warmest month would increase by , while the temperature of the coldest month would go down by . According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.\nMoreover, according to the 2022 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, Dar es Salaam is one of 12 major African cities (Abidjan, Alexandria, Algiers, Cape Town, Casablanca, Dakar, Dar es Salaam, Durban, Lagos, Lom\u00e9, Luanda and Maputo) which would be the most severely affected by the future sea level rise. It estimates that they would collectively sustain cumulative damages of US$65 billion under RCP 4.5 and US$86.5 billion for the high-emission scenario RCP 8.5 by the year 2050. Additionally, RCP 8.5 combined with the hypothetical impact from marine ice sheet instability at high levels of warming would involve up to US$137.5 billion in damages, while the additional accounting for the \"low-probability, high-damage events\" may increase aggregate risks to US$187 billion for the \"moderate\" RCP4.5, US$206 billion for RCP8.5 and US$397 billion under the high-end ice sheet instability scenario. Since sea level rise would continue for about 10,000 years under every scenario of climate change, future costs of sea level rise would only increase, especially without adaptation measures.\nGovernment.\nIn his 1979 journal \"A Modern History of Tanganyika\", historian John Iliffe wrote, \"In 1949 the town became a municipality...[with] four honourable nominated Town Councillors who elected a Mayor.\" According to \"Associational Life in African Cities: Popular Responses to the Urban Crisis\", published in 2001: \"Until June 1996, Dar es Salaam was managed by the Dar es Salaam City Council...the highest policy-making body in the city.\" As of 2017, Paul Makonda serves as the commissioner of Dar es Salaam Region.\nDemographics.\nDar es Salaam is the most populous city in Tanzania and the fifth most populous in Africa. In 2020, the population was estimated to be 8 million. Muslims make up 70% of the population in Dar es Salaam.\nWhen the 2012 national census was taken, the city had a population of 4,364,541, about ten percent of the country's total. The average private household size was 3.9 persons compared to the national average of 4.7. Less than half of the city's residents were married, with a rate lower than any other region in the country. The literacy rate in the city was 96%, while the national average was 78%. Between the 2002 and 2012 censuses, the city's 5.6% average annual growth rate was the highest in the country.\nMore than three-quarters of the city's population live in informal settlements. In 2018, Dar es Salaam scored 0.699 (medium category) on the Human Development Index (HDI). The city's HDI has increased every year since 1992, and it ranked higher than any other region in the country except for one.\nDar es Salaam is the second-fastest-growing city in the world and could have a population as high as 15.9 million by 2030. The population was estimated at 20,000 in 1900, 93,000 in 1957 and 273,000 in 1967.\nEconomy and infrastructure.\nDar es Salaam is Tanzania's most important city for both business and government. The city contains high concentrations of trade and other services and manufacturing compared to other parts of the country, which has about 65 percent of its population in rural areas. Downtown includes small businesses, many of which are run by traders and proprietors whose families originated in the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent\u2014areas of the world with which the settlements of the Tanzanian coast have had long-standing trading relations.\nThe Dar es Salaam Central Business District is the largest in Tanzania and comprises the Kisutu, Kivukoni, Upanga and Kariakoo areas. The downtown area is located in the Ilala district. Kivukoni is home to the Tanzania Central Bank, The Bank of Tanzania, the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and the city's important Magogoni fish market. With businesses and offices, Kisutu is the location of Dar es Salaam central railway station, the PSPF Towers, and the TPA Tower.\nDar es Salaam is undergoing major construction and development. The 35-storey PSPF Twin Towers are the second tallest building in the city and the country. The city has major infrastructural challenges, including an outdated transport system and occasional power rationing.\nFinancial services.\nThe Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) is the country's first stock market. The headquarters of the Natural Gas Revenue Fund is also here.\nRetail.\nDar es Salaam hosts the Mlimani City shopping mall, the City Mall in the Kisutu area, Quality Center Mall, GSM Pugu Shopping Mall, GSM Msasani Mall, and Dar Free Market Mall.\nTransportation.\nOn a natural harbour on the Indian Ocean, Dar es Salaam is one of the hubs of the Tanzanian transportation system, as the main railways and several highways originate in or near the city to provide convenient transportation for commuters.\nLocal public transport.\nPublic minibus share taxis (\"dala dala\") are the most common form of transport in Dar es Salaam and are often found at the major bus terminals of Makumbusho, Ubungo and other areas of the city. However, since the introduction of the motorcycle transit business known as \"bodaboda\", most people prefer it, allowing them to get into the city faster as compared with the minibuses, which encounter heavy traffic. Other types of transport include motorcycles and bajaj (auto rickshaws).\nBus.\nThe government has been introducing a metro bus system, Dar es Salaam bus rapid transit (\"mwendo kasi\" in Kiswahili). The metro buses are managed by UDA-RT, a partnership between Usafiri Dar es Salaam (UDA) and the government.\nThe bus rapid-transit system Phase 1 has been completed by UDA-RT and began operation on 10 May 2016. The first section runs between Kimara in the northwest to Kivukoni on the northern headland of the harbour. Phase 1 was funded by the World Bank, African Development Bank and the Tanzanian government.\nMetro.\nDar es Salaam will have a metro system, currently undergoing a feasibility study conducted by Mota-Engil and Dar Rapid Transit Agency.\nMaritime transport.\nPort.\nThe Port of Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's busiest, handling 90% of the country's cargo. It is located in the Kurasini administrative ward of Temeke District southeast of the city's central business district. Due to a huge influx of cargo and the slow pace of expansion, a new cargo port northwest of Dar es Salaam is proposed at Bagamoyo.\nFerry.\nMV \"Kigamboni\" ferries run between southeast of Kivukoni and northwest of Kigamboni in Dar es Salaam.\nRailway.\nDar es Salaam commuter rail.\nTravel to urban and suburban parts of the city is provided by the Dar es Salaam commuter rail.\nIntra-city railway.\nTanzania Railways operates the Central Line from Dar es Salaam west to Kigoma.\nInternational railway.\nThe city also hosts the head office of Tanzania\u2013Zambia Railways Authority (TAZARA) built in the late 1960s to early 1970s. The main terminal is located west of Dar es Salaam's central business district in north Yombo Vituka along the Nelson Mandela Road. The TAZARA Railway connects Dar es Salaam to Zambia.\nSGR.\nTanzania Standard Gauge Railway is a new railway station currently under construction. It will link the country to Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and Congo.\nAirport.\nThe Julius Nyerere International Airport is the principal airport serving the country, with three operating terminals. Terminal Three is located at Kipawa in Ilala Municipality. The airport is located west of Dar es Salaam's central business district.\nCulture.\nArt.\nThe Tingatinga painting style originates from Dar es Salaam. The Nyumba ya sanaa (\"House of Art\") is a cultural centre, workshop and retail outlet dedicated to Tanzanian art, showcasing and promoting Tanzanian craftsmanship. Prominent Tanzanian sculptor George Lilanga has donated some of his works to the centre, including decorations of the building's main entrance.\nMusic.\nThe music scene in Dar es Salaam is divided among several styles. The longest-standing style is live dance music (muziki wa dansi) played by bands such as DDC Mlimani Park Orchestra and Malaika Musical Band. Taarab, which was traditionally popular in Zanzibar has also found a niche. However, it remains small compared both to dance music and \"Bongo Flava\", a broad category representing the Tanzanian take on hip hop and rhythm and blues that has quickly become the most popular locally produced music. The rap music scene is also present. Traditional music, which locally refers to tribal music, is still performed, but typically only on family-oriented occasions such as weddings.\nIn the 1970s, the Ministry of National Youth Culture aimed to create a national culture stressing the importance of music. Dar es Salaam became the music centre in Tanzania, with the local radio showcasing new bands and dominating the music and cultural scene. With this \"ujamaa\" (family) mentality governing culture and music, a unified people's culture was created, leading to the rise of hip hop culture. Throughout the years, the radio in Dar es Salaam has played a major role in the dissemination of music, because many people do not have television; cassettes are more common than CDs.\nTourism.\nDar es Salaam has two of the five museums that make up the National Museum of Tanzania consortium, namely the National Museum proper and the Makumbusho Cultural Centre &amp; Village Museum. The National Museum is dedicated to the history of Tanzania; most notably, it exhibits some of the bones of \"Paranthropus boisei\" that were among the findings of Louis Leakey at Olduvai. In 2016, there was a breakthrough discovery in Northern Tanzania by a scientist, from the University of Dar es Salaam, of footprints thought to be of a hominid that predates \"Homo sapiens\". The Makumbusho Cultural Centre &amp; Village Museum, located in the outskirts of the city on the road to Bagamoyo, showcases traditional huts from 16 different Tanzanian ethnic groups. There are also examples of traditional cultivation, as well as daily traditional music and dance shows. Close to the National Museum are also the botanical gardens, with tropical plants and trees.\nThere are beaches on the Msasani peninsula north of Dar es Salaam and in Kigamboni to the south. Bongoyo Island can be reached by boat from the Msasani Slipway.\nPlaces of worship.\nThe city is home to several churches and mosques. Islam is the most practiced religion in the city with 70% of the population being Muslim. Notable mosques in the city include Mohammed VI mosque, Masjid Mamuur Mosque, Qiblatein Mosque, Ngazija Mosque and Manyema Mosque. The churches in the city belong to various denominations; for example, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dar es Salaam (Catholic Church), Anglican Church of Tanzania (Anglican Communion), Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (Lutheran World Federation), Baptist Convention of Tanzania (Baptist World Alliance), Ilala Seventh Day Adventist Church and Assemblies of God. There are also a number of Hindu temples, such as Shree Shankarashram temple, Shree Sanatan Dharma Sabha temple, Swaminarayan temple.\nSports.\nStadium.\nDar es Salaam is the sports centre of Tanzania and hosts the second-largest stadium in East and Central Africa, the National Stadium, which can accommodate up to 60,000 people.\nAssociation football.\nThe Tanzanian National Stadium hosts football clubs based in Dar es Salaam: Young Africans and Simba. It also hosts other Tanzanian football clubs and international matches. A new stadium in Dodoma with a much larger capacity has been proposed by the government as a donation from Morocco.\nApart from the National Stadium, the city is home to two other stadiums: the Uhuru Stadium, the Karume Memorial Stadium and Chamazi Stadium. The Uhuru Stadium is used mainly for local tournaments and political gatherings, whilst the Karume Memorial Stadium is situated west of Kurasini and home to the Tanzania Football Federation. Azam Complex Chamazi is owned by Azam Football Club.\nGolf.\nThe Gymkhana Golf Courses located northwest of the Kivukoni area (between the city centre overlooking the shores of the Indian Ocean in the east and Barack Obama Drive), also have tennis courts, squash courts, and a fitness club. Outside of the metropolitan districts is Lugalo Military Golf Course located in the Lugalo Military Barracks.\nAcrobatics.\nFounded in 2003, Mama Africa is a school known for training some of Africa's professional acrobats.\nBoxing.\nBoxing is a popular sport in Tanzania and Dar es Salaam hosts numerous boxing galas organised throughout the year. Tanzanian professional boxer Francis Checka is the current World Boxing Federation (WBF) Super Middleweight Champion.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nNewspapers in Dar es Salaam are often sold by vendors weaving through stationary traffic at road intersections. English-language newspapers, with online versions, include \"The Citizen\" and \"The Guardian\". Swahili dailies \"Tanzania Daima\" and \"Mwananchi\" are also available. \"Business Times\" is the only financial and economic newspaper in the city; it was established in 1988 and became the first private newspaper in Tanzania. \"Business Times\" owns \"Majira\", another Swahili newspaper.\nTelevision stations.\nDar es Salaam is home to ITV, Sibuka, Channel Ten Television Station (formerly Dar es Salaam Television [DTV]) and Azam TV, a subscription-based service from the Azam group of companies.\nTelevision station Ayo TV is based in Ubungo, Dar es Salaam, as is the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation.\nInternet access.\nInstallation of the trans-Indian Ocean backbone cable (SEACOM) in 2009 has, in theory, made Internet access much more readily available in Dar es Salaam in particular and in East Africa in general. However, roll-out to end-users is currently slow. Telephone-line coverage provided by the Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited is limited, prices are high, and long contracts are required for purchase of bandwidth for small Internet service providers. The expressed aim of the SEACOM cable is to enable East Africa to develop economically through increased online trading.\nInternet caf\u00e9s are found in the city centre, and free Wi-Fi hotspots are available in various government and nongovernment institutions as well as public transport.\nMobile-telephone access to the Internet via 4G is still relatively expensive, though 5G is making its way through major cities and towns as of 2022[ [update]] with plans to go nationwide in the advanced stages.\nRadio.\nDar es Salaam's first radio station began operation in the early 1950s with \"little more equipment than a microphone and a blanket hung over a wall...\" This project was overseen by Edward Twining.\nEnvironment.\nSince the 1990s, Dar es Salaam has experienced heavy and frequent flooding due to intense rainfall. The city is especially vulnerable to flooding, due to its lowland coastal orientation and the fact that the Msimbazi River flows through the city. The situation has worsened over the years, both due to climate change and the expansion of city pavement, which increases surface runoff.\nIn 2019, flooding displaced 1,215 households. Between 2017 and 2018, the city experienced seven floods. The World Bank estimates that exposure to floods has impacted about 2 million people, or 25% of the population in Dar es Salaam. Flooding incidents destroy bridges and roads, disrupt transportation, increase risk of diseases such as cholera and skin infection, and are a barrier to reducing poverty.\nEducation.\nDar es Salaam has the highest literacy rate in the country, with 93.9% of the residents being literate, compared to the national average of 77.9%. The city's GER lacks in comparison to the rest of the country with 96.1%, which is however still sufficient. On the other hand, its secondary GER is one of the highest in the country (61.8%).\nInternational relations.\nDar es Salaam is sister cities with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "8501", "revid": "50707573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8501", "title": "Distributed computing", "text": "System with multiple networked computers\nDistributed computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems, defined as computer systems whose inter-communicating components are located on different networked computers. \nThe components of a distributed system communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another in order to achieve a common goal. Three challenges of distributed systems are: maintaining concurrency of components, overcoming the lack of a global clock, and managing the independent failure of components. When a component of one system fails, the entire system does not fail. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to microservices to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications. Distributed systems cost more than monolithic architectures, primarily due to increased needs for additional hardware, servers, gateways, firewalls, new subnets, proxies, and so on. Distributed systems can also suffer from fallacies of distributed computing. Conversely, a well-designed distributed system is more scalable, more durable, more changeable, and more fine-tuned than a monolithic application deployed on a single machine. According to Marc Brooker: \"a system is scalable in the range where marginal cost of additional workload is nearly constant.\" Serverless technologies fit this definition but the total cost of ownership, and not just the infra cost must be considered.\nA computer program that runs within a distributed system is called a distributed program, and \"distributed programming\" is the process of writing such programs. There are many types of implementations for the message-passing mechanism, including pure HTTP, RPC-like connectors, and message queues.\n\"Distributed computing\" also refers to the use of distributed systems to solve computational problems. In \"distributed computing\", a problem is divided into many tasks, each of which is solved by one or more computers, which communicate with each other via message passing.\nIntroduction.\nThe word \"distributed\" in terms such as \"distributed system\", \"distributed programming\", and \"distributed algorithm\" originally referred to computer networks where individual computers were physically distributed within some geographical area. The terms are nowadays used in a much wider sense, even referring to autonomous processes that run on the same physical computer and interact with each other by message passing.\nThere is no single definition of a distributed system, but two common properties are generally cited:\nA distributed system may have a common goal, such as solving a large computational problem; the user then perceives the collection of autonomous processors as a unit. Alternatively, each computer may have its own user with individual needs, and the purpose of the distributed system is to coordinate the use of shared resources or provide communication services to the users.\nOther typical properties of distributed systems are:\nPatterns.\nHere are common architectural patterns used for distributed computing:\nEvents vs. Messages.\nIn distributed systems, events represent a fact or state change (e.g., \"OrderPlaced\") and are typically broadcast asynchronously to multiple consumers, promoting loose coupling and scalability. While events generally don't expect an immediate response, acknowledgment mechanisms are often implemented at the infrastructure level (e.g., Kafka commit offsets, SNS delivery statuses) rather than being an inherent part of the event pattern itself.\nIn contrast, messages serve a broader role, encompassing commands (e.g., \"ProcessPayment\"), events (e.g., \"PaymentProcessed\"), and documents (e.g., \"DataPayload\"). Both events and messages can support various delivery guarantees, including at-least-once, at-most-once, and exactly-once, depending on the technology stack and implementation. However, exactly-once delivery is often achieved through idempotency mechanisms rather than true, infrastructure-level exactly-once semantics.\nDelivery patterns for both events and messages include publish/subscribe (one-to-many) and point-to-point (one-to-one). While request/reply is technically possible, it is more commonly associated with messaging patterns rather than pure event-driven systems. Events excel at state propagation and decoupled notifications, while messages are better suited for command execution, workflow orchestration, and explicit coordination.\nModern architectures commonly combine both approaches, leveraging events for distributed state change notifications and messages for targeted command execution and structured workflows based on specific timing, ordering, and delivery requirements.\nParallel and distributed computing.\nDistributed systems are groups of networked computers which share a common goal for their work.\nThe terms \"concurrent computing\", \"parallel computing\", and \"distributed computing\" have much overlap, and no clear distinction exists between them. The same system may be characterized both as \"parallel\" and \"distributed\"; the processors in a typical distributed system run concurrently in parallel. Parallel computing may be seen as a particularly tightly coupled form of distributed computing, and distributed computing may be seen as a loosely coupled form of parallel computing. Nevertheless, it is possible to roughly classify concurrent systems as \"parallel\" or \"distributed\" using the following criteria:\nThe figure on the right illustrates the difference between distributed and parallel systems. Figure (a) is a schematic view of a typical distributed system; the system is represented as a network topology in which each node is a computer and each line connecting the nodes is a communication link. Figure (b) shows the same distributed system in more detail: each computer has its own local memory, and information can be exchanged only by passing messages from one node to another by using the available communication links. Figure (c) shows a parallel system in which each processor has a direct access to a shared memory.\nThe situation is further complicated by the traditional uses of the terms parallel and distributed \"algorithm\" that do not quite match the above definitions of parallel and distributed \"systems\" (see below for more detailed discussion). Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb, high-performance parallel computation in a shared-memory multiprocessor uses parallel algorithms while the coordination of a large-scale distributed system uses distributed algorithms.\nHistory.\nThe use of concurrent processes which communicate through message-passing has its roots in operating system architectures studied in the 1960s. The first widespread distributed systems were local-area networks such as Ethernet, which was invented in the 1970s.\nARPANET, one of the predecessors of the Internet, was introduced in the late 1960s, and ARPANET e-mail was invented in the early 1970s. E-mail became the most successful application of ARPANET, and it is probably the earliest example of a large-scale distributed application. In addition to ARPANET (and its successor, the global Internet), other early worldwide computer networks included Usenet and FidoNet from the 1980s, both of which were used to support distributed discussion systems.\nThe study of distributed computing became its own branch of computer science in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first conference in the field, Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC), dates back to 1982, and its counterpart International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC) was first held in Ottawa in 1985 as the International Workshop on Distributed Algorithms on Graphs.\nDistributed Computing Architectures.\nVarious hardware and software architectures are used for distributed computing. At a lower level, it is necessary to interconnect multiple CPUs with some sort of network, regardless of whether that network is printed onto a circuit board or made up of loosely coupled devices and cables. At a higher level, it is necessary to interconnect processes running on those CPUs with some sort of communication system.\nWhether these CPUs share resources or not determines a first distinction between three types of architecture:\nDistributed programming typically falls into one of several basic architectures: client\u2013server, three-tier, \"n\"-tier, or peer-to-peer; or categories: loose coupling, or tight coupling.\nAnother basic aspect of distributed computing architecture is the method of communicating and coordinating work among concurrent processes. Through various message passing protocols, processes may communicate directly with one another, typically in a main/sub relationship. Alternatively, a \"database-centric\" architecture can enable distributed computing to be done without any form of direct inter-process communication, by utilizing a shared database. Database-centric architecture in particular provides relational processing analytics in a schematic architecture allowing for live environment relay. This enables distributed computing functions both within and beyond the parameters of a networked database.\nCell-Based Architecture.\nCell-based architecture is a distributed computing approach in which computational resources are organized into self-contained units called cells. Each cell operates independently, processing requests while maintaining scalability, fault isolation, and availability.\nA cell typically consists of multiple services or application components and functions as an autonomous unit. Some implementations replicate entire sets of services across multiple cells, while others partition workloads between cells. In replicated models, requests may be rerouted to an operational cell if another experiences a failure. This design is intended to enhance system resilience by reducing the impact of localized failures.\nSome implementations employ circuit breakers within and between cells. Within a cell, circuit breakers may be used to prevent cascading failures among services, while inter-cell circuit breakers can isolate failing cells and redirect traffic to those that remain operational.\nCell-based architecture has been adopted in some large-scale distributed systems, particularly in cloud-native and high-availability environments, where fault isolation and redundancy are key design considerations. Its implementation varies depending on system requirements, infrastructure constraints, and operational objectives.\nApplications.\nReasons for using distributed systems and distributed computing may include:\nExamples.\nExamples of distributed systems and applications of distributed computing include the following:\nReactive distributed systems.\nAccording to Reactive Manifesto, reactive distributed systems are responsive, resilient, elastic and message-driven. Subsequently, Reactive systems are more flexible, loosely-coupled and scalable. To make your systems reactive, you are advised to implement Reactive Principles. Reactive Principles are a set of principles and patterns which help to make your cloud native application as well as edge native applications more reactive.\nTheoretical foundations.\nModels.\nMany tasks that we would like to automate by using a computer are of question\u2013answer type: we would like to ask a question and the computer should produce an answer. In theoretical computer science, such tasks are called computational problems. Formally, a computational problem consists of \"instances\" together with a \"solution\" for each instance. Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.\nTheoretical computer science seeks to understand which computational problems can be solved by using a computer (computability theory) and how efficiently (computational complexity theory). Traditionally, it is said that a problem can be solved by using a computer if we can design an algorithm that produces a correct solution for any given instance. Such an algorithm can be implemented as a computer program that runs on a general-purpose computer: the program reads a problem instance from input, performs some computation, and produces the solution as output. Formalisms such as random-access machines or universal Turing machines can be used as abstract models of a sequential general-purpose computer executing such an algorithm.\nThe field of concurrent and distributed computing studies similar questions in the case of either multiple computers, or a computer that executes a network of interacting processes: which computational problems can be solved in such a network and how efficiently? However, it is not at all obvious what is meant by \"solving a problem\" in the case of a concurrent or distributed system: for example, what is the task of the algorithm designer, and what is the concurrent or distributed equivalent of a sequential general-purpose computer?\nThe discussion below focuses on the case of multiple computers, although many of the issues are the same for concurrent processes running on a single computer.\nThree viewpoints are commonly used:\nIn the case of distributed algorithms, computational problems are typically related to graphs. Often the graph that describes the structure of the computer network \"is\" the problem instance. This is illustrated in the following example.\nAn example.\nConsider the computational problem of finding a coloring of a given graph \"G\". Different fields might take the following approaches:\nWhile the field of parallel algorithms has a different focus than the field of distributed algorithms, there is much interaction between the two fields. For example, the Cole\u2013Vishkin algorithm for graph coloring was originally presented as a parallel algorithm, but the same technique can also be used directly as a distributed algorithm.\nMoreover, a parallel algorithm can be implemented either in a parallel system (using shared memory) or in a distributed system (using message passing). The traditional boundary between parallel and distributed algorithms (choose a suitable network vs. run in any given network) does not lie in the same place as the boundary between parallel and distributed systems (shared memory vs. message passing).\nComplexity measures.\nIn parallel algorithms, yet another resource in addition to time and space is the number of computers. Indeed, often there is a trade-off between the running time and the number of computers: the problem can be solved faster if there are more computers running in parallel (see speedup). If a decision problem can be solved in polylogarithmic time by using a polynomial number of processors, then the problem is said to be in the class NC. The class NC can be defined equally well by using the PRAM formalism or Boolean circuits\u2014PRAM machines can simulate Boolean circuits efficiently and vice versa.\nIn the analysis of distributed algorithms, more attention is usually paid on communication operations than computational steps. Perhaps the simplest model of distributed computing is a synchronous system where all nodes operate in a lockstep fashion. This model is commonly known as the LOCAL model. During each \"communication round\", all nodes in parallel (1)\u00a0receive the latest messages from their neighbours, (2)\u00a0perform arbitrary local computation, and (3)\u00a0send new messages to their neighbors. In such systems, a central complexity measure is the number of synchronous communication rounds required to complete the task.\nThis complexity measure is closely related to the diameter of the network. Let \"D\" be the diameter of the network. On the one hand, any computable problem can be solved trivially in a synchronous distributed system in approximately 2\"D\" communication rounds: simply gather all information in one location (\"D\" rounds), solve the problem, and inform each node about the solution (\"D\" rounds).\nOn the other hand, if the running time of the algorithm is much smaller than \"D\" communication rounds, then the nodes in the network must produce their output without having the possibility to obtain information about distant parts of the network. In other words, the nodes must make globally consistent decisions based on information that is available in their \"local D-neighbourhood\". Many distributed algorithms are known with the running time much smaller than \"D\" rounds, and understanding which problems can be solved by such algorithms is one of the central research questions of the field. Typically an algorithm which solves a problem in polylogarithmic time in the network size is considered efficient in this model.\nAnother commonly used measure is the total number of bits transmitted in the network (cf. communication complexity). The features of this concept are typically captured with the CONGEST(B) model, which is similarly defined as the LOCAL model, but where single messages can only contain B bits.\nOther problems.\nTraditional computational problems take the perspective that the user asks a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes the question, then produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where the system is required not to stop, including the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or deadlocks occur.\nThere are also fundamental challenges that are unique to distributed computing, for example those related to \"fault-tolerance\". Examples of related problems include consensus problems, Byzantine fault tolerance, and self-stabilisation.\nMuch research is also focused on understanding the \"asynchronous\" nature of distributed systems:\nNote that in distributed systems, latency should be measured through \"99th percentile\" because \"median\" and \"average\" can be misleading.\nElection.\n\"Coordinator election\" (or \"leader election\") is the process of designating a single process as the organizer of some task distributed among several computers (nodes). Before the task is begun, all network nodes are either unaware which node will serve as the \"coordinator\" (or leader) of the task, or unable to communicate with the current coordinator. After a coordinator election algorithm has been run, however, each node throughout the network recognizes a particular, unique node as the task coordinator.\nThe network nodes communicate among themselves in order to decide which of them will get into the \"coordinator\" state. For that, they need some method in order to break the symmetry among them. For example, if each node has unique and comparable identities, then the nodes can compare their identities, and decide that the node with the highest identity is the coordinator.\nThe definition of this problem is often attributed to LeLann, who formalized it as a method to create a new token in a token ring network in which the token has been lost.\nCoordinator election algorithms are designed to be economical in terms of total bytes transmitted, and time. The algorithm suggested by Gallager, Humblet, and Spira for general undirected graphs has had a strong impact on the design of distributed algorithms in general, and won the Dijkstra Prize for an influential paper in distributed computing.\nMany other algorithms were suggested for different kinds of network graphs, such as undirected rings, unidirectional rings, complete graphs, grids, directed Euler graphs, and others. A general method that decouples the issue of the graph family from the design of the coordinator election algorithm was suggested by Korach, Kutten, and Moran.\nIn order to perform coordination, distributed systems employ the concept of coordinators. The coordinator election problem is to choose a process from among a group of processes on different processors in a distributed system to act as the central coordinator. Several central coordinator election algorithms exist.\nProperties of distributed systems.\nSo far the focus has been on \"designing\" a distributed system that solves a given problem. A complementary research problem is \"studying\" the properties of a given distributed system.\nThe halting problem is an analogous example from the field of centralised computation: we are given a computer program and the task is to decide whether it halts or runs forever. The halting problem is undecidable in the general case, and naturally understanding the behaviour of a computer network is at least as hard as understanding the behaviour of one computer.\nHowever, there are many interesting special cases that are decidable. In particular, it is possible to reason about the behaviour of a network of finite-state machines. One example is telling whether a given network of interacting (asynchronous and non-deterministic) finite-state machines can reach a deadlock. This problem is PSPACE-complete, i.e., it is decidable, but not likely that there is an efficient (centralised, parallel or distributed) algorithm that solves the problem in the case of large networks.\nOther Topics.\nLinearizability\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
