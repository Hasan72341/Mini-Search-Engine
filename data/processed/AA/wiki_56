{"id": "6095", "revid": "525927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6095", "title": "Chechnya", "text": "Republic of Russia in the North Caucasus\nChechnya, officially the Chechen Republic, is a republic of Russia. It is situated in the North Caucasus of Eastern Europe, between the Caspian Sea and Black Sea. The republic forms a part of the North Caucasian Federal District, and shares land borders with Georgia to its south; with the Russian republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia, and North Ossetia\u2013Alania to its east, north, and west; and with Stavropol Krai to its northwest.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Checheno-Ingush ASSR split into two parts: the Republic of Ingushetia and the Chechen Republic. The latter proclaimed the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, which declared independence, while the former sided with Russia. Following the First Chechen War of 1994\u20131996 with Russia, Chechnya gained \"de facto\" independence as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, although \"de jure\" it remained a part of Russia. Russian federal control was restored in the Second Chechen War of 1999\u20132009, with Chechen politics being dominated by the former Ichkerian mufti Akhmad Kadyrov, and later his son Ramzan Kadyrov.\nThe republic covers an area of , with a population of over 1.5 million residents as of 2021[ [update]]. Its population largely consists of the indigenous Chechen ethnic group, who are part of the Nakh peoples and adhere primarily to the Islamic faith. Grozny is the capital and largest city.\nHistory.\nOrigin of Chechnya's population.\nAccording to Leonti Mroveli, the 11th-century Georgian chronicler, the word \"Caucasus\" is derived from the Nakh ancestor Kavkas.\nAccording to George Anchabadze of Ilia State University:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Vainakhs are the ancient natives of the Caucasus. It is noteworthy, that according to the genealogical table drawn up by Leonti Mroveli, the legendary forefather of the Vainakhs was \"Kavkas\", hence the name Kavkasians, one of the ethnicons met in the ancient Georgian written sources, signifying the ancestors of the Chechens and Ingush. As appears from the above, the Vainakhs, at least by name, are presented as the most \"Caucasian\" people of all the Caucasians (Caucasus \u2013 Kavkas \u2013 Kavkasians) in the Georgian historical tradition.\nAmerican linguist Johanna Nichols \"has used language to connect the modern people of the Caucasus region to the ancient farmers of the Fertile Crescent\" and her research suggests that \"farmers of the region were proto-Nakh-Daghestanians\". Nichols stated: \"The Nakh\u2013Dagestanian languages are the closest thing we have to a direct continuation of the cultural and linguistic community that gave rise to Western civilisation.\"\nPrehistory.\nTraces of human settlement dating back to 40,000 BC were found near Lake Kezenoyam. Cave paintings, artifacts, and other archaeological evidence indicate continuous habitation for some 8,000 years. People living in these settlements used tools, fire, and clothing made of animal skins.\nThe Caucasian Epipaleolithic and early Caucasian Neolithic era saw the introduction of agriculture, irrigation, and the domestication of animals in the region. Settlements near Ali-Yurt and Magas, discovered in modern times, revealed tools made out of stone: stone axes, polished stones, stone knives, stones with holes drilled in them, clay dishes, etc. Settlements made out of clay bricks were discovered in the plains. In the mountains there were settlements made from stone and surrounded by walls; some of them dated back to 8000 BC. This period also saw the appearance of the wheel (3000 BC), horseback riding, metal works (copper, gold, silver, iron), dishes, armor, daggers, knives and arrow tips in the region. The artifacts were found near Nasare-Cort, Muzhichi, Ja-E-Bortz (alternatively known as Surkha-khi), Abbey-Gove (also known as Nazran or Nasare).\nPre-imperial era.\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, there was frequent warfare between the Chechens, Tamerlane and Tokhtamysh, culminating in the Battle of the Terek River (see Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war). The Chechen tribes built fortresses, castles, and defensive walls, protecting the mountains from the invaders (see Vainakh tower architecture). Part of the lowland tribes were occupied by Mongols. However, during the mid-14th century a strong Chechen Princedom called Simsim emerged under Khour II, a Chechen king that led the Chechen politics and wars. He was in charge of an army of Chechens against the rogue warlord Mamai and defeated him in the Battle of Tatar-tup in 1362. The kingdom of Simsim was almost destroyed during the Timurid invasion of the Caucasus, when Khour II allied himself with the Golden Horde Khan Tokhtamysh in the Battle of the Terek River. Timur sought to punish the highlanders for their allegiance to Tokhtamysh and as a consequence invaded Simsim in 1395.\nThe 16th century saw the first Russian involvement in the Caucasus. In 1558, Temryuk of Kabarda sent his emissaries to Moscow requesting help from Ivan the Terrible against the Vainakh tribes. Ivan the Terrible married Temryuk's daughter Maria Temryukovna. An alliance was formed to gain the ground in the central Caucasus for the expanding Tsardom of Russia against Vainakh defenders.\nIn 1667 Mehk-Da Aldaman Gheza defended the borders of Chechnya from invasions of Kabardinians and Avars during the Battle of Khachara. The Chechens converted over the next few centuries to Sunni Islam, as Islam was associated with resistance to Russian encroachment.\nImperial rule.\nRussian Emperor Peter the Great first sought to increase Russia's political influence in the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea at the expense of Safavid Persia when he launched the Russo-Persian War of 1722\u20131723. Russian forces succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories from Persia for several years.\nAs the Imperial Russian Army took control of the Caspian corridor and moved into Persian-ruled Dagestan, Peter's forces ran into mountain tribes. Peter sent a cavalry force to subdue them, but the Chechens routed them. In 1732, after Russia had already ceded back most of the Caucasus to Persia, now led by Nader Shah, following the Treaty of Resht, Russian troops clashed again with Chechens in a village called Chechen-aul along the Argun River. The Russians were defeated again and withdrew, but this battle is responsible for the apocryphal story about how the Nokhchiy came to be known as \"Chechens\" \u2013 the people ostensibly named for the place the battle had taken place. However, the name \"Chechen\" had already been used as early as 1692.\nUnder intermittent Persian rule since 1555, in 1783, the eastern Georgians of Kartl-Kakheti, led by Erekle II, and the Russians signed the Treaty of Georgievsk. According to this treaty, Kartl-Kakheti received protection from Russia, and Georgia abjured any dependence on Iran. To increase its influence in the Caucasus and secure communication with Kartli and other Christian-inhabited regions of Transcaucasia, which it considered useful in its wars against Persia and the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire began conquering the Northern Caucasus mountains. The Russian Empire used Christianity to justify its conquests. This allowed Islam to spread widely among the Chechens, as it positioned itself as the religion of liberation from the Tsardom of Russia, which viewed Nakh tribes as \"bandits\". The rebellion was led by Mansur Ushurma, a Chechen sheikh belonging to the Naqshbandi Sufi order\u2014with wavering military support from other North Caucasian tribes. Mansur hoped to establish an Islamic state based in the Transcaucasus under \"Sharia\" law. He was unable to fully achieve this because, in the course of the war, he was betrayed by the Ottoman Turks, handed over to the Russians, and executed in 1794.\nAfter Persia was forced to cede the current territories of Dagestan, most of Azerbaijan, and Georgia to Russia following the Russo-Persian War of 1804\u20131813 and its resultant Treaty of Gulistan, Russia significantly widened its foothold in the Caucasus at Persia's expense. Another successful Caucasus war against Persia several years later, starting in 1826 and ending in 1828 with the Treaty of Turkmenchay, and a successful war against the Ottoman Empire in 1828\u20131829, enabled Russia to use a much larger portion of its army in subduing the natives of the North Caucasus.\nThe resistance of the Nakh tribes never ended and was a fertile ground for a new Muslim-Avar commander, Imam Shamil, who fought against the Russians from 1834 to 1859 (see Murid War). In 1859, Shamil was captured by the Russians at aul Gunib. Shamil left Baysangur of Benoa, a Chechen with one arm, one eye, and one leg, in charge of command at Gunib. Baysangur broke through the siege and continued to fight Russia for another two years until he was captured and killed by Russians. The Russian Tsar hoped that by sparing the life of Shamil, the resistance in the North Caucasus would stop, but it did not. Russia began to use a colonization tactic by destroying Nakh settlements and building Cossack defense lines in the lowlands.\nThe Russian Tsarist regime used a different approach at the end of the 1860s. They offered Chechens and Ingush to leave the Caucasus for the Ottoman Empire (see Muhajir (Caucasus)). It is estimated that about 80% of Chechens and Ingush left the Caucasus during the deportation. It weakened the resistance, which went from open warfare to insurgent warfare. One of the notable Chechen resistance fighters at the end of the 19th century was a Chechen abrek Zelimkhan Gushmazukaev and his comrade-in-arms Ingush abrek Sulom-Beck Sagopshinski. Together they built up small units which constantly harassed Russian military convoys, government mints, and the postal service, mainly in Ingushetia and Chechnya. Ingush aul Kek was completely burned when the Ingush refused to hand over Zelimkhan. Zelimkhan was killed at the beginning of the twentieth century. The war between Nakh tribes and Russia resurfaced during the times of the Russian Revolution, which saw the Nakh struggle against Anton Denikin and later against the Soviet Union.\nOn 21 December 1917, Ingushetia, Chechnya, and Dagestan declared independence from Russia and formed a single state: the United Mountain Dwellers of the North Caucasus, which was recognized by major world powers of the time. The capital of the new state was moved to Temir-Khan-Shura (today in Dagestan). Tapa Tchermoeff, a prominent Chechen statesman, was elected the first prime minister of the state. The second prime minister elected was Vassan-Girey Dzhabagiev, an Ingush statesman, who also was the author of the constitution of the republic in 1917, and in 1920 he was re-elected for the third term. In 1921 the Russians attacked and occupied the country and forcibly absorbed it into the Soviet state. The Caucasian war for independence restarted, and the government went into exile.\nSoviet rule.\nUnder the Soviet Union, Chechnya and Ingushetia were combined to form the Checheno-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In the 1930s, Chechnya was flooded with many Ukrainians fleeing a famine. As a result, many of the Ukrainians settled in Chechen-Ingush ASSR permanently and survived the famine. Although over 50,000 Chechens and over 12,000 Ingush were fighting against Nazi Germany on the front line (including Heroes of the USSR: Abukhadzhi Idrisov, Khanpasha Nuradilov, Movlid Visaitov), and although Nazi German troops advanced as far as the Ossetian ASSR city of Ordzhonikidze and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR city of Malgobek after capturing half of the Caucasus in less than a month, Chechens and Ingush were falsely accused as Nazi supporters and entire nations were deported during Operation Lentil to the Kazakh SSR (later Kazakhstan) in 1944 near the end of World War II where over 60% of Chechen and Ingush populations perished. American historian Norman Naimark writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Troops assembled villagers and townspeople, loaded them onto trucks\u00a0\u2013 many deportees remembered that they were Studebakers, fresh from Lend-Lease deliveries over the Iranian border\u00a0\u2013 and delivered them at previously designated railheads.\u00a0... Those who could not be moved were shot.\u00a0... [A] few fighters aside, the entire Chechen and Ingush nations, 496,460 people, were deported from their homeland.\nThe deportation was justified by the materials prepared by NKVD officer Bogdan Kobulov accusing Chechens and Ingush in a mass conspiracy preparing rebellion and providing assistance to the German forces. Many of the materials were later proven to be fabricated. Even distinguished Red Army officers who fought bravely against Germans (e.g. the commander of 255th Separate Chechen-Ingush regiment Movlid Visaitov, the first to contact American forces at Elbe river) were deported. There is a theory that the real reason why Chechens and Ingush were deported was the desire of Russia to attack Turkey, an anti-communist country, as Chechens and Ingush could impede such plans. In 2004, the European Parliament recognized the deportation of Chechens and Ingush as an act of genocide.\nThe territory of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was divided between Stavropol Krai (where Grozny Okrug was formed), the Dagestan ASSR, the North Ossetian ASSR, and the Georgian SSR.\nThe Chechens and Ingush were allowed to return to their land after 1956 during de-Stalinization under Nikita Khrushchev when the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored but with both the boundaries and ethnic composition of the territory significantly changed. There were many (predominantly Russian) migrants from other parts of the Soviet Union, who often settled in the abandoned family homes of Chechens and Ingushes. The republic lost its Prigorodny District which transferred to North Ossetian ASSR but gained predominantly Russian Naursky District and Shelkovskoy District that is considered the homeland for Terek Cossacks.\nThe Russification policies towards Chechens continued after 1956, with Russian language proficiency required in many aspects of life to provide Chechens better opportunities for advancement in the Soviet system. On 26 November 1990, the Supreme Council of Chechen-Ingush ASSR adopted the \"Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Chechen-Ingush Republic\". This declaration was part of the reorganisation of the Soviet Union. This new treaty was to be signed 22 August 1991, which would have transformed 15 republic states into more than 80. The 19\u201321 August 1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt led to the abandonment of this reorganisation.\nWith the impending dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, an independence movement, the Chechen National Congress, was formed, led by ex-Soviet Air Force general and new Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev. It campaigned for the recognition of Chechnya as a separate nation. This movement was opposed by Boris Yeltsin's Russian Federation, which argued that Chechnya had not been an independent entity within the Soviet Union\u2014as the Baltic, Central Asian, and other Caucasian states such as Georgia had\u2014but was part of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and hence did not have a right under the Soviet constitution to secede. It also argued that other republics of Russia, such as Tatarstan, would consider seceding from the Russian Federation if Chechnya were granted that right. Finally, it argued that Chechnya was a major hub in the oil infrastructure of Russia and hence its secession would hurt the country's economy and energy access.\nDuring the Chechen Revolution, the Soviet Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev was overthrown and Dzhokhar Dudayev seized power. On 1 November 1991, Dudaev's Chechnya issued a unilateral declaration of independence. In the ensuing decade, the territory was locked in an ongoing struggle between various factions, usually fighting unconventionally.\nChechen Wars and brief independence.\nThe First Chechen War, during which Russian forces attempted to regain control over Chechnya, took place from 1994 to 1996. Despite overwhelming numerical superiority in troops, weaponry, and air support, the Russian forces were unable to establish effective permanent control over the mountainous area due to numerous successful full-scale battles and insurgency raids. The Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in 1995 shocked the Russian public. In April 1996, the first democratically elected president of Chechnya, Dzhokhar Dudayev, was killed by Russian forces using a booby trap bomb and a missile fired from a warplane after he was located by triangulating the position of a satellite phone he was using.\nThe widespread demoralization of the Russian Army in the area and a successful offensive to retake Grozny by Chechen rebel forces led by Aslan Maskhadov prompted Russian president Boris Yeltsin to declare a ceasefire in 1996, and sign a peace treaty a year later that saw a withdrawal of Russian troops.\nAfter the war, parliamentary and presidential elections took place in January 1997 in Chechnya and brought to power new president Aslan Maskhadov, chief of staff and prime minister in the Chechen coalition government, for a five-year term. Maskhadov sought to maintain Chechen sovereignty while pressing the Russian government to help rebuild the republic, whose formal economy and infrastructure were virtually destroyed. Russia continued to send money for the rehabilitation of the republic; it also provided pensions and funds for schools and hospitals. Nearly half a million people (40% of Chechnya's prewar population) had been internally displaced and lived in refugee camps or overcrowded villages. There was an economic downturn. Two Russian brigades were permanently stationed in Chechnya.\nIn light of the devastated economic structure, kidnapping emerged as the principal source of income countrywide, procuring over US$200\u00a0million during the three-year independence of the chaotic fledgling state, although victims were rarely killed. In 1998, 176 people were kidnapped, 90 of whom were released, according to official accounts. President Maskhadov started a major campaign against hostage-takers, and on 25 October 1998, Shadid Bargishev, Chechnya's top anti-kidnapping official, was killed in a remote-controlled car bombing. Bargishev's colleagues then insisted they would not be intimidated by the attack and would go ahead with their offensive. Political violence and religious extremism, blamed on Salafism and Wahhabism, was rife. In 1998, Grozny authorities declared a state of emergency. Tensions led to open clashes between the Chechen National Guard and Islamist militants, such as the July 1998 confrontation in Gudermes.\nThe War of Dagestan began on 7 August 1999, during which the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade (IIPB) began an unsuccessful incursion into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan in favor of the Shura of Dagestan, which sought independence from Russia. In September, a series of apartment bombings that killed around 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow, were blamed on Chechen separatists. Some journalists contested the official explanation, instead blaming the Russian secret services for blowing up the buildings to initiate a new military campaign against Chechnya. In response to the bombings, a prolonged air campaign of retaliatory strikes against the Ichkerian regime and a ground offensive that began in October 1999 marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War. Much better organized and planned than the First Chechen War, the Russian armed forces took control of most regions. The Russian forces used brutal force, killing 60 Chechen civilians during a mop-up operation in Aldy, Chechnya on 5 February 2000. After the re-capture of Grozny in February 2000, the Ichkerian regime fell apart.\nPost-war reconstruction and insurgency.\nChechen separatists continued to fight Russian troops and conduct terror attacks after the occupation of Grozny. In October 2002, 40\u201350 Chechen rebels seized a Moscow theater and took about 900 civilians hostage. The crisis ended with 117 hostages and up to 50 rebels dead, mostly due to an unknown aerosol pumped into the building by Russian special forces to incapacitate the people inside.\nIn response to these attacks, Russia tightened its grip on Chechnya and expanded its anti-terrorist operations throughout the region. Russia installed a pro-Russian Chechen regime. In 2003, a referendum was held on a constitution that reintegrated Chechnya within Russia but provided limited autonomy. According to the Chechen government, the referendum passed with 95.5% of the votes and almost 80% turnout. \"The Economist\" was sceptical of the results, arguing that \"few outside the Kremlin regard the referendum as fair\".\nIn September 2004, separatist rebels occupied a school in the town of Beslan, North Ossetia, demanding recognition of the independence of Chechnya and a Russian withdrawal. 1,100 people (including 777 children) were taken hostage. The attack lasted three days, resulting in the deaths of over 331 people, including 186 children. After the 2004 school siege, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced sweeping security and political reforms, sealing borders in the Caucasus region and revealing plans to give the central government more power. He also vowed to take tougher action against domestic terrorism, including preemptive strikes against Chechen separatists. In 2005 and 2006, separatist leaders Aslan Maskhadov and Shamil Basayev were killed.\nSince 2007, Chechnya has been governed by Ramzan Kadyrov. Kadyrov's rule has been characterized by high-level corruption, a poor human rights record, widespread use of torture, and a growing cult of personality. Allegations of anti-gay purges in Chechnya were initially reported on 1 April 2017.\nIn April 2009, Russia ended its counter-terrorism operations and pulled out the bulk of its army. The insurgency in the North Caucasus continued even after this date. The Caucasus Emirate had fully adopted the tenets of a Salafi-jihadist group through its strict adherence to the Sunni Hanbali obedience to the literal interpretation of the Quran and the Sunnah.\nThe Chechen government has been outspoken in its support for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, where a Chechen military force, the Kadyrovtsy, which is under Kadyrov's personal command, has played a leading role, notably in the Siege of Mariupol. Meanwhile, a substantial number of Chechen separatists have allied themselves to the Ukrainian cause and are fighting a mutual Russian enemy in the Donbas.\nIn March 2025, Chechnya blocked the messaging app Telegram due to concerns that it could be used by \"enemies\".\nGeography.\nSituated in the eastern part of the North Caucasus in Eastern Europe, Chechnya is surrounded on nearly all sides by Russian Federal territory. In the west, it borders North Ossetia and Ingushetia, in the north, Stavropol Krai, in the east, Dagestan, and to the south, Georgia. Its capital is Grozny. Chechnya is well known for being mountainous, but it is in fact split between the more flat areas north of the Terek, and the highlands south of the Terek.\nRivers:\nClimate.\nDespite a relatively small territory, Chechnya is characterized by a variety of climate conditions. The average temperature in Grozny is .\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe Chechen Republic is divided into 15 districts and three cities of republican significance.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2021 Census, the population of the republic is 1,510,824, up from 1,268,989 in the 2010 Census. As of the 2021 Census, Chechens at 1,456,792 make up 96.4% of the republic's population. Other groups include Russians (18,225, or 1.2%), Kumyks (12,184, or 0.8%) and a host of other small groups, each accounting for less than 0.5% of the total population. The birth rate was 25.41 in 2004. (25.7 in Achkhoi Martan, 19.8 in Groznyy, 17.5 in Kurchaloi, 28.3 in Urus Martan and 11.1 in Vedeno).\nThe languages used in the Republic are Chechen and Russian. Chechen belongs to the Vaynakh or North-central Caucasian language family, which also includes Ingush and Batsb. Some scholars place it in a wider North Caucasian languages.\nLife expectancy.\nDespite its difficult past, Chechnya has a high life expectancy, one of the highest in Russia. But the pattern of life expectancy is unusual, and according to numerous statistics, Chechnya stands out from the overall picture. In 2020, Chechnya had the deepest fall in life expectancy, but in 2021 it had the biggest rise. Chechnya has the highest excess of life expectancy in rural areas over cities.\nSettlements.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReligion.\nIslam.\nSunni Islam is the predominant religion in Chechnya, practiced by 95% of those polled in Grozny in 2010. Most of the population is Sunni and follows either the Shafi'i or the Hanafi schools of Islamic jurisprudence. The Shafi'i school of jurisprudence has a long tradition among the Chechens, and thus it remains the most practiced. Many Chechens are also Sufis, of either the Qadiri or Naqshbandi orders.\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, there has been an Islamic revival in Chechnya, and in 2011 it was estimated that there were 465 mosques, including the Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque in Grozny accommodating 10,000 worshippers, as well 31 madrasas, including an Islamic university named Kunta-haji, the Kurchaloy Islamic Institute named Akhmad Kadyrov, and the Center of Islamic Medicine in Grozny, which is the largest such institution in Europe. A supreme Islamic administrative territorial organisation in Chechnya is the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of the Chechen Republic or the Muftiate of the Chechen Republic.\nChristianity.\nFrom the 11th to 13th centuries (i.e. before Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia), there was a mission of Georgian Orthodox missionaries to the Nakh peoples. They were not successful, though one or two highland teips did convert to Christianity (conversion was largely by teips). However, during the Mongol invasions of Durdzuketia, these Christianized teips gradually reverted to paganism, perhaps due to the loss of Transcaucasian contacts, as the Georgians fought the Mongols and briefly fell under their dominion.\nThe once-strong Russian minority in Chechnya, mostly Terek Cossacks and estimated as numbering approximately 25,000 in 2012, are predominantly Russian Orthodox, although currently only one church exists in Grozny. In August 2011, Archbishop Zosima of Vladikavkaz and Makhachkala performed the first mass baptism ceremony in the history of the Chechen Republic in the Terek River of Naursky District, in which 35 citizens of Naursky and Shelkovsky districts were converted to Russian Orthodoxy. As of 2020, there are eight Eastern Orthodox churches in Chechnya, the largest is the temple of the Archangel Michael in Grozny.\nPolitics.\nSince 1990, the Chechen Republic has had many legal, military, and civil conflicts involving separatist movements and pro-Russian authorities. Chechnya has enjoyed a period of relative stability under the Russian-appointed government, although there is still some separatist movement activity. Its regional constitution entered into effect on 2 April 2003, after an all-Chechen referendum was held on 23 March 2003. Some Chechens were controlled by regional teips, or clans, despite the existence of pro- and anti-Russian political structures.\nIn the 2024 Russian presidential election, which critics called rigged and fraudulent, Russian president Vladimir Putin won 98.99% of the vote in Chechnya.\nRegional government.\nThe former separatist religious leader (mufti) Akhmad Kadyrov was elected president with 83% of the vote in an internationally monitored election on 5 October 2003. Incidents of ballot stuffing and voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of separatist parties from the polls were subsequently reported by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) monitors. On 9 May 2004, Kadyrov was assassinated in Grozny football stadium by a landmine explosion that was planted beneath a VIP stage and detonated during a parade, and Sergey Abramov was appointed acting prime minister after the incident. However, since 2005 Ramzan Kadyrov (son of Akhmad Kadyrov) has been the caretaker prime minister, and in 2007 was appointed as the new president. Many allege he is the wealthiest and most powerful man in the republic, with control over a large private militia (the Kadyrovites). The militia, which began as his father's security force, has been accused of killings and kidnappings by human rights organisations such as Human Rights Watch.\nSeparatist government.\nIchkeria was a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation between 1991 and 2010. Former president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, deposed in a military coup of 1991 and a participant of the Georgian Civil War, recognized the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria in 1993. Diplomatic relations with Ichkeria were also established by the partially recognised Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan under the Taliban government on 16 January 2000. This recognition ceased with the fall of the Taliban in 2001. However, despite Taliban recognition, there were no friendly relations between the Taliban and Ichkeria\u2014Maskhadov rejected their recognition, stating that the Taliban were illegitimate. Ichkeria also received vocal support from the Baltic countries, a group of Ukrainian nationalists, and Poland; Estonia once voted to recognize, but the act never was followed through due to pressure applied by both Russia and the EU.\nThe president of this government was Aslan Maskhadov, and the foreign minister was Ilyas Akhmadov, who was the spokesman for the president. Maskhadov had been elected for four years in an internationally monitored election in 1997, which took place after signing a peace agreement with Russia. In 2001, he issued a decree prolonging his office for one additional year; he was unable to participate in the 2003 presidential election since separatist parties were barred by the Russian government, and Maskhadov faced accusations of terrorist offenses in Russia. Maskhadov left Grozny and moved to the separatist-controlled areas of the south at the onset of the Second Chechen War. Maskhadov was unable to influence a number of warlords who retain effective control over Chechen territory, and his power was diminished as a result. Russian forces killed Maskhadov on 8 March 2005, and the assassination was widely criticized since it left no legitimate Chechen separatist leader with whom to conduct peace talks. Akhmed Zakayev, deputy prime minister and a foreign minister under Maskhadov, was appointed shortly after the 1997 election and is currently living under asylum in England. He and others chose Abdul Khalim Saidullayev, a relatively unknown Islamic judge who was previously the host of an Islamic program on Chechen television, to replace Maskhadov following his death. On 17 June 2006, it was reported that Russian special forces killed Abdul Khalim Saidullayev in a raid in the Chechen town of Argun. On 10 July 2006, Shamil Basayev, a leader of the Chechen rebel movement, was killed in a truck explosion during an arms deal.\nThe successor of Saidullayev became Doku Umarov. On 31 October 2007, Umarov abolished the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and its presidency and in its place proclaimed the Caucasus Emirate with himself as its Emir. This change of status has been rejected by many Chechen politicians and military leaders who continue to support the existence of the republic.\nDuring the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian parliament voted to recognize the \"Chechen Republic of Ichkeria as territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation\".\nHuman rights.\n\u0422he Internal Displacement Monitoring Center reports that after hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians and Chechens fled their homes following inter-ethnic and separatist conflicts in Chechnya in 1994 and 1999, more than 150,000 people still remain displaced in Russia today.\n\u041duman rights organizations criticized the conduct of the 2005 parliamentary elections as unfairly influenced by the central Russian government and military. In 2006, Human Rights Watch reported that pro-Russian Chechen forces under the command of Ramzan Kadyrov, as well as Russian federal police personnel, used torture to get information about separatist forces. \"If you are detained in Chechnya, you face a real and immediate risk of torture. And there is little chance that your torturer will be held accountable\", said Holly Cartner, Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of the Human Rights Watch.\nIn 2009, the U. S. government-financed American organization Freedom House included Chechnya in the \"Worst of the Worst\" list of most repressive societies in the world, together with Burma, North Korea, Tibet, and others. Memorial considers Chechnya under Kadyrov to be a totalitarian regime.\nOn February 1, 2009, \"The New York Times\" released extensive evidence to support allegations of consistent torture and executions under the Kadyrov government. The accusations were sparked by the assassination in Austria of a former Chechen rebel who had gained access to Kadyrov's inner circle, 27-year-old Umar Israilov.\nOn July 1, 2009, Amnesty International released a detailed report covering the human rights violations committed by the Russian Federation against Chechen citizens. Among the most prominent features was that those abused had no method of redress against assaults, ranging from kidnapping to torture, while those responsible were never held accountable. This led to the conclusion that Chechnya was being ruled without law, being run into further devastating destabilization.\nOn 10 March 2011, Human Rights Watch reported that since Chechenization, the government has pushed for enforced Islamic dress code. The president Ramzan Kadyrov is quoted as saying \"I have the right to criticize my wife. She doesn't [have the right to criticize me]. With us [in Chechen society], a wife is a housewife. A woman should know her place. A woman should give her love to us [men]... She would be [man's] property. And the man is the owner. Here, if a woman does not behave properly, her husband, father, and brother are responsible. According to our tradition, if a woman fools around, her family members kill her... That's how it happens, a brother kills his sister or a husband kills his wife... As a president, I cannot allow for them to kill. So, let women not wear shorts...\". He has also openly defended honor killings on several occasions.\nOn 9 July 2017, Russian newspaper reported that a number of people were extrajudicially executed on the night of 26 January 2017. It published a list of 27 names of the people known to be dead, but stressed that the list is \"not all [of those killed]\"; the newspaper asserted that 50 people may have been executed. Some of the dead were gay, but not all. The killings appeared to have been precipitated by the death of a policeman; according to the author of the report, Elena Milashina, the victims were executed for engaging in terrorism.\nIn December 2021, up to 50 family members of critics of the Kadyrov government were abducted in a wave of mass kidnappings beginning on 22 December. In a case-study published during the same year, Freedom House reported that Kadyrov also conducts a total transnational repression campaign against Chechen exiles outside of Russia, including assassinations of critics and digital intimidation.\nLGBT rights.\nAlthough homosexuality is officially legal in Chechnya per Russian law, it is de facto illegal. Chechen authorities have reportedly arrested, imprisoned and killed persons based on their perceived sexual orientation.\nIn 2017, it was reported by and human rights groups that Chechen authorities had set up concentration camps, one of which is in Argun, where gay men are interrogated and subjected to physical violence. On 27 June 2018, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe noted \"cases of abduction, arbitrary detention, and torture ... with the direct involvement of Chechen law enforcement officials and on the orders of top-level Chechen authorities\" and expressed dismay \"at the statements of Chechen and Russian public officials denying the existence of LGBTI people in the Chechen Republic\". Kadyrov's spokesman Alvi Karimov told Interfax that gay people \"simply do not exist in the republic\" and made an approving reference to honor killings by family members \"if there were such people in Chechnya\". In a 2021 Council of Europe report into anti-LGBTI hate-crimes, rapporteur Foura ben Chikha described the \"state-sponsored attacks carried out against LGBTI people in Chechnya in 2017\" as \"the single most egregious example of violence against LGBTI people in Europe that has occurred in decades\".\nOn 11 January 2019, it was reported that another \"gay purge\" had begun in the country in December 2018, with several men and women being detained. The Russian LGBT Network believes that around 40 people were detained and two killed.\nEconomy.\nDuring the First Chechen War, the Chechen economy fell apart. In 1994, the separatists planned to introduce a new currency, but the change did not occur due to the re-taking of Chechnya by Russian troops in the Second Chechen War.\nThe economic situation in Chechnya has improved considerably since 2000. According to the \"New York Times\", major efforts to rebuild Grozny have been made, and improvements in the political situation have led some officials to consider setting up a tourism industry, though there are claims that construction workers are being irregularly paid and that poor people have been displaced.\nChechnya's unemployment was 67% in 2006 and fell to 21.5% in 2014.\nTotal revenue of the budget of Chechnya for 2017 was 59.2 billion rubles. Of these, 48.5 billion rubles were grants from the federal budget of the Russian Federation.\nIn late 1970s, Chechnya produced up to 20 million tons of oil annually, production declined sharply to approximately 3 million tons in the late 1980s, and to below 2 million tons before 1994, first (1994\u20131996) second Russian invasion of Chechnya (1999) inflicted material damage on the oil-sector infrastructure, oil production decreased to 750,000 tons in 2001 only to increase to 2 million tons in 2006, by 2012 production was 1 million tons.\nCulture.\nThe culture of Chechnya is based on the native traditions of Chechen people. Chechen mythology along with art have helped shape the culture for over 1,000 years.\nFrom April 2024, all music must have a tempo between 80 and 116 beats per minute, to comply with Chechen traditions. Borrowing musical culture from other peoples is not allowed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n.\u00a0Decree\u00a0#164\u00a0of\u00a015\u00a0July 2004 \"On the State Anthem of the Chechen Republic\".

Popes began making such decrees in the tenth century. Up to that point, the local bishops governed the veneration of holy men and women within their own dioceses; and there may have been, for any particular saint, no formal decree at all. In subsequent centuries, the procedures became increasingly regularized and the Popes began restricting to themselves the right to declare someone a Catholic saint. In contemporary usage, the term is understood to refer to the act by which any Christian church declares that a person who has died is a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the list of recognized saints, called the \"canon\".\nBiblical roots.\nIn the Roman Martyrology, the following entry is given for the Penitent Thief: \"At Jerusalem, the commemoration of the good Thief, who confessed Christ on the cross, and deserved to hear from Him these words: 'This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise.'\nHistorical development.\nThe Roman Canon, the historical Eucharistic Prayer or Anaphora of Canon of the Roman Rite contains only the names of apostles and martyrs, along with that of the Blessed Virgin Mary and, since 1962, that of Saint Joseph her spouse.\nBy the fourth century, however, \"confessors\"\u2014people who had confessed their faith not by dying but by word and life\u2014began to be venerated publicly. Examples of such people are Saint Hilarion and Saint Ephrem the Syrian in the East, and Saint Martin of Tours and Saint Hilary of Poitiers in the West. Their names were inserted in the diptychs, the lists of saints explicitly venerated in the liturgy, and their tombs were honoured in like manner as those of the martyrs. Since the witness of their lives was not as unequivocal as that of the martyrs, they were venerated publicly only with the approval by the local bishop. This process is often referred to as \"local canonization\".\nThis approval was required even for veneration of a reputed martyr. In his history of the Donatist heresy, Saint Optatus recounts that at Carthage a Catholic matron, named Lucilla, incurred the censures of the Church for having kissed the relics of a reputed martyr whose claims to martyrdom had not been juridically proved. And Saint Cyprian (died 258) recommended that the utmost diligence be observed in investigating the claims of those who were said to have died for the faith. All the circumstances accompanying the martyrdom were to be inquired into; the faith of those who suffered, and the motives that animated them were to be rigorously examined, in order to prevent the recognition of undeserving persons. Evidence was sought from the court records of the trials or from people who had been present at the trials.\nAugustine of Hippo (died 430) tells of the procedure which was followed in his day for the recognition of a martyr. The bishop of the diocese in which the martyrdom took place set up a canonical process for conducting the inquiry with the utmost severity. The acts of the process were sent either to the metropolitan or primate, who carefully examined the cause, and, after consultation with the suffragan bishops, declared whether the deceased was worthy of the name of \"martyr\" and public veneration.\nThough not \"canonizations\" in the narrow sense, acts of formal recognition, such as the erection of an altar over the saint's tomb or transferring the saint's relics to a church, were preceded by formal inquiries into the sanctity of the person's life and the miracles attributed to that person's intercession.\nSuch acts of recognition of a saint were authoritative, in the strict sense, only for the diocese or ecclesiastical province for which they were issued, but with the spread of the fame of a saint, were often accepted elsewhere also.\nNature.\nIn the Catholic Church, both in the Latin and the constituent Eastern churches, the act of canonization is reserved to the Apostolic See and occurs at the conclusion of a long process requiring extensive proof that the candidate for canonization lived and died in such an exemplary and holy way that they are worthy to be recognized as a saint. The Church's official recognition of sanctity implies that the person is now in Heaven and that they may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the liturgy of the Church, including in the Litany of the Saints.\nIn the Catholic Church, canonization is a decree that allows universal veneration of the saint. For permission to venerate merely locally, only beatification is needed.\nProcedure prior to reservation to the Apostolic See.\nFor several centuries the bishops, or in some places only the primates and patriarchs, could grant martyrs and confessors public ecclesiastical honor; such honor, however, was always decreed only for the local territory of which the grantors had jurisdiction. Only acceptance of the \"cultus\" by the Pope made the \"cultus\" universal, because he alone can rule the universal Catholic Church. Abuses, however, crept into this discipline, due as well to indiscretions of popular fervor as to the negligence of some bishops in inquiring into the lives of those whom they permitted to be honoured as saints.\nIn the Medieval West, the Apostolic See was asked to intervene in the question of canonizations so as to ensure more authoritative decisions. The canonization of Saint Udalric, Bishop of Augsburg by Pope John XV in 993 was the first undoubted example of papal canonization of a saint from outside of Rome being declared worthy of liturgical veneration for the entire church. \nThereafter, recourse to the judgment of the Pope occurred more frequently. Toward the end of the 11th century, the Popes began asserting their exclusive right to authorize the veneration of a saint against the older rights of bishops to do so for their dioceses and regions. Popes therefore decreed that the virtues and miracles of persons proposed for public veneration should be examined in councils, more specifically in general councils. Pope Urban II, Pope Calixtus II, and Pope Eugene III conformed to this discipline.\nExclusive reservation to the Apostolic See.\nHugh de Boves, Archbishop of Rouen, canonized Walter of Pontoise, or St. Gaultier, in 1153, the final saint in Western Europe to be canonized by an authority other than the Pope: \"The last case of canonization by a metropolitan is said to have been that of St. Gaultier, or Gaucher, [A]bbot of Pontoise, by the Archbishop of Rouen. A decree of Pope Alexander III [in] 1170 gave the prerogative to the [P]ope thenceforth, so far as the Western Church was concerned.\" In a decretal of 1173, Pope Alexander III reprimanded some bishops for permitting veneration of a man who was merely killed while intoxicated, prohibited veneration of the man, and most significantly decreed that \"you shall not therefore presume to honor him in the future; for, even if miracles were worked through him, it is not lawful for you to venerate him as a saint without the authority of the Catholic Church.\" Theologians disagree as to the full import of the decretal of Pope Alexander III: either a new law was instituted, in which case the Pope then for the first time reserved the right of beatification to himself, or an existing law was confirmed.\nHowever, the procedure initiated by the decretal of Pope Alexander III was confirmed by a bull of Pope Innocent III issued on the occasion of the canonization of Cunigunde of Luxembourg in 1200. The bull of Pope Innocent III resulted in increasingly elaborate inquiries to the Apostolic See concerning canonizations. Because the decretal of Pope Alexander III did not end all controversy and some bishops did not obey it in so far as it regarded beatification, the right of which they had certainly possessed hitherto, Pope Urban VIII issued the Apostolic letter \"Caelestis Hierusalem cives\" of 5 July 1634 that exclusively reserved to the Apostolic See both its immemorial right of canonization and that of beatification. He further regulated both of these acts by issuing his \"Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum\" on 12 March 1642.\nProcedure from 1734 to 1738 to 1983.\nIn his \"De Servorum Dei beatificatione et de Beatorum canonizatione\" of five volumes the eminent canonist Prospero Lambertini (1675\u20131758), who later became Pope Benedict XIV, elaborated on the procedural norms of Pope Urban VIII's Apostolic letter \"Caelestis Hierusalem cives\" of 1634 and \"Decreta servanda in beatificatione et canonizatione Sanctorum\" of 1642, and on the conventional practice of the time. His work published from 1734 to 1738 governed the proceedings until 1917. The article \"Beatification and canonization process in 1914\" describes the procedures followed until the promulgation of the \"Codex\" of 1917. The substance of \"De Servorum Dei beatif\u03b9catione et de Beatorum canonizatione\" was incorporated into the \"Codex Iuris Canonici\" (\"Code of Canon Law\") of 1917, which governed until the promulgation of the revised \"Codex Iuris Canonici\" in 1983 by Pope John Paul II. Prior to promulgation of the revised \"Codex\" in 1983, Pope Paul VI initiated a simplification of the procedures.\nSince 1983.\nThe Apostolic constitution \"Divinus Perfectionis Magister\" of Pope John Paul II of 25 January 1983 and the norms issued by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 7 February 1983 to implement the constitution in dioceses, continued the simplification of the process initiated by Pope Paul VI. Contrary to popular belief, the reforms did not eliminate the office of the Promoter of the Faith (Latin: \"Promotor Fidei\"), popularly known as the Devil's advocate, whose office is to question the material presented in favor of canonization. The reforms were intended to reduce the adversarial nature of the process. In November 2012 Pope Benedict XVI appointed Monsignor Carmello Pellegrino as Promoter of the Faith.\nCandidates for canonization undergo the following process:\nCanonization is a statement of the Church that the person certainly enjoys the beatific vision of Heaven. The title of \"Saint\" (Latin: \"Sanctus\" or \"Sancta\") is then proper, reflecting that the saint is a refulgence of the holiness (\"sanctitas\") of God himself, which alone comes from God's gift. The saint is assigned a feast day which may be celebrated anywhere in the universal Church, although it is not necessarily added to the General Roman Calendar or local calendars as an \"obligatory\" feast; parish churches may be erected in their honor; and the faithful may freely celebrate and honor the saint.\nAlthough recognition of sainthood by the Pope does not directly concern a fact of Divine revelation, nonetheless it must be \"definitively held\" by the faithful as \"infallible\" pursuant to, at the least, the Universal Magisterium of the Church, because it is a truth related to revelation by historical necessity.\nRegarding the Eastern Catholic Churches, the cult of candidates for sainthood who have attained beatification in a \"sui juris\" Church is restricted to that Church. Canonization removes this restriction, and the saint is then venerated in the universal Church.\nEquipollent canonization.\nPopes have several times permitted to the universal Church, without executing the ordinary judicial process of canonization described above, the veneration as a saint, the \"cultus\" of one long venerated as such locally. This act of a Pope is denominated \"equipollent\" or \"equivalent canonization\" and \"confirmation of \"cultus\"\". In such cases, there is no need to have a miracle attributed to the saint to allow their canonization. According to the rules Pope Benedict XIV (\"regnat\" 17 August 1740 \u2013 3 May 1758) instituted, there are three conditions for an equipollent canonization: (1) existence of an ancient \"cultus\" of the person, (2) a general and constant attestation to the virtues or martyrdom of the person by credible historians, and (3) uninterrupted fame of the person as a worker of miracles.\nProtestant denominations.\nThe majority of Protestant denominations do not formally recognize saints because some think the Bible uses the term in a way that suggests all Christians are saints. However, some denominations do, as shown below.\nAnglican Communion.\nThe Church of England, the Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, canonized Charles I as a saint, in the Convocations of Canterbury and York of 1660.\nUnited Methodist Church.\nThe General Conference of the United Methodist Church has formally declared individuals \"martyrs\", including Dietrich Bonhoeffer (in 2008) and Martin Luther King Jr. (in 2012).\nEastern Orthodox Church.\nVarious terms are used for canonization by the autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches: \u043a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f (\"canonization\") or \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 (\"glorification\", in the Russian Orthodox Church), \u10d9\u10d0\u10dc\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\u10d6\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8\u10d0 (\"kanonizats\u2019ia\", Georgian Orthodox Church), \u043a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 (Serbian Orthodox Church), \"canonizare\" (Romanian Orthodox Church), and \u041a\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f (Bulgarian Orthodox Church). Additional terms are used for canonization by other autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Churches: (Katharevousa: ) \"agiokatataxi/agiokatataxis\", \"ranking among saints\" (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Church of Cyprus, Church of Greece), \"kanonizim\" (Albanian Orthodox Church), \"kanonizacja\" (Polish Orthodox Church), and \"kanonizace/kanoniz\u00e1cia\" (Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church).\nThe Orthodox Church in America, an Eastern Orthodox Church partly recognized as autocephalous, uses the term \"glorification\" for the official recognition of a person as a saint.\nOriental Orthodox Church.\nWithin the Armenian Apostolic Church, part of Oriental Orthodoxy, there had been discussions since the 1980s about canonizing the victims of the Armenian genocide. On 23 April 2015, all of the victims of the genocide were canonized.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6099", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6099", "title": "Carboxylic acid", "text": "Organic compound containing a \u2013C(=O)OH group\nIn organic chemistry, a carboxylic acid is an organic acid that contains a carboxyl group () attached to an R-group. The general formula of a carboxylic acid is often written as ' or ', sometimes as with R referring to an organyl group (e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, aryl), or hydrogen, or other groups. Carboxylic acids occur widely. Important examples include the amino acids and fatty acids. Deprotonation of a carboxylic acid gives a carboxylate anion.\nExamples and nomenclature.\nCarboxylic acids are commonly identified by their trivial names. They often have the suffix \"-ic acid\". IUPAC-recommended names also exist; in this system, carboxylic acids have an \"-oic acid\" suffix. For example, butyric acid () is butanoic acid by IUPAC guidelines. For nomenclature of complex molecules containing a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position one of the parent chain even if there are other substituents, such as 3-chloropropanoic acid. Alternately, it can be named as a \"carboxy\" or \"carboxylic acid\" substituent on another parent structure, such as 2-carboxyfuran.\nThe carboxylate anion ( or ) of a carboxylic acid is usually named with the suffix \"-ate\", in keeping with the general pattern of \"-ic acid\" and \"-ate\" for a conjugate acid and its conjugate base, respectively. For example, the conjugate base of acetic acid is acetate.\nCarbonic acid, which occurs in bicarbonate buffer systems in nature, is not generally classed as one of the carboxylic acids, despite it having a moiety that looks like a COOH group.\nPhysical properties.\nSolubility.\nCarboxylic acids are polar. Because they are both hydrogen-bond acceptors (the carbonyl ) and hydrogen-bond donors (the hydroxyl ), they also participate in hydrogen bonding. Together, the hydroxyl and carbonyl group form the functional group carboxyl. Carboxylic acids usually exist as dimers in nonpolar media due to their tendency to \"self-associate\". Smaller carboxylic acids (1 to 5 carbons) are soluble in water, whereas bigger carboxylic acids have limited solubility due to the increasing hydrophobic nature of the alkyl chain. These longer chain acids tend to be soluble in less-polar solvents such as ethers and alcohols. Aqueous sodium hydroxide and carboxylic acids, even hydrophobic ones, react to yield water-soluble sodium salts. For example, enanthic acid has a low solubility in water (0.2 g/L), but its sodium salt is very soluble in water.\nBoiling points.\nCarboxylic acids tend to have higher boiling points than water, because of their greater surface areas and their tendency to form stabilized dimers through hydrogen bonds. For boiling to occur, either the dimer bonds must be broken or the entire dimer arrangement must be vaporized, increasing the enthalpy of vaporization requirements significantly.\nAcidity.\nCarboxylic acids are Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids because they are proton (H+) donors. They are the most common type of organic acid.\nCarboxylic acids are typically weak acids, meaning that they only partially dissociate into cations and anions in neutral aqueous solution. For example, at room temperature, in a 1-molar solution of acetic acid, only 0.001% of the acid are dissociated (i.e. 10\u22125 moles out of 1\u00a0mol). Electron-withdrawing substituents such as trifluoromethyl () give stronger acids (the p\"K\"a of acetic acid is 4.76 whereas trifluoroacetic acid, with a trifluoromethyl substituent, has a p\"K\"a of 0.23). Electron-donating substituents give weaker acids (the p\"K\"a of formic acid is 3.75 whereas acetic acid, with a methyl substituent, has a p\"K\"a of 4.76)\nDeprotonation of carboxylic acids gives carboxylate anions; these are resonance stabilized, because the negative charge is delocalized over the two oxygen atoms, increasing the stability of the anion. Each of the carbon\u2013oxygen bonds in the carboxylate anion has a partial double-bond character. The carbonyl carbon's partial positive charge is also weakened by the \u22121/2 negative charges on the 2 oxygen atoms.\nOdour.\nCarboxylic acids often have strong sour odours. Esters of carboxylic acids tend to have fruity, pleasant odours, and many are used in perfume.\nCharacterization.\nCarboxylic acids are readily identified as such by infrared spectroscopy. They exhibit a sharp band associated with vibration of the C=O carbonyl bond (\"\u03bd\"C=O) between 1680 and 1725\u00a0cm\u22121. A characteristic \"\u03bd\"O\u2013H band appears as a broad peak in the 2500 to 3000\u00a0cm\u22121 region. By 1H NMR spectrometry, the hydroxyl hydrogen appears in the 10\u201313 ppm region, although it is often either broadened or not observed owing to exchange with traces of water.\nOccurrence and applications.\nMany carboxylic acids are produced industrially on a large scale. They are also frequently found in nature. Esters of fatty acids are the main components of lipids and polyamides of aminocarboxylic acids are the main components of proteins.\nCarboxylic acids are used in the production of polymers, pharmaceuticals, solvents, and food additives. Industrially important carboxylic acids include acetic acid (component of vinegar, precursor to solvents and coatings), acrylic and methacrylic acids (precursors to polymers, adhesives), adipic acid (polymers), citric acid (a flavor and preservative in food and beverages), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (chelating agent), fatty acids (coatings), maleic acid (polymers), propionic acid (food preservative), terephthalic acid (polymers). Important carboxylate salts are soaps.\nSynthesis.\nIndustrial routes.\nIn contrast to methods used on a laboratory scale, industrial routes to carboxylic acids often require specialized equipment for high pressures and high temperatures.\nLaboratory methods.\nPreparative methods for small scale reactions for research or for production of fine chemicals often employ expensive consumable reagents.\n\nLess-common reactions.\nMany reactions produce carboxylic acids but are used only in specific cases or are mainly of academic interest.\nReactions.\nAcid-base reactions.\nCarboxylic acids react with bases to form carboxylate salts, in which the hydrogen of the hydroxyl (\u2013OH) group is replaced with a metal cation. For example, acetic acid found in vinegar reacts with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to form sodium acetate, carbon dioxide, and water:\nConversion to esters, amides, anhydrides.\nWidely practiced reactions convert carboxylic acids into esters, amides, carboxylate salts, acid chlorides, and alcohols.\nTheir conversion to esters is widely used, e.g. in the production of polyesters. Likewise, carboxylic acids are converted into amides, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine. Instead esters are typical precursors to amides. The conversion of amino acids into peptides is a significant biochemical process that requires ATP.\nConverting a carboxylic acid to an amide is possible, but not straightforward. Instead of acting as a nucleophile, an amine will react as a base in the presence of a carboxylic acid to give the ammonium carboxylate salt. Heating the salt to above 100\u00a0\u00b0C will drive off water and lead to the formation of the amide. This method of synthesizing amides is industrially important, and has laboratory applications as well. In the presence of a strong acid catalyst, carboxylic acids can condense to form acid anhydrides. The condensation produces water, however, which can hydrolyze the anhydride back to the starting carboxylic acids. Thus, the formation of the anhydride via condensation is an equilibrium process.\nUnder acid-catalyzed conditions, carboxylic acids will react with alcohols to form esters via the Fischer esterification reaction, which is also an equilibrium process. Alternatively, diazomethane can be used to convert an acid to an ester. While esterification reactions with diazomethane often give quantitative yields, diazomethane is only useful for forming methyl esters.\nReduction.\nLike esters, most carboxylic acids can be reduced to alcohols by hydrogenation, or using hydride transferring agents such as lithium aluminium hydride. Strong alkyl transferring agents, such as organolithium compounds but not Grignard reagents, will reduce carboxylic acids to ketones along with transfer of the alkyl group.\nThe Vilsmaier reagent (\"N\",\"N\"-Dimethyl(chloromethylene)ammonium chloride; ) is a highly chemoselective agent for carboxylic acid reduction. It selectively activates the carboxylic acid to give the carboxymethyleneammonium salt, which can be reduced by a mild reductant like lithium tris(\"t\"-butoxy)aluminum hydride to afford an aldehyde in a one pot procedure. This procedure is known to tolerate reactive carbonyl functionalities such as ketone as well as moderately reactive ester, olefin, nitrile, and halide moieties.\nConversion to acyl halides.\nThe hydroxyl group on carboxylic acids may be replaced with a chlorine atom using thionyl chloride to give acyl chlorides. In nature, carboxylic acids are converted to thioesters. Thionyl chloride can be used to convert carboxylic acids to their corresponding acyl chlorides. First, carboxylic acid 1 attacks thionyl chloride, and chloride ion leaves. The resulting oxonium ion 2 is activated towards nucleophilic attack and has a good leaving group, setting it apart from a normal carboxylic acid. In the next step, 2 is attacked by chloride ion to give tetrahedral intermediate 3, a chlorosulfite. The tetrahedral intermediate collapses with the loss of sulfur dioxide and chloride ion, giving protonated acyl chloride 4. Chloride ion can remove the proton on the carbonyl group, giving the acyl chloride 5 with a loss of HCl.\nPhosphorus(III) chloride (PCl3) and phosphorus(V) chloride (PCl5) will also convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides, by a similar mechanism. One equivalent of PCl3 can react with three equivalents of acid, producing one equivalent of H3PO3, or phosphorus acid, in addition to the desired acid chloride. PCl5 reacts with carboxylic acids in a 1:1 ratio, and produces phosphorus(V) oxychloride (POCl3) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) as byproducts.\nReactions with carbanion equivalents.\nCarboxylic acids react with Grignard reagents and organolithiums to form ketones. The first equivalent of nucleophile acts as a base and deprotonates the acid. A second equivalent will attack the carbonyl group to create a geminal alkoxide dianion, which is protonated upon workup to give the hydrate of a ketone. Because most ketone hydrates are unstable relative to their corresponding ketones, the equilibrium between the two is shifted heavily in favor of the ketone. For example, the equilibrium constant for the formation of acetone hydrate from acetone is only 0.002. The carboxylic group is the most acidic in organic compounds.\nCarboxyl radical.\nThe carboxyl radical, \u2022COOH, only exists briefly.

It is located within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, to the north of Kyiv and to the southwest of Gomel in neighbouring Belarus. Prior to being evacuated in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, it was home to approximately 14,000 residents\u2014considerably less than adjacent Pripyat, which was completely abandoned following the incident. Since then, although living anywhere within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is technically illegal, Ukrainian authorities have tolerated those who have taken up living in some of the city's less irradiated areas; Chernobyl's 2020 population estimate was 150 people.\nFirst mentioned as a ducal hunting lodge in Kievan Rus' in 1193, the city has changed hands multiple times over the course of its history. In the 16th century, Jews began moving into Chernobyl, and at the end of the 18th century, it had become a major centre of Hasidic Judaism under the Twersky dynasty. During the early 20th century, pogroms and associated emigration caused the local Jewish community to dwindle significantly. By World War II, all remaining Jews in the city were murdered by Nazi Germany as part of the Holocaust. \nIn 1972, Chernobyl rose to prominence in the Soviet Union when it was selected as the site of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant; Pripyat was constructed nearby to house the facility's workers. Located to the north of Chernobyl proper, it opened in 1977. On 5 May 1986, nine days after Reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded, the Soviet government began evacuating the residents of both Chernobyl and Pripyat in preparation for the liquidators' management of the disaster. Following their subsequent settlement in the newly purpose-built city of Slavutych, most of the evacuees never returned. From 1923 onwards, Chernobyl had been the administrative centre of Chernobyl Raion, which was dissolved and merged with Ivankiv Raion in 1988, owing to widespread radioactive contamination in the region. Ivankiv Raion, in turn, was dissolved and merged with Vyshhorod Raion during Ukraine's 2020 administrative reform.\nWorkers on watch and administrative personnel of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone are stationed in the city, which has two general stores and a hotel. Though the city's atmosphere remained calm after the disaster was contained, the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 sparked international concern about the stability of Ukrainian nuclear facilities, especially pursuant to reports that Russia's occupation of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone until April 2022 had caused a spike in radiation levels.\nEtymology.\nThe names \"Chernobyl\" and \"Chornobyl\" are identical in form to the Russian and Ukrainian words for mugwort, which literally mean \"black stem\". It is likely, however, that the city's name in fact derives from the Old East Slavic personal name (), combined with the possessive suffix -j\u044c.\nThe name in languages used nearby is:\nThe name in languages formerly used in the area is:\nIn English, the Russian-derived spelling \"Chernobyl\" has been commonly used, but some style guides recommend the spelling \"Chornobyl\", or the use of romanized Ukrainian names for Ukrainian places generally.\nHistory.\nThe Polish Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland of 1880\u20131902 states that the time the city was founded is not known.\nIdentity of Ptolemy's \"Azagarium\".\nSome older geographical dictionaries and descriptions of modern Eastern Europe mention \"Czernobol\" (Chernobyl) with reference to Ptolemy's world map (2nd century AD). Czernobol is identified as Azagarium \"oppidium Sarmatiae\" (Lat., \"a city in Sarmatia\"), by the 1605 \"Lexicon geographicum\" of Filippo Ferrari and the 1677 \"Lexicon Universale\" of Johann Jakob Hofmann. According to the \"Dictionary of Ancient Geography\" of Alexander Macbean (London, 1773), Azagarium is \"a town of Sarmatia Europaea, on the Borysthenes\" (Dnieper), 36\u00b0 East longitude and 50\u00b040' latitude. The city is \"now supposed to be \"Czernobol\", a town of Poland, in Red Russia [Red Ruthenia], in the Palatinate of Kiow [Kiev Voivodeship], not far from the Borysthenes.\"\nWhether Azagarium is indeed Czernobol is debatable. The question of Azagarium's correct location was raised in 1842 by Habsburg-Slovak historian, Pavel Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik, who published a book titled \"Slavic Ancient History\" (\"S\u0142awia\u0144skie staro\u017cytno\u015bci\"), where he claimed Azagarium to be the hill of Zaguryna, which he found on an old Russian map \"Bolzoj czertez\" (Big drawing) near the city of Pereiaslav, now in central Ukraine.\nIn 2019, Ukrainian architect Boris Yerofalov-Pylypchak published a book, \"Roman Kyiv or Castrum Azagarium at Kyiv-Podil\".\nKievan Rus' and post-medieval era (880\u20131793).\nThe archaeological excavations that were conducted in 2005\u20132008 found a cultural layer from the 10\u201312th centuries AD, which predates the first documentary mention of Chernobyl.\nAround the 12th century Chernobyl was part of the land of Kievan Rus\u2032. The first known mention of the settlement as Chernobyl is from an 1193 charter, which describes it as a hunting lodge of Knyaz Rurik Rostislavich. In 1362 it was a crown village of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Around that time the town had own castle which was ruined at least on two occasions in 1473 and 1482. The Chernobyl castle was rebuilt in the first quarter of the 16th century being located nearby the settlement in a hard to reach area. With revival of the castle, Chernobyl became a county seat. In 1552 it accounted for 196 buildings with 1,372 residents, out of which over 1,160 were considered city dwellers. In the city were developing various crafts professions such as blacksmith, cooper among others. Near Chernobyl has been excavated bog iron, out of which was produced iron. The village was granted to Filon Kmita, a captain of the royal cavalry, as a fiefdom in 1566. Following the Union of Lublin, the province where Chernobyl is located was transferred to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland in 1569. Under the Polish Crown, Chernobyl became a seat of eldership (starostwo). During that period Chernobyl was inhabited by Ukrainian peasants, some Polish people and a relatively large number of Jews. Jews were brought to Chernobyl by Filon Kmita, during the Polish campaign of colonization. The first mentioning of Jewish community in Chernobyl is in the 17th century. In 1600 the first Roman Catholic church was built in the town. Local population was persecuted for holding Eastern Orthodox rite services. The traditionally Eastern Orthodox Ukrainian peasantry around the town were forcibly converted, by Poland, to the Ruthenian Uniate Church. In 1626, during the Counter-Reformation, a Dominican church and monastery were founded by Lukasz Sapieha. A group of Old Catholics opposed the decrees of the Council of Trent. The Chernobyl residents actively supported the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648\u20131657).\nWith the signing of the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667, Chernobyl was secured after the Sapieha family. Sometime in the 18th century, the place was passed on to the Chodkiewicz family. In the mid-18th century the area around Chernobyl was engulfed in a number of peasant riots, which caused Prince Riepnin to write from Warsaw to Major General Krechetnikov, requesting hussars to be sent from Kharkiv to deal with the uprising near Chernobyl in 1768. The 8th Lithuanian Infantry Regiment was stationed in the town in 1791. By the end of the 18th century, the town accounted for 2,865 residents and had 642 buildings.\nImperial Russian era (1793\u20131917).\nFollowing the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793 Chernobyl was annexed by the Russian Empire and became part of Radomyshl county (\"uezd\") as a supernumerary town (\"zashtatny gorod\"). Many of the Uniate Church converts returned to Eastern Orthodoxy.\nIn 1832, following the failed Polish November Uprising, the Dominican monastery was sequestrated. The church of the Old Catholics was disbanded in 1852.\nUntil the end of the 19th century, Chernobyl was a privately owned city that belonged to the Chodkiewicz family. In 1896 they sold the city to the state, but until 1910 they owned a castle and a house in the city.\nHasidic Jewish dynasty of Chernobyl.\nIn the second half of the 18th century, Chernobyl became a major centre of Hasidic Judaism. The Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty had been founded by Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twersky. The Jewish population suffered greatly from pogroms in October 1905 and in March\u2013April 1919; many Jews were killed or robbed at the instigation of the Russian nationalist Black Hundreds. When the Twersky Dynasty left Chernobyl in 1920, it ceased to exist as a center of Hasidism.\nChernobyl had a population of 10,800 in 1898, including 7,200 Jews. In the beginning of March 1918 Chernobyl was occupied in World War I by German forces in accordance with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\nSoviet era (1920\u20131991).\nUkrainians and Bolsheviks fought over the city in the ensuing Civil War. In the Polish\u2013Soviet War of 1919\u201320, Chernobyl was taken first by the Polish Army and then by the cavalry of the Red Army. From 1921 onwards, it was officially incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR.\nHolodomor.\nBetween 1929 and 1933, Chernobyl suffered from killings during Stalin's collectivization campaign. It was also affected by the famine that resulted from Stalin's policies. The Polish and German community of Chernobyl was deported to Kazakhstan in 1936, during the Frontier Clearances.\nWorld War II and the Holocaust.\nDuring World War II, Chernobyl was occupied by the German Army from 25 August 1941 to 17 November 1943. When the Germans arrived, only 400 Jews remained in Chernobyl; they were murdered during the Holocaust.\nChernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.\nIn 1972, the Duga-1 radio receiver, part of the larger Duga over-the-horizon radar array, began construction west-northwest of Chernobyl. It was the origin of the Russian Woodpecker and was designed as part of an anti-ballistic missile early-warning radar network.\nOn 15 August 1972, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (officially the Vladimir Ilyich Lenin Nuclear Power Plant) began construction about northwest of Chernobyl. The plant was built alongside Pripyat, an \"atomograd\" city founded on 4 February 1970 that was intended to serve the nuclear power plant. The decision to build the power plant was adopted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on recommendations of the State Planning Committee that the Ukrainian SSR be its location. It was the first nuclear power plant to be built in Ukraine.\n26 April 1986: Chernobyl disaster.\nAfter the nuclear disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant; the worst nuclear disaster in history, the city of Chernobyl was evacuated on 5 May 1986. Along with the residents of the nearby city of Pripyat, built as a home for the plant's workers, the population was relocated to the newly built city of Slavutych. While Pripyat remains completely abandoned with no remaining inhabitants, Chernobyl has since hosted a small population.\nIndependent Ukrainian era (1991\u2013present).\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chernobyl remained part of Ukraine within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone which Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union.\n2022 Russian occupation of Chernobyl.\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces captured the city on 24 February. Following the capture of Chernobyl, the Russian army used the city as a staging point for attacks on Kyiv. Ukrainian officials reported that the radiation levels in the city had started to rise due to recent military activity causing radioactive dust to ascend into the air. Hundreds of Russian soldiers were suffering from radiation poisoning after digging trenches in a contaminated area, and one died. On 31 March it was reported that Russian forces had left the exclusion zone. Ukrainian authorities reasserted control over the area on 2 April.\nGeography.\nChernobyl is located about north of Kyiv, and southwest of the Belarusian city of Gomel.\nClimate.\nChernobyl has a humid continental climate (Dfb) with very warm, wet summers with cool nights and long, cold, and snowy winters.\nAftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and evacuation.\nOn 26 April 1986, one of the reactors at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded after a scheduled test on the reactor was carried out improperly by plant operators. The resulting loss of control was due to design flaws of the RBMK reactor, which made it unstable when operated at low power, and prone to thermal runaway where increases in temperature increase reactor power output.\nChernobyl city was evacuated nine days after the disaster. The level of contamination with caesium-137 was around 555 kBq/m2 (surface ground deposition in 1986).\nLater analyses concluded that, even with very conservative estimates, relocation of the city (or of any area below 1500 kBq/m2) could not be justified on the grounds of radiological health.\nThis however does not account for the uncertainty in the first few days of the accident about further depositions and weather patterns.\nMoreover, an earlier short-term evacuation could have averted more significant doses from short-lived isotope radiation (specifically iodine-131, which has a half-life of eight days).\nThe long-term health effects of the Chernobyl disaster are a subject of some controversy.\nIn 1998, average caesium-137 doses from the accident (estimated at 1\u20132 mSv per year) did not exceed those from other sources of exposure. Current effective caesium-137 dose rates as of 2019 are 200\u2013250 nSv/h, or roughly 1.7\u20132.2 mSv per year,\nwhich is comparable to the worldwide average background radiation from natural sources.\nThe base of operations for the administration and monitoring of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was moved from Pripyat to Chernobyl. Chernobyl currently contains offices for the State Agency of Ukraine on the Exclusion Zone Management and accommodations for visitors. Apartment blocks have been repurposed as accommodations for employees of the State Agency. The length of time that workers may spend within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is restricted by regulations that have been implemented to limit radiation exposure. Today, visits are allowed to Chernobyl but limited by strict rules.\nIn 2003, the United Nations Development Programme launched a project, called the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP), for the recovery of the affected areas. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to mitigate the long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl disaster.\nThe city has become overgrown and many types of animals live there. According to census information collected over an extended period of time, it is estimated that more mammals live there now than before the disaster.\nNotably, Mikhail Gorbachev, the final leader of the Soviet Union, stated in respect to the Chernobyl disaster that, \"More than anything else, (Chernobyl) opened the possibility of much greater freedom of expression, to the point that the (Soviet) system as we knew it could no longer continue.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6102", "revid": "7799163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6102", "title": "Cyan", "text": "Color between blue and green\nCyan () is the color between blue and green on the visible spectrum of light. It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength between 500 and 520 nm, between the wavelengths of green and blue.\nIn the subtractive color system, or CMYK color model, which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing, cyan is one of the primary colors, along with magenta and yellow. In the additive color system, or RGB color model, used to create all the colors on a computer or television display, cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light. Cyan is the complement of red; it can be made by the removal of red from white. Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity will make white light. It is commonly seen on a bright, sunny day in the sky.\nShades and variations.\nDifferent shades of cyan can vary in terms of hue, chroma (also known as saturation, intensity, or colorfulness), or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or any combination of these characteristics. Differences in value can also be referred to as tints and shades, with a tint being a cyan mixed with white, and a shade being mixed with black.\nColor nomenclature is subjective. Many shades of cyan with a bluish hue are called blue. Similarly, those with a greenish hue are referred to as green. A cyan with a dark shade is commonly known as teal. A teal blue shade leans toward the blue end of the spectrum. Variations of teal with a greener tint are commonly referred to as teal green.\nTurquoise, reminiscent of the stone with the same name, is a shade in the green spectrum of cyan hues. Celeste is a lightly tinted cyan that represents the color of a clear sky. Other colors in the cyan color range are electric blue, aquamarine, and others described as blue-green.\nHistory.\nCyan boasts a rich and diverse history, holding cultural significance for millennia. In ancient civilizations, turquoise, valued for its aesthetic appeal, served as a highly regarded precious gem. Turquoise comes in a variety of shades from green to blue, but cyan hues are particularly prevalent. Approximately 3,700 years ago, an intricately crafted dragon-shaped treasure made from over 2,000 pieces of turquoise and jade was created. This artifact is widely recognized as the oldest Chinese dragon totem by many Chinese scholars.\nTurquoise jewelry also held significant importance among the Aztecs, who often featured this precious gemstone in vibrant frescoes for both symbolic and decorative purposes. The Aztecs revered turquoise, associating its color with the heavens and sacredness. Additionally, ancient Egyptians interpreted cyan hues as representing faith and truth, while Tibetans viewed them as a symbol of infinity.\nAfter earlier uses in various contexts, cyan hues found increased use in diverse cultures due to their appealing aesthetic qualities in religious structures and art pieces. For example, the prominent dome of the Goharshad Mosque in Iran, built in 1418, showcases this trend. Additionally, Jacopo da Pontormo's use of a teal shade for Mary's robe in the 1528 painting \"Carmignano Visitation\" demonstrates the allure for these hues. During the 16th century, speakers of the English language began using the term \"turquoise\" to describe the cyan color of objects that resembled the color of the stone.\nImpressionist artists, such as Claude Monet in his renowned \"Water Lilies\", effectively incorporated cyan hues into their works. Deviating from traditional interpretations of local color under neutral lighting conditions, the focus of artists was on accurately depicting perceived color and the influence of light on altering object hues. Specifically, daylight plays a significant role in shifting the perceived color of objects toward cyan hues. In 1917, the color term \"teal\" was introduced to describe deeper shades of cyan.\nIn the late 19th century, while \"traditional\" nomenclature of red, yellow, and blue persisted, the printing industry initiated a shift towards utilizing magenta and cyan inks for red and blue hues, respectively. This transition aimed to establish a more versatile color gamut achievable with only three primary colors. In 1949, a document in the printing industry stated: \u201cThe four-color set comprises Yellow, Red (magenta), Blue (cyan), Black\u201d. This practice of labeling magenta, yellow, and cyan as red, yellow, and blue persisted until 1961. As the hues evolved, the printing industry maintained the use of the \"traditional\" terms red, yellow, and blue. Consequently, pinpointing the exact date of origin for CMYK, in which cyan serves as a primary color, proves \"challenging\".\nIn August 1991, the HP Deskwriter 500C became the first Deskwriter to offer color printing as an option. It used interchangeable black and color (cyan, magenta, and yellow) inkjet print cartridges. With the inclusion of cyan ink in printers, the term \"cyan\" has become widely recognized in both home and office settings. According to TUP/Technology User Profile 2020, approximately 70% of online American adults regularly use a home printer.\nEtymology and terminology.\nIts name is derived from the Ancient Greek word \"kyanos\" (\u03ba\u03cd\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"dark blue enamel, Lapis lazuli\". It was formerly known as \"cyan blue\" or cyan-blue, and its first recorded use as a color name in English was in 1879. Another origin of the color's name can be traced back to a dye produced from the cornflower (\"Centaurea cyanus\").\nIn most languages, 'cyan' is not a basic color term and it phenomenologically appears as a greenish vibrant hue of blue to most English speakers. Other English terms for this \"borderline\" hue region include \"blue green\", \"aqua\", \"turquoise\", \"teal\", and \"grue\".\nOn the web and in printing.\nWeb colors cyan and aqua.\nThe web color cyan shown at right is a secondary color in the RGB color model, which uses combinations of red, green and blue light to create all the colors on computer and television displays. In X11 colors, this color is called both cyan and aqua. In the HTML color list, this same color is called \"aqua\", a name also used due to the color's common association with water, such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach.\nThe web colors are more vivid than the cyan used in the CMYK color system, and the web colors cannot be accurately reproduced on a printed page. To reproduce the web color cyan in inks, it is necessary to add some white ink to the printer's cyan below, so when it is reproduced in printing, it is not a primary subtractive color.\nProcess cyan.\nCyan is also one of the common inks used in four-color printing, along with magenta, yellow, and black; this set of colors is referred to as CMYK. In printing, the cyan ink is sometimes known as printer's cyan, process cyan, or process blue.\nWhile both the additive secondary and the subtractive primary are called \"cyan\", they can be substantially different from one another. Cyan printing ink is typically more saturated than the RGB secondary cyan, depending on what RGB color space and ink are considered. That is, process cyan is usually outside the RGB gamut, and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB. Different formulations are used for printer's ink, so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure cyan ink. This is because real-world subtractive (unlike additive) color mixing does not consistently produce the same result when mixing apparently identical colors, since the specific frequencies filtered out to produce that color affect how it interacts with other colors. Phthalocyanine blue is one such commonly used pigment. A typical formulation of \"process cyan\" is shown in the color box on the right.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6109", "revid": "21226809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6109", "title": "Cream", "text": "Dairy product\nCream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization. In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top. In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called \"separators\". In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content. It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.\nCream skimmed from milk may be called \"sweet cream\" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making. Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy, and \"cheesy\". In many countries partially fermented cream is also sold as: sour cream, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, and so on. Both forms have many culinary uses in both sweet and savoury dishes.\nCream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some fat-soluble carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; traces of these intensely coloured pigments concentrated during separation give cream a slightly yellow hue, hence the name of the yellow-tinged off-white colour cream. Carotenoids are also the origin of butter's yellow colour. Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white.\nCuisine.\nCream is used as an ingredient in many foods, including ice cream, many sauces, soups, stews, puddings, and some custard bases, and is also used for cakes. Whipped cream is served as a topping on ice cream sundaes, milkshakes, lassi, eggnog, sweet pies, strawberries, blueberries, or peaches. Cream is also used in Indian curries such as masala dishes. Both single and double cream (see Types for definitions) can be used in cooking. Double cream or full-fat cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is often used when the cream is added to a hot sauce, to prevent it separating or \"splitting\". Double cream can be thinned with milk to make an approximation of single cream.\nCream (usually light/single cream or half and half) may be added to coffee.\nThe French word denotes not only dairy cream but also other thick liquids such as sweet and savory custards, which are normally made with milk, not cream.\nTypes.\nDifferent grades of cream are distinguished by their fat content, whether they have been heat-treated, whipped, and so on. In many jurisdictions, there are regulations for each type.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nThe Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code \u2013 Standard 2.5.2 \u2013 Defines cream as a milk product comparatively rich in fat, in the form of an emulsion of fat-in-skim milk, which can be obtained by separation from milk. Cream sold without further specification must contain no less than 350 g/kg (35%) milk fat.\nManufacturers labels may distinguish between different fat contents, a general guideline is as follows:\nCanada.\nCanadian cream definitions are similar to those used in the United States, except for \"light cream\", which is very low-fat cream, usually with 5 or 6 percent butterfat. Specific product characteristics are generally uniform throughout Canada, but names vary by both geographic and linguistic area and by manufacturer: \"coffee cream\" may be 10 or 18 percent cream and \"half-and-half\" () may be 3, 5, 6 or 10 percent, all depending on location and brand.\nRegulations allow cream to contain acidity regulators and stabilizers. For whipping cream, allowed additives include skim milk powder (\u2264 0.25%), glucose solids (\u2264 0.1%), calcium sulphate (\u2264 0.005%), and xanthan gum (\u2264 0.02%). The content of milk fat in canned cream must be displayed as a percentage followed by \"milk fat\", \"B.F\", or \"M.F\".\nFrance.\nIn France, the use of the term \"cream\" for food products is defined by the decree 80-313 of April 23, 1980. It specifies the minimum rate of milk fat (12%) as well as the rules for pasteurisation or UHT sterilisation. The mention \"cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche\" (fresh cream) can only be used for pasteurised creams conditioned on production site within 24h after pasteurisation. Even if food additives complying with French and European laws are allowed, usually, none will be found in plain \"cr\u00e8mes\" and \"cr\u00e8mes fra\u00eeches\" apart from lactic ferments (some low cost creams (or close to creams) can contain thickening agents, but rarely). Fat content is commonly shown as \"XX% M.G.\" (\"mati\u00e8re grasse\").\nRussia.\nRussia, as well as other EAC countries, legally separates cream into two classes: normal (10\u201334% butterfat) and heavy (35\u201358%), but the industry has pretty much standardized around the following types:\nSweden.\nIn Sweden, cream is usually sold as:\nMellangr\u00e4dde (27%) is, nowadays, a less common variant. \nGr\u00e4ddfil (usually 12%) and Creme Fraiche (usually around 35%) are two common sour cream products.\nSwitzerland.\nIn Switzerland, the types of cream are legally defined as follows:\nSour cream and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche (German: Sauerrahm, Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche; French: cr\u00e8me acidul\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche; Italian: panna acidula, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche) are defined as cream soured by bacterial cultures.\nThick cream (German: ; French: ; Italian: ) is defined as cream thickened using thickening agents.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, these types of cream are produced. Fat content must meet the Food Labelling Regulations 1996.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, cream is usually sold as:\nNot all grades are defined by all jurisdictions, and the exact fat content ranges vary. The above figures, except for \"manufacturer's cream\", are based on the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 131.\nProcessing and additives.\nCream may have thickening agents and stabilizers added. Thickeners include sodium alginate, carrageenan, gelatine, sodium bicarbonate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and alginic acid.\nOther processing may be carried out. For example, cream has a tendency to produce oily globules (called \"feathering\") when added to coffee. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial demineralisation and addition of sodium caseinate, although this is expensive.\nOther items called \"cream\".\nSome non-edible substances are called creams due to their consistency: shoe cream is runny, unlike regular waxy shoe polish; hand/body \"creme\" or \"skin cream\" is meant for moisturizing the skin.\nRegulations in many jurisdictions restrict the use of the word \"cream\" for foods. Words such as \"creme\", \"kreme\", \"creame\", or \"whipped topping\" (e.g., Cool Whip) are often used for products which cannot legally be called cream, though in some jurisdictions even these spellings may be disallowed, for example under the doctrine of \"idem sonans\". Oreo and Hydrox cookies are a type of sandwich cookie in which two biscuits have a soft, sweet filling between them that is called \"cr\u00e8me filling.\" In some cases, foods can be described as cream although they do not contain predominantly milk fats; for example, in Britain, \"ice cream\" can contain non-milk fat (declared on the label) in addition to or instead of cream, and salad cream is the customary name for a non-dairy condiment that has been produced since the 1920s.\nIn other languages, cognates of \"cream\" are also sometimes used for non-food products, such as fogkr\u00e9m (Hungarian for toothpaste), or Sonnencreme (German for sunscreen).\nSome products are described as \"cream alternatives\". For example, \"Elmlea Double\", etc. are blends of buttermilk or lentils and vegetable oil with other additives sold by Upfield in the United Kingdom packaged and shelved in the same way as cream, labelled as having \"a creamy taste\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The process is often used in the semiconductor industry to produce thin films.\nIn typical CVD, the wafer (substrate) is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposit. Frequently, volatile by-products are also produced, which are removed by gas flow through the reaction chamber.\nMicrofabrication processes widely use CVD to deposit materials in various forms, including: monocrystalline, polycrystalline, amorphous, and epitaxial. These materials include: silicon (dioxide, carbide, nitride, oxynitride), carbon (fiber, nanofibers, nanotubes, diamond and graphene), fluorocarbons, filaments, tungsten, titanium nitride and various high-\u03ba dielectrics.\nThe term \"chemical vapour deposition\" was coined in 1960 by \"John M. Blocher, Jr.\" who intended to differentiate \"chemical\" from \"physical vapour deposition\" (PVD).\nTypes.\nCVD is practiced in a variety of formats. These processes generally differ in the means by which chemical reactions are initiated.\nMost modern CVD is either LPCVD or UHVCVD.\nUses.\nCVD is commonly used to deposit conformal films and augment substrate surfaces in ways that more traditional surface modification techniques are not capable of. CVD is extremely useful in the process of atomic layer deposition at depositing extremely thin layers of material. A variety of applications for such films exist. Gallium arsenide is used in some integrated circuits (ICs) and photovoltaic devices. Amorphous polysilicon is used in photovoltaic devices. Certain carbides and nitrides confer wear-resistance. Polymerization by CVD, perhaps the most versatile of all applications, allows for super-thin coatings which possess some very desirable qualities, such as lubricity, hydrophobicity and weather-resistance to name a few. The CVD of metal-organic frameworks, a class of crystalline nanoporous materials, has recently been demonstrated. Recently scaled up as an integrated cleanroom process depositing large-area substrates, the applications for these films are anticipated in gas sensing and low-\u03ba dielectrics. CVD techniques are advantageous for membrane coatings as well, such as those in desalination or water treatment, as these coatings can be sufficiently uniform (conformal) and thin that they do not clog membrane pores.\nCommercially important materials prepared by CVD.\nPolysilicon.\nPolycrystalline silicon is deposited from trichlorosilane (SiHCl3) or silane (SiH4), using the following reactions:\nSiHCl3 \u2192 Si + Cl2 + HCl\nSiH4 \u2192 Si + 2 H2\nThis reaction is usually performed in LPCVD systems, with either pure silane feedstock, or a solution of silane with 70\u201380% nitrogen. Temperatures between 600 and 650\u00a0\u00b0C and pressures between 25 and 150 Pa yield a growth rate between 10 and 20 nm per minute. An alternative process uses a hydrogen-based solution. The hydrogen reduces the growth rate, but the temperature is raised to 850 or even 1050\u00a0\u00b0C to compensate. Polysilicon may be grown directly with doping, if gases such as phosphine, arsine or diborane are added to the CVD chamber. Diborane increases the growth rate, but arsine and phosphine decrease it.\nSilicon dioxide.\nSilicon dioxide (usually called simply \"oxide\" in the semiconductor industry) may be deposited by several different processes. Common source gases include silane and oxygen, dichlorosilane (SiCl2H2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), or tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS; Si(OC2H5)4). The reactions are as follows:\nSiH4 + O2 \u2192 SiO2 + 2 H2\nSiCl2H2 + 2 N2O \u2192 SiO2 + 2 N2 + 2 HCl\nSi(OC2H5)4 \u2192 SiO2 + byproducts\nThe choice of source gas depends on the thermal stability of the substrate; for instance, aluminium is sensitive to high temperature. Silane deposits between 300 and 500\u00a0\u00b0C, dichlorosilane at around 900\u00a0\u00b0C, and TEOS between 650 and 750\u00a0\u00b0C, resulting in a layer of \"low- temperature oxide\" (LTO). However, silane produces a lower-quality oxide than the other methods (lower dielectric strength, for instance), and it deposits nonconformally. Any of these reactions may be used in LPCVD, but the silane reaction is also done in APCVD. CVD oxide invariably has lower quality than thermal oxide, but thermal oxidation can only be used in the earliest stages of IC manufacturing.\nOxide may also be grown with impurities (alloying or \"doping\"). This may have two purposes. During further process steps that occur at high temperature, the impurities may diffuse from the oxide into adjacent layers (most notably silicon) and dope them. Oxides containing 5\u201315% impurities by mass are often used for this purpose. In addition, silicon dioxide alloyed with phosphorus pentoxide (\"P-glass\") can be used to smooth out uneven surfaces. P-glass softens and reflows at temperatures above 1000\u00a0\u00b0C. This process requires a phosphorus concentration of at least 6%, but concentrations above 8% can corrode aluminium. Phosphorus is deposited from phosphine gas and oxygen:\n4 PH3 + 5 O2 \u2192 2 P2O5 + 6 H2\nGlasses containing both boron and phosphorus (borophosphosilicate glass, BPSG) undergo viscous flow at lower temperatures; around 850\u00a0\u00b0C is achievable with glasses containing around 5 weight % of both constituents, but stability in air can be difficult to achieve. Phosphorus oxide in high concentrations interacts with ambient moisture to produce phosphoric acid. Crystals of BPO4 can also precipitate from the flowing glass on cooling; these crystals are not readily etched in the standard reactive plasmas used to pattern oxides, and will result in circuit defects in integrated circuit manufacturing.\nBesides these intentional impurities, CVD oxide may contain byproducts of the deposition. TEOS produces a relatively pure oxide, whereas silane introduces hydrogen impurities, and dichlorosilane introduces chlorine.\nLower temperature deposition of silicon dioxide and doped glasses from TEOS using ozone rather than oxygen has also been explored (350 to 500\u00a0\u00b0C). Ozone glasses have excellent conformality but tend to be hygroscopic \u2013 that is, they absorb water from the air due to the incorporation of silanol (Si-OH) in the glass. Infrared spectroscopy and mechanical strain as a function of temperature are valuable diagnostic tools for diagnosing such problems.\nSilicon nitride.\nSilicon nitride is often used as an insulator and chemical barrier in manufacturing ICs. The following two reactions deposit silicon nitride from the gas phase:\n3 SiH4 + 4 NH3 \u2192 Si3N4 + 12 H2\n3 SiCl2H2 + 4 NH3 \u2192 Si3N4 + 6 HCl + 6 H2\nSilicon nitride deposited by LPCVD contains up to 8% hydrogen. It also experiences strong tensile stress, which may crack films thicker than 200\u00a0nm. However, it has higher resistivity and dielectric strength than most insulators commonly available in microfabrication (1016 \u03a9\u00b7cm and 10 MV/cm, respectively).\nAnother two reactions may be used in plasma to deposit SiNH:\n2 SiH4 + N2 \u2192 2 SiNH + 3 H2\nSiH4 + NH3 \u2192 SiNH + 3 H2\nThese films have much less tensile stress, but worse electrical properties (resistivity 106 to 1015 \u03a9\u00b7cm, and dielectric strength 1 to 5 MV/cm).\nTitanium nitride.\nTitanium nitride (TiN) is a commonly used as a wear resistant coating to increase the lifetime of cutting tools due to its hardness and chemical resistance. A common gas mixture used for depositing titanium nitride with CVD is:\nTiCl4 + 1/2 N2 + 2 H2 \u2192 TiN(s) + 4 HCl\nOther gas mixtures used to deposit titanium nitride with CVD includes TiCl4 + NH3 + H2.\nMetals.\nTungsten CVD, used for forming conductive contacts, vias, and plugs on a semiconductor device, is achieved from tungsten hexafluoride (WF6), which may be deposited in two ways:\nWF6 \u2192 W + 3 F2\nWF6 + 3 H2 \u2192 W + 6 HF\nOther metals, notably aluminium and copper, can be deposited by CVD. As of 2010[ [update]], commercially cost-effective CVD for copper did not exist, although volatile sources exist, such as Cu(hfac)2. Copper is typically deposited by electroplating. Aluminium can be deposited from triisobutylaluminium (TIBAL) and related organoaluminium compounds.\nCVD for molybdenum, tantalum, titanium, nickel is widely used. These metals can form useful silicides when deposited onto silicon. Mo, Ta and Ti are deposited by LPCVD, from their pentachlorides. Nickel, molybdenum, and tungsten can be deposited at low temperatures from their carbonyl precursors. In general, for an arbitrary metal \"M\", the chloride deposition reaction is as follows:\n2 MCl5 + 5 H2 \u2192 2 M + 10 HCl\nwhereas the carbonyl decomposition reaction can happen spontaneously under thermal treatment or acoustic cavitation and is as follows:\nM(CO)n \u2192 M + n CO\nthe decomposition of metal carbonyls is often violently precipitated by moisture or air, where oxygen reacts with the metal precursor to form metal or metal oxide along with carbon dioxide.\nNiobium(V) oxide layers can be produced by the thermal decomposition of niobium(V) ethoxide with the loss of diethyl ether according to the equation:\n2 Nb(OC2H5)5 \u2192 Nb2O5 + 5 C2H5OC2H5\nGraphene.\nMany variations of CVD can be utilized to synthesize graphene. Although many advancements have been made, the processes listed below are not commercially viable yet.\nCarbon source.\nThe most popular carbon source that is used to produce graphene is methane gas. One of the less popular choices is petroleum asphalt, notable for being inexpensive but more difficult to work with.\nAlthough methane is the most popular carbon source, hydrogen is required during the preparation process to promote carbon deposition on the substrate. If the flow ratio of methane and hydrogen are not appropriate, it will cause undesirable results. During the growth of graphene, the role of methane is to provide a carbon source, the role of hydrogen is to provide H atoms to corrode amorphous C, and improve the quality of graphene. But excessive H atoms can also corrode graphene. As a result, the integrity of the crystal lattice is destroyed, and the quality of graphene is deteriorated. Therefore, by optimizing the flow rate of methane and hydrogen gases in the growth process, the quality of graphene can be improved.\nUse of catalyst.\nThe use of catalyst is viable in changing the physical process of graphene production. Notable examples include iron nanoparticles, nickel foam, and gallium vapor. These catalysts can either be used in situ during graphene buildup, or situated at some distance away at the deposition area. Some catalysts require another step to remove them from the sample material.\nThe direct growth of high-quality, large single-crystalline domains of graphene on a dielectric substrate is of vital importance for applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Combining the advantages of both catalytic CVD and the ultra-flat dielectric substrate, gaseous catalyst-assisted CVD paves the way for synthesizing high-quality graphene for device applications while avoiding the transfer process.\nPhysical conditions.\nPhysical conditions such as surrounding pressure, temperature, carrier gas, and chamber material play a big role in production of graphene.\nMost systems use LPCVD with pressures ranging from 1 to 1500 Pa. However, some still use APCVD. Low pressures are used more commonly as they help prevent unwanted reactions and produce more uniform thickness of deposition on the substrate.\nOn the other hand, temperatures used range from 800 to 1050\u00a0\u00b0C. High temperatures translate to an increase of the rate of reaction. Caution has to be exercised as high temperatures do pose higher danger levels in addition to greater energy costs.\nCarrier gas.\nHydrogen gas and inert gases such as argon are flowed into the system. These gases act as a carrier, enhancing surface reaction and improving reaction rate, thereby increasing deposition of graphene onto the substrate.\nChamber material.\nStandard quartz tubing and chambers are used in CVD of graphene. Quartz is chosen because it has a very high melting point and is chemically inert. In other words, quartz does not interfere with any physical or chemical reactions regardless of the conditions.\nMethods of analysis of results.\nRaman spectroscopy, X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used to examine and characterize the graphene samples.\nRaman spectroscopy is used to characterize and identify the graphene particles; X-ray spectroscopy is used to characterize chemical states; TEM is used to provide fine details regarding the internal composition of graphene; SEM is used to examine the surface and topography.\nSometimes, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to measure local properties such as friction and magnetism.\nX-ray diffraction methods are useful techniques to analyze thin films. X-ray diffraction methods such as Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction can be used to qualify the phases present in deposited films. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) can be used to measure the thickness and roughness of deposited films. Pole figure measurements are useful and can be used to investigate textures and preferential orientations in deposited films.\nCold wall CVD technique can be used to study the underlying surface science involved in graphene nucleation and growth as it allows unprecedented control of process parameters like gas flow rates, temperature and pressure as demonstrated in a recent study. The study was carried out in a home-built vertical cold wall system utilizing resistive heating by passing direct current through the substrate. It provided conclusive insight into a typical surface-mediated nucleation and growth mechanism involved in two-dimensional materials grown using catalytic CVD under conditions sought out in the semiconductor industry.\nGraphene nanoribbon.\nIn spite of graphene's exciting electronic and thermal properties, it is unsuitable as a transistor for future digital devices, due to the absence of a bandgap between the conduction and valence bands. This makes it impossible to switch between on and off states with respect to electron flow. Scaling things down, graphene nanoribbons of less than 10\u00a0nm in width do exhibit electronic bandgaps and are therefore potential candidates for digital devices. Precise control over their dimensions, and hence electronic properties, however, represents a challenging goal, and the ribbons typically possess rough edges that are detrimental to their performance.\nDiamond.\nCVD can be used to produce a synthetic diamond by creating the circumstances necessary for carbon atoms in a gas to settle on a substrate in crystalline form. CVD of diamonds has received much attention in the materials sciences because it allows many new applications that had previously been considered too expensive. CVD diamond growth typically occurs under low pressure (1\u201327 kPa; 0.145\u20133.926 psi; 7.5\u2013203 Torr) and involves feeding varying amounts of gases into a chamber, energizing them and providing conditions for diamond growth on the substrate. The gases always include a carbon source, and typically include hydrogen as well, though the amounts used vary greatly depending on the type of diamond being grown. Energy sources include hot filament, microwave power, and arc discharges, among others. The energy source is intended to generate a plasma in which the gases are broken down and more complex chemistries occur. The actual chemical process for diamond growth is still under study and is complicated by the very wide variety of diamond growth processes used.\nUsing CVD, films of diamond can be grown over large areas of substrate with control over the properties of the diamond produced. In the past, when high pressure high temperature (HPHT) techniques were used to produce a diamond, the result was typically very small free-standing diamonds of varying sizes. With CVD diamond, growth areas of greater than fifteen centimeters (six inches) in diameter have been achieved, and much larger areas are likely to be successfully coated with diamond in the future. Improving this process is key to enabling several important applications.\nThe growth of diamond directly on a substrate allows the addition of many of diamond's important qualities to other materials. Since diamond has the highest thermal conductivity of any bulk material, layering diamond onto high heat-producing electronics (such as optics and transistors) allows the diamond to be used as a heat sink. Diamond films are being grown on valve rings, cutting tools, and other objects that benefit from diamond's hardness and exceedingly low wear rate. In each case the diamond growth must be carefully done to achieve the necessary adhesion onto the substrate. Diamond's very high scratch resistance and thermal conductivity, combined with a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than Pyrex glass, a coefficient of friction close to that of Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene) and strong lipophilicity would make it a nearly ideal non-stick coating for cookware if large substrate areas could be coated economically.\nCVD growth allows one to control the properties of the diamond produced. In the area of diamond growth, the word \"diamond\" is used as a description of any material primarily made up of sp3-bonded carbon, and there are many different types of diamond included in this. By regulating the processing parameters\u2014especially the gases introduced, but also including the pressure the system is operated under, the temperature of the diamond, and the method of generating plasma\u2014many different materials that can be considered diamond can be made. Single-crystal diamond can be made containing various dopants. Polycrystalline diamond consisting of grain sizes from several nanometers to several micrometers can be grown. Some polycrystalline diamond grains are surrounded by thin, non-diamond carbon, while others are not. These different factors affect the diamond's hardness, smoothness, conductivity, optical properties and more.\nChalcogenides.\nCommercially, mercury cadmium telluride is of continuing interest for detection of infrared radiation. Consisting of an alloy of CdTe and HgTe, this material can be prepared from the dimethyl derivatives of the respective elements.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6112", "revid": "3080835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6112", "title": "CN Tower", "text": "Communications and observation tower in Toronto, Canada\nThe CN Tower () is a communications and observation tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Completed in 1976, it is located in downtown Toronto, built on the former Railway Lands. Its name \"CN\" refers to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for the government's real estate portfolio.\nThe CN Tower held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years, from 1975 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa, and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 when it was surpassed by the Canton Tower. It is currently the tenth-tallest free-standing structure in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure on land in the Western Hemisphere. In 1995, the CN Tower was declared one of the modern Seven Wonders of the World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It also belongs to the World Federation of Great Towers.\nIt is a signature icon of Toronto's skyline and attracts more than two\u00a0million international visitors annually. It houses several observation decks, a revolving restaurant at some , and an entertainment complex.\nHistory.\nThe original concept of the CN Tower was first conceived in 1968 when the Canadian National Railway wanted to build a large television and radio communication platform to serve the Toronto area, and to demonstrate the strength of Canadian industry and CN in particular. These plans evolved over the next few years, and the project became official in 1972.\nThe tower would have been part of Metro Centre (see CityPlace), a large development south of Front Street on the Railway Lands, a large railway switching yard that was being made redundant after the opening of the MacMillan Yard north of the city in 1965 (then known as Toronto Yard). Key project team members were NCK Engineering as structural engineer; John Andrews Architects; Webb, Zerafa, Menkes, Housden Architects; Foundation Building Construction; and Canron (Eastern Structural Division).\nAs Toronto grew rapidly during the late 1960s and early 1970s, multiple skyscrapers were constructed in the downtown core, most notably First Canadian Place, which houses Bank of Montreal's head offices. The reflective nature of the new buildings reduced the quality of broadcast signals, requiring new, higher antennas that were at least tall. The radio wire is estimated to be long in 44 pieces, the heaviest of which weighs around .\nAt the time, most data communications took place over point-to-point microwave links, whose dish antennas covered the roofs of large buildings. As each new skyscraper was added to the downtown, former line-of-sight links were no longer possible. CN intended to rent \"hub\" space for microwave links, visible from almost any building in the Toronto area.\nThe original plan for the tower envisioned a tripod consisting of three independent cylindrical \"pillars\" linked at various heights by structural bridges. Had it been built, this design would have been considerably shorter, with the metal antenna located roughly where the concrete section between the main level and The Top lies today. As the design effort continued, it evolved into the current design with a single continuous hexagonal core to The Top, with three support legs blended into the hexagon below the main level, forming a large Y-shape structure at the ground level.\nThe idea for the main level in its current form evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (currently named The Top, and originally dubbed 'Bud's Bubble' named after Bud Andrews) was not part of the plans until later. Bud Andrews (president of the Metro Centre Developments Group) felt that visitors would feel the higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. Also around this time, it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest free-standing structure to improve signal quality and attract tourists, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.\nConstruction.\nThe CN Tower was built by Foundation Company of Canada with Canron of Etobicoke handling the steel and antenna fabrication work. \nConstruction began on February 6, 1973, with massive excavations at the tower base for the foundation. By the time the foundation was complete, of earth and shale were removed to a depth of in the centre, and a base incorporating of concrete with of rebar and of steel cable had been built to a thickness of . This portion of the construction was fairly rapid, with only four months needed between the start and the foundation being ready for construction on top.\nTo create the main support pillar, workers constructed a hydraulically raised slipform at the base. This was a fairly unprecedented engineering feat on its own, consisting of a large metal platform that raised itself on jacks at about per day as the concrete below set. Concrete was poured Monday to Friday (not continuously) by a small team of people until February 22, 1974, at which time it had already become the tallest structure in Canada, surpassing the recently built tall Inco Superstack in Sudbury, built using similar methods.\nThe tower contains of concrete, all of which was mixed on-site in order to ensure batch consistency. Through the pour, the vertical accuracy of the tower was maintained by comparing the slip form's location to massive plumb bobs hanging from it, observed by small telescopes from the ground. Over the height of the tower, it varies from true vertical accuracy by only .\nIn August 1974, construction of the main level commenced. Using 45 hydraulic jacks attached to cables strung from a temporary steel crown anchored to the top of the tower, twelve giant steel and wooden bracket forms were slowly raised, ultimately taking about a week to crawl up to their final position. These forms were used to create the brackets that support the main level, as well as a base for the construction of the main level itself. The Top was built of concrete poured into a wooden frame attached to rebar at the lower level deck, and then reinforced with a large steel compression band around the outside.\nWhile still under construction, the CN Tower officially became the world's tallest free-standing structure on March 31, 1975.\nThe antenna was originally to be raised by crane as well, but, during construction, the Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane helicopter became available when the United States Army sold one to civilian operators. The helicopter, named \"Olga\", was first used to remove the crane, and then flew the antenna up in 36 sections.\nThe flights of the antenna pieces were a minor tourist attraction of their own, and the schedule was printed in local newspapers. Use of the helicopter saved months of construction time, with this phase taking only three and a half weeks instead of the planned six months. The tower was topped-off on April 2, 1975, after 26 months of construction, officially capturing the height record from Moscow's Ostankino Tower, and bringing the total mass to .\nTwo years into the construction, plans for Metro Centre were scrapped, leaving the tower isolated on the Railway Lands in what was then a largely abandoned light-industrial space. This caused serious problems for tourists to access the tower. Ned Baldwin, project architect with John Andrews, wrote at the time that \"All of the logic which dictated the design of the lower accommodation has been upset,\" and that \"Under such ludicrous circumstances Canadian National would hardly have chosen this location to build.\"\nOpening.\nThe CN Tower opened on June 26, 1976. The construction costs of approximately CA$ ($ in 2023 dollars) were repaid in fifteen years.\nFrom the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, the CN Tower was practically the only development along Front Street West; it was still possible to see Lake Ontario from the foot of the CN Tower due to the expansive parking lots and lack of development in the area at the time. As the area around the tower was developed, particularly with the completion of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (north building) in 1984 and SkyDome in 1989 (renamed Rogers Centre in 2005), the former Railway Lands were redeveloped and the tower became the centre of a newly developing entertainment area. Access was greatly improved with the construction of the SkyWalk in 1989, which connected the tower and SkyDome to the nearby Union Station railway and subway station, and, in turn, to the city's Path underground pedestrian system. By the mid-1990s, it was the centre of a thriving tourist district. The entire area continues to be an area of intense building, notably a boom in condominium construction in the early 21st century, as well as the 2013 opening of the Ripley's Aquarium by the base of the tower.\nEarly years.\nWhen the CN Tower opened in 1976, there were three public observation points: The Top (then known as the Space Deck) that stands at , the Indoor Observation Level (later named Main Observation Level) at , and the Outdoor Observation Terrace (at the same level as the Glass Floor) at . One floor above the Indoor Observation Level was the Top of Toronto Restaurant (now named \"360 The Restaurant at the CN Tower\"), which completed a revolution once every 72 minutes.\nThe tower would garner worldwide media attention when stuntman Dar Robinson jumped off the CN Tower on two occasions in 1979 and 1980. The first was for a scene from the movie \"Highpoint\", in which Robinson received CA$ ($ in 2023 dollars) for the stunt. The second was for a personal documentary. The first stunt had him use a parachute that he deployed three seconds before impact with the ground, while the second one used a wire decelerator attached to his back.\nOn June 26, 1986, the tenth anniversary of the tower's opening, high-rise firefighting and rescue advocate Dan Goodwin, in a sponsored publicity event, used his hands and feet to climb the outside of the tower, a feat he performed twice on the same day. Following both ascents, he used multiple rappels to descend to the ground.\nFrom 1985 to 1992, the CN Tower basement level hosted the world's first flight simulator ride, Tour of the Universe, based on the flight of a Space Shuttle. The ride was replaced in 1992 with a similar attraction entitled \"Space Race.\" It was later dismantled and replaced by two other rides in 1998 and 1999.\nThe 1990s and 2000s.\nA glass floor at an elevation of was installed in 1994. Canadian National Railway sold the tower to Canada Lands Company prior to privatizing the company in 1995, when it divested all operations not directly related to its core freight shipping businesses. The tower's name and wordmark were adjusted to remove the CN railways logo, and the tower's official name was renamed Canada's National Tower (from Canadian National Tower), though the tower is commonly called the CN Tower.\nFurther changes were made from 1997 to January 2004: TrizecHahn Corporation managed the tower and instituted several expansion projects including a CA$ entertainment expansion, the 1997 addition of two new elevators (to a total of six) and the consequential relocation of the staircase from the north side leg to inside the core of the building, a conversion that also added nine stairs to the climb. TrizecHahn also owned the Willis Tower (Sears Tower at the time) in Chicago approximately at the same time.\nIn 2007, light-emitting diode (LED) lights replaced the incandescent lights that lit the CN Tower at night. This was done to take advantage of the cost savings of LED lights over incandescent lights. The colour of the LED lights can change, compared to the constant white colour of the incandescent lights. On September 12, 2007, Burj Khalifa in Dubai, then under construction and known as Burj Dubai, surpassed the CN Tower as the world's tallest free-standing structure on land. In 2008, glass panels were installed in one of the CN Tower elevators, which established a world record () for highest glass floor panelled elevator in the world.\n2010s: EdgeWalk.\nOn August 1, 2011, the CN Tower opened the EdgeWalk, an amusement in which thrill-seekers can walk on and around the roof of the main pod of the tower at , which is directly above the 360 Restaurant. It is the world's highest full-circle, hands-free walk. Visitors are tethered to an overhead rail system and walk around the edge of the CN Tower's main pod above the 360 Restaurant on a metal floor. The attraction is closed throughout the winter and during periods of electrical storms and high winds.\nOne of the notable guests who visited EdgeWalk was Canadian comedian Rick Mercer, featured as the first episode of the ninth season of his CBC Television news satire show, \"Rick Mercer Report\". There, he was accompanied by Canadian pop singer Jann Arden. The episode first aired on April 10, 2013.\n2015 Pan Am Games.\nThe tower and surrounding areas were prominent in the 2015 Pan American Games production. In the opening ceremony, a pre-recorded segment featured track-and-field athlete Bruny Surin passing the flame to sprinter Donovan Bailey on the EdgeWalk and parachuting into Rogers Centre. A fireworks display off the tower concluded both the opening and closing ceremonies.\nCanada 150.\nOn July 1, 2017, as part of the nationwide celebrations for Canada 150, which celebrated the 150th anniversary of Canadian Confederation, fireworks were once again shot from the tower in a five-minute display coordinated with the tower lights and music broadcast on a local radio station.\n2020s.\nThe CN Tower closed during much of the COVID-19 pandemic. During much of the pandemic, the gift shop was renovated to take advantage of the lack of visitors from the tower's closure.\nStructure.\nThe CN Tower consists of several substructures. The main portion of the tower is a hollow concrete hexagonal pillar containing the stairwells and power and plumbing connections. The tower's six elevators are located in the three inverted angles created by the Tower's hexagonal shape (two elevators per angle). Each of the three elevator shafts is lined with glass, allowing for views of the city as the glass-windowed elevators make their way through the tower. The stairwell was originally located in one of these angles (the one facing north), but was moved into the central hollow of the tower; the tower's new fifth and sixth elevators were placed in the hexagonal angle that once contained the stairwell. On top of the main concrete portion of the tower is a tall metal broadcast antenna, carrying television and radio signals. There are three visitor areas: \nThe hexagonal shape is visible between the two highest areas; however, below the main deck, three large supporting legs give the tower the appearance of a large tripod.\nThe main deck level has seven storeys, some of which are open to the public. Below the public areas\u2014at \u2014is a large white donut-shaped radome containing the structure's UHF transmitters. The glass floor at the Lower Observation Level has an area of and can withstand a pressure of . The floor's thermal glass units are thick, consisting of a pane of laminated glass, airspace and a pane of laminated glass. In 2008, one elevator was upgraded to add a glass floor panel, believed to have the highest vertical rise of any elevator equipped with this feature. The Horizons Cafe and the lookout level are at . The 360 Restaurant (formally \"360 The Restaurant at the CN Tower\"), a revolving restaurant that completes a full rotation once every 72 minutes, is at . When the tower first opened, it also featured a discotheque named Sparkles (at the Indoor Observation Level), billed as the highest disco and dance floor in the world.\nThe Top was once the highest public observation deck in the world until it was surpassed by the Shanghai World Financial Center in 2008.\nA metal staircase reaches the main deck level after 1,776 steps, and The Top above after 2,579 steps; it is the tallest metal staircase on Earth. These stairs are intended for emergency use only except for charity stair-climb events two times during the year. The average climber takes approximately 30 minutes to climb to the base of the radome, but the fastest climb on record is 7 minutes and 52 seconds in 1989 by Brendan Keenoy, an Ontario Provincial Police officer. In 2002, Canadian Olympian and Paralympic champion Jeff Adams climbed the stairs of the tower in a specially designed wheelchair. The stairs were originally on one of the three sides of the tower (facing north), with a glass view, but these were later replaced with the third elevator pair and the stairs were moved to the inside of the core. Top climbs on the new, windowless stairwell used since around 2003 have generally been over ten minutes.\nFalling ice danger.\nA freezing rain storm on March 2, 2007, resulted in a layer of ice several centimetres thick forming on the side of the tower and other downtown buildings. The sun thawed the ice, then winds of up to blew some of it away from the structure. There were fears that cars and windows of nearby buildings would be smashed by large chunks of ice. In response, police closed some streets surrounding the tower. During morning rush hour on March 5 of the same year, police expanded the area of closed streets to include the Gardiner Expressway away from the tower as increased winds blew the ice farther, as far north as King Street West, away, where a taxicab window was shattered. Subsequently, on March 6, 2007, the Gardiner Expressway reopened after winds abated.\nOn April 16, 2018, falling ice from the CN Tower punctured the roof of the nearby Rogers Centre stadium, causing the Toronto Blue Jays to postpone the game that day to the following day as a doubleheader; this was the third doubleheader held at the Rogers Centre. On April 20 of the same year, the CN Tower reopened.\nSafety features.\nIn August 2000, a fire broke out at the Ostankino Tower in Moscow, killing three people and causing extensive damage. The fire was blamed on poor maintenance and outdated equipment. The failure of the fire-suppression systems and the lack of proper equipment for firefighters allowed the fire to destroy most of the interior and sparked fears the tower might even collapse.\nThe Ostankino Tower was completed nine years before the CN Tower and is only shorter. The parallels between the towers led to some concern that the CN Tower could be at risk of a similar tragedy. However, Canadian officials subsequently stated that it is \"highly unlikely\" that a similar disaster could occur at the CN Tower, as it has important safeguards that were not present in the Ostankino Tower. Specifically, officials cited:\nOfficials also noted that the CN Tower has an excellent safety record, although there was an electrical fire in the antennas on August 16, 2017 \u2014 the tower's first fire. Moreover, other supertall structures built between 1967 and 1976 \u2014 such as the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower), the World Trade Center (until its destruction on September 11, 2001), the Fernsehturm Berlin, the Aon Center, 875 North Michigan Avenue (formerly the John Hancock Center), and First Canadian Place \u2014 also have excellent safety records, which suggests that the Ostankino Tower accident was a rare safety failure, and that the likelihood of similar events occurring at other supertall structures is extremely low.\nLighting.\nThe CN Tower was originally lit at night with incandescent lights, which were removed in 1997 because they were inefficient and expensive to repair. In June 2007, the tower was outfitted with 1,330 super-bright LED lights inside the elevator shafts, shooting over the main pod and upward to the top of the tower's mast to light the tower from dusk until 2 a.m. the next calendar day. The official opening ceremony took place on June 28, 2007, before the Canada Day holiday weekend.\nThe tower changes its lighting scheme on holidays and to commemorate major events. After the 95th Grey Cup in Toronto, the tower was lit in green and white to represent the colours of the Grey Cup champion Saskatchewan Roughriders. From sundown on August 27, 2011, to sunrise the following day, the tower was lit in orange, the official colour of the New Democratic Party (NDP), to commemorate the death of federal NDP leader and leader of the official opposition Jack Layton. When former South African president Nelson Mandela died, the tower was lit in the colours of the South African flag. When former federal finance minister under Stephen Harper's Conservatives Jim Flaherty died, the tower was lit in green to reflect his Irish Canadian heritage. On the night of the attacks on Paris on November 13, 2015, the tower displayed the colours of the French flag. On June 8, 2021, the tower displayed the colours of the Toronto Maple Leafs' archrivals Montreal Canadiens after they advanced to the semifinals of 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs. The CN Tower was lit in the colours of the Ukrainian flag during the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. On June 4, 2025, the CN Tower was lit in the colours of the Edmonton Oilers for the 2025 Stanley Cup Final.\nProgrammed remotely from a desktop computer with a wireless network interface controller in Burlington, Ontario, the LEDs use less energy to light than the previous incandescent lights (10% less energy than the dimly lit version and 60% less than the brightly lit version). The estimated cost to use the LEDs is $1,000 per month.\nDuring the spring and autumn bird migration seasons, the lights are turned off to comply with the voluntary Fatal Light Awareness Program, which \"encourages buildings to dim unnecessary exterior lighting to mitigate bird mortality during spring and summer migration.\"\nHeight comparisons.\nThe CN Tower is the tallest freestanding structure in the Western Hemisphere. As of 2013, there were two other freestanding structures in the Western Hemisphere exceeding in height: the Willis Tower in Chicago, which stands at when measured to its pinnacle, and One World Trade Center in New York City, which has a pinnacle height of , or approximately shorter than the CN Tower. Due to the symbolism of the number 1776 (the year of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence), the height of One World Trade Center is unlikely to be increased. The proposed Chicago Spire was expected to exceed the height of the CN Tower, but its construction was halted early due to financial difficulties amid the Great Recession, and was eventually cancelled in 2010 and replaced with 400 Lake Shore.\nHeight distinction debate.\n\"World's Tallest Tower\" title.\n\"Guinness World Records\" has called the CN Tower \"the world's tallest self-supporting tower\" and \"the world's tallest free-standing tower\". Although Guinness did list this description of the CN Tower under the heading \"tallest building\" at least once, it has also listed it under \"tallest tower\", omitting it from its list of \"tallest buildings.\" In 1996, Guinness changed the tower's classification to \"World's Tallest Building and Freestanding Structure\". Emporis and the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat both listed the CN Tower as the world's tallest free-standing structure on land, and specifically state that the CN Tower is not a true building, thereby awarding the title of world's tallest building to Taipei 101, which is shorter than the CN Tower. The issue of what was tallest became moot when Burj Khalifa, then under construction, exceeded the height of the CN Tower in 2007 (see below).\nAlthough the CN Tower contains a restaurant, a gift shop and multiple observation levels, it does not have floors continuously from the ground, and therefore it is not considered a building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) or Emporis. CTBUH defines a building as \"a structure that is designed for residential, business, or manufacturing purposes. An essential characteristic of a building is that it has floors.\" The CN Tower and other similar structures\u2014such as the Ostankino Tower in Moscow, Russia; the Oriental Pearl Tower in Shanghai, China; The Strat in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States; and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France\u2014are categorized as \"towers\", which are free-standing structures that may have observation decks and a few other habitable levels, but do not have floors from the ground up. The CN Tower was the tallest tower by this definition until 2010 (see below).\nTaller than the CN Tower are numerous radio masts and towers, which are held in place by guy-wires, the tallest being the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, in the United States at tall, leading to a distinction between these and \"free-standing\" structures. Additionally, the Petronius Platform stands above its base on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico near the Mississippi River Delta, but only the top of this oil and natural gas platform are above water, and the structure is thus partially supported by its buoyancy. Like the CN Tower, none of these taller structures are commonly considered buildings.\nOn September 12, 2007, Burj Khalifa, which is a hotel, residential and commercial building in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (formerly known as Burj Dubai before opening), passed the CN Tower's 553.33-m height. The CN Tower held the record of the tallest freestanding structure on land for over 30 years.\nAfter Burj Khalifa had been formally recognized by the Guinness World Records as the world's tallest freestanding structure, Guinness re-certified CN Tower as the world's tallest freestanding tower. The tower definition used by Guinness was defined by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat as 'a building in which less than 50% of the construction is usable floor space'. \"Guinness World Records\" editor-in-chief Craig Glenday announced that Burj Khalifa was not classified as a tower because it has too much usable floor space to be considered to be a tower. CN Tower still held world records for highest above ground wine cellar (in 360 Restaurant) at 351 m, highest above-ground restaurant at 346 m (Horizons Restaurant), and tallest free-standing concrete tower during Guinness's recertification. The CN Tower was surpassed in 2009 by the Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China, which stands at tall, as the world's tallest tower; which in turn was surpassed by the Tokyo Skytree in 2011, which currently is the tallest tower at in height. The CN Tower, as of 2022, stands as the tenth-tallest free-standing structure on land, remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, and is the third-tallest tower. The CN Tower is the second-tallest free-standing structure in the Commonwealth of Nations behind Merdeka 118 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nHeight records.\nSince its construction, the tower has gained the following world height records:\nUse.\nThe CN Tower has been and continues to be used as a communications tower for a number of different media and by numerous companies.\nRadio.\nThere is no AM broadcasting from the CN Tower. The FM transmitters are situated in a metal broadcast antenna, on top of the main concrete portion of the tower at an elevation above from the ground.\nIn popular culture.\nThe CN Tower has been featured in numerous films, television shows, music recording covers, and video games. The tower also has its own official mascot, which resembles the tower itself.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

More precisely, if formula_1 is the function such that formula_2 for every x, then the chain rule is, in Lagrange's notation,\nformula_3\nor, equivalently,\nformula_4\nThe chain rule may also be expressed in Leibniz's notation. If a variable z depends on the variable y, which itself depends on the variable x (that is, y and z are dependent variables), then z depends on x as well, via the intermediate variable y. In this case, the chain rule is expressed as\nformula_5 \nand\nformula_6\nfor indicating at which points the derivatives have to be evaluated.\nIn integration, the counterpart to the chain rule is the substitution rule.\nIntuitive explanation.\nIntuitively, the chain rule states that knowing the instantaneous rate of change of \"z\" relative to \"y\" and that of \"y\" relative to \"x\" allows one to calculate the instantaneous rate of change of \"z\" relative to \"x\" as the product of the two rates of change.\nAs put by George F. Simmons: \"If a car travels twice as fast as a bicycle and the bicycle is four times as fast as a walking man, then the car travels 2 \u00d7 4 = 8 times as fast as the man.\"\nThe relationship between this example and the chain rule is as follows. Let z, y and x be the (variable) positions of the car, the bicycle, and the walking man, respectively. The rate of change of relative positions of the car and the bicycle is formula_7 Similarly, formula_8 So, the rate of change of the relative positions of the car and the walking man is\nformula_9\nThe rate of change of positions is the ratio of the speeds, and the speed is the derivative of the position with respect to the time; that is,\nformula_10\nor, equivalently,\nformula_11\nwhich is also an application of the chain rule.\nHistory.\nThe chain rule seems to have first been used by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. He used it to calculate the derivative of formula_12 as the composite of the square root function and the function formula_13. He first mentioned it in a 1676 memoir (with a sign error in the calculation). The common notation of the chain rule is due to Leibniz. Guillaume de l'H\u00f4pital used the chain rule implicitly in his \"Analyse des infiniment petits\". The chain rule does not appear in any of Leonhard Euler's analysis books, even though they were written over a hundred years after Leibniz's discovery.. It is believed that the first \"modern\" version of the chain rule appears in Lagrange's 1797 \"Th\u00e9orie des fonctions analytiques\"; it also appears in Cauchy's 1823 \"R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des Le\u00e7ons donn\u00e9es a L\u2019\u00c9cole Royale Polytechnique sur Le Calcul Infinitesimal\".\nStatement.\nThe simplest form of the chain rule is for real-valued functions of one real variable. It states that if \"g\" is a function that is differentiable at a point \"c\" (i.e.\u00a0the derivative \"g\"\u2032(\"c\") exists) and \"f\" is a function that is differentiable at \"g\"(\"c\"), then the composite function formula_14 is differentiable at \"c\", and the derivative is\nformula_15\nThe rule is sometimes abbreviated as\nformula_16\nIf \"y\" = \"f\"(\"u\") and \"u\" = \"g\"(\"x\"), then this abbreviated form is written in Leibniz notation as:\nformula_17\nThe points where the derivatives are evaluated may also be stated explicitly:\nformula_18\nCarrying the same reasoning further, given \"n\" functions formula_19 with the composite function formula_20, if each function formula_21 is differentiable at its immediate input, then the composite function is also differentiable by the repeated application of Chain Rule, where the derivative is (in Leibniz's notation):\nformula_22\nApplications.\nComposites of more than two functions.\nThe chain rule can be applied to composites of more than two functions. To take the derivative of a composite of more than two functions, notice that the composite of f, g, and \"h\" (in that order) is the composite of f with \"g\" \u2218 \"h\". The chain rule states that to compute the derivative of \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" \u2218 \"h\", it is sufficient to compute the derivative of \"f\" and the derivative of \"g\" \u2218 \"h\". The derivative of f can be calculated directly, and the derivative of \"g\" \u2218 \"h\" can be calculated by applying the chain rule again.\nFor concreteness, consider the function\nformula_23\nThis can be decomposed as the composite of three functions:\nformula_24\nSo that formula_25.\nTheir derivatives are:\nformula_26\nThe chain rule states that the derivative of their composite at the point \"x\" = \"a\" is:\nformula_27\nIn Leibniz's notation, this is:\nformula_28\nor for short,\nformula_29\nThe derivative function is therefore:\nformula_30\nAnother way of computing this derivative is to view the composite function \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" \u2218 \"h\" as the composite of \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" and \"h\". Applying the chain rule in this manner would yield:\nformula_31\nThis is the same as what was computed above. This should be expected because (\"f\" \u2218 \"g\") \u2218 \"h\" = \"f\" \u2218 (\"g\" \u2218 \"h\").\nSometimes, it is necessary to differentiate an arbitrarily long composition of the form formula_32. In this case, define\nformula_33\nwhere formula_34 and formula_35 when formula_36. Then the chain rule takes the form\nformula_37\nor, in the Lagrange notation,\nformula_38\nQuotient rule.\nThe chain rule can be used to derive some well-known differentiation rules. For example, the quotient rule is a consequence of the chain rule and the product rule. To see this, write the function \"f\"(\"x\")/\"g\"(\"x\") as the product \"f\"(\"x\") \u00b7 1/\"g\"(\"x\"). First apply the product rule:\nformula_39\nTo compute the derivative of 1/\"g\"(\"x\"), notice that it is the composite of g with the reciprocal function, that is, the function that sends x to 1/\"x\". The derivative of the reciprocal function is formula_40. By applying the chain rule, the last expression becomes:\nformula_41\nwhich is the usual formula for the quotient rule.\nDerivatives of inverse functions.\nSuppose that \"y\" = \"g\"(\"x\") has an inverse function. Call its inverse function f so that we have \"x\" = \"f\"(\"y\"). There is a formula for the derivative of f in terms of the derivative of g. To see this, note that f and g satisfy the formula\nformula_42\nAnd because the functions formula_43 and x are equal, their derivatives must be equal. The derivative of x is the constant function with value 1, and the derivative of formula_43 is determined by the chain rule. Therefore, we have that:\nformula_45\nTo express f' as a function of an independent variable y, we substitute formula_46 for x wherever it appears. Then we can solve for f'.\nformula_47\nFor example, consider the function \"g\"(\"x\") = \"e\"\"x\". It has an inverse \"f\"(\"y\") = ln \"y\". Because \"g\"\u2032(\"x\") = \"e\"\"x\", the above formula says that\nformula_48\nThis formula is true whenever g is differentiable and its inverse f is also differentiable. This formula can fail when one of these conditions is not true. For example, consider \"g\"(\"x\") = \"x\"3. Its inverse is \"f\"(\"y\") = \"y\"1/3, which is not differentiable at zero. If we attempt to use the above formula to compute the derivative of f at zero, then we must evaluate 1/\"g\"\u2032(\"f\"(0)). Since \"f\"(0) = 0 and \"g\"\u2032(0) = 0, we must evaluate 1/0, which is undefined. Therefore, the formula fails in this case. This is not surprising because f is not differentiable at zero.\nBack propagation.\nThe chain rule forms the basis of the back propagation algorithm, which is used in gradient descent of neural networks in deep learning (artificial intelligence).\nHigher derivatives.\nFa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula generalizes the chain rule to higher derivatives. Assuming that \"y\" \n \"f\"(\"u\") and \"u\" \n \"g\"(\"x\"), then the first few derivatives are:\nformula_49\nProofs.\nFirst proof.\nOne proof of the chain rule begins by defining the derivative of the composite function \"f\" \u2218 \"g\", where we take the limit of the difference quotient for \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" as x approaches a:\nformula_50\nAssume for the moment that formula_51 does not equal formula_52 for any formula_53 near formula_54. Then the previous expression is equal to the product of two factors:\nformula_55\nIf formula_56 oscillates near a, then it might happen that no matter how close one gets to a, there is always an even closer x such that \"g\"(\"x\") = \"g\"(\"a\"). For example, this happens near \"a\" = 0 for the continuous function g defined by \"g\"(\"x\") = 0 for \"x\" = 0 and \"g\"(\"x\") = \"x\"2 sin(1/\"x\") otherwise. Whenever this happens, the above expression is undefined because it involves division by zero. To work around this, introduce a function formula_57 as follows:\nformula_58\nWe will show that the difference quotient for \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" is always equal to:\nformula_59\nWhenever \"g\"(\"x\") is not equal to \"g\"(\"a\"), this is clear because the factors of \"g\"(\"x\") \u2212 \"g\"(\"a\") cancel. When \"g\"(\"x\") equals \"g\"(\"a\"), then the difference quotient for \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" is zero because \"f\"(\"g\"(\"x\")) equals \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\")), and the above product is zero because it equals \"f\"\u2032(\"g\"(\"a\")) times zero. So the above product is always equal to the difference quotient, and to show that the derivative of \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" at \"a\" exists and to determine its value, we need only show that the limit as \"x\" goes to \"a\" of the above product exists and determine its value.\nTo do this, recall that the limit of a product exists if the limits of its factors exist. When this happens, the limit of the product of these two factors will equal the product of the limits of the factors. The two factors are \"Q\"(\"g\"(\"x\")) and (\"g\"(\"x\") \u2212 \"g\"(\"a\")) / (\"x\" \u2212 \"a\"). The latter is the difference quotient for g at a, and because g is differentiable at a by assumption, its limit as x tends to a exists and equals \"g\"\u2032(\"a\").\nAs for \"Q\"(\"g\"(\"x\")), notice that \"Q\" is defined wherever \"f\" is. Furthermore, \"f\" is differentiable at \"g\"(\"a\") by assumption, so \"Q\" is continuous at \"g\"(\"a\"), by definition of the derivative. The function g is continuous at a because it is differentiable at a, and therefore \"Q\" \u2218 \"g\" is continuous at a. So its limit as \"x\" goes to \"a\" exists and equals \"Q\"(\"g\"(\"a\")), which is \"f\"\u2032(\"g\"(\"a\")).\nThis shows that the limits of both factors exist and that they equal \"f\"\u2032(\"g\"(\"a\")) and \"g\"\u2032(\"a\"), respectively. Therefore, the derivative of \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" at \"a\" exists and equals \"f\"\u2032(\"g\"(\"a\"))\"g\"\u2032(\"a\").\nSecond proof.\nAnother way of proving the chain rule is to measure the error in the linear approximation determined by the derivative. This proof has the advantage that it generalizes to several variables. It relies on the following equivalent definition of differentiability at a point: A function \"g\" is differentiable at \"a\" if there exists a real number \"g\"\u2032(\"a\") and a function \"\u03b5\"(\"h\") that tends to zero as \"h\" tends to zero, and furthermore\nformula_60\nHere the left-hand side represents the true difference between the value of \"g\" at \"a\" and at \"a\" + \"h\", whereas the right-hand side represents the approximation determined by the derivative plus an error term.\nIn the situation of the chain rule, such a function \"\u03b5\" exists because \"g\" is assumed to be differentiable at \"a\". Again by assumption, a similar function also exists for \"f\" at \"g\"(\"a\"). Calling this function \"\u03b7\", we have\nformula_61\nThe above definition imposes no constraints on \"\u03b7\"(0), even though it is assumed that \"\u03b7\"(\"k\") tends to zero as \"k\" tends to zero. If we set \"\u03b7\"(0) = 0, then \"\u03b7\" is continuous at 0.\nProving the theorem requires studying the difference \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\" + \"h\")) \u2212 \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\")) as \"h\" tends to zero. The first step is to substitute for \"g\"(\"a\" + \"h\") using the definition of differentiability of \"g\" at \"a\":\nformula_62\nThe next step is to use the definition of differentiability of \"f\" at \"g\"(\"a\"). This requires a term of the form \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\") + \"k\") for some \"k\". In the above equation, the correct \"k\" varies with \"h\". Set \"k\"\"h\" = \"g\"\u2032(\"a\") \"h\" + \"\u03b5\"(\"h\") \"h\" and the right hand side becomes \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\") + \"k\"\"h\") \u2212 \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\")). Applying the definition of the derivative gives:\nformula_63\nTo study the behavior of this expression as \"h\" tends to zero, expand \"k\"\"h\". After regrouping the terms, the right-hand side becomes:\nformula_64\nBecause \"\u03b5\"(\"h\") and \"\u03b7\"(\"k\"\"h\") tend to zero as \"h\" tends to zero, the first two bracketed terms tend to zero as \"h\" tends to zero. Applying the same theorem on products of limits as in the first proof, the third bracketed term also tends zero. Because the above expression is equal to the difference \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\" + \"h\")) \u2212 \"f\"(\"g\"(\"a\")), by the definition of the derivative \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" is differentiable at \"a\" and its derivative is \"f\"\u2032(\"g\"(\"a\")) \"g\"\u2032(\"a\").\nThe role of \"Q\" in the first proof is played by \"\u03b7\" in this proof. They are related by the equation:\nformula_65\nThe need to define \"Q\" at \"g\"(\"a\") is analogous to the need to define \"\u03b7\" at zero.\nThird proof.\nConstantin Carath\u00e9odory's alternative definition of the differentiability of a function can be used to give an elegant proof of the chain rule.\nUnder this definition, a function f is differentiable at a point a if and only if there is a function q, continuous at a and such that \"f\"(\"x\") \u2212 \"f\"(\"a\") = \"q\"(\"x\")(\"x\" \u2212 \"a\"). There is at most one such function, and if f is differentiable at a then \"f\" \u2032(\"a\") = \"q\"(\"a\").\nGiven the assumptions of the chain rule and the fact that differentiable functions and compositions of continuous functions are continuous, we have that there exist functions q, continuous at \"g\"(\"a\"), and r, continuous at a, and such that,\nformula_66\nand\nformula_67\nTherefore,\nformula_68\nbut the function given by \"h\"(\"x\") = \"q\"(\"g\"(\"x\"))\"r\"(\"x\") is continuous at a, and we get, for this a\nformula_69\nA similar approach works for continuously differentiable (vector-)functions of many variables. This method of factoring also allows a unified approach to stronger forms of differentiability, when the derivative is required to be Lipschitz continuous, H\u00f6lder continuous, etc. Differentiation itself can be viewed as the polynomial remainder theorem (the little B\u00e9zout theorem, or factor theorem), generalized to an appropriate class of functions.\nMultivariable case.\nThe full generalization of the chain rule to multi-variable functions (such as formula_70) is rather technical. However, it is simpler to write in the case of functions of the form \nformula_71\nwhere formula_72, and formula_73 for each formula_74\nAs this case occurs often in the study of functions of a single variable, it is worth describing it separately.\nCase of scalar-valued multivariate functions.\nLet formula_75, and formula_73 for each formula_74\nTo write the chain rule for the composition of functions \nformula_78 \none needs the partial derivatives of f with respect to its k arguments. The usual notations for partial derivatives involve names for the arguments of the function. As these arguments are not named in the above formula, it is simpler and clearer to use \"D\"-Notation, and to denote by \nformula_79 \nthe partial derivative of f with respect to its ith argument, and by \nformula_80\nthe value of this derivative at z.\nWith this notation, the chain rule is\nformula_81\nExample: arithmetic operations.\nIf the function f is addition, that is, if \nformula_82\nthen formula_83 and formula_84. Thus, the chain rule gives \nformula_85\nFor multiplication\nformula_86\nthe partials are formula_87 and formula_88. Thus, \nformula_89\nThe case of exponentiation\nformula_90\nis slightly more complicated, as \nformula_91\nand, as formula_92\nformula_93\nIt follows that \nformula_94\nGeneral rule: Vector-valued multivariate functions.\nThe simplest way for writing the chain rule in the general case is to use the total derivative, which is a linear transformation that captures all directional derivatives in a single formula. Consider differentiable functions \"f\" : R\"m\" \u2192 R\"k\" and \"g\" : R\"n\" \u2192 R\"m\", and a point a in R\"n\". Let \"D\"a \"g\" denote the total derivative of \"g\" at a and \"D\"\"g\"(a) \"f\" denote the total derivative of \"f\" at \"g\"(a). These two derivatives are linear transformations R\"n\" \u2192 R\"m\" and R\"m\" \u2192 R\"k\", respectively, so they can be composed. The chain rule for total derivatives is that their composite is the total derivative of \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" at a:\nformula_95\nor for short,\nformula_96\nThe higher-dimensional chain rule can be proved using a technique similar to the second proof given above.\nBecause the total derivative is a linear transformation, the functions appearing in the formula can be rewritten as matrices. The matrix corresponding to a total derivative is called a Jacobian matrix, and the composite of two derivatives corresponds to the product of their Jacobian matrices. From this perspective the chain rule therefore says:\nformula_97\nor for short,\nformula_98\nThat is, the Jacobian of a composite function is the product of the Jacobians of the composed functions (evaluated at the appropriate points).\nThe higher-dimensional chain rule is a generalization of the one-dimensional chain rule. If k, m, and n are 1, so that \"f\" : R \u2192 R and \"g\" : R \u2192 R, then the Jacobian matrices of \"f\" and \"g\" are 1 \u00d7 1. Specifically, they are:\nformula_99\nThe Jacobian of \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" is the product of these 1 \u00d7 1 matrices, so it is \"f\"\u2032(\"g\"(\"a\"))\u22c5\"g\"\u2032(\"a\"), as expected from the one-dimensional chain rule. In the language of linear transformations, \"D\"\"a\"(\"g\") is the function which scales a vector by a factor of \"g\"\u2032(\"a\") and \"D\"\"g\"(\"a\")(\"f\") is the function which scales a vector by a factor of \"f\"\u2032(\"g\"(\"a\")). The chain rule says that the composite of these two linear transformations is the linear transformation \"D\"\"a\"(\"f\" \u2218 \"g\"), and therefore it is the function that scales a vector by \"f\"\u2032(\"g\"(\"a\"))\u22c5\"g\"\u2032(\"a\").\nAnother way of writing the chain rule is used when \"f\" and \"g\" are expressed in terms of their components as y = \"f\"(u) = (\"f\"1(u), \u2026, \"f\"\"k\"(u)) and u = \"g\"(x) = (\"g\"1(x), \u2026, \"g\"\"m\"(x)). In this case, the above rule for Jacobian matrices is usually written as:\nformula_100\nThe chain rule for total derivatives implies a chain rule for partial derivatives. Recall that when the total derivative exists, the partial derivative in the i-th coordinate direction is found by multiplying the Jacobian matrix by the i-th basis vector. By doing this to the formula above, we find:\nformula_101\nSince the entries of the Jacobian matrix are partial derivatives, we may simplify the above formula to get:\nformula_102\nMore conceptually, this rule expresses the fact that a change in the \"x\"\"i\" direction may change all of \"g\"1 through \"gm\", and any of these changes may affect \"f\".\nIn the special case where \"k\" = 1, so that \"f\" is a real-valued function, then this formula simplifies even further:\nformula_103\nThis can be rewritten as a dot product. Recalling that u \n (\"g\"1, \u2026, \"g\"\"m\"), the partial derivative \u2202u / \u2202\"x\"\"i\" is also a vector, and the chain rule says that:\nformula_104\nExample.\nGiven \"u\"(\"x\", \"y\") = \"x\"2 + 2\"y\" where \"x\"(\"r\", \"t\") = \"r\" sin(\"t\") and \"y\"(\"r\",\"t\") = sin2(\"t\"), determine the value of \u2202\"u\" / \u2202\"r\" and \u2202\"u\" / \u2202\"t\" using the chain rule.\nformula_105\nand\nformula_106\nHigher derivatives of multivariable functions.\nFa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula for higher-order derivatives of single-variable functions generalizes to the multivariable case. If \"y\" = \"f\"(u) is a function of u = \"g\"(x) as above, then the second derivative of \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" is:\nformula_107\nFurther generalizations.\nAll extensions of calculus have a chain rule. In most of these, the formula remains the same, though the meaning of that formula may be vastly different.\nOne generalization is to manifolds. In this situation, the chain rule represents the fact that the derivative of \"f\" \u2218 \"g\" is the composite of the derivative of \"f\" and the derivative of \"g\". This theorem is an immediate consequence of the higher dimensional chain rule given above, and it has exactly the same formula.\nThe chain rule is also valid for Fr\u00e9chet derivatives in Banach spaces. The same formula holds as before. This case and the previous one admit a simultaneous generalization to Banach manifolds.\nIn differential algebra, the derivative is interpreted as a morphism of modules of K\u00e4hler differentials. A ring homomorphism of commutative rings \"f\" : \"R\" \u2192 \"S\" determines a morphism of K\u00e4hler differentials \"Df\" : \u03a9\"R\" \u2192 \u03a9\"S\" which sends an element \"dr\" to \"d\"(\"f\"(\"r\")), the exterior differential of \"f\"(\"r\"). The formula \"D\"(\"f\" \u2218 \"g\") = \"Df\" \u2218 \"Dg\" holds in this context as well.\nThe common feature of these examples is that they are expressions of the idea that the derivative is part of a functor. A functor is an operation on spaces and functions between them. It associates to each space a new space and to each function between two spaces a new function between the corresponding new spaces. In each of the above cases, the functor sends each space to its tangent bundle and it sends each function to its derivative. For example, in the manifold case, the derivative sends a \"C\"\"r\"-manifold to a \"C\"\"r\"\u22121-manifold (its tangent bundle) and a \"C\"\"r\"-function to its total derivative. There is one requirement for this to be a functor, namely that the derivative of a composite must be the composite of the derivatives. This is exactly the formula \"D\"(\"f\" \u2218 \"g\") = \"Df\" \u2218 \"Dg\".\nThere are also chain rules in stochastic calculus. One of these, It\u014d's lemma, expresses the composite of an It\u014d process (or more generally a semimartingale) \"dX\"\"t\" with a twice-differentiable function \"f\". In It\u014d's lemma, the derivative of the composite function depends not only on \"dX\"\"t\" and the derivative of \"f\" but also on the second derivative of \"f\". The dependence on the second derivative is a consequence of the non-zero quadratic variation of the stochastic process, which broadly speaking means that the process can move up and down in a very rough way. This variant of the chain rule is not an example of a functor because the two functions being composed are of different types.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved.\nHere, \"quickly\" means an algorithm exists that solves the task and runs in polynomial time (as opposed to, say, exponential time), meaning the task completion time is bounded above by a polynomial function on the size of the input to the algorithm. The general class of questions that some algorithm can answer in polynomial time is \"P\" or \"class P\". For some questions, there is no known way to find an answer quickly, but if provided with an answer, it can be verified quickly. The class of questions where an answer can be \"verified\" in polynomial time is \"NP\", standing for \"nondeterministic polynomial time\".\nAn answer to the P versus NP question would determine whether problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. If P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, which is widely believed, it would mean that there are problems in NP that are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial time.\nThe problem has been called the most important open problem in computer science. Aside from being an important problem in computational theory, a proof either way would have profound implications for mathematics, cryptography, algorithm research, artificial intelligence, game theory, multimedia processing, philosophy, economics and many other fields.\nIt is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute, each of which carries a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.\nExample.\nConsider the following yes/no problem: given an incomplete Sudoku grid of size formula_1, is there at least one legal solution where every row, column, and formula_2 square contains the integers 1 through formula_3? It is straightforward to verify \"yes\" instances of this generalized Sudoku problem given a candidate solution. However, it is not known whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can correctly answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to all instances of this problem. Therefore, generalized Sudoku is in NP (quickly verifiable), but may or may not be in P (quickly solvable). (It is necessary to consider a generalized version of Sudoku, as any fixed size Sudoku has only a finite number of possible grids. In this case the problem is in P, as the answer can be found by table lookup.)\nHistory.\nThe precise statement of the P versus NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\" (and independently by Leonid Levin in 1973).\nAlthough the P versus NP problem was formally defined in 1971, there were previous inklings of the problems involved, the difficulty of proof, and the potential consequences. In 1955, mathematician John Nash wrote a letter to the National Security Agency, speculating that the time required to crack a sufficiently complex code would increase exponentially with the length of the key. If proved (and Nash was suitably skeptical), this would imply what is now called P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, since a proposed key can be verified in polynomial time. Another mention of the underlying problem occurred in a 1956 letter written by Kurt G\u00f6del to John von Neumann. G\u00f6del asked whether theorem-proving (now known to be co-NP-complete) could be solved in quadratic or linear time, and pointed out one of the most important consequences\u2014that if so, then the discovery of mathematical proofs could be automated.\nContext.\nThe relation between the complexity classes P and NP is studied in computational complexity theory, the part of the theory of computation dealing with the resources required during computation to solve a given problem. The most common resources are time (how many steps it takes to solve a problem) and space (how much memory it takes to solve a problem).\nIn such analysis, a model of the computer for which time must be analyzed is required. Typically such models assume that the computer is \"deterministic\" (given the computer's present state and any inputs, there is only one possible action that the computer might take) and \"sequential\" (it performs actions one after the other).\nIn this theory, the class P consists of all \"decision problems\" (defined below) solvable on a deterministic sequential machine in a duration polynomial in the size of the input; the class NP consists of all decision problems whose positive solutions are verifiable in polynomial time given the right information, or equivalently, whose solution can be found in polynomial time on a non-deterministic machine. Clearly, P \u2286 NP. Arguably, the biggest open question in theoretical computer science concerns the relationship between those two classes:\nIs P equal to NP?\nSince 2002, William Gasarch has conducted three polls of researchers concerning this and related questions. Confidence that P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP has been increasing \u2013 in 2019, 88% believed P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, as opposed to 83% in 2012 and 61% in 2002. When restricted to experts, the 2019 answers became 99% believed P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP. These polls do not imply whether P\u00a0=\u00a0NP, Gasarch himself stated: \"This does not bring us any closer to solving P=?NP or to knowing when it will be solved, but it attempts to be an objective report on the subjective opinion of this era.\"\nNP-completeness.\nTo attack the P\u00a0=\u00a0NP question, the concept of NP-completeness is very useful. NP-complete problems are problems that any other NP problem is reducible to in polynomial time and whose solution is still verifiable in polynomial time. That is, any NP problem can be transformed into any NP-complete problem. Informally, an NP-complete problem is an NP problem that is at least as \"tough\" as any other problem in NP.\nNP-hard problems are those at least as hard as NP problems; i.e., all NP problems can be reduced (in polynomial time) to them. NP-hard problems need not be in NP; i.e., they need not have solutions verifiable in polynomial time.\nFor instance, the Boolean satisfiability problem is NP-complete by the Cook\u2013Levin theorem, so \"any\" instance of \"any\" problem in NP can be transformed mechanically into a Boolean satisfiability problem in polynomial time. The Boolean satisfiability problem is one of many NP-complete problems. If any NP-complete problem is in P, then it would follow that P\u00a0=\u00a0NP. However, many important problems are NP-complete, and no fast algorithm for any of them is known.\nFrom the definition alone it is unintuitive that NP-complete problems exist; however, a trivial NP-complete problem can be formulated as follows: given a Turing machine \"M\" guaranteed to halt in polynomial time, does a polynomial-size input that \"M\" will accept exist? It is in NP because (given an input) it is simple to check whether \"M\" accepts the input by simulating \"M\"; it is NP-complete because the verifier for any particular instance of a problem in NP can be encoded as a polynomial-time machine \"M\" that takes the solution to be verified as input. Then the question of whether the instance is a yes or no instance is determined by whether a valid input exists.\nThe first natural problem proven to be NP-complete was the Boolean satisfiability problem, also known as SAT. As noted above, this is the Cook\u2013Levin theorem; its proof that satisfiability is NP-complete contains technical details about Turing machines as they relate to the definition of NP. However, after this problem was proved to be NP-complete, proof by reduction provided a simpler way to show that many other problems are also NP-complete, including the game Sudoku discussed earlier. In this case, the proof shows that a solution of Sudoku in polynomial time could also be used to complete Latin squares in polynomial time. This in turn gives a solution to the problem of partitioning tri-partite graphs into triangles, which could then be used to find solutions for the special case of SAT known as 3-SAT, which then provides a solution for general Boolean satisfiability. So a polynomial-time solution to Sudoku leads, by a series of mechanical transformations, to a polynomial time solution of satisfiability, which in turn can be used to solve any other NP-problem in polynomial time. Using transformations like this, a vast class of seemingly unrelated problems are all reducible to one another, and are in a sense \"the same problem\".\nHarder problems.\nAlthough it is unknown whether P\u00a0=\u00a0NP, problems outside of P are known. Just as the class P is defined in terms of polynomial running time, the class EXPTIME is the set of all decision problems that have \"exponential\" running time. In other words, any problem in EXPTIME is solvable by a deterministic Turing machine in O(2\"p\"(\"n\")) time, where \"p\"(\"n\") is a polynomial function of \"n\". A decision problem is EXPTIME-complete if it is in EXPTIME, and every problem in EXPTIME has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it. A number of problems are known to be EXPTIME-complete. Because it can be shown that P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0EXPTIME, these problems are outside P, and so require more than polynomial time. In fact, by the time hierarchy theorem, they cannot be solved in significantly less than exponential time. Examples include finding a perfect strategy for chess positions on an \"N\" \u00d7 \"N\" board and similar problems for other board games.\nThe problem of deciding the truth of a statement in Presburger arithmetic requires even more time. Fischer and Rabin proved in 1974 that every algorithm that decides the truth of Presburger statements of length \"n\" has a runtime of at least formula_4 for some constant \"c\". Hence, the problem is known to need more than exponential run time. Even more difficult are the undecidable problems, such as the halting problem. They cannot be completely solved by any algorithm, in the sense that for any particular algorithm there is at least one input for which that algorithm will not produce the right answer; it will either produce the wrong answer, finish without giving a conclusive answer, or otherwise run forever without producing any answer at all.\nIt is also possible to consider questions other than decision problems. One such class, consisting of counting problems, is called #P: whereas an NP problem asks \"Are there any solutions?\", the corresponding #P problem asks \"How many solutions are there?\". Clearly, a #P problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding NP problem, since a count of solutions immediately tells if at least one solution exists, if the count is greater than zero. Surprisingly, some #P problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) P problems. For these problems, it is very easy to tell whether solutions exist, but thought to be very hard to tell how many. Many of these problems are #P-complete, and hence among the hardest problems in #P, since a polynomial time solution to any of them would allow a polynomial time solution to all other #P problems.\nProblems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete.\nIn 1975, Richard E. Ladner showed that if P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NP-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NP-complete.\nThe graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai, runs in quasi-polynomial time.\nThe integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than \"k\". No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in NP and in co-NP (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., NP = co-NP). The most efficient known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes expected time\nformula_5\nto factor an \"n\"-bit integer. The best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor's algorithm, runs in polynomial time, although this does not indicate where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.\nDoes P mean \"easy\"?\nAll of the above discussion has assumed that P means \"easy\" and \"not in P\" means \"difficult\", an assumption known as \"Cobham's thesis\". It is a common assumption in complexity theory; but there are caveats.\nFirst, it can be false in practice. A theoretical polynomial algorithm may have extremely large constant factors or exponents, rendering it impractical. For example, the problem of deciding whether a graph \"G\" contains \"H\" as a minor, where \"H\" is fixed, can be solved in a running time of \"O\"(\"n\"2), where \"n\" is the number of vertices in \"G\". However, the big O notation hides a constant that depends superexponentially on \"H\". The constant is greater than formula_6 (using Knuth's up-arrow notation), and where \"h\" is the number of vertices in \"H\".\nOn the other hand, even if a problem is shown to be NP-complete, and even if P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, there may still be effective approaches to the problem in practice. There are algorithms for many NP-complete problems, such as the knapsack problem, the traveling salesman problem, and the Boolean satisfiability problem, that can solve to optimality many real-world instances in reasonable time. The empirical average-case complexity (time vs. problem size) of such algorithms can be surprisingly low. An example is the simplex algorithm in linear programming, which works surprisingly well in practice; despite having exponential worst-case time complexity, it runs on par with the best known polynomial-time algorithms.\nFinally, there are types of computations which do not conform to the Turing machine model on which P and NP are defined, such as quantum computation and randomized algorithms.\nReasons to believe P \u2260 NP or P = NP.\nCook provides a restatement of the problem in \"The P Versus NP Problem\" as \"Does P\u00a0=\u00a0NP?\" According to polls, most computer scientists believe that P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems no one has been able to find a polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3,000 important known NP-complete problems (see List of NP-complete problems). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P\u00a0=\u00a0NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP\u00a0=\u00a0co-NP and P\u00a0=\u00a0PH.\nIt is also intuitively argued that the existence of problems that are hard to solve but whose solutions are easy to verify matches real-world experience.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; Scott Aaronson, UT Austin\nOn the other hand, some researchers believe that it is overconfident to believe P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP and that researchers should also explore proofs of P\u00a0=\u00a0NP. For example, in 2002 these statements were made:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The main argument in favor of P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP is the total lack of fundamental progress in the area of exhaustive search. This is, in my opinion, a very weak argument. The space of algorithms is very large and we are only at the beginning of its exploration. [...] The resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem also shows that very simple questions may be settled only by very deep theories.\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Being attached to a speculation is not a good guide to research planning. One should always try both directions of every problem. Prejudice has caused famous mathematicians to fail to solve famous problems whose solution was opposite to their expectations, even though they had developed all the methods required.\u2014\u200a\nDLIN vs NLIN.\nWhen one substitutes \"linear time on a multitape Turing machine\" for \"polynomial time\" in the definitions of P and NP, one obtains the classes DLIN and NLIN.\nIt is known that DLIN \u2260 NLIN.\nConsequences of solution.\nOne of the reasons the problem attracts so much attention is the consequences of the possible answers. Either direction of resolution would advance theory enormously, and perhaps have huge practical consequences as well.\nP = NP.\nA proof that P\u00a0=\u00a0NP could have stunning practical consequences if the proof leads to efficient methods for solving some of the important problems in NP. The potential consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various NP-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.\nIt is also very possible that a proof would \"not\" lead to practical algorithms for NP-complete problems. The formulation of the problem does not require that the bounding polynomial be small or even specifically known. A non-constructive proof might show a solution exists without specifying either an algorithm to obtain it or a specific bound. Even if the proof is constructive, showing an explicit bounding polynomial and algorithmic details, if the polynomial is not very low-order the algorithm might not be sufficiently efficient in practice. In this case the initial proof would be mainly of interest to theoreticians, but the knowledge that polynomial time solutions are possible would surely spur research into better (and possibly practical) methods to achieve them.\nA solution showing P\u00a0=\u00a0NP could upend the field of cryptography, which relies on certain problems being difficult. A constructive and efficient solution to an NP-complete problem such as 3-SAT would break most existing cryptosystems including:\nThese would need modification or replacement with information-theoretically secure solutions that do not assume P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP.\nThere are also enormous benefits that would follow from rendering tractable many currently mathematically intractable problems. For instance, many problems in operations research are NP-complete, such as types of integer programming and the travelling salesman problem. Efficient solutions to these problems would have enormous implications for logistics. Many other important problems, such as some problems in protein structure prediction, are also NP-complete; making these problems efficiently solvable could considerably advance life sciences and biotechnology.\nThese changes could be insignificant compared to the revolution that efficiently solving NP-complete problems would cause in mathematics itself. G\u00f6del, in his early thoughts on computational complexity, noted that a mechanical method that could solve any problem would revolutionize mathematics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If there really were a machine with \u03c6(\"n\") \u223c \"k\"\u22c5\"n\" (or even \u223c \"k\"\u22c5\"n\"2), this would have consequences of the greatest importance. Namely, it would obviously mean that in spite of the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem, the mental work of a mathematician concerning Yes-or-No questions could be completely replaced by a machine. After all, one would simply have to choose the natural number \"n\" so large that when the machine does not deliver a result, it makes no sense to think more about the problem.\nSimilarly, Stephen Cook (assuming not only a proof, but a practically efficient algorithm) says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0it would transform mathematics by allowing a computer to find a formal proof of any theorem which has a proof of a reasonable length, since formal proofs can easily be recognized in polynomial time. Example problems may well include all of the CMI prize problems.\nResearch mathematicians spend their careers trying to prove theorems, and some proofs have taken decades or even centuries to find after problems have been stated\u2014for instance, Fermat's Last Theorem took over three centuries to prove. A method guaranteed to find a proof if a \"reasonable\" size proof exists, would essentially end this struggle.\nDonald Knuth has stated that he has come to believe that P\u00a0=\u00a0NP, but is reserved about the impact of a possible proof:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[...] if you imagine a number \"M\" that's finite but incredibly large\u2014like say the number 10\u2191\u2191\u2191\u21913 discussed in my paper on \"coping with finiteness\"\u2014then there's a humongous number of possible algorithms that do \"n\"\"M\" bitwise or addition or shift operations on \"n\" given bits, and it's really hard to believe that all of those algorithms fail.\nMy main point, however, is that I don't believe that the equality P\u00a0=\u00a0NP will turn out to be helpful even if it is proved, because such a proof will almost surely be nonconstructive.\nP \u2260 NP.\nA proof of P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP would lack the practical computational benefits of a proof that P\u00a0=\u00a0NP, but would represent a great advance in computational complexity theory and guide future research. It would demonstrate that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, much of this focusing of research has already taken place.\nP\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP still leaves open the average-case complexity of hard problems in NP. For example, it is possible that SAT requires exponential time in the worst case, but that almost all randomly selected instances of it are efficiently solvable. Russell Impagliazzo has described five hypothetical \"worlds\" that could result from different possible resolutions to the average-case complexity question. These range from \"Algorithmica\", where P\u00a0=\u00a0NP and problems like SAT can be solved efficiently in all instances, to \"Cryptomania\", where P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP and generating hard instances of problems outside P is easy, with three intermediate possibilities reflecting different possible distributions of difficulty over instances of NP-hard problems. The \"world\" where P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP but all problems in NP are tractable in the average case is called \"Heuristica\" in the paper. A Princeton University workshop in 2009 studied the status of the five worlds.\nResults about difficulty of proof.\nAlthough the P\u00a0=\u00a0NP problem itself remains open despite a million-dollar prize and a huge amount of dedicated research, efforts to solve the problem have led to several new techniques. In particular, some of the most fruitful research related to the P\u00a0=\u00a0NP problem has been in showing that existing proof techniques are insufficient for answering the question, suggesting novel technical approaches are required.\nAs additional evidence for the difficulty of the problem, essentially all known proof techniques in computational complexity theory fall into one of the following classifications, all insufficient to prove P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP:\nThese barriers are another reason why NP-complete problems are useful: if a polynomial-time algorithm can be demonstrated for an NP-complete problem, this would solve the P\u00a0=\u00a0NP problem in a way not excluded by the above results.\nThese barriers lead some computer scientists to suggest the P versus NP problem may be independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). An independence result could imply that either P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP and this is unprovable in (e.g.) ZFC, or that P\u00a0=\u00a0NP but it is unprovable in ZFC that any polynomial-time algorithms are correct. However, if the problem is undecidable even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms for integer arithmetic, then nearly polynomial-time algorithms exist for all NP problems. Therefore, assuming (as most complexity theorists do) some NP problems don't have efficient algorithms, proofs of independence with those techniques are impossible. This also implies proving independence from PA or ZFC with current techniques is no easier than proving all NP problems have efficient algorithms.\nLogical characterizations.\nThe P\u00a0=\u00a0NP problem can be restated as certain classes of logical statements, as a result of work in descriptive complexity.\nConsider all languages of finite structures with a fixed signature including a linear order relation. Then, all such languages in P are expressible in first-order logic with the addition of a suitable least fixed-point combinator. Recursive functions can be defined with this and the order relation. As long as the signature contains at least one predicate or function in addition to the distinguished order relation, so that the amount of space taken to store such finite structures is actually polynomial in the number of elements in the structure, this precisely characterizes P.\nSimilarly, NP is the set of languages expressible in existential second-order logic\u2014that is, second-order logic restricted to exclude universal quantification over relations, functions, and subsets. The languages in the polynomial hierarchy, PH, correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question \"is P a proper subset of NP\" can be reformulated as \"is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with least fixed point cannot?\". The word \"existential\" can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since P\u00a0=\u00a0NP if and only if P\u00a0=\u00a0PH (as the former would establish that NP\u00a0=\u00a0co-NP, which in turn implies that NP\u00a0=\u00a0PH).\nPolynomial-time algorithms.\nNo known algorithm for a NP-complete problem runs in polynomial time. However, there are algorithms known for NP-complete problems that if P\u00a0=\u00a0NP, the algorithm runs in polynomial time on accepting instances (although with enormous constants, making the algorithm impractical). However, these algorithms do not qualify as polynomial time because their running time on rejecting instances are not polynomial. The following algorithm, due to Levin (without any citation), is such an example below. It correctly accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM. It runs in polynomial time on inputs that are in SUBSET-SUM if and only if P\u00a0=\u00a0NP:\n \"// Algorithm that accepts the NP-complete language SUBSET-SUM.\"\n \"// this is a polynomial-time algorithm if and only if P = NP.\"\n \"// \"Polynomial-time\" means it returns \"yes\" in polynomial time when\"\n \"// the answer should be \"yes\", and runs forever when it is \"no\".\"\n \"// Input: S = a finite set of integers\"\n \"// Output: \"yes\" if any subset of S adds up to 0.\"\n \"// Runs forever with no output otherwise.\"\n \"// Note: \"Program number M\" is the program obtained by\"\n \"// writing the integer M in binary, then\"\n \"// considering that string of bits to be a\"\n \"// program. Every possible program can be\"\n \"// generated this way, though most do nothing\"\n \"// because of syntax errors.\"\n FOR K = 1...\u221e\n FOR M = 1...K\n Run program number M for K steps with input S\n IF the program outputs a list of distinct integers\n AND the integers are all in S\n AND the integers sum to 0\n THEN\n OUTPUT \"yes\" and HALT\nThis is a polynomial-time algorithm accepting an NP-complete language only if P\u00a0=\u00a0NP. \"Accepting\" means it gives \"yes\" answers in polynomial time, but is allowed to run forever when the answer is \"no\" (also known as a \"semi-algorithm\").\nThis algorithm is enormously impractical, even if P\u00a0=\u00a0NP. If the shortest program that can solve SUBSET-SUM in polynomial time is \"b\" bits long, the above algorithm will try at least 2\"b\" \u2212 1 other programs first.\nFormal definitions.\nP and NP.\nA \"decision problem\" is a problem that takes as input some string \"w\" over an alphabet \u03a3, and outputs \"yes\" or \"no\". If there is an algorithm (say a Turing machine, or a computer program with unbounded memory) that produces the correct answer for any input string of length \"n\" in at most \"cnk\" steps, where \"k\" and \"c\" are constants independent of the input string, then we say that the problem can be solved in \"polynomial time\" and we place it in the class P. Formally, P is the set of languages that can be decided by a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine. Meaning,\nformula_7\nwhere\nformula_8\nand a deterministic polynomial-time Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine \"M\" that satisfies two conditions:\nformula_11\nformula_12\nNP can be defined similarly using nondeterministic Turing machines (the traditional way). However, a modern approach uses the concept of \"certificate\" and \"verifier\". Formally, NP is the set of languages with a finite alphabet and verifier that runs in polynomial time. The following defines a \"verifier\":\nLet \"L\" be a language over a finite alphabet, \u03a3.\n\"L\" \u2208 NP if, and only if, there exists a binary relation formula_13 and a positive integer \"k\" such that the following two conditions are satisfied:\nA Turing machine that decides \"LR\" is called a \"verifier\" for \"L\" and a \"y\" such that (\"x\", \"y\") \u2208 \"R\" is called a \"certificate of membership\" of \"x\" in \"L\".\nNot all verifiers must be polynomial-time. However, for \"L\" to be in NP, there must be a verifier that runs in polynomial time.\nExample.\nLet\nformula_14\nformula_15\nWhether a value of \"x\" is composite is equivalent to of whether \"x\" is a member of COMPOSITE. It can be shown that COMPOSITE \u2208 NP by verifying that it satisfies the above definition (if we identify natural numbers with their binary representations).\nCOMPOSITE also happens to be in P, a fact demonstrated by the invention of the AKS primality test.\nNP-completeness.\nThere are many equivalent ways of describing NP-completeness.\nLet \"L\" be a language over a finite alphabet \u03a3.\n\"L\" is NP-complete if, and only if, the following two conditions are satisfied:\nAlternatively, if \"L\" \u2208 NP, and there is another NP-complete problem that can be polynomial-time reduced to \"L\", then \"L\" is NP-complete. This is a common way of proving some new problem is NP-complete.\nClaimed solutions.\nWhile the P versus NP problem is generally considered unsolved, many amateur and some professional researchers have claimed solutions. Gerhard J. Woeginger compiled a list of 116 purported proofs from 1986 to 2016, of which 61 were proofs of P\u00a0=\u00a0NP, 49 were proofs of P\u00a0\u2260\u00a0NP, and 6 proved other results, e.g. that the problem is undecidable. Some attempts at resolving P versus NP have received brief media attention, though these attempts have been refuted.\nPopular culture.\nThe film \"Travelling Salesman\", by director Timothy Lanzone, is the story of four mathematicians hired by the US government to solve the P versus NP problem.\nIn the sixth episode of \"The Simpsons\"' seventh season \"Treehouse of Horror VI\", the equation P\u00a0=\u00a0NP is seen shortly after Homer accidentally stumbles into the \"third dimension\".\nIn the second episode of season 2 of \"Elementary\", \"Solve for X\" Holmes and Watson investigate the murders of mathematicians who were attempting to solve P versus NP.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6117", "revid": "2102840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6117", "title": "Charles Sanders Peirce", "text": "American scientist (1839\u20131914)\nCharles Sanders Peirce ( ; September 10, 1839 \u2013 April 19, 1914) was an American scientist, mathematician, logician, and philosopher who is sometimes known as \"the father of pragmatism\". According to philosopher Paul Weiss, Peirce was \"the most original and versatile of America's philosophers and America's greatest logician\". Bertrand Russell wrote \"he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest American thinker ever\". \nEducated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for thirty years, Peirce meanwhile made major contributions to logic, such as theories of relations and quantification. C. I. Lewis wrote, \"The contributions of C. S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer\u2014at least in the nineteenth century.\" For Peirce, logic also encompassed much of what is now called epistemology and the philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics or study of signs, of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th-century Western philosophy. Peirce's study of signs also included a tripartite theory of predication. \nAdditionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulating mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. He was one of the founders of statistics. As early as 1886, he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits. The same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.\nIn metaphysics, Peirce was an \"objective idealist\" in the tradition of German philosopher Immanuel Kant as well as a scholastic realist about universals. He also held a commitment to the ideas of continuity and chance as real features of the universe, views he labeled synechism and tychism respectively. Peirce believed an epistemic fallibilism and anti-skepticism went along with these views. \nBiography.\nEarly life.\nPeirce was born at 3 Phillips Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and Benjamin Peirce, himself a professor of mathematics and astronomy at Harvard University. At age\u00a012, Charles read his older brother's copy of Richard Whately's \"Elements of Logic\", then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning. \nHe suffered from his late teens onward from a nervous condition then known as \"facial neuralgia\", which would today be diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. His biographer, Joseph Brent, says that when in the throes of its pain \"he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper\". Its consequences may have led to the social isolation of his later life.\nEducation.\nPeirce went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degree (1862) from Harvard. In 1863 the Lawrence Scientific School awarded him a Bachelor of Science degree, Harvard's first \"summa cum laude\" chemistry degree. His academic record was otherwise undistinguished. At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Chauncey Wright, and William James. One of his Harvard instructors, Charles William Eliot, formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard (1869\u20131909\u2014a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life), repeatedly vetoed Peirce's employment at the university.\nUnited States Coast Survey.\nBetween 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the United States Coast Survey, which in 1878 was renamed the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, where he enjoyed his highly influential father's protection until the latter's death in 1880. At the Survey, he worked mainly in geodesy and gravimetry, refining the use of pendulums to determine small local variations in the Earth's gravity.\nAmerican Civil War.\nThis employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the American Civil War; it would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the Boston Brahmin Peirces sympathized with the Confederacy. No members of the Peirce family volunteered or enlisted. Peirce grew up in a home where white supremacy was taken for granted, and slavery was considered natural. Peirce's father had described himself as a secessionist until the outbreak of the war, after which he became a Union partisan, providing donations to the Sanitary Commission, the leading Northern war charity. \nPeirce liked to use the following syllogism to illustrate the unreliability of traditional forms of logic (for the first premise arguably assumes the conclusion):&lt;poem&gt;\nAll Men are equal in their political rights.\nNegroes are Men.\nTherefore, negroes are equal in political rights to whites.&lt;/poem&gt;\nTravels to Europe.\nHe was elected a resident fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in January 1867. The Survey sent him to Europe five times, first in 1871 as part of a group sent to observe a solar eclipse. There, he sought out Augustus De Morgan, William Stanley Jevons, and William Kingdon Clifford, British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. \nHarvard observatory.\nFrom 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of stars and the shape of the Milky Way. In 1872 he founded the Metaphysical Club, a conversational philosophical club that Peirce, the future Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., the philosopher and psychologist William James, amongst others, formed in January 1872 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and dissolved in December 1872. Other members of the club included Chauncey Wright, John Fiske, Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Nicholas St. John Green, and Joseph Bangs Warner. The discussions eventually birthed Peirce's notion of pragmatism.\nNational Academy of Sciences.\nOn April 20, 1877, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Also in 1877, he proposed measuring the meter as so many wavelengths of light of a certain frequency, the kind of definition employed from 1960 to 1983.\nIn 1879 Peirce developed Peirce quincuncial projection, having been inspired by H. A. Schwarz's 1869 conformal transformation of a circle onto a polygon of \"n\" sides (known as the Schwarz\u2013Christoffel mapping). \n1880 to 1891.\nDuring the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while his Survey work's quality and timeliness waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in months. Meanwhile, he wrote entries, ultimately thousands, during 1883\u20131909 on philosophy, logic, science, and other subjects for the encyclopedic \"Century Dictionary\". In 1885, an investigation by the Allison Commission exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent Julius Hilgard and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds. In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey at Superintendent Thomas Corwin Mendenhall's request.\nJohns Hopkins University.\nIn 1879, Peirce was appointed lecturer in logic at Johns Hopkins University, which had strong departments in areas that interested him, such as philosophy (Royce and Dewey completed their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by G. Stanley Hall and studied by Joseph Jastrow, who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by J.\u00a0J. Sylvester, who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). His \"Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University\" (1883) contained works by himself and Allan Marquand, Christine Ladd, Benjamin Ives Gilman, and Oscar Howard Mitchell, several of whom were his graduate students. Peirce's nontenured position at Hopkins was the only academic appointment he ever held.\nBrent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major Canadian-American scientist of the day, Simon Newcomb. Newcomb had been a favourite student of Peirce's father; although \"no doubt quite bright\", \"like Salieri in Peter Shaffer's Amadeus he also had just enough talent to recognize he was not a genius and just enough pettiness to resent someone who was\". Additionally \"an intensely devout and literal-minded Christian of rigid moral standards\", he was appalled by what he considered Peirce's personal shortcomings. Peirce's efforts may also have been hampered by what Brent characterizes as \"his difficult personality\". In contrast, Keith Devlin believes that Peirce's work was too far ahead of his time to be appreciated by the academic establishment of the day and that this played a large role in his inability to obtain a tenured position.\nPersonal life.\nPeirce's personal life undoubtedly worked against his professional success. After his first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay (\"Zina\"), left him in 1875, Peirce, while still legally married, became involved with Juliette, whose last name, given variously as Froissy and Pourtalai, and nationality (she spoke French) remain uncertain. When his divorce from Zina became final in 1883, he married Juliette. That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married; the ensuing scandal led to his dismissal in January 1884. Over the years Peirce sought academic employment at various universities without success. He had no children by either marriage.\nLater life and poverty.\nIn 1887, Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy of rural land near Milford, Pennsylvania, which never yielded an economic return. There he had an 1854 farmhouse remodeled to his design. The Peirces named the property \"Arisbe\". There they lived with few interruptions for the rest of their lives, Charles writing prolifically, with much of his work remaining unpublished to this day (see Works). Living beyond their means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties. Charles spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter and subsisting on old bread donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while. Several people, including his brother James Mills Peirce and his neighbors, relatives of Gifford Pinchot, settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.\nPeirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote much for meager pay, mainly encyclopedic dictionary entries, and reviews for \"The Nation\" (with whose editor, Wendell Phillips Garrison, he became friendly). He did translations for the Smithsonian Institution, at its director Samuel Langley's instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing. He began but did not complete several books. In 1888, President Grover Cleveland appointed him to the Assay Commission.\nFrom 1890 on, he had a friend and admirer in Judge Francis C. Russell of Chicago, who introduced Peirce to editor Paul Carus and owner Edward C. Hegeler of the pioneering American philosophy journal \"The Monist\", which eventually published at least 14 articles by Peirce. He wrote many texts in James Mark Baldwin's \"Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology\" (1901\u20131905); half of those credited to him appear to have been written actually by Christine Ladd-Franklin under his supervision. He applied in 1902 to the newly formed Carnegie Institution for a grant to write a systematic book describing his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis, Newcomb, served on the Carnegie Institution executive committee, and its president had been president of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal.\nThe one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend William James, dedicating his \"Will to Believe\" (1897) to Peirce, and arranging for Peirce to be paid to give two series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898 and 1903). Most important, each year from 1907 until James's death in 1910, James wrote to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia to request financial aid for Peirce; the fund continued even after James died. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him. It has been believed that this was also why Peirce used \"Santiago\" (\"St. James\" in English) as a middle name, but he appeared in print as early as 1890 as Charles Santiago Peirce. (See Charles Santiago Sanders Peirce for discussion and references).\nDeath and legacy.\nPeirce died destitute in Milford, Pennsylvania, twenty years before his widow. Juliette Peirce kept the urn with Peirce's ashes at Arisbe. In 1934, Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot arranged for Juliette's burial in Milford Cemetery. The urn with Peirce's ashes was interred with Juliette.\nBertrand Russell (1959) wrote \"Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century and certainly the greatest American thinker ever\". Russell and Whitehead's \"Principia Mathematica\", published from 1910 to 1913, does not mention Peirce (Peirce's work was not widely known until later). A. N. Whitehead, while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own \"process\" thinking. (On Peirce and process metaphysics, see Lowe 1964.) Karl Popper viewed Peirce as \"one of the greatest philosophers of all times\". Yet Peirce's achievements were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries William James and Josiah Royce admired him and Cassius Jackson Keyser, at Columbia and C. K. Ogden, wrote about Peirce with respect but to no immediate effect.\nThe first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student Morris Raphael Cohen, the editor of an anthology of Peirce's writings entitled \"Chance, Love, and Logic\" (1923), and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings. John Dewey studied under Peirce at Johns Hopkins. From 1916 onward, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 \"Logic: The Theory of Inquiry\" is much influenced by Peirce. The publication of the first six volumes of \"Collected Papers\" (1931\u20131935) was the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one that Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds; however it did not prompt an outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss, did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and Goudge (1950), the 1941 PhD thesis by Arthur W. Burks (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8), and the studies edited by Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its \"Transactions\", an academic quarterly specializing in Peirce's pragmatism and American philosophy has appeared since 1965. (See Phillips 2014, 62 for discussion of Peirce and Dewey relative to transactionalism.)\nBy 1943 such was Peirce's reputation, in the US at least, that \"Webster's Biographical Dictionary\" said that Peirce was \"now regarded as the most original thinker and greatest logician of his time\".\nIn 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics Carolyn Eisele (1902\u20132000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. So began her forty years of research on Peirce, \u201cthe mathematician and scientist,\u201d culminating in several works (Eisele 1976, 1979, 1985). In 1952, the Scottish philosopher W. B. Gallie had his book \"Peirce and Pragmatism\" published, which introduced the work of Peirce to an international readership. A.J. Ayer, the English philosopher, provided the Editorial Foreword to Gallie's book. In it he credited Peirce's philosophy as being 'not only of great historical significance, as one of the original sources of American pragmatism, but also extremely important in itself.' Ayer concluded: 'it is clear from Professor Gallie\u2019s exposition of his doctrines that he is a philosopher from whom we still have much to learn.'\nBeginning around 1960, Max Fisch (1900-1995), the philosopher and historian of ideas, emerged as an authority on Peirce (Fisch, 1986). He included many of his relevant articles in a survey (Fisch 1986: 422\u2013448) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983.\nPeirce has gained an international following, marked by university research centers devoted to Peirce studies and pragmatism in Brazil (CeneP/CIEP and Centro de Estudos de Pragmatismo), Finland (HPRC and Commens), Germany (Wirth's group, Hoffman's and Otte's group, and Deuser's and H\u00e4rle's group), France (L'I.R.S.C.E.), Spain (GEP), and Italy (CSP). His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish, British, and Brazilian Peirce scholars of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the University of Toronto, thanks in part to the leadership of Thomas Goudge and David Savan. In recent years, U.S. Peirce scholars have clustered at Indiana University \u2013 Purdue University Indianapolis, home of the Peirce Edition Project (PEP) \u2013, and Pennsylvania State University.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Currently, considerable interest is being taken in Peirce's ideas by researchers wholly outside the arena of academic philosophy. The interest comes from industry, business, technology, intelligence organizations, and the military; and it has resulted in the existence of a substantial number of agencies, institutes, businesses, and laboratories in which ongoing research into and development of Peircean concepts are being vigorously undertaken.\nIn recent years, Peirce's trichotomy of signs is exploited by a growing number of practitioners for marketing and design tasks.\nJohn Deely writes that Peirce was the last of the \"moderns\" and \"first of the postmoderns\". He lauds Peirce's doctrine of signs as a contribution to the dawn of the Postmodern epoch. Deely additionally comments that \"Peirce stands...in a position analogous to the position occupied by Augustine as last of the Western Fathers and first of the medievals\".\nWorks.\nPeirce's reputation rests largely on academic papers published in American scientific and scholarly journals such as \"Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\", the \"Journal of Speculative Philosophy\", \"The Monist\", \"Popular Science Monthly\", the \"American Journal of Mathematics\", \"Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences\", \"The Nation\", and others. See Articles by Peirce, published in his lifetime for an extensive list with links to them online. The only full-length book (neither extract nor pamphlet) that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime was \"Photometric Researches\" (1878), a 181-page monograph on the applications of spectrographic methods to astronomy. While at Johns Hopkins, he edited \"Studies in Logic\" (1883), containing chapters by himself and his graduate students. Besides lectures during his years (1879\u20131884) as lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least nine series of lectures, many now published; see Lectures by Peirce.\nAfter Peirce's death, Harvard University obtained from Peirce's widow the papers found in his study, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967) catalogued this \"Nachlass\" did it become clear that Peirce had left approximately 1,650 unpublished manuscripts, totaling over 100,000\u00a0pages, mostly still unpublished except on microfilm. On the vicissitudes of Peirce's papers, see Houser (1989). Reportedly the papers remain in unsatisfactory condition.\nThe first published anthology of Peirce's articles was the one-volume \"Chance, Love and Logic: Philosophical Essays\", edited by Morris Raphael Cohen, 1923, still in print. Other one-volume anthologies were published in 1940, 1957, 1958, 1972, 1994, and 2009, most still in print. The main posthumous editions of Peirce's works in their long trek to light, often multi-volume, and some still in print, have included:\n1931\u20131958: \"Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce\" (CP), 8 volumes, includes many published works, along with a selection of previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence. This long-time standard edition drawn from Peirce's work from the 1860s to 1913 remains the most comprehensive survey of his prolific output from 1893 to 1913. It is organized thematically, but texts (including lecture series) are often split up across volumes, while texts from various stages in Peirce's development are often combined, requiring frequent visits to editors' notes. Edited (1\u20136) by Charles Hartshorne and Paul Weiss and (7\u20138) by Arthur Burks, in print and online.\n1975\u20131987: \"Charles Sanders Peirce: Contributions to\" The Nation, 4 volumes, includes Peirce's more than 300 reviews and articles published 1869\u20131908 in \"The Nation\". Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner and James Edward Cook, online.\n1976: \"The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce\", 4 volumes in 5, included many previously unpublished Peirce manuscripts on mathematical subjects, along with Peirce's important published mathematical articles. Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.\n1977: \"Semiotic and Significs: The Correspondence between C. S. Peirce and Victoria Lady Welby\" (2nd edition 2001), included Peirce's entire correspondence (1903\u20131912) with Victoria, Lady Welby. Peirce's other published correspondence is largely limited to the 14 letters included in volume 8 of the \"Collected Papers\", and the 20-odd pre-1890 items included so far in the \"Writings\". Edited by Charles S. Hardwick with James Cook, out of print.\n1982\u2013now: \"Writings of Charles S. Peirce, A Chronological Edition\" (W), Volumes 1\u20136 &amp; 8, of a projected 30. The limited coverage, and defective editing and organization, of the \"Collected Papers\" led Max Fisch and others in the 1970s to found the http:// (PEP), whose mission is to prepare a more complete critical chronological edition. Only seven volumes have appeared to date, but they cover the period from 1859 to 1892, when Peirce carried out much of his best-known work. \"Writings of Charles S. Peirce\", 8 was published in November 2010; and work continues on \"Writings of Charles S. Peirce\", 7, 9, and 11. In print and online.\n1985: \"Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science: A History of Science\", 2 volumes. Auspitz has said, \"The extent of Peirce's immersion in the science of his day is evident in his reviews in the \"Nation\" [...] and in his papers, grant applications, and publishers' prospectuses in the history and practice of science\", referring latterly to \"Historical Perspectives\". Edited by Carolyn Eisele, back in print.\n1992: \"Reasoning and the Logic of Things\" collects in one place Peirce's 1898 series of lectures invited by William James. Edited by Kenneth Laine Ketner, with commentary by Hilary Putnam, in print.\n1992\u20131998: \"The Essential Peirce\" (EP), 2 volumes, is an important recent sampler of Peirce's philosophical writings. Edited (1) by Nathan Hauser and Christian Kloesel and (2) by \"Peirce Edition Project\" editors, in print.\n1997: \"Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right Thinking\" collects Peirce's 1903 Harvard \"Lectures on Pragmatism\" in a study edition, including drafts, of Peirce's lecture manuscripts, which had been previously published in abridged form; the lectures now also appear in \"The Essential Peirce\", 2. Edited by Patricia Ann Turisi, in print.\n2010: \"Philosophy of Mathematics: Selected Writings\" collects important writings by Peirce on the subject, many not previously in print. Edited by Matthew E. Moore, in print.\nMathematics.\nPeirce's most important work in pure mathematics was in logical and foundational areas. He also worked on linear algebra, matrices, various geometries, topology and Listing numbers, Bell numbers, graphs, the four-color problem, and the nature of continuity.\nHe worked on applied mathematics in economics, engineering, and map projections, and was especially active in probability and statistics.\n\u2193 The Peirce arrow, &lt;br&gt;symbol for \"(neither) ... nor ...\", also called the \"Quine dagger\"\nPeirce made a number of striking discoveries in formal logic and foundational mathematics, nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after he died:\nIn 1860, he suggested a cardinal arithmetic for infinite numbers, years before any work by Georg Cantor (who completed his dissertation in 1867) and without access to Bernard Bolzano's 1851 (posthumous) \"Paradoxien des Unendlichen\".\nIn 1880\u20131881, he showed how Boolean algebra could be done via a repeated sufficient single binary operation (logical NOR), anticipating Henry M. Sheffer by 33\u00a0years. (See also De Morgan's Laws.)\nIn 1881, he set out the axiomatization of natural number arithmetic, a few years before Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano. In the same paper Peirce gave, years before Dedekind, the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set in the sense now known as \"Dedekind-finite\", and implied by the same stroke an important formal definition of an infinite set (Dedekind-infinite), as a set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with one of its proper subsets.\nIn 1885, he distinguished between first-order and second-order quantification. In the same paper he set out what can be read as the first (primitive) axiomatic set theory, anticipating Zermelo by about two decades (Brady 2000, pp.\u00a0132\u2013133).\nIn 1886, he saw that Boolean calculations could be carried out via electrical switches, anticipating Claude Shannon by more than 50 years. \nBy the later 1890s he was devising existential graphs, a diagrammatic notation for the predicate calculus. Based on them are John F. Sowa's conceptual graphs and Sun-Joo Shin's diagrammatic reasoning.\nPeirce wrote drafts for an introductory textbook, with the working title \"The New Elements of Mathematics\", that presented mathematics from an original standpoint. Those drafts and many other of his previously unpublished mathematical manuscripts finally appeared in \"The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce\" (1976), edited by mathematician Carolyn Eisele.\nPeirce agreed with Auguste Comte in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce classified mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the real numbers) and continua. Influenced by his father Benjamin, Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science \"about\" drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.\nMathematics of logic.\nMathematical logic and foundations, some noted articles\nProbability and statistics.\nPeirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that spontaneity (\"absolute chance\") is real (see Tychism on his view). Most of his statistical writings promote the frequency interpretation of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) probability when such models are not based on objective randomization. Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his possible world semantics introduced the \"propensity\" theory of probability before Karl Popper. Peirce (sometimes with Joseph Jastrow) investigated the probability judgments of experimental subjects, \"perhaps the very first\" elicitation and estimation of subjective probabilities in experimental psychology and (what came to be called) Bayesian statistics.\nPeirce formulated modern statistics in \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" (1877\u20131878) and \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (1883). With a repeated measures design, Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow introduced blinded, controlled randomized experiments in 1884 (Hacking 1990:205) (before Ronald A. Fisher). He invented optimal design for experiments on gravity, in which he \"corrected the means\". He used correlation and smoothing. Peirce extended the work on outliers by Benjamin Peirce, his father. He introduced the terms \"confidence\" and \"likelihood\" (before Jerzy Neyman and Fisher). (See Stephen Stigler's historical books and Ian Hacking 1990.)\nAs a philosopher.\nPeirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\", in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including mathematics, logic, philosophy, statistics, astronomy, metrology, geodesy, experimental psychology, economics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.\nPeirce's philosophy includes a pervasive three-category system: belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion (fallibilism) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways\u2014including philosophical pragmatism (which he founded), critical common-sensism, and scientific method\u2014and, in metaphysics: Scholastic realism, e.g. John Duns Scotus, belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, objective idealism, and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love. In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like skepticism and positivism, respectively, in others' work. However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an anti-skepticism and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity, and pragmatism commits one to anti-nominalist belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453\u2013457).\nFor Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences. He divided such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.\nPeirce did not write extensively in aesthetics and ethics, but came by 1902 to hold that aesthetics, ethics, and logic, in that order, comprise the normative sciences. He characterized aesthetics as the study of the good (grasped as the admirable), and thus of the ends governing all conduct and thought.\nInfluence and legacy.\nUmberto Eco described Peirce as \"undoubtedly the greatest unpublished writer of our generation\" and by Karl Popper as \"one of the greatest philosophers of all time\". The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy says of Peirce that although \"long considered an eccentric figure whose contribution to pragmatism was to provide its name and whose importance was as an influence upon James and Dewey, Peirce's significance in his own right is now largely accepted.\"\nPragmatism.\nSome noted articles and lectures\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Consider what effects that might \"conceivably\" have practical bearings you \"conceive\" the objects of your \"conception\" to have. Then, your \"conception\" of those effects is the whole of your \"conception\" of the object.\nAs a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, William James, and others in the Metaphysical Club. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as \" (1877) and especially \" (1878) as foundational to pragmatism. Peirce (CP 5.11\u201312), like James (\"\", 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early John Dewey, in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.\nIn 1905 Peirce coined the new name pragmaticism \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and F.C.S. Schiller's variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini's declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.\nPragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles. In the second one, \"\", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:\nBy way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. In clearness's second grade (the \"nominal\" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which \"would\" be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion\u2014a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction. Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.\nPeirce said that a conception's meaning consists in \"all general modes of rational conduct\" implied by \"acceptance\" of the conception\u2014that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?\u2014the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to \"vulgar\" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Instead the pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances\u2014a method hospitable to the formation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the use and improvement of verification.\nPeirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of definitions and conceptual clearness, is part of his theory of inquiry, which he variously called speculative, general, formal or universal rhetoric or simply methodeutic. He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.\nTheory of inquiry.\nIn \"\" (1877), Peirce gives his take on the psychological origin and aim of inquiry. On his view, individuals are motivated to inquiry by desire to escape the feelings of anxiety and unease which Peirce takes to be characteristic of the state of doubt. Doubt is described by Peirce as an \"uneasy and dissatisfied state from which we struggle to free ourselves and pass into the state of belief.\" Peirce uses words like \"irritation\" to describe the experience of being in doubt and to explain why he thinks we find such experiences to be motivating. The irritating feeling of doubt is appeased, Peirce says, through our efforts to achieve a settled state of satisfaction with what we land on as our answer to the question which led to that doubt in the first place. This settled state, namely, belief, is described by Peirce as \"a calm and satisfactory state which we do not wish to avoid.\" Our efforts to achieve the satisfaction of belief, by whichever methods we may pursue, are what Peirce calls \"inquiry\". Four methods which Peirce describes as having been actually pursued throughout the history of thought are summarized below in the section after next. \nCritical common-sensism.\nCritical common-sensism, treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy with a fallibilism that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to raise genuine doubts in tests for a core group of common indubitables that change slowly, if at all.\nRival methods of inquiry.\nIn \"\" (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth \"per se\" but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:\nPeirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research, which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's \"first rule\" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. Scientific method excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive\u2014eventually\u2014at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth \"per se\" but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.\nScientific method.\nInsofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: deduction from self-evident truths, or \"rationalism\"; and induction from experiential phenomena, or \"empiricism\".\nBased on his critique of three modes of argument and different from either foundationalism or coherentism, Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:\nThereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization \"simpliciter\", which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the scientific method was proposed as an epistemology for philosophical questions.\nA theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.\nPeirce extracted the pragmatic model or theory of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.\nAbduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.\nPeirce's outline of the scientific method in \u00a7III\u2013IV of \"A Neglected Argument\" is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of critique of arguments).\ni. Explication. Not clearly premised, but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.\nii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, Euclidean in procedure. Explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found. Corollarial or, if needed, Theorematic.\ni. Classification. Not clearly premised, but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas.\nii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also \"Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce\", 7.114\u2013120). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of \"S\", \"S\" is found actually accompanied by \"P\" that was predicted for \"S\" (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.\niii. Sentential Induction. \"...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result\".\nAgainst Cartesianism.\nPeirce drew on the methodological implications of the four incapacities\u2014no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable\u2014to attack philosophical Cartesianism, of which he said that:\nTheory of categories.\nOn May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled \"On a New List of Categories\" to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading Aristotle, Immanuel Kant, and G. W. F. Hegel, categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life. Peirce scholars generally regard the \"New List\" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's \"architectonic\", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in \"\" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.\n is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works. In 1893, Peirce restated most of it for a less advanced audience. \n\u00a0\"*Note:\" An interpretant is an interpretation (human or otherwise) in the sense of the product of an interpretive process. \nLogic, or semiotic.\nIn 1918, the logician C.\u00a0I. Lewis wrote, \"The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer\u2014at least in the nineteenth century.\" \nRelational logic.\nBeginning with his first paper on the \"Logic of Relatives\" (1870), Peirce extended the theory of relations pioneered by Augustus De Morgan. Beginning in 1940, Alfred Tarski and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of relation algebra.\nRelational logic gained applications. In mathematics, it influenced the abstract analysis of E. H. Moore and the lattice theory of Garrett Birkhoff. In computer science, the relational model for databases was developed with Peircean ideas in work of Edgar F. Codd, who was a doctoral student of Arthur W. Burks, a Peirce scholar. In economics, relational logic was used by Frank P. Ramsey, John von Neumann, and Paul Samuelson to study preferences and utility and by Kenneth J. Arrow in \"Social Choice and Individual Values\", following Arrow's association with Tarski at City College of New York.\nQuantifiers.\nOn Peirce and his contemporaries Ernst Schr\u00f6der and Gottlob Frege, Hilary Putnam (1982) documented that Frege's work on the logic of quantifiers had little influence on his contemporaries, although it was published four years before the work of Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell. Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's \"On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation\" (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by Peano and Schr\u00f6der, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, philosophy of language, and the foundations of mathematics.\nPeirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides Ernst Schr\u00f6der:\nPhilosophy of logic.\nA philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982); the Introduction in Nathan Houser \"et al.\" (1997); and Randall Dipert's chapter in Cheryl Misak (2004).\nLogic as philosophical.\nPeirce regarded logic \"per se\" as a division of philosophy, as a normative science based on esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics, and as \"the art of devising methods of research\". More generally, as inference, \"logic is rooted in the social principle\", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited. Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) \"mathematics of logic\" much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply \"logic\". He was productive in both (philosophical) logic and logic's mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.\nPeirce argued that logic is formal semiotic: the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. Peirce held that \"all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs\", along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs and sign processes (\"semiosis\") such as the inquiry process. He divided logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or universal rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.\nPresuppositions of logic.\nIn his \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and \"in one sense, the sole\", rule of reason is that, \"to learn, one needs to desire to learn\" and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think. So, the first rule is, \"to wonder\". Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:\n&lt;poem&gt;...there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:\nDo not block the way of inquiry.&lt;/poem&gt;\nPeirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that \"the one unpardonable offence\" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which \"metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted\". Peirce in many writings holds that logic precedes metaphysics (ontological, religious, and physical).\nPeirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of \"fallibilism\", which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real (tychism and synechism).\nThe First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic; presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough (see below). He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.\nFour incapacities.\nThe \"Journal of Speculative Philosophy\" series (1868\u20131869), including\nPeirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning, and the falsity of philosophical Cartesianism (see below).\nPeirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself and later said that to \"dismiss make-believes\" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.\nLogic as formal semiotic.\nPeirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods. Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in Aristotle's work, in such \"loci\" as: the basic terminology of psychology in \"On the Soul\"; the founding description of sign relations in \"On Interpretation\"; and the differentiation of inference into three modes that are commonly translated into English as \"abduction\", \"deduction\", and \"induction\", in the \"Prior Analytics\", as well as inference by analogy (called \"paradeigma\" by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.\nPeirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both \"semiotic\" and \"semeiotic\". Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic sign relation, and defined \"semiosis\" as \"action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of \"three\" subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs\". As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse: \"To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.\"\nPeirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where \"sign\" is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or \"quasi-mind\", that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees\u2014the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).\nInquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:\nPeirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"On the Definition of Logic\". Logic is \"formal semiotic\". A sign is something, \"A\", which brings something, \"B\", its \"interpretant\" sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, \"C\", its \"object\", as that in which itself stands to \"C\". This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of Weierstrassian severity, and that is perfectly evident. The word \"formal\" in the definition is also defined.\nSigns.\nSign relation.\nPeirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign\u2014not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The \"sign relation\" is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its \"object\", and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its \"interpretant\" (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible \"triadic relation\", according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.\n\"Extension \u00d7 intension = information.\" Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of \"extension\" (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of \"intension\" (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, comprehension, significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of \"information\", including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole. For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.\n\"Determination.\" A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object\u2014the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object\u2014an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something \"as\" a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, in which the object is found or from which it is recalled, as when a sign consists in a chance semblance of an absent object. Peirce used the word \"determine\" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of \"specializes\", \"bestimmt\", involving variable amount, like an influence. Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination. The object determines the sign to determine another sign\u2014the interpretant\u2014to be related to the object \"as the sign is related to the object\", hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.\nSemiotic elements.\nPeirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):\nSome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.\nClasses of signs.\nAmong Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a trichotomy, via Peirce's three phenomenological categories: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.\nI. \"Qualisign, sinsign, legisign\" (also called\" tone, token, type,\" and also called \"potisign, actisign, famisign\"): This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category\u2014the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a \"First\"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a \"Second\"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a \"Third\".\nII. \"Icon, index, symbol\": This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object\u2014the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.\nIII. \"Rheme, dicisign, argument\" (also called \"sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,\" also \"seme, pheme, delome,\" and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional \"term, proposition, argument\"): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object\u2014the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.\nEvery sign belongs to one class or another within (I) \"and\" within (II) \"and\" within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.\nModes of inference.\nBorrowing a brace of concepts from Aristotle, Peirce examined three basic modes of inference\u2014\"abduction\", \"deduction\", and \"induction\"\u2014in his \"critique of arguments\" or \"logic proper\". Peirce also called abduction \"retroduction\", \"presumption\", and, earliest of all, \"hypothesis\". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical syllogism Barbara (AAA), for example in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" (1878). He does this by rearranging the \"rule\" (Barbara's major premise), the \"case\" (Barbara's minor premise), and the \"result\" (Barbara's conclusion):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 1883, in \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (\"Studies in Logic\"), Peirce equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The surprising fact, C, is observed;\n But if A were true, C would be a matter of course,\n Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.\nThe logical form does not also cover induction, since induction neither depends on surprise nor proposes a new idea for its conclusion. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. \"Deduction proves that something \"must\" be; Induction shows that something \"actually is\" operative; Abduction merely suggests that something \"may be\".\" Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction. In his methodeutic or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing\nMetaphysics.\nPeirce divided metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) psychical or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.\nOntology.\nOn the issue of universals, Peirce was a scholastic realist, declaring the reality of generals as early as 1868. According to Peirce, his category he called \"thirdness\", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities. Regarding modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.), he came in later years to regard himself as having wavered earlier as to just how positively real the modalities are. In his 1897 \"The Logic of Relatives\" he wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I formerly defined the possible as that which in a given state of information (real or feigned) we do not know not to be true. But this definition today seems to me only a twisted phrase which, by means of two negatives, conceals an anacoluthon. We know in advance of experience that certain things are not true, because we see they are impossible.\nPeirce retained, as useful for some purposes, the definitions in terms of information states, but insisted that the pragmaticist is committed to a strong modal realism by conceiving of objects in terms of predictive general conditional propositions about how they \"would\" behave under certain circumstances.\nContinua.\nContinuity and synechism are central in Peirce's philosophy: \"I did not at first suppose that it was, as I gradually came to find it, the master-Key of philosophy\".\nFrom a mathematical point of view, he embraced infinitesimals and worked long on the mathematics of continua. He long held that the real numbers constitute a pseudo-continuum; that a true continuum is the real subject matter of \"analysis situs\" (topology); and that a true continuum of instants exceeds\u2014and within any lapse of time has room for\u2014any Aleph number (any infinite \"multitude\" as he called it) of instants.\nIn 1908 Peirce wrote that he found that a true continuum might have or lack such room. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Havenel (2008): \"It is on 26\u00a0May 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties.\"\nPsychical or religious metaphysics.\nPeirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits\u2014and it is a belief in God not as an \"actual\" or \"existent\" being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a \"real\" being. In \"\" (1908), Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving habits (for example scientific progress), such that the thought of such purposefulness will \"stand or fall with the hypothesis\"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an \"infinitely incomprehensible\" being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be \"more\" false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless. Peirce also argued that the will is free and (see Synechism) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.\nPhysical metaphysics.\nPeirce held the view, which he called objective idealism, that \"matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws\". Peirce observed that \"Berkeley's metaphysical theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop\". \nPeirce asserted the reality of (1) \"absolute chance\" or randomness (his tychist view), (2) \"mechanical necessity\" or physical laws (anancist view), and (3) what he called the \"law of love\" (agapist view), echoing his categories Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called \"sporting\"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called \"tychasm\", \"anancasm\", and \"agapasm\") of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in Lamarckian evolution; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity, especially of space, time, and law.\nPhilosophy of science.\nPeirce outlined two fields, \"Cenoscopy\" and \"Science of Review\", both of which he called philosophy. Both included philosophy about science. In 1903 he arranged them, from more to less theoretically basic, thus: \nPeirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nContemporaries associated with Peirce.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6118", "revid": "636570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6118", "title": "Carnot heat engine", "text": "Theoretical engine\nA Carnot heat engine is a theoretical heat engine that operates on the Carnot cycle. The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot in 1824. The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded by Beno\u00eet Paul \u00c9mile Clapeyron in 1834 and mathematically explored by Rudolf Clausius in 1857, work that led to the fundamental thermodynamic concept of entropy. The Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine which is theoretically possible. The efficiency depends only upon the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs between which it operates.\nA heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and, in the process, converting some of that energy to mechanical work. The cycle may also be reversed. The system may be worked upon by an external force, and in the process, it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one, thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine.\nEvery thermodynamic system exists in a particular state. A thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states, and finally returned to its initial state. In the process of going through this cycle, the system may perform work on its surroundings, thereby acting as a heat engine.\nThe Carnot engine is a theoretical construct, useful for exploring the efficiency limits of other heat engines. An actual Carnot engine, however, would be completely impractical to build.\nCarnot's diagram.\nIn the adjacent diagram, from Carnot's 1824 work, \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire\", there are \"two bodies \"A\" and \"B\", kept each at a constant temperature, that of \"A\" being higher than that of \"B\". These two bodies to which we can give, or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary, exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric. We will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator.\" Carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power, i.e., \"work\", by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body \"A\" to body \"B\".\nIt also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator.\nModern diagram.\nThe previous image shows the original piston-and-cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engine. The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine, such as the Carnot engine. In the diagram, the \"working body\" (system), a term introduced by Clausius in 1850, can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat \"Q\" can be introduced or transmitted to produce work. Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion, such as vapor of water, vapor of alcohol, vapor of mercury, a permanent gas, air, etc. Although in those early years, engines came in a number of configurations, typically \"Q\"H was supplied by a boiler, wherein water was boiled over a furnace; \"Q\"C was typically removed by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine. The output work, \"W\", is transmitted by the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank-arm, which in turn was typically used to power a pulley so as to lift water out of flooded salt mines. Carnot defined work as \"weight lifted through a height\".\nCarnot cycle.\nThe Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps:\nCarnot's theorem.\nCarnot's theorem is a formal statement of this fact: \"No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs.\"\nformula_1\nExplanation.\nThis maximum efficiency is defined as above:\nA corollary to Carnot's theorem states that: All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient.\nIt is easily shown that the efficiency \u03b7 is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process. This means the total entropy of system and surroundings (the entropies of the hot furnace, the \"working fluid\" of the heat engine, and the cold sink) remains constant when the \"working fluid\" completes one cycle and returns to its original state. (In the general and more realistic case of an irreversible process, the total entropy of this combined system would increase.)\nSince the \"working fluid\" comes back to the same state after one cycle, and entropy of the system is a state function, the change in entropy of the \"working fluid\" system is 0. Thus, it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero, for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum. This derivation is carried out in the next section.\nThe coefficient of performance (COP) of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency.\nEfficiency of real heat engines.\nFor a real heat engine, the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible. The working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle, and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is 0, but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than 0.\nThe internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable, so its total change in one cycle is 0. So the total work done by the system W is equal to the net heat put into the system, the sum of formula_2 &gt; 0 taken up and the waste heat formula_3 &lt; 0 given off:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor real engines, stages 1 and 3 of the Carnot cycle, in which heat is absorbed by the \"working fluid\" from the hot reservoir, and released by it to the cold reservoir, respectively, no longer remain ideally reversible, and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place.\nDuring heat transfer from the hot reservoir at formula_4 to the fluid, the fluid would have a slightly lower temperature than formula_4, and the process for the fluid may not necessarily remain isothermal. \nLet formula_6 be the total entropy change of the fluid in the process of intake of heat.\nwhere the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly lesser than formula_4, in this process.\nSo, one would get:\nSimilarly, at the time of heat injection from the fluid to the cold reservoir one would have, for the magnitude of total entropy change formula_8&lt; 0 of the fluid in the process of expelling heat:\nwhere, during this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir, the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly greater than formula_9.\nWe have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here. Since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is 0, we must have\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe previous three equations, namely (3), (4), (5), substituted into (6) to give:\nFor [\u0394Sh \u2265 (Qh/Th)] +[\u0394Sc \u2265 (Qc/Tc)] = 0\n[\u0394Sh \u2265 (Qh/Th)] = - [\u0394Sc \u2265 (Qc/Tc)]\n= [-\u0394Sc \"\u2264\" (-Qc/Tc)]\nit is at least (Qh/Th) \"\u2264\" (-Qc/Tc)\nEquations (2) and (7) combine to give\nTo derive this step needs two adiabatic processes involved to show an isentropic process property for the ratio of the changing volumes of two isothermal processes are equal. \nMost importantly, since the two adiabatic processes are volume works without heat lost, and since the ratio of volume changes for this two processes are the same, so the works for these two adiabatic processes are the same with opposite direction to each other, namely, one direction is work done by the system and the other is work done on the system; therefore, heat efficiency only concerns the amount of work done by the heat absorbed comparing to the amount of heat absorbed by the system.\nTherefore, (W/Qh) = (Qh - Qc) / Qh\n= 1 - (Qc/Qh)\n= 1 - (Tc/Th)\nAnd, from (7)\n(Qh/Th) \"\u2264\" (-Qc/Tc) here Qc it is less than 0 (release heat) \n-(Tc/Th) \u2265 (Qc/Qh)\n\"1+\"[-(Tc/Th)] \u2265 \"1+\"(Qc/Qh) \n1 - (Tc/Th) \u2265 (Qh + Qc)/Qh here Qc&lt;0, \n1 - (Tc/Th) \u2265 (Qh - Qc)/Qh\n1 - (Tc/Th) \u2265 W/Qh\nHence,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere formula_10 is the efficiency of the real engine, and formula_11 is the efficiency of the Carnot engine working between the same two reservoirs at the temperatures formula_4 and formula_9. For the Carnot engine, the entire process is 'reversible', and Equation (7) is an equality. Hence, the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal Carnot engine.\nEquation (7) signifies that the total entropy of system and surroundings (the fluid and the two reservoirs) increases for the real engine, because (in a surroundings-based analysis) the entropy gain of the cold reservoir as formula_14 flows into it at the fixed temperature formula_9, is greater than the entropy loss of the hot reservoir as formula_16 leaves it at its fixed temperature formula_4. The inequality in Equation (7) is essentially the statement of the Clausius theorem.\nAccording to the second theorem, \"The efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance\".\nThe Carnot engine and Rudolf Diesel.\nIn 1892 Rudolf Diesel patented an internal combustion engine inspired by the Carnot engine. Diesel knew a Carnot engine is an ideal that cannot be built, but he thought he had invented a working approximation. His principle was unsound, but in his struggle to implement it he developed a practical Diesel engine.\nThe conceptual problem was how to achieve isothermal expansion in an internal combustion engine, since burning fuel at the highest temperature of the cycle would only raise the temperature further. Diesel's patented solution was: having achieved the highest temperature just by compressing the air, to add a small amount of fuel at a controlled rate, such that heating caused by burning the fuel would be counteracted by cooling caused by air expansion as the piston moved. Hence all the heat from the fuel would be transformed into work during the isothermal expansion, as required by Carnot's theorem.\nFor the idea to work a small mass of fuel would have to be burnt in a huge mass of air. Diesel first proposed a working engine that would compress air to 250 atmospheres at , then cycle to one atmosphere at . However, this was well beyond the technological capabilities of the day, since it implied a compression ratio of 60:1. Such an engine, if it could have been built, would have had an efficiency of 73%. (In contrast, the best steam engines of his day achieved 7%.)\nAccordingly, Diesel sought to compromise. He calculated that, were he to reduce the peak pressure to a less ambitious 90 atmospheres, he would sacrifice only 5% of the thermal efficiency. Seeking financial support, he published the \"Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Engine to Take the Place of the Steam Engine and All Presently Known Combustion Engines\" (1893). Endorsed by scientific opinion, including Lord Kelvin, he won the backing of Krupp and . He clung to the Carnot cycle as a symbol. But years of practical work failed to achieve an isothermal combustion engine, nor could have done, since it requires such an enormous quantity of air that it cannot develop enough power to compress it. Furthermore, controlled fuel injection turned out to be no easy matter.\nEven so, the Diesel engine slowly evolved over 25 years to become a practical high-compression air engine, its fuel injected near the end of the compression stroke and ignited by the heat of compression, capable by 1969 of 40% efficiency.\nAs a macroscopic construct.\nThe Carnot heat engine is, ultimately, a theoretical construct based on an \"idealized\" thermodynamic system. On a practical human-scale level the Carnot cycle has proven a valuable model, as in advancing the development of the diesel engine. However, on a macroscopic scale limitations placed by the model's assumptions prove it impractical, and, ultimately, incapable of doing any work. As such, per Carnot's theorem, the Carnot engine may be thought as the theoretical limit of macroscopic scale heat engines rather than any practical device that could ever be built.\nFor example, for the isothermal expansion part of the Carnot cycle, the following \n\"infinitesimal\" conditions must be satisfied simultaneously at every step in the expansion:\nSuch \"infinitesimal\" requirements as these (and others) cause the Carnot cycle to take an \"infinite amount of time\", rendering the production of work impossible. \nOther practical requirements that make the Carnot cycle impractical to realize include fine control of the gas, and perfect thermal contact with the surroundings (including high and low temperature reservoirs).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6121", "revid": "73920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6121", "title": "Central America", "text": "Subregion of North America\nCentral America is a subregion of North America. Its political boundaries are defined as bordering Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. Central America is usually defined as consisting of seven countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. Within Central America is the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, which extends from southern Mexico to southeastern Panama. Due to the presence of several active geologic faults and the Central America Volcanic Arc, there is a high amount of seismic activity in the region, such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury, and property damage.\nMost of Central America falls under the Isthmo-Colombian cultural area. Before the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus' voyages to the Americas, hundreds of indigenous peoples made their homes in the area. From the year 1502 onwards, Spain began their colonization. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama and including the modern Mexican state of Chiapas) were governed by the viceroyalty of New Spain from Mexico City as the Captaincy General of Guatemala. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy Juan de O'Donoj\u00fa signed the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba, which established New Spain's independence and autonomy from mainland Spain. On 15 September, the Act of Independence of Central America was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the Spanish Empire. Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region were invaded and annexed to the First Mexican Empire; however in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the Federal Republic of Central America until 1838.\nIn 1838, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent countries, followed by El Salvador in 1841, Panama in 1903, and Belize in 1981. Despite the dissolution of the Federal Republic of Central America, the five remaining countries, save for Panama and Belize, all preserved and maintained a Central American identity.\nThe Spanish-speaking countries officially include both North America and South America as a single continent, , which is split into four subregions: Central America, The Caribbean (a.k.a. the West Indies), North America (Mexico and Northern America), and South America.\nDefinitions.\n\"Central America\" may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:\nHistory.\n Central America was formed more than 3 million years ago, as part of the Isthmus of Panama, when its portion of land connected each side of water.\nIn the Pre-Columbian era, the northern areas of Central America were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica. Most notable among these were the Mayans, who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the Aztecs, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern Honduras, Caribbean Nicaragua, most of Costa Rica and Panama were predominantly speakers of the Chibchan languages at the time of European contact and are considered by some culturally different and grouped in the Isthmo-Colombian Area.\nFollowing the Spanish expedition of Christopher Columbus's voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of Maya territory in 1523. Soon after the conquest of the Aztec Empire, Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado commenced the conquest of northern Central America for the Spanish Empire. Beginning with his arrival in Soconusco in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the K'iche', Tz'utujil, Pipil, and the Kaqchikel. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the Pet\u00e9n Basin remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms \u2013 the Kowoj and the Itza people \u2013 were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n.\nIn 1538, Spain established the Real Audiencia of Panama, which had jurisdiction over all land from the Strait of Magellan to the Gulf of Fonseca. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the \"Audiencia Real de Guatemala\". This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of Chiapas, but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in Antigua Guatemala, was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a captaincy general and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The Captaincy General of Guatemala encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of present-day Belize and Panama.\nThe Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a rebellion in 1811 which began in the Intendancy of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the Act of Independence of Central America. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire, and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.\nSlavery in Central America was a key component of the colonial economies established by Spain from the early 16th century. While Indigenous peoples were the initial targets of forced labor systems such as the encomienda, the catastrophic population decline caused by disease and exploitation led to the increasing importation of enslaved Africans. The transatlantic slave trade brought hundreds of thousands of Africans to the region, particularly to present-day Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama, and Costa Rica, to labor in mining, agriculture, and domestic service.\nAfrican slavery in Central America was concentrated in port cities, mining regions, and plantation zones. Panama, with its strategic location as a transit point between the Atlantic and Pacific, became an early hub for African slave importation as early as the 1510s. Enslaved people were used to build infrastructure, carry goods across the isthmus, and work in emerging urban centers. In Honduras, enslaved Africans were brought to support mining operations in Olancho and agriculture along the northern coast, where they mixed with Indigenous and later Gar\u00edfuna populations (a people of mixed African and Indigenous descent). Guatemala also had a significant enslaved population in its early colonial history, particularly in the sugar-producing areas of Escuintla.\nAfrican slavery in Central America left enduring cultural, demographic, and social legacies. By the 18th century, the importation of African slaves had declined, and free Afro-descendant populations grew through manumission, escape (maroon communities), and intermarriage. Slavery was gradually abolished in the 19th century following independence from Spain. Guatemala formally ended slavery in 1824, Costa Rica in 1824, El Salvador in 1825, Honduras in 1824, and Nicaragua in 1824. However, forms of coerced Indigenous labor persisted well beyond formal abolition.\nModern Afro-descendant communities across Central America, including Afro-Costa Ricans, Afro-Nicaraguans, Afro-Hondurans, Afro-Panamanians, and Afro-Guatemalans. They part the legacy of this complex history of enslavement, resistance, and cultural resilience.\nFrom its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived First Mexican Empire. When the Emperor of Mexico abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the Federal Republic of Central America.\nThe Federal Republic of Central America, initially known as the United Provinces of Central America, was a sovereign state that existed from 1823 to 1840. It was composed of five states: Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. The federation was established after these regions declared independence from Spain in 1821 and briefly joined the Mexican Empire before breaking away to form their own union. The republic adopted a constitution in 1824, which was inspired by the federal system of the United States. It provided for a federal capital, initially located in Guatemala City, and a president for each of the five constituent states. The constitution abolished slavery and maintained the privileges of the Roman Catholic Church, while restricting suffrage to the upper classes.\nThe territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence. Spain, and later Guatemala, considered this land a Guatemalan department. In 1862, Britain formally declared it a British colony and named it British Honduras. It became independent as Belize in 1981.\nPanama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the Isthmus of Panama, has for most of its history been culturally and politically linked to South America. Panama was part of the Province of Tierra Firme from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed \"Audiencia Real de Panama\". Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the Viceroyalty of New Granada, the capital of which was located at Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of military and political struggles took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of Gran Colombia. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the Republic of New Granada. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as Panama State, first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the Granadine Confederation, and finally within the United States of Colombia. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the Republic of Colombia in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the Isthmus Department. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the secession of Panama on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.\nBy the 1930s the United Fruit Company owned of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase banana republic.\nAfter more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict, and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation. Poverty, social injustice, and violence are still widespread. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the western hemisphere, after Haiti.\nGeography.\nCentral America is a part of North America consisting of a tapering isthmus running from the southern extent of Mexico to the northwestern portion of South America. Central America has the Gulf of Mexico, a body of water within the Atlantic Ocean, to the north; the Caribbean Sea, also part of the Atlantic Ocean, to the northeast; and the Pacific Ocean to the southwest. Some physiographists define the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as the northern geographic border of Central America, while others use the northwestern borders of Belize and Guatemala. From there, the Central American land mass extends southeastward to the Atrato River, where it connects to the Pacific Lowlands in northwestern South America.\nCentral America has over 70 active volcanoes, 41 which are located in El Salvador, and Guatemala. The volcano with the most activity in Central America is Santa Mar\u00eda. Still experiencing frequent eruptions to this day, with the last one beginning in 2013, and still is going on to this day.\nOf the many mountain ranges within Central America, the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca. At , Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco is the highest peak in Central America. Other high points of Central America are as listed in the table below:\nBetween the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the raising of livestock and for the production of coffee, tobacco, beans and other crops. Most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala lives in valleys.\nTrade winds have a significant effect upon the climate of Central America. Temperatures in Central America are highest just prior to the summer wet season, and are lowest during the winter dry season, when trade winds contribute to a cooler climate. The highest temperatures occur in April, due to higher levels of sunlight, lower cloud cover and a decrease in trade winds.\nCentral American forests.\nCentral America is part of the Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot, boasting 7% of the world's biodiversity. The Pacific Flyway is a major north\u2013south flyway for migratory birds in the Americas, extending from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Due to the funnel-like shape of its land mass, migratory birds can be seen in very high concentrations in Central America, especially in the spring and autumn. As a bridge between North America and South America, Central America has many species from the Nearctic and the Neotropical realms. However the southern countries (Costa Rica and Panama) of the region have more biodiversity than the northern countries (Guatemala and Belize), meanwhile the central countries (Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador) have the least biodiversity. The table below shows recent statistics:\nOver 300 species of the region's flora and fauna are threatened, 107 of which are classified as critically endangered. The underlying problems are deforestation, which is estimated by FAO at 1.2% per year in Central America and Mexico combined, fragmentation of rainforests and the fact that 80% of the vegetation in Central America has already been converted to agriculture.\nEfforts to protect fauna and flora in the region are made by creating ecoregions and nature reserves. 36% of Belize's land territory falls under some form of official protected status, giving Belize one of the most extensive systems of terrestrial protected areas in the Americas. In addition, 13% of Belize's marine territory are also protected. A large coral reef extends from Mexico to Honduras: the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. The Belize Barrier Reef is part of this. The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse ecosystems of the world. It is home to 70 hard coral species, 36 soft coral species, 500 species of fish and hundreds of invertebrate species.\nSo far only about 10% of the species in the Belize barrier reef have been discovered.\nNational trees.\nFrom 2001 to 2010, of forest were lost in the region. In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest biome, with . Woody vegetation loss was partially set off by a gain in the coniferous forest biome with , and a gain in the dry forest biome at . Mangroves and deserts contributed only 1% to the loss in forest vegetation. The bulk of the deforestation was located at the Caribbean slopes of Nicaragua with a loss of of forest in the period from 2001 to 2010. The most significant regrowth of of forest was seen in the coniferous woody vegetation of Honduras.\nMontane forests.\nThe Central American pine-oak forests ecoregion, in the tropical and subtropical coniferous forests biome, is found in Central America and southern Mexico. The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of , extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the Sierra Madre de Chiapas in Mexico's Chiapas state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between elevation, and are surrounded at lower elevations by tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests. Higher elevations above are usually covered with Central American montane forests. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including oak, pine, fir, and cypress.\nLaurel forest is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen cloud forest, found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than above sea level. Tree species include evergreen oaks, members of the laurel family, species of \"Weinmannia\" and \"Magnolia\", and \"Drimys granadensis\". The cloud forest of Sierra de las Minas, Guatemala, is the largest in Central America. In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the Mombacho volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de Tilar\u00e1n and Volc\u00e1n Arenal, called Monteverde, also in the Cordillera de Talamanca.\nThe Central American montane forests are an ecoregion of the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome, as defined by the World Wildlife Fund. These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer wet season and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from , on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua. The entire ecoregion covers an area of and has a temperate climate with relatively high precipitation levels.\nNational birds.\nEcoregions are not only established to protect the forests themselves but also because they are habitats for an incomparably rich and often endemic fauna. Almost half of the bird population of the Talamancan montane forests in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the resplendent quetzal (\"Pharomacrus mocinno\"), three-wattled bellbird (\"Procnias tricarunculata\"), bare-necked umbrellabird (\"Cephalopterus glabricollis\"), and black guan (\"Chamaepetes unicolor\"). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The golden toad that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extinction are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of that frog is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. Jaguars, cougars, spider monkeys, as well as tapirs, and anteaters live in the woods of Central America. The Central American red brocket is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6122", "revid": "50446187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6122", "title": "Continuous function", "text": "Mathematical function with no sudden changes\nIn mathematics, a continuous function is a function such that a small variation of the argument induces a small variation of the value of the function. This implies there are no abrupt changes in value, known as \"discontinuities\". More precisely, a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its value can be assured by restricting to sufficiently small changes of its argument. A discontinuous function is a function that is not continuous. Until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity and considered only continuous functions. The epsilon\u2013delta definition of a limit was introduced to formalize the definition of continuity.\nContinuity is one of the core concepts of calculus and mathematical analysis, where arguments and values of functions are real and complex numbers. The concept has been generalized to functions between metric spaces and between topological spaces. The latter are the most general continuous functions, and their definition is the basis of topology.\nA stronger form of continuity is uniform continuity. In order theory, especially in domain theory, a related concept of continuity is Scott continuity.\nAs an example, the function \"H\"(\"t\") denoting the height of a growing flower at time t would be considered continuous. In contrast, the function \"M\"(\"t\") denoting the amount of money in a bank account at time t would be considered discontinuous since it \"jumps\" at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn.\nHistory.\nA form of the epsilon\u2013delta definition of continuity was first given by Bernard Bolzano in 1817. Augustin-Louis Cauchy defined continuity of formula_1 as follows: an infinitely small increment formula_2 of the independent variable \"x\" always produces an infinitely small change formula_3 of the dependent variable \"y\" (see e.g. \"Cours d'Analyse\", p.\u00a034). Cauchy defined infinitely small quantities in terms of variable quantities, and his definition of continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today (see microcontinuity). The formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and uniform continuity were first given by Bolzano in the 1830s, but the work wasn't published until the 1930s. Like Bolzano, Karl Weierstrass denied continuity of a function at a point \"c\" unless it was defined at and on both sides of \"c\", but \u00c9douard Goursat allowed the function to be defined only at and on one side of \"c\", and Camille Jordan allowed it even if the function was defined only at \"c\". All three of those nonequivalent definitions of pointwise continuity are still in use. Eduard Heine provided the first published definition of uniform continuity in 1872, but based these ideas on lectures given by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet in 1854.\nReal functions.\nDefinition.\nA real function that is a function from real numbers to real numbers can be represented by a graph in the Cartesian plane; such a function is continuous if, roughly speaking, the graph is a single unbroken curve whose domain is the entire real line. A more mathematically rigorous definition is given below.\nContinuity of real functions is usually defined in terms of limits. A function \"f\" with variable x is \"continuous at\" the real number c, if the limit of formula_4 as x tends to c, is equal to formula_5\nThere are several different definitions of the (global) continuity of a function, which depend on the nature of its domain. \nA function is continuous on an open interval if the interval is contained in the function's domain and the function is continuous at every interval point. A function that is continuous on the interval formula_6 (the whole real line) is often called simply a continuous function; one also says that such a function is \"continuous everywhere\". For example, all polynomial functions are continuous everywhere.\nA function is continuous on a semi-open or a closed interval; if the interval is contained in the domain of the function, the function is continuous at every interior point of the interval, and the value of the function at each endpoint that belongs to the interval is the limit of the values of the function when the variable tends to the endpoint from the interior of the interval. For example, the function formula_7 is continuous on its whole domain, which is the semi-open interval formula_8\nMany commonly encountered functions are partial functions that have a domain formed by all real numbers, except some isolated points. Examples include the reciprocal function formula_9 and the tangent function formula_10 When they are continuous on their domain, one says, in some contexts, that they are continuous, although they are not continuous everywhere. In other contexts, mainly when one is interested in their behavior near the exceptional points, one says they are discontinuous.\nA partial function is \"discontinuous\" at a point if the point belongs to the topological closure of its domain, and either the point does not belong to the domain of the function or the function is not continuous at the point. For example, the functions formula_11 and formula_12 are discontinuous at 0, and remain discontinuous whichever value is chosen for defining them at 0. A point where a function is discontinuous is called a \"discontinuity\".\nUsing mathematical notation, several ways exist to define continuous functions in the three senses mentioned above.\nLet formula_13 be a function whose domain formula_14 is contained in formula_15 of real numbers.\nSome (but not all) possibilities for formula_14 are: \nIn the case of an open interval, formula_23 and formula_24 do not belong to formula_14, and the values formula_26 and formula_27 are not defined, and if they are, they do not matter for continuity on formula_14.\nDefinition in terms of limits of functions.\nThe function \"f\" is \"continuous at some point\" \"c\" of its domain if the limit of formula_4 as \"x\" approaches \"c\" through the domain of \"f\", exists and is equal to formula_5 In mathematical notation, this is written as\nformula_31\nIn detail this means three conditions: first, \"f\" has to be defined at \"c\" (guaranteed by the requirement that \"c\" is in the domain of \"f\"). Second, the limit of that equation has to exist. Third, the value of this limit must equal formula_5\nDefinition in terms of neighborhoods.\nA neighborhood of a point \"c\" is a set that contains, at least, all points within some fixed distance of \"c\". Intuitively, a function is continuous at a point \"c\" if the range of \"f\" over the neighborhood of \"c\" shrinks to a single point formula_33 as the width of the neighborhood around \"c\" shrinks to zero. More precisely, a function \"f\" is continuous at a point \"c\" of its domain if, for any neighborhood formula_34 there is a neighborhood formula_35 in its domain such that formula_36 whenever formula_37\nAs neighborhoods are defined in any topological space, this definition of a continuous function applies not only for real functions but also when the domain and the codomain are topological spaces and is thus the most general definition. It follows that a function is automatically continuous at every isolated point of its domain. For example, every real-valued function on the integers is continuous.\nDefinition in terms of limits of sequences.\nOne can instead require that for any sequence formula_38 of points in the domain which converges to \"c\", the corresponding sequence formula_39 converges to formula_5 In mathematical notation, formula_41\nWeierstrass and Jordan definitions (epsilon\u2013delta) of continuous functions.\nExplicitly including the definition of the limit of a function, we obtain a self-contained definition: Given a function formula_42 as above and an element formula_43 of the domain formula_14, formula_45 is said to be continuous at the point formula_43 when the following holds: For any positive real number formula_47 however small, there exists some positive real number formula_48 such that for all formula_49 in the domain of formula_45 with formula_51 the value of formula_52 satisfies\nformula_53\nAlternatively written, continuity of formula_42 at formula_55 means that for every formula_47 there exists a formula_48 such that for all formula_58:\nformula_59\nMore intuitively, we can say that if we want to get all the formula_52 values to stay in some small neighborhood around formula_61 we need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the formula_49 values around formula_63 If we can do that no matter how small the formula_64 neighborhood is, then formula_45 is continuous at formula_63\nIn modern terms, this is generalized by the definition of continuity of a function with respect to a basis for the topology, here the metric topology.\nWeierstrass had required that the interval formula_67 be entirely within the domain formula_14, but Jordan removed that restriction.\nDefinition in terms of control of the remainder.\nIn proofs and numerical analysis, we often need to know how fast limits are converging, or in other words, control of the remainder. We can formalize this to a definition of continuity. \nA function formula_69 is called a control function if\nA function formula_71 is \"C\"-continuous at formula_43 if there exists such a neighbourhood formula_73 that \nformula_74\nA function is continuous in formula_43 if it is \"C\"-continuous for some control function \"C\".\nThis approach leads naturally to refining the notion of continuity by restricting the set of admissible control functions. For a given set of control functions formula_76 a function is formula_76-continuous if it is formula_78-continuous for some formula_79 For example, the Lipschitz, the H\u00f6lder continuous functions of exponent \u03b1 and the uniformly continuous functions below are defined by the set of control functions \nformula_80 \nformula_81\nformula_82\nrespectively.\nDefinition using oscillation.\nContinuity can also be defined in terms of oscillation: a function \"f\" is continuous at a point formula_43 if and only if its oscillation at that point is zero; in symbols, formula_84 A benefit of this definition is that it quantifies discontinuity: the oscillation gives how much the function is discontinuous at a point.\nThis definition is helpful in descriptive set theory to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points \u2013 the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than formula_85 (hence a formula_86 set) \u2013 and gives a rapid proof of one direction of the Lebesgue integrability condition.\nThe oscillation is equivalent to the formula_87 definition by a simple re-arrangement and by using a limit (lim sup, lim inf) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given formula_88 there is no formula_89 that satisfies the formula_87 definition, then the oscillation is at least formula_91 and conversely if for every formula_85 there is a desired formula_93 the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.\nDefinition using the hyperreals.\nCauchy defined the continuity of a function in the following intuitive terms: an infinitesimal change in the independent variable corresponds to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable (see \"Cours d'analyse\", page 34). Non-standard analysis is a way of making this mathematically rigorous. The real line is augmented by adding infinite and infinitesimal numbers to form the hyperreal numbers. In nonstandard analysis, continuity can be defined as follows.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;A real-valued function \"f\" is continuous at x if its natural extension to the hyperreals has the property that for all infinitesimal \"dx\", formula_94 is infinitesimal\n(see microcontinuity). In other words, an infinitesimal increment of the independent variable always produces an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable, giving a modern expression to Augustin-Louis Cauchy's definition of continuity.\nRules for continuity.\nProving the continuity of a function by a direct application of the definition is generally a noneasy task. Fortunately, in practice, most functions are built from simpler functions, and their continuity can be deduced immediately from the way they are defined, by applying the following rules:\nThese rules imply that every polynomial function is continuous everywhere and that a rational function is continuous everywhere where it is defined, if the numerator and the denominator have no common zeros. More generally, the quotient of two continuous functions is continuous outside the zeros of the denominator.\nAn example of a function for which the above rules are not sufficient is the sinc function, which is defined by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. The above rules show immediately that the function is continuous for &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, but, for proving the continuity at &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, one has to prove \nformula_95\nAs this is true, one gets that the sinc function is continuous function on all real numbers.\nExamples of discontinuous functions.\nAn example of a discontinuous function is the Heaviside step function formula_96, defined by\nformula_97\nPick for instance formula_98. Then there is no formula_89-neighborhood around formula_100, i.e. no open interval formula_101 with formula_102 that will force all the formula_103 values to be within the formula_85-neighborhood of formula_105, i.e. within formula_106. Intuitively, we can think of this type of discontinuity as a sudden jump in function values.\nSimilarly, the signum or sign function\nformula_107\nis discontinuous at formula_100 but continuous everywhere else. Yet another example: the function\nformula_109\nis continuous everywhere apart from formula_100.\nBesides plausible continuities and discontinuities like above, there are also functions with a behavior, often coined pathological, for example, Thomae's function,\nformula_111\nis continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers. In a similar vein, Dirichlet's function, the indicator function for the set of rational numbers,\nformula_112\nis nowhere continuous.\nProperties.\nA useful lemma.\nLet formula_52 be a function that is continuous at a point formula_114 and formula_115 be a value such formula_116 Then formula_117 throughout some neighbourhood of formula_63\n\"Proof:\" By the definition of continuity, take formula_119 , then there exists formula_120 such that \nformula_121\nSuppose there is a point in the neighbourhood formula_122 for which formula_123 then we have the contradiction\nformula_124\nIntermediate value theorem.\nThe intermediate value theorem is an existence theorem, based on the real number property of completeness, and states:\nIf the real-valued function \"f\" is continuous on the closed interval formula_125 and \"k\" is some number between formula_26 and formula_127 then there is some number formula_128 such that formula_129\nFor example, if a child grows from 1\u00a0m to 1.5\u00a0m between the ages of two and six years, then, at some time between two and six years of age, the child's height must have been 1.25\u00a0m.\nAs a consequence, if \"f\" is continuous on formula_130 and formula_26 and formula_27 differ in sign, then, at some point formula_128 formula_33 must equal zero.\nExtreme value theorem.\nThe extreme value theorem states that if a function \"f\" is defined on a closed interval formula_130 (or any closed and bounded set) and is continuous there, then the function attains its maximum, i.e. there exists formula_136 with formula_137 for all formula_138 The same is true of the minimum of \"f\". These statements are not, in general, true if the function is defined on an open interval formula_139 (or any set that is not both closed and bounded), as, for example, the continuous function formula_140 defined on the open interval (0,1), does not attain a maximum, being unbounded above.\nRelation to differentiability and integrability.\nEvery differentiable function\nformula_141\nis continuous, as can be shown. The converse does not hold: for example, the absolute value function\nformula_142\nis everywhere continuous. However, it is not differentiable at formula_100 (but is so everywhere else). Weierstrass's function is also everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable.\nThe derivative \"f\u2032\"(\"x\") of a differentiable function \"f\"(\"x\") need not be continuous. If \"f\u2032\"(\"x\") is continuous, \"f\"(\"x\") is said to be \"continuously differentiable\". The set of such functions is denoted formula_144 More generally, the set of functions\nformula_145\n(from an open interval (or open subset of formula_15) formula_147 to the reals) such that \"f\" is formula_148 times differentiable and such that the formula_148-th derivative of \"f\" is continuous is denoted formula_150 See differentiability class. In the field of computer graphics, properties related (but not identical) to formula_151 are sometimes called formula_152 (continuity of position), formula_153 (continuity of tangency), and formula_154 (continuity of curvature); see Smoothness of curves and surfaces.\nEvery continuous function\nformula_155\nis integrable (for example in the sense of the Riemann integral). The converse does not hold, as the (integrable but discontinuous) sign function shows.\nPointwise and uniform limits.\nGiven a sequence\nformula_156\nof functions such that the limit\nformula_157\nexists for all formula_158, the resulting function formula_52 is referred to as the pointwise limit of the sequence of functions formula_160 The pointwise limit function need not be continuous, even if all functions formula_161 are continuous, as the animation at the right shows. However, \"f\" is continuous if all functions formula_161 are continuous and the sequence converges uniformly, by the uniform convergence theorem. This theorem can be used to show that the exponential functions, logarithms, square root function, and trigonometric functions are continuous.\nDirectional Continuity.\nDiscontinuous functions may be discontinuous in a restricted way, giving rise to the concept of directional continuity (or right and left continuous functions) and semi-continuity. Roughly speaking, a function is right-continuous if no jump occurs when the limit point is approached from the right. Formally, \"f\" is said to be right-continuous at the point \"c\" if the following holds: For any number formula_163 however small, there exists some number formula_48 such that for all \"x\" in the domain with formula_165 the value of formula_52 satisfies\nformula_167\nThis is the same condition as continuous functions, except it is required to hold only for \"x\" strictly larger than \"c\". Requiring formula_168 to hold instead for all \"x\" with formula_169 yields the notion of left-continuous functions. A function is continuous if and only if it is both right-continuous and left-continuous.\nSemicontinuity.\nA function \"f\" is lower semi-continuous at the point \"c\" if, roughly, any jumps that might occur only go down, but not up. That is, for any formula_47 there exists some number formula_48 such that for all \"x\" in the domain with formula_172 the value of formula_52 satisfies\nformula_174\nThe reverse condition is upper semi-continuity.\nContinuous functions between metric spaces.\nThe concept of continuous real-valued functions can be generalized to functions between metric spaces. A metric space is a set formula_175 equipped with a function (called metric) formula_176 that can be thought of as a measurement of the distance of any two elements in \"X\". Formally, the metric is a function\nformula_177\nthat satisfies a number of requirements, notably the triangle inequality. Given two metric spaces formula_178 and formula_179 and a function\nformula_180\nthen formula_45 is continuous at the point formula_182 (with respect to the given metrics) if for any positive real number formula_47 there exists a positive real number formula_48 such that all formula_185 satisfying formula_186 will also satisfy formula_187 As in the case of real functions above, this is equivalent to the condition that for every sequence formula_188 in formula_175 with limit formula_190 we have formula_191 The latter condition can be weakened as follows: formula_45 is continuous at the point formula_193 if and only if for every convergent sequence formula_188 in formula_175 with limit formula_193, the sequence formula_197 is a Cauchy sequence, and formula_193 is in the domain of formula_45.\nThe set of points at which a function between metric spaces is continuous is a formula_86 set\u00a0\u2013 this follows from the formula_87 definition of continuity.\nThis notion of continuity is applied, for example, in functional analysis. A key statement in this area says that a linear operator\nformula_202\nbetween normed vector spaces formula_203 and formula_204 (which are vector spaces equipped with a compatible norm, denoted formula_205) is continuous if and only if it is bounded, that is, there is a constant formula_206 such that\nformula_207\nfor all formula_208\nUniform, H\u00f6lder and Lipschitz continuity.\nThe concept of continuity for functions between metric spaces can be strengthened in various ways by limiting the way formula_89 depends on formula_85 and \"c\" in the definition above. Intuitively, a function \"f\" as above is uniformly continuous if the formula_89 does\nnot depend on the point \"c\". More precisely, it is required that for every real number formula_163 there exists formula_48 such that for every formula_214 with formula_215 we have that formula_216 Thus, any uniformly continuous function is continuous. The converse does not generally hold but holds when the domain space \"X\" is compact. Uniformly continuous maps can be defined in the more general situation of uniform spaces.\nA function is H\u00f6lder continuous with exponent \u03b1 (a real number) if there is a constant \"K\" such that for all formula_217 the inequality\nformula_218\nholds. Any H\u00f6lder continuous function is uniformly continuous. The particular case formula_219 is referred to as Lipschitz continuity. That is, a function is Lipschitz continuous if there is a constant \"K\" such that the inequality\nformula_220\nholds for any formula_221 The Lipschitz condition occurs, for example, in the Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem concerning the solutions of ordinary differential equations.\nContinuous functions between topological spaces.\nAnother, more abstract, notion of continuity is the continuity of functions between topological spaces in which there generally is no formal notion of distance, as there is in the case of metric spaces. A topological space is a set \"X\" together with a topology on \"X\", which is a set of subsets of \"X\" satisfying a few requirements with respect to their unions and intersections that generalize the properties of the open balls in metric spaces while still allowing one to talk about the neighborhoods of a given point. The elements of a topology are called open subsets of \"X\" (with respect to the topology).\nA function\nformula_180\nbetween two topological spaces \"X\" and \"Y\" is continuous if for every open set formula_223 the inverse image\nformula_224\nis an open subset of \"X\". That is, \"f\" is a function between the sets \"X\" and \"Y\" (not on the elements of the topology formula_225), but the continuity of \"f\" depends on the topologies used on \"X\" and \"Y\".\nThis is equivalent to the condition that the preimages of the closed sets (which are the complements of the open subsets) in \"Y\" are closed in \"X\".\nAn extreme example: if a set \"X\" is given the discrete topology (in which every subset is open), all functions\nformula_226\nto any topological space \"T\" are continuous. On the other hand, if \"X\" is equipped with the indiscrete topology (in which the only open subsets are the empty set and \"X\") and the space \"T\" set is at least T0, then the only continuous functions are the constant functions. Conversely, any function whose codomain is indiscrete is continuous.\nContinuity at a point.\nThe translation in the language of neighborhoods of the formula_227-definition of continuity leads to the following definition of the continuity at a point:\nThis definition is equivalent to the same statement with neighborhoods restricted to open neighborhoods and can be restated in several ways by using preimages rather than images. One of those ways is the following. As every set that contains a neighborhood is also a neighborhood, and formula_228 is the largest subset formula_229 such that formula_230 the above definition may be simplified into:\nAs an open set is a set that is a neighborhood of all its points, a function formula_231 is continuous at every point of \"X\" if and only if it is a continuous function.\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are metric spaces, it is equivalent to consider the neighborhood system of open balls centered at \"x\" and \"f\"(\"x\") instead of all neighborhoods. This gives back the above formula_87 definition of continuity in the context of metric spaces. In general topological spaces, there is no notion of nearness or distance. If, however, the target space is a Hausdorff space, it is still true that \"f\" is continuous at \"a\" if and only if the limit of \"f\" as \"x\" approaches \"a\" is \"f\"(\"a\"). At an isolated point, every function is continuous.\nGiven formula_233 a map formula_231 is continuous at formula_49 if and only if whenever formula_236 is a filter on formula_175 that converges to formula_49 in formula_239 which is expressed by writing formula_240 then necessarily formula_241 in formula_242 \nIf formula_243 denotes the neighborhood filter at formula_49 then formula_231 is continuous at formula_49 if and only if formula_247 in formula_242 Moreover, this happens if and only if the prefilter formula_249 is a filter base for the neighborhood filter of formula_52 in formula_242\nAlternative definitions.\nSeveral equivalent definitions for a topological structure exist; thus, several equivalent ways exist to define a continuous function.\nSequences and nets.\nIn several contexts, the topology of a space is conveniently specified in terms of limit points. This is often accomplished by specifying when a point is the limit of a sequence. Still, for some spaces that are too large in some sense, one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a directed set, known as nets. A function is (Heine-)continuous only if it takes limits of sequences to limits of sequences. In the former case, preservation of limits is also sufficient; in the latter, a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous, and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition.\nIn detail, a function formula_231 is sequentially continuous if whenever a sequence formula_188 in formula_175 converges to a limit formula_255 the sequence formula_197 converges to formula_257 Thus, sequentially continuous functions \"preserve sequential limits.\" Every continuous function is sequentially continuous. If formula_175 is a first-countable space and countable choice holds, then the converse also holds: any function preserving sequential limits is continuous. In particular, if formula_175 is a metric space, sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent. For non-first-countable spaces, sequential continuity might be strictly weaker than continuity. (The spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called sequential spaces.) This motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces. Continuous functions preserve the limits of nets, and this property characterizes continuous functions.\nFor instance, consider the case of real-valued functions of one real variable:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u2014A function formula_260 is continuous at formula_43 if and only if it is sequentially continuous at that point.\nClosure operator and interior operator definitions.\nIn terms of the interior and closure operators, we have the following equivalences,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_theorem/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTheorem\u2014Let formula_262 be a mapping between topological spaces. Then the following are equivalent.\nIf we declare that a point formula_49 is close to a subset formula_264 if formula_265 then this terminology allows for a plain English description of continuity: formula_45 is continuous if and only if for every subset formula_267 formula_45 maps points that are close to formula_269 to points that are close to formula_270 Similarly, formula_45 is continuous at a fixed given point formula_185 if and only if whenever formula_49 is close to a subset formula_267 then formula_52 is close to formula_270\nInstead of specifying topological spaces by their open subsets, any topology on formula_175 can alternatively be determined by a closure operator or by an interior operator. \nSpecifically, the map that sends a subset formula_269 of a topological space formula_175 to its topological closure formula_280 satisfies the Kuratowski closure axioms. Conversely, for any closure operator formula_281 there exists a unique topology formula_282 on formula_175 (specifically, formula_284) such that for every subset formula_267 formula_286 is equal to the topological closure formula_287 of formula_269 in formula_289 If the sets formula_175 and formula_291 are each associated with closure operators (both denoted by formula_292) then a map formula_231 is continuous if and only if formula_294 for every subset formula_295\nSimilarly, the map that sends a subset formula_269 of formula_175 to its topological interior formula_298 defines an interior operator. Conversely, any interior operator formula_299 induces a unique topology formula_282 on formula_175 (specifically, formula_302) such that for every formula_267 formula_304 is equal to the topological interior formula_305 of formula_269 in formula_289 If the sets formula_175 and formula_291 are each associated with interior operators (both denoted by formula_310) then a map formula_231 is continuous if and only if formula_312 for every subset formula_313\nFilters and prefilters.\nContinuity can also be characterized in terms of filters. A function formula_231 is continuous if and only if whenever a filter formula_236 on formula_175 converges in formula_175 to a point formula_233 then the prefilter formula_319 converges in formula_291 to formula_257 This characterization remains true if the word \"filter\" is replaced by \"prefilter.\"\nProperties.\nIf formula_231 and formula_323 are continuous, then so is the composition formula_324 If formula_231 is continuous and\nThe possible topologies on a fixed set \"X\" are partially ordered: a topology formula_326 is said to be coarser than another topology formula_327 (notation: formula_328) if every open subset with respect to formula_326 is also open with respect to formula_330 Then, the identity map\nformula_331\nis continuous if and only if formula_328 (see also comparison of topologies). More generally, a continuous function\nformula_333\nstays continuous if the topology formula_334 is replaced by a coarser topology and/or formula_335 is replaced by a finer topology.\nHomeomorphisms.\nSymmetric to the concept of a continuous map is an open map, for which images of open sets are open. If an open map \"f\" has an inverse function, that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map \"g\" has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a bijective function \"f\" between two topological spaces, the inverse function formula_336 need not be continuous. A bijective continuous function with a continuous inverse function is called a homeomorphism.\nIf a continuous bijection has as its domain a compact space and its codomain is Hausdorff, then it is a homeomorphism.\nDefining topologies via continuous functions.\nGiven a function\nformula_337\nwhere \"X\" is a topological space and \"S\" is a set (without a specified topology), the final topology on \"S\" is defined by letting the open sets of \"S\" be those subsets \"A\" of \"S\" for which formula_338 is open in \"X\". If \"S\" has an existing topology, \"f\" is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is coarser than the final topology on \"S\". Thus, the final topology is the finest topology on \"S\" that makes \"f\" continuous. If \"f\" is surjective, this topology is canonically identified with the quotient topology under the equivalence relation defined by \"f\".\nDually, for a function \"f\" from a set \"S\" to a topological space \"X\", the initial topology on \"S\" is defined by designating as an open set every subset \"A\" of \"S\" such that formula_339 for some open subset \"U\" of \"X\". If \"S\" has an existing topology, \"f\" is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is finer than the initial topology on \"S\". Thus, the initial topology is the coarsest topology on \"S\" that makes \"f\" continuous. If \"f\" is injective, this topology is canonically identified with the subspace topology of \"S\", viewed as a subset of \"X\".\nA topology on a set \"S\" is uniquely determined by the class of all continuous functions formula_340 into all topological spaces \"X\". Dually, a similar idea can be applied to maps formula_341\nRelated notions.\nIf formula_342 is a continuous function from some subset formula_343 of a topological space formula_175 then a of formula_45 to formula_175 is any continuous function formula_347 such that formula_348 for every formula_349, which is a condition that is often written as formula_350. In words, it is any continuous function formula_347 that restricts to formula_45 on formula_343. This notion is used, for example, in the Tietze extension theorem and the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem. If formula_342 is not continuous, then it could not possibly have a continuous extension. If formula_291 is a Hausdorff space and formula_343 is a dense subset of formula_175 then a continuous extension of formula_342 to formula_175, if one exists, will be unique. The Blumberg theorem states that if formula_360 is an arbitrary function then there exists a dense subset formula_14 of formula_15 such that the restriction formula_363 is continuous; in other words, every function formula_364 can be restricted to some dense subset on which it is continuous. \nVarious other mathematical domains use the concept of continuity in different but related meanings. For example, in order theory, an order-preserving function formula_231 between particular types of partially ordered sets formula_175 and formula_291 is continuous if for each directed subset formula_269 of formula_239 we have formula_370 Here formula_371 is the supremum with respect to the orderings in formula_175 and formula_373 respectively. This notion of continuity is the same as topological continuity when the partially ordered sets are given the Scott topology.\nIn category theory, a functor\nformula_374\nbetween two categories is called continuous if it commutes with small limits. That is to say,\nformula_375\nfor any small (that is, indexed by a set formula_376 as opposed to a class) diagram of objects in formula_377.\nA continuity space is a generalization of metric spaces and posets, which uses the concept of quantales, and that can be used to unify the notions of metric spaces and domains.\nIn measure theory, a function formula_378 defined on a Lebesgue measurable set formula_379 is called approximately continuous at a point formula_380 if the approximate limit of formula_45 at formula_43 exists and equals formula_64. This generalizes the notion of continuity by replacing the ordinary limit with the approximate limit. A fundamental result known as the Stepanov-Denjoy theorem states that a function is measurable if and only if it is approximately continuous almost everywhere.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6123", "revid": "40130528", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6123", "title": "Curl (mathematics)", "text": "Circulation density in a vector field\nIn vector calculus, the curl, also known as rotor, is a vector operator that describes the infinitesimal circulation of a vector field in three-dimensional Euclidean space. The curl at a point in the field is represented by a vector whose length and direction denote the magnitude and axis of the maximum circulation respectively. The curl of a field is formally defined as the circulation density at each point of the field.\nA vector field whose curl is zero is called irrotational. The curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields. The corresponding form of the fundamental theorem of calculus is Stokes' theorem, which relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary curve.\nThe notation curl F is more common in English-speaking countries. In the rest of the world, particularly in 20th century scientific literature, the alternative notation rot F is traditionally used, which comes from the \"rate of rotation\" that it represents. To avoid confusion, modern authors tend to use the cross product notation with the del (nabla) operator, as in formula_1, which also reveals the relation between curl (rotor), divergence, and gradient operators.\nUnlike the gradient and divergence, curl as formulated in vector calculus does not generalize simply to other dimensions; some generalizations are possible, but only in three dimensions is the geometrically defined curl of a vector field again a vector field. This deficiency is a direct consequence of the limitations of vector calculus; on the other hand, when expressed as an antisymmetric tensor field via the wedge operator of geometric calculus, the curl generalizes to all dimensions. The circumstance is similar to that attending the 3-dimensional cross product, and indeed the connection is reflected in the notation formula_2 for the curl. \nThe name \"curl\" was first suggested by James Clerk Maxwell in 1871 but the concept was apparently first used in the construction of an optical field theory by James MacCullagh in 1839.\nDefinition.\n&lt;/math&gt; and the fingers curl along the orientation of \"C\"\nThe curl of a vector field F, denoted by curl F, or formula_1, or rot F, is an operator that maps \"Ck\" functions in R3 to \"C\"\"k\"\u22121 functions in R3, and in particular, it maps continuously differentiable functions R3 \u2192 R3 to continuous functions R3 \u2192 R3. It can be defined in several ways, to be mentioned below:\nOne way to define the curl of a vector field at a point is implicitly through its components along various axes passing through the point: if formula_4 is any unit vector, the component of the curl of F along the direction formula_4 may be defined to be the limiting value of a closed line integral in a plane perpendicular to formula_4 divided by the area enclosed, as the path of integration is contracted indefinitely around the point.\nMore specifically, the curl is defined at a point \"p\" as\nformula_7\nwhere the line integral is calculated along the boundary \"C\" of the area \"A\" containing point p, being the magnitude of the area. This equation defines the component of the curl of F along the direction formula_4. The infinitesimal surfaces bounded by \"C\" have formula_4 as their normal. \"C\" is oriented via the right-hand rule.\nThe above formula means that the component of the curl of a vector field along a certain axis is the \"infinitesimal area density\" of the circulation of the field in a plane perpendicular to that axis. This formula does not \"a priori\" define a legitimate vector field, for the individual circulation densities with respect to various axes \"a priori\" need not relate to each other in the same way as the components of a vector do; that they \"do\" indeed relate to each other in this precise manner must be proven separately.\nTo this definition fits naturally the Kelvin\u2013Stokes theorem, as a global formula corresponding to the definition. It equates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field to the above line integral taken around the boundary of the surface.\nAnother way one can define the curl vector of a function F at a point is explicitly as the limiting value of a vector-valued surface integral around a shell enclosing \"p\" divided by the volume enclosed, as the shell is contracted indefinitely around \"p\".\nMore specifically, the curl may be defined by the vector formula\nformula_10\nwhere the surface integral is calculated along the boundary \"S\" of the volume \"V\", being the magnitude of the volume, and formula_11 pointing outward from the surface \"S\" perpendicularly at every point in \"S\".\nIn this formula, the cross product in the integrand measures the tangential component of F at each point on the surface \"S\", and points along the surface at right angles to the \"tangential projection\" of F. Integrating this cross product over the whole surface results in a vector whose magnitude measures the overall circulation of F around \"S\", and whose direction is at right angles to this circulation. The above formula says that the \"curl\" of a vector field at a point is the \"infinitesimal volume density\" of this \"circulation vector\" around the point.\nTo this definition fits naturally another global formula (similar to the Kelvin-Stokes theorem) which equates the volume integral of the curl of a vector field to the above surface integral taken over the boundary of the volume. \nA third way to define the curl emphasizes its interpretation as twice the \"rotation vector\" of an infinitesimal spherical volume of field. \nIt can be shown that the curl fulfills \nformula_12\nwhere formula_13 and formula_14 are points in formula_15, \nformula_16,\nand formula_17 denotes the ball of radius formula_18 centered at formula_19.\nOn the other hand, the instantaneous rotation vector formula_20 of a rigid body with motion field formula_21 is given, for every ball formula_17, by the integral mean formula\nformula_23\n(thus formula_24).\nWe see that the curl appears as twice the rotation vector of an infinitesimal spherical volume of field formula_25,\nseen (up to the third order), as a rigid body with motion field equal to formula_25. \nWhereas the above three definitions of the curl are coordinate free, there is another \"easy to memorize\" definition of the curl in curvilinear orthogonal coordinates, e.g. in Cartesian coordinates, spherical, cylindrical, or even elliptical or parabolic coordinates: formula_27\nThe equation for each component (curl F)\"k\" can be obtained by exchanging each occurrence of a subscript 1, 2, 3 in cyclic permutation: 1\u00a0\u2192\u00a02, 2\u00a0\u2192\u00a03, and\u00a03\u00a0\u2192\u00a01 (where the subscripts represent the relevant indices).\nIf (\"x\"1, \"x\"2, \"x\"3) are the Cartesian coordinates and (\"u\"1, \"u\"2, \"u\"3) are the orthogonal coordinates, then \nformula_28 \nis the length of the coordinate vector corresponding to \"ui\". The remaining two components of curl result from cyclic permutation of indices: 3,1,2\u00a0\u2192\u00a01,2,3\u00a0\u2192\u00a02,3,1.\nUsage.\nIn practice, the two coordinate-free definitions described above are rarely used because in virtually all cases, the curl operator can be applied using some set of curvilinear coordinates, for which simpler representations have been derived.\nThe notation formula_29 has its origins in the similarities to the 3-dimensional cross product, and it is useful as a mnemonic in Cartesian coordinates if formula_30 is taken as a vector differential operator del. Such notation involving operators is common in physics and algebra.\nExpanded in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (see \"Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates\" for spherical and cylindrical coordinate representations), formula_29 is, for formula_32 composed of formula_33 (where the subscripts indicate the components of the vector, not partial derivatives):\nformula_34\nwhere i, j, and k are the unit vectors for the \"x\"-, \"y\"-, and \"z\"-axes, respectively. This expands as follows:\nformula_35\nAlthough expressed in terms of coordinates, the result is invariant under proper rotations of the coordinate axes but the result inverts under reflection.\nIn a general coordinate system, the curl is given by\nformula_36\nwhere \u03b5 denotes the Levi-Civita tensor, \u2207 the covariant derivative, formula_37 is the determinant of the metric tensor and the Einstein summation convention implies that repeated indices are summed over. Due to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols participating in the covariant derivative, this expression reduces to the partial derivative:\nformula_38\nwhere R\"k\" are the local basis vectors. Equivalently, using the exterior derivative, the curl can be expressed as:\nformula_39\nHere \u266d and \u266f are the musical isomorphisms, and is the Hodge star operator. This formula shows how to calculate the curl of F in any coordinate system, and how to extend the curl to any oriented three-dimensional Riemannian manifold. Since this depends on a choice of orientation, curl is a chiral operation. In other words, if the orientation is reversed, then the direction of the curl is also reversed.\nExamples.\nExample 1.\nSuppose the vector field describes the velocity field of a fluid flow (such as a large tank of liquid or gas) and a small ball is located within the fluid or gas (the center of the ball being fixed at a certain point). If the ball has a rough surface, the fluid flowing past it will make it rotate. The rotation axis (oriented according to the right hand rule) points in the direction of the curl of the field at the center of the ball, and the angular speed of the rotation is half the magnitude of the curl at this point.\nThe curl of the vector field at any point is given by the rotation of an infinitesimal area in the \"xy\"-plane (for \"z\"-axis component of the curl), \"zx\"-plane (for \"y\"-axis component of the curl) and \"yz\"-plane (for \"x\"-axis component of the curl vector). This can be seen in the examples below.\nExample 2.\nThe vector field\nformula_40\ncan be decomposed as\nformula_41\nUpon visual inspection, the field can be described as \"rotating\". If the vectors of the field were to represent a linear force acting on objects present at that point, and an object were to be placed inside the field, the object would start to rotate clockwise around itself. This is true regardless of where the object is placed.\nCalculating the curl:\nformula_42\nThe resulting vector field describing the curl would at all points be pointing in the negative \"z\" direction. The results of this equation align with what could have been predicted using the right-hand rule using a right-handed coordinate system. Being a uniform vector field, the object described before would have the same rotational intensity regardless of where it was placed.\nExample 3.\nFor the vector field\nformula_43\nthe curl is not as obvious from the graph. However, taking the object in the previous example, and placing it anywhere on the line \"x\" = 3, the force exerted on the right side would be slightly greater than the force exerted on the left, causing it to rotate clockwise. Using the right-hand rule, it can be predicted that the resulting curl would be straight in the negative \"z\" direction. Inversely, if placed on \"x\" = \u22123, the object would rotate counterclockwise and the right-hand rule would result in a positive \"z\" direction.\nCalculating the curl:\nformula_44\nThe curl points in the negative \"z\" direction when \"x\" is positive and vice versa. In this field, the intensity of rotation would be greater as the object moves away from the plane \"x\" = 0.\nIdentities.\nIn general curvilinear coordinates (not only in Cartesian coordinates), the curl of a cross product of vector fields v and F can be shown to be\nformula_45\nInterchanging the vector field v and \u2207 operator, we arrive at the cross product of a vector field with curl of a vector field:\nformula_46\nwhere \u2207F is the Feynman subscript notation, which considers only the variation due to the vector field F (i.e., in this case, v is treated as being constant in space).\nAnother example is the curl of a curl of a vector field. It can be shown that in general coordinates\nformula_47\nand this identity defines the vector Laplacian of F, symbolized as \u22072F.\nThe curl of the gradient of \"any\" scalar field \u03c6 is always the zero vector field\nformula_48\nwhich follows from the antisymmetry in the definition of the curl, and the symmetry of second derivatives.\nThe divergence of the curl of any vector field is equal to zero: \nformula_49\nIf \u03c6 is a scalar valued function and F is a vector field, then\nformula_50\nGeneralizations.\nThe vector calculus operations of grad, curl, and div are most easily generalized in the context of differential forms, which involves a number of steps. In short, they correspond to the derivatives of 0-forms, 1-forms, and 2-forms, respectively. The geometric interpretation of curl as rotation corresponds to identifying bivectors (2-vectors) in 3 dimensions with the special orthogonal Lie algebra formula_51 of infinitesimal rotations (in coordinates, skew-symmetric 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 matrices), while representing rotations by vectors corresponds to identifying 1-vectors (equivalently, 2-vectors) and formula_51, these all being 3-dimensional spaces.\nDifferential forms.\nIn 3 dimensions, a differential 0-form is a real-valued function formula_53; a differential 1-form is the following expression, where the coefficients are functions:\nformula_54\na differential 2-form is the formal sum, again with function coefficients:\nformula_55\nand a differential 3-form is defined by a single term with one function as coefficient:\nformula_56\nThe exterior derivative of a \"k\"-form in R3 is defined as the (\"k\" + 1)-form from above\u2014and in R\"n\" if, e.g.,\nformula_59\nthen the exterior derivative \"d\" leads to\nformula_60\nThe exterior derivative of a 1-form is therefore a 2-form, and that of a 2-form is a 3-form. On the other hand, because of the interchangeability of mixed derivatives, \nformula_61\nand antisymmetry,\nformula_62\nthe twofold application of the exterior derivative yields formula_63 (the zero formula_64-form).\nThus, denoting the space of \"k\"-forms by formula_65 and the exterior derivative by \"d\" one gets a sequence:\nformula_66\nHere formula_67 is the space of sections of the exterior algebra formula_68 vector bundle over R\"n\", whose dimension is the binomial coefficient formula_69; note that formula_70 for formula_71 or formula_72. Writing only dimensions, one obtains a row of Pascal's triangle:\nformula_73\nthe 1-dimensional fibers correspond to scalar fields, and the 3-dimensional fibers to vector fields, as described below. Modulo suitable identifications, the three nontrivial occurrences of the exterior derivative correspond to grad, curl, and div.\nDifferential forms and the differential can be defined on any Euclidean space, or indeed any manifold, without any notion of a Riemannian metric. On a Riemannian manifold, or more generally pseudo-Riemannian manifold, \"k\"-forms can be identified with \"k\"-vector fields (\"k\"-forms are \"k\"-covector fields, and a pseudo-Riemannian metric gives an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), and on an \"oriented\" vector space with a nondegenerate form (an isomorphism between vectors and covectors), there is an isomorphism between \"k\"-vectors and (\"n\" \u2212 \"k\")-vectors; in particular on (the tangent space of) an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Thus on an oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifold, one can interchange \"k\"-forms, \"k\"-vector fields, (\"n\" \u2212 \"k\")-forms, and (\"n\" \u2212 \"k\")-vector fields; this is known as Hodge duality. Concretely, on R3 this is given by:\nThus, identifying 0-forms and 3-forms with scalar fields, and 1-forms and 2-forms with vector fields:\nOn the other hand, the fact that \"d\"2 = 0 corresponds to the identities\nformula_74\nfor any scalar field f, and\nformula_75\nfor any vector field v.\nGrad and div generalize to all oriented pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, with the same geometric interpretation, because the spaces of 0-forms and \"n\"-forms at each point are always 1-dimensional and can be identified with scalar fields, while the spaces of 1-forms and (\"n\" \u2212 1)-forms are always fiberwise \"n\"-dimensional and can be identified with vector fields.\nCurl does not generalize in this way to 4 or more dimensions (or down to 2 or fewer dimensions); in 4 dimensions the dimensions are\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;0 \u2192 1 \u2192 4 \u2192 6 \u2192 4 \u2192 1 \u2192 0;\nso the curl of a 1-vector field (fiberwise 4-dimensional) is a \"2-vector field\", which at each point belongs to 6-dimensional vector space, and so one has\nformula_76\nwhich yields a sum of six independent terms, and cannot be identified with a 1-vector field. Nor can one meaningfully go from a 1-vector field to a 2-vector field to a 3-vector field (4 \u2192 6 \u2192 4), as taking the differential twice yields zero (\"d\"2 = 0). Thus there is no curl function from vector fields to vector fields in other dimensions arising in this way.\nHowever, one can define a curl of a vector field as a \"2-vector field\" in general, as described below.\nCurl geometrically.\n2-vectors correspond to the exterior power \u039b2\"V\"; in the presence of an inner product, in coordinates these are the skew-symmetric matrices, which are geometrically considered as the special orthogonal Lie algebra formula_77(\"V\") of infinitesimal rotations. This has () = \"n\"(\"n\" \u2212 1) dimensions, and allows one to interpret the differential of a 1-vector field as its infinitesimal rotations. Only in 3 dimensions (or trivially in 0 dimensions) we have \"n\" = \"n\"(\"n\" \u2212 1), which is the most elegant and common case. In 2 dimensions the curl of a vector field is not a vector field but a function, as 2-dimensional rotations are given by an angle (a scalar\u00a0\u2013 an orientation is required to choose whether one counts clockwise or counterclockwise rotations as positive); this is not the div, but is rather perpendicular to it. In 3 dimensions the curl of a vector field is a vector field as is familiar (in 1 and 0 dimensions the curl of a vector field is 0, because there are no non-trivial 2-vectors), while in 4 dimensions the curl of a vector field is, geometrically, at each point an element of the 6-dimensional Lie algebra formula_78.\nThe curl of a 3-dimensional vector field which only depends on 2 coordinates (say \"x\" and \"y\") is simply a vertical vector field (in the \"z\" direction) whose magnitude is the curl of the 2-dimensional vector field, as in the examples on this page.\nConsidering curl as a 2-vector field (an antisymmetric 2-tensor) has been used to generalize vector calculus and associated physics to higher dimensions.\nInverse.\nIn the case where the divergence of a vector field V is zero, a vector field W exists such that V = curl(W). This is why the magnetic field, characterized by zero divergence, can be expressed as the curl of a magnetic vector potential.\nIf W is a vector field with curl(W) = V, then adding any gradient vector field grad(\"f\") to W will result in another vector field W + grad(\"f\") such that curl(W + grad(\"f\")) = V as well. This can be summarized by saying that the inverse curl of a three-dimensional vector field can be obtained up to an unknown irrotational field with the Biot\u2013Savart law.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was director of the G\u00f6ttingen Observatory in Germany and professor of astronomy from 1807 until his death in 1855.\nWhile studying at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, he propounded several mathematical theorems. As an independent scholar, he wrote the masterpieces \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" and \"Theoria motus corporum coelestium\". Gauss produced the second and third complete proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra. In number theory, he made numerous contributions, such as the composition law, the law of quadratic reciprocity and triangular case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem. He also contributed to the theory of binary and ternary quadratic forms, the construction of the heptadecagon, and the theory of hypergeometric series. Due to Gauss's extensive and fundamental contributions to science and mathematics, more than 100 mathematical and scientific concepts are named after him.\nGauss was instrumental in the identification of Ceres as a dwarf planet. His work on the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets led to the introduction of the Gaussian gravitational constant and the method of least squares, which he had discovered before Adrien-Marie Legendre published it. Gauss led the geodetic survey of the Kingdom of Hanover together with an arc measurement project from 1820 to 1844; he was one of the founders of geophysics and formulated the fundamental principles of magnetism. His practical work led to the invention of the heliotrope in 1821, a magnetometer in 1833 and \u2013 with Wilhelm Eduard Weber \u2013 the first electromagnetic telegraph in 1833.\nGauss was the first to discover and study non-Euclidean geometry, which he also named. He developed a fast Fourier transform some 160 years before John Tukey and James Cooley.\nGauss refused to publish incomplete work and left several works to be edited posthumously. He believed that the act of learning, not possession of knowledge, provided the greatest enjoyment. Gauss was not a committed or enthusiastic teacher, generally preferring to focus on his own work. Nevertheless, some of his students, such as Dedekind and Riemann, became well-known and influential mathematicians in their own right.\nBiography.\nYouth and education.\nGauss was born on 30 April 1777 in Brunswick, in the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel (now in the German state of Lower Saxony). His family was of relatively low social status. His father Gebhard Dietrich Gauss (1744\u20131808) worked variously as a butcher, bricklayer, gardener, and treasurer of a death-benefit fund. Gauss characterized his father as honourable and respected, but rough and dominating at home. He was experienced in writing and calculating, whereas his second wife Dorothea, Carl Friedrich's mother, was nearly illiterate. He had one elder brother from his father's first marriage.\nGauss was a child prodigy in mathematics. When the elementary teachers noticed his intellectual abilities, they brought him to the attention of the Duke of Brunswick who sent him to the local \"Collegium Carolinum\", which he attended from 1792 to 1795 with Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann as one of his teachers. Thereafter the Duke granted him the resources for studies of mathematics, sciences, and classical languages at the University of G\u00f6ttingen until 1798. His professor in mathematics was Abraham Gotthelf K\u00e4stner, whom Gauss called \"the leading mathematician among poets, and the leading poet among mathematicians\" because of his epigrams. Astronomy was taught by Karl Felix Seyffer, with whom Gauss stayed in correspondence after graduation; Olbers and Gauss mocked him in their correspondence. On the other hand, he thought highly of Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, his teacher of physics, and of Christian Gottlob Heyne, whose lectures in classics Gauss attended with pleasure. Fellow students of this time were Johann Friedrich Benzenberg, Farkas Bolyai, and Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes.\nHe was likely a self-taught student in mathematics since he independently rediscovered several theorems. He solved a geometrical problem that had occupied mathematicians since the Ancient Greeks when he determined in 1796 which regular polygons can be constructed by compass and straightedge. This discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of philology as a career. Gauss's mathematical diary, a collection of short remarks about his results from the years 1796 until 1814, shows that many ideas for his mathematical magnum opus \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" (1801) date from this time.\nAs an elementary student, Gauss and his class were tasked by their teacher, J.G. B\u00fcttner, to sum the numbers from 1 to 100. Much to B\u00fcttner's surprise, Gauss replied with the correct answer of 5050 in a vastly faster time than expected. Gauss had realised that the sum could be rearranged as 50 pairs of 101 (1 + 100 = 101, 2 + 99= 101, etc.). Thus, he simply multiplied 50 by 101. Other accounts state that he computed the sum as 100 sets of 101 and divided by 2.\nPrivate scholar.\nGauss graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy in 1799, not in G\u00f6ttingen, as is sometimes stated, but at the Duke of Brunswick's special request from the University of Helmstedt, the only state university of the duchy. Johann Friedrich Pfaff assessed his doctoral thesis, and Gauss got the degree \"in absentia\" without further oral examination. The Duke then granted him the cost of living as a private scholar in Brunswick. Gauss subsequently refused calls from the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Peterburg and Landshut University. Later, the Duke promised him the foundation of an observatory in Brunswick in 1804. Architect Peter Joseph Krahe made preliminary designs, but one of Napoleon's wars cancelled those plans: the Duke was killed in the battle of Jena in 1806. The duchy was abolished in the following year, and Gauss's financial support stopped.\nWhen Gauss was calculating asteroid orbits in the first years of the century, he established contact with the astronomical communities of Bremen and Lilienthal, especially Wilhelm Olbers, Karl Ludwig Harding, and Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, forming part of the informal group of astronomers known as the Celestial police. One of their aims was the discovery of further planets. They assembled data on asteroids and comets as a basis for Gauss's research on their orbits, which he later published in his astronomical magnum opus \"Theoria motus corporum coelestium\" (1809).\nProfessor in G\u00f6ttingen.\nIn November 1807, Gauss was hired by the University of G\u00f6ttingen, then an institution of the newly founded Kingdom of Westphalia under J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte, as full professor and director of the astronomical observatory, and kept the chair until his death in 1855. He was soon confronted with the demand for two thousand francs from the Westphalian government as a war contribution, which he could not afford to pay. Both Olbers and Laplace wanted to help him with the payment, but Gauss refused their assistance. Finally, an anonymous person from Frankfurt, later discovered to be Prince-primate Dalberg, paid the sum.\nGauss took on the directorship of the 60-year-old observatory, founded in 1748 by Prince-elector George II and built on a converted fortification tower, with usable but partly out-of-date instruments. The construction of a new observatory had been approved by Prince-elector George III in principle since 1802, and the Westphalian government continued the planning, but Gauss could not move to his new place of work until September 1816. He got new up-to-date instruments, including two meridian circles from Repsold and Reichenbach, and a heliometer from Fraunhofer.\nThe scientific activity of Gauss, besides pure mathematics, can be roughly divided into three periods: astronomy was the main focus in the first two decades of the 19th century, geodesy in the third decade, and physics, mainly magnetism, in the fourth decade.\nGauss made no secret of his aversion to giving academic lectures. But from the start of his academic career at G\u00f6ttingen, he continuously gave lectures until 1854. He often complained about the burdens of teaching, feeling that it was a waste of his time. On the other hand, he occasionally described some students as talented. Most of his lectures dealt with astronomy, geodesy, and applied mathematics, and only three lectures on subjects of pure mathematics. Some of Gauss's students went on to become renowned mathematicians, physicists, and astronomers: Moritz Cantor, Dedekind, Dirksen, Encke, Gould, Heine, Klinkerfues, Kupffer, Listing, M\u00f6bius, Nicolai, Riemann, Ritter, Schering, Scherk, Schumacher, von Staudt, Stern, Ursin; as geoscientists Sartorius von Waltershausen, and Wapp\u00e4us.\nGauss did not write any textbook and disliked the popularization of scientific matters. His only attempts at popularization were his works on the date of Easter (1800/1802) and the essay \"Erdmagnetismus und Magnetometer\" of 1836. Gauss published his papers and books exclusively in Latin or German. He wrote Latin in a classical style but used some customary modifications set by contemporary mathematicians.\nGauss gave his inaugural lecture at G\u00f6ttingen University in 1808. He described his approach to astronomy as based on reliable observations and accurate calculations, rather than on belief or empty hypothesizing. At university, he was accompanied by a staff of other lecturers in his disciplines, who completed the educational program; these included the mathematician Thibaut with his lectures, the physicist Mayer, known for his textbooks, his successor Weber since 1831, and in the observatory Harding, who took the main part of lectures in practical astronomy. When the observatory was completed, Gauss occupied the western wing of the new observatory, while Harding took the eastern. They had once been on friendly terms, but over time they became alienated, possibly \u2013 as some biographers presume \u2013 because Gauss had wished the equal-ranked Harding to be no more than his assistant or observer. Gauss used the new meridian circles nearly exclusively, and kept them away from Harding, except for some very seldom joint observations.\nBrendel subdivides Gauss's astronomic activity chronologically into seven periods, of which the years since 1820 are taken as a \"period of lower astronomical activity\". The new, well-equipped observatory did not work as effectively as other ones; Gauss's astronomical research had the character of a one-man enterprise without a long-time observation program, and the university established a place for an assistant only after Harding died in 1834.\nNevertheless, Gauss twice refused the opportunity to solve the problem, turning down offers from Berlin in 1810 and 1825 to become a full member of the Prussian Academy without burdening lecturing duties, as well as from Leipzig University in 1810 and from Vienna University in 1842, perhaps because of the family's difficult situation. Gauss's salary was raised from 1000 Reichsthaler in 1810 to 2500 Reichsthaler in 1824, and in his later years he was one of the best-paid professors of the university.\nWhen Gauss was asked for help by his colleague and friend Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in 1810, who was in trouble at K\u00f6nigsberg University because of his lack of an academic title, Gauss provided a doctorate \"honoris causa\" for Bessel from the Philosophy Faculty of G\u00f6ttingen in March 1811. Gauss gave another recommendation for an honorary degree for Sophie Germain but only shortly before her death, so she never received it. He also gave successful support to the mathematician Gotthold Eisenstein in Berlin.\nGauss was loyal to the House of Hanover. After King William IV died in 1837, the new Hanoverian King Ernest Augustus annulled the 1833 constitution. Seven professors, later known as the \"G\u00f6ttingen Seven\", protested against this, among them his friend and collaborator Wilhelm Weber and Gauss's son-in-law Heinrich Ewald. All of them were dismissed, and three of them were expelled, but Ewald and Weber could stay in G\u00f6ttingen. Gauss was deeply affected by this quarrel but saw no possibility to help them.\nGauss took part in academic administration: three times he was elected as dean of the Faculty of Philosophy. Being entrusted with the widow's pension fund of the university, he dealt with actuarial science and wrote a report on the strategy for stabilizing the benefits. He was appointed director of the Royal Academy of Sciences in G\u00f6ttingen for nine years.\nGauss remained mentally active into his old age, even while suffering from gout and general unhappiness. On 23 February 1855, he died of a heart attack in G\u00f6ttingen; and was interred in the Albani Cemetery there. Heinrich Ewald, Gauss's son-in-law, and Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen, Gauss's close friend and biographer, gave eulogies at his funeral.\nGauss was a successful investor and accumulated considerable wealth with stocks and securities, amounting to a value of more than 150,000 Thaler; after his death, about 18,000 Thaler were found hidden in his rooms.\nGauss's brain.\nThe day after Gauss's death his brain was removed, preserved, and studied by Rudolf Wagner, who found its mass to be slightly above average, at . Wagner's son Hermann, a geographer, estimated the cerebral area to be in his doctoral thesis. In 2013, a neurobiologist at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G\u00f6ttingen discovered that Gauss's brain had been mixed up soon after the first investigations, due to mislabelling, with that of the physician Conrad Heinrich Fuchs, who died in G\u00f6ttingen a few months after Gauss. A further investigation showed no remarkable anomalies in the brains of either person. Thus, all investigations of Gauss's brain until 1998, except the first ones of Rudolf and Hermann Wagner, actually refer to the brain of Fuchs.\nFamily.\nGauss married Johanna Osthoff on 9 October 1805 in St. Catherine's church in Brunswick. They had two sons and one daughter: Joseph (1806\u20131873), Wilhelmina (1808\u20131840), and Louis (1809\u20131810). Johanna died on 11 October 1809, one month after the birth of Louis, who himself died a few months later. Gauss chose the first names of his children in honour of Giuseppe Piazzi, Wilhelm Olbers, and Karl Ludwig Harding, the discoverers of the first asteroids.\nOn 4 August 1810, Gauss married Wilhelmine (Minna) Waldeck, a friend of his first wife, with whom he had three more children: Eugen (later Eugene) (1811\u20131896), Wilhelm (later William) (1813\u20131879), and Therese (1816\u20131864). Minna Gauss died on 12 September 1831 after being seriously ill for more than a decade. Therese then took over the household and cared for Gauss for the rest of his life; after her father's death, she married actor Constantin Staufenau. Her sister Wilhelmina married the orientalist Heinrich Ewald. Gauss's mother Dorothea lived in his house from 1817 until she died in 1839.\nThe eldest son Joseph, while still a schoolboy, helped his father as an assistant during the survey campaign in the summer of 1821. After a short time at university, in 1824 Joseph joined the Hanoverian army and assisted in surveying again in 1829. In the 1830s he was responsible for the enlargement of the survey network into the western parts of the kingdom. With his geodetical qualifications, he left the service and engaged in the construction of the railway network as director of the Royal Hanoverian State Railways. In 1836 he studied the railroad system in the US for some months.\nEugen left G\u00f6ttingen in September 1830 and emigrated to the United States, where he spent five years with the army. He then worked for the American Fur Company in the Midwest. He later moved to Missouri and became a successful businessman. Wilhelm married a niece of the astronomer Bessel; he then moved to Missouri, started as a farmer and became wealthy in the shoe business in St. Louis in later years. Eugene and William have numerous descendants in America, but the Gauss descendants left in Germany all derive from Joseph, as the daughters had no children.\nPersonality.\nScholar.\nIn the first two decades of the 19th century, Gauss was the only important mathematician in Germany comparable to the leading French mathematicians. His \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" was the first mathematical book from Germany to be translated into the French language.\nGauss was \"in front of the new development\" with documented research since 1799, his wealth of new ideas, and his rigour of demonstration. In contrast to previous mathematicians like Leonhard Euler, who let their readers take part in their reasoning, including certain erroneous deviations from the correct path, Gauss introduced a new style of direct and complete exposition that did not attempt to show the reader the author's train of thought.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Gauss was the first to restore that \"rigor\" of demonstration which we admire in the ancients and which had been forced unduly into the background by the exclusive interest of the preceding period in \"new\" developments.\nBut for himself, he propagated a quite different ideal, given in a letter to Farkas Bolyai as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again.\nHis posthumous papers, his scientific diary, and short glosses in his own textbooks show that he empirically worked to a great extent. He was a lifelong busy and enthusiastic calculator, working extraordinarily quickly and checking his results through estimation. Nevertheless, his calculations were not always free from mistakes. He coped with the enormous workload by using skillful tools. Gauss used numerous mathematical tables, examined their exactness, and constructed new tables on various matters for personal use. He developed new tools for effective calculation, for example the Gaussian elimination. Gauss's calculations and the tables he prepared were often more precise than practically necessary. Very likely, this method gave him additional material for his theoretical work.\nGauss was only willing to publish work when he considered it complete and above criticism. This perfectionism was in keeping with the motto of his personal seal (\"Few, but Ripe\"). Many colleagues encouraged him to publicize new ideas and sometimes rebuked him if he hesitated too long, in their opinion. Gauss defended himself by claiming that the initial discovery of ideas was easy, but preparing a presentable elaboration was a demanding matter for him, for either lack of time or \"serenity of mind\". Nevertheless, he published many short communications of urgent content in various journals, but left a considerable literary estate, too. Gauss referred to mathematics as \"the queen of sciences\" and arithmetics as \"the queen of mathematics\", and supposedly once espoused a belief in the necessity of immediately understanding Euler's identity as a benchmark pursuant to becoming a first-class mathematician.\nOn certain occasions, Gauss claimed that the ideas of another scholar had already been in his possession previously. Thus his concept of priority as \"the first to discover, not the first to publish\" differed from that of his scientific contemporaries. In contrast to his perfectionism in presenting mathematical ideas, his citations were criticized as negligent. He justified himself with an unusual view of correct citation practice: he would only give complete references, with respect to the previous authors of importance, which no one should ignore, but citing in this way would require knowledge of the history of science and more time than he wished to spend.\nPrivate man.\nSoon after Gauss's death, his friend Sartorius published the first biography (1856), written in a rather enthusiastic style. Sartorius saw him as a serene and forward-striving man with childlike modesty, but also of \"iron character\" with an unshakeable strength of mind. Apart from his closer circle, others regarded him as reserved and unapproachable \"like an Olympian sitting enthroned on the summit of science\". His close contemporaries agreed that Gauss was a man of difficult character. He often refused to accept compliments. His visitors were occasionally irritated by his grumpy behaviour, but a short time later his mood could change, and he would become a charming, open-minded host. Gauss disliked polemic natures; together with his colleague Hausmann he opposed to a call for Justus Liebig on a university chair in G\u00f6ttingen, \"because he was always involved in some polemic.\"\nGauss's life was overshadowed by severe problems in his family. When his first wife Johanna suddenly died shortly after the birth of their third child, he revealed the grief in a last letter to his dead wife in the style of an ancient threnody, the most personal of his surviving documents. His second wife and his two daughters suffered from tuberculosis. In a letter to Bessel, dated December 1831, Gauss hinted at his distress, describing himself as \"the victim of the worst domestic sufferings\".\nBecause of his wife's illness, both younger sons were educated for some years in Celle, far from G\u00f6ttingen. The military career of his elder son Joseph ended after more than two decades at the poorly paid rank of first lieutenant, although he had acquired a considerable knowledge of geodesy. He needed financial support from his father even after he was married. The second son Eugen shared a good measure of his father's talent in computation and languages but had a lively and sometimes rebellious character. He wanted to study philology, whereas Gauss wanted him to become a lawyer. Having run up debts and caused a scandal in public, Eugen suddenly left G\u00f6ttingen under dramatic circumstances in September 1830 and emigrated via Bremen to the United States. He wasted the little money he had taken to start, after which his father refused further financial support. The youngest son Wilhelm wanted to qualify for agricultural administration, but had difficulties getting an appropriate education, and eventually emigrated as well. Only Gauss's youngest daughter Therese accompanied him in his last years of life.\nIn his later years Gauss habitually collected various types of useful or useless numerical data, such as the number of paths from his home to certain places in G\u00f6ttingen or peoples' ages in days; he congratulated Humboldt in December 1851 for having reached the same age as Isaac Newton at his death, calculated in days.\nBeyond his excellent knowledge of Latin, he was also acquainted with modern languages. Gauss read both classical and modern literature, and English and French works in the original languages. His favorite English author was Walter Scott, his favorite German Jean Paul. At the age of 62, he began to teach himself Russian, very likely to understand scientific writings from Russia, among them those of Lobachevsky on non-Euclidean geometry. Gauss liked singing and went to concerts. He was a busy newspaper reader; in his last years, he would visit an academic press salon of the university every noon. Gauss did not care much for philosophy, and mocked the \"splitting hairs of the so-called metaphysicians\", by which he meant proponents of the contemporary school of \"Naturphilosophie\".\nGauss had an \"aristocratic and through and through conservative nature\", with little respect for people's intelligence and morals, following the motto \"mundus vult decipi\". He disliked Napoleon and his system and was horrified by violence and revolution of all kinds. Thus he condemned the methods of the Revolutions of 1848, though he agreed with some of their aims, such as that of a unified Germany. He had a low estimation of the constitutional system and he criticized parliamentarians of his time for their perceived ignorance and logical errors.\nSome Gauss biographers have speculated on his religious beliefs. He sometimes said \"God arithmetizes\" and \"I succeeded \u2013 not on account of my hard efforts, but by the grace of the Lord.\" Gauss was a member of the Lutheran church, like most of the population in northern Germany, but it seems that he did not believe all Lutheran dogma or understand the Bible fully literally. According to Sartorius, Gauss's religious tolerance, \"insatiable thirst for truth\" and sense of justice were motivated by his religious convictions.\nMathematics.\nAlgebra and number theory.\nFundamental theorem of algebra.\nIn his doctoral thesis from 1799, Gauss proved the fundamental theorem of algebra which states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has at least one complex root. Mathematicians including Jean le Rond d'Alembert had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. He subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts led to considerable clarification of the concept of complex numbers.\n\"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\".\nIn the preface to the \"Disquisitiones\", Gauss dates the beginning of his work on number theory to 1795. By studying the works of previous mathematicians like Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre, he realized that these scholars had already found much of what he had independently discovered. The \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\", written in 1798 and published in 1801, consolidated number theory as a discipline and covered both elementary and algebraic number theory. Therein he introduces the triple bar symbol (\u2261) for congruence and uses it for a clean presentation of modular arithmetic. It deals with the unique factorization theorem and primitive roots modulo n. In the main sections, Gauss presents the first two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity and develops the theories of binary and ternary quadratic forms.\nThe \"Disquisitiones\" include the Gauss composition law for binary quadratic forms, as well as the enumeration of the number of representations of an integer as the sum of three squares. As an almost immediate corollary of his theorem on three squares, he proves the triangular case of the Fermat polygonal number theorem for \"n\" = 3. From several analytic results on class numbers that Gauss gives without proof towards the end of the fifth section, it appears that Gauss already knew the class number formula in 1801.\nIn the last section, Gauss gives proof for the constructibility of a regular heptadecagon (17-sided polygon) with straightedge and compass by reducing this geometrical problem to an algebraic one. He shows that a regular polygon is constructible if the number of its sides is either a power of 2 or the product of a power of 2 and any number of distinct Fermat primes. In the same section, he gives a result on the number of solutions of certain cubic polynomials with coefficients in finite fields, which amounts to counting integral points on an elliptic curve. An unfinished chapter, consisting of work done during 1797\u20131799, was found among his papers after his death.\nFurther investigations.\nOne of Gauss's first results was the empirically found conjecture of 1792 \u2013 the later called prime number theorem \u2013 giving an estimation of the number of prime numbers by using the integral logarithm.\nIn 1816, Olbers encouraged Gauss to compete for a prize from the French Academy for a proof for Fermat's Last Theorem; he refused, considering the topic uninteresting. However, after his death a short undated paper was found with proofs of the theorem for the cases \"n\" = 3 and \"n\" = 5. The particular case of \"n\" = 3 was proved much earlier by Leonhard Euler, but Gauss developed a more streamlined proof which made use of Eisenstein integers; though more general, the proof was simpler than in the real integers case.\nGauss contributed to solving the Kepler conjecture in 1831 with the proof that a greatest packing density of spheres in the three-dimensional space is given when the centres of the spheres form a cubic face-centred arrangement, when he reviewed a book of Ludwig August Seeber on the theory of reduction of positive ternary quadratic forms. Having noticed some lacks in Seeber's proof, he simplified many of his arguments, proved the central conjecture, and remarked that this theorem is equivalent to the Kepler conjecture for regular arrangements.\nIn two papers on biquadratic residues (1828, 1832) Gauss introduced the ring of Gaussian integers formula_1, showed that it is a unique factorization domain, and generalized some key arithmetic concepts, such as Fermat's little theorem and Gauss's lemma. The main objective of introducing this ring was to formulate the law of biquadratic reciprocity \u2013 as Gauss discovered, rings of complex integers are the natural setting for such higher reciprocity laws.\nIn the second paper, he stated the general law of biquadratic reciprocity and proved several special cases of it. In an earlier publication from 1818 containing his fifth and sixth proofs of quadratic reciprocity, he claimed the techniques of these proofs (Gauss sums) can be applied to prove higher reciprocity laws.\nAnalysis.\nOne of Gauss's first discoveries was the notion of the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) of two positive real numbers. He discovered its relation to elliptic integrals in the years 1798\u20131799 through Landen's transformation, and a diary entry recorded the discovery of the connection of Gauss's constant to lemniscatic elliptic functions, a result that Gauss stated \"will surely open an entirely new field of analysis\". He also made early inroads into the more formal issues of the foundations of complex analysis, and from a letter to Bessel in 1811 it is clear that he knew the \"fundamental theorem of complex analysis\" \u2013 Cauchy's integral theorem \u2013 and understood the notion of complex residues when integrating around poles.\nEuler's pentagonal numbers theorem, together with other researches on the AGM and lemniscatic functions, led him to plenty of results on Jacobi theta functions, culminating in the discovery in 1808 of the later called Jacobi triple product identity, which includes Euler's theorem as a special case. His works show that he knew modular transformations of order 3, 5, 7 for elliptic functions since 1808.\nSeveral mathematical fragments in his Nachlass indicate that he knew parts of the modern theory of modular forms. In his work on the multivalued AGM of two complex numbers, he discovered a deep connection between the infinitely many values of the AGM and its two \"simplest values\". In his unpublished writings he recognized and made a sketch of the key concept of fundamental domain for the modular group. One of Gauss's sketches of this kind was a drawing of a tessellation of the unit disk by \"equilateral\" hyperbolic triangles with all angles equal to formula_2.\nAn example of Gauss's insight in analysis is the cryptic remark that the principles of circle division by compass and straightedge can also be applied to the division of the lemniscate curve, which inspired Abel's theorem on lemniscate division. Another example is his publication \"Summatio quarundam serierum singularium\" (1811) on the determination of the sign of quadratic Gauss sums, in which he solved the main problem by introducing q-analogs of binomial coefficients and manipulating them by several original identities that seem to stem from his work on elliptic function theory; however, Gauss cast his argument in a formal way that does not reveal its origin in elliptic function theory, and only the later work of mathematicians such as Jacobi and Hermite has exposed the crux of his argument.\nIn the \"Disquisitiones generales circa series infinitam...\" (1813), he provides the first systematic treatment of the general hypergeometric function formula_3, and shows that many of the functions known at the time are special cases of the hypergeometric function. This work is the first exact inquiry into convergence of infinite series in the history of mathematics. Furthermore, it deals with infinite continued fractions arising as ratios of hypergeometric functions, which are now called Gauss continued fractions.\nIn 1823, Gauss won the prize of the Danish Society with an essay on conformal mappings, which contains several developments that pertain to the field of complex analysis. Gauss stated that angle-preserving mappings in the complex plane must be complex analytic functions, and used the later-named Beltrami equation to prove the existence of isothermal coordinates on analytic surfaces. The essay concludes with examples of conformal mappings into a sphere and an ellipsoid of revolution.\nNumerical analysis.\nGauss often deduced theorems inductively from numerical data he had collected empirically. As such, the use of efficient algorithms to facilitate calculations was vital to his research, and he made many contributions to numerical analysis, such as the method of Gaussian quadrature, published in 1816.\nIn a private letter to Gerling from 1823, he described a solution of a 4x4 system of linear equations with the Gauss-Seidel method \u2013 an \"indirect\" iterative method for the solution of linear systems, and recommended it over the usual method of \"direct elimination\" for systems of more than two equations.\nGauss invented an algorithm for calculating what is now called discrete Fourier transforms when calculating the orbits of Pallas and Juno in 1805, 160 years before Cooley and Tukey found their similar Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. He developed it as a trigonometric interpolation method, but the paper \"Theoria Interpolationis Methodo Nova Tractata\" was published only posthumously in 1876, well after Joseph Fourier's introduction of the subject in 1807.\nGeometry.\nDifferential geometry.\nThe geodetic survey of Hanover fuelled Gauss's interest in differential geometry and topology, fields of mathematics dealing with curves and surfaces. This led him in 1828 to the publication of a work that marks the birth of modern differential geometry of surfaces, as it departed from the traditional ways of treating surfaces as cartesian graphs of functions of two variables, and that initiated the exploration of surfaces from the \"inner\" point of view of a two-dimensional being constrained to move on it. As a result, the Theorema Egregium (\"remarkable theorem\"), established a property of the notion of Gaussian curvature. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring angles and distances on the surface, regardless of the embedding of the surface in three-dimensional or two-dimensional space.\nThe Theorema Egregium leads to the abstraction of surfaces as doubly-extended manifolds; it clarifies the distinction between the intrinsic properties of the manifold (the metric) and its physical realization in ambient space. A consequence is the impossibility of an isometric transformation between surfaces of different Gaussian curvature. This means practically that a sphere or an ellipsoid cannot be transformed to a plane without distortion, which causes a fundamental problem in designing projections for geographical maps. A portion of this essay is dedicated to a profound study of geodesics. In particular, Gauss proves the local Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem on geodesic triangles, and generalizes Legendre's theorem on spherical triangles to geodesic triangles on arbitrary surfaces with continuous curvature; he found that the angles of a \"sufficiently small\" geodesic triangle deviate from that of a planar triangle of the same sides in a way that depends only on the values of the surface curvature at the vertices of the triangle, regardless of the behaviour of the surface in the triangle interior.\nGauss's memoir from 1828 lacks the conception of geodesic curvature. However, in a previously unpublished manuscript, very likely written in 1822\u20131825, he introduced the term \"side curvature\" (German: \"Seitenkr\u00fcmmung\") and proved its invariance under isometric transformations, a result that was later obtained by Ferdinand Minding and published by him in 1830. This Gauss paper contains the core of his lemma on total curvature, but also its generalization, found and proved by Pierre Ossian Bonnet in 1848 and known as the Gauss\u2013Bonnet theorem.\nNon-Euclidean geometry.\nDuring Gauss's lifetime, the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry was heavily discussed. Numerous efforts were made to prove it in the frame of the Euclidean axioms, whereas some mathematicians discussed the possibility of geometrical systems without it. Gauss thought about the basics of geometry from the 1790s on, but only realized in the 1810s that a non-Euclidean geometry without the parallel postulate could solve the problem. In a letter to Franz Taurinus of 1824, he presented a short comprehensible outline of what he named a \"non-Euclidean geometry\", but he strongly forbade Taurinus to make any use of it. Gauss is credited with having been the one to first discover and study non-Euclidean geometry, even coining the term as well.\nThe first publications on non-Euclidean geometry in the history of mathematics were authored by Nikolai Lobachevsky in 1829 and Janos Bolyai in 1832. In the following years, Gauss wrote his ideas on the topic but did not publish them, thus avoiding influencing the contemporary scientific discussion. Gauss commended the ideas of Janos Bolyai in a letter to his father and university friend Farkas Bolyai claiming that these were congruent to his own thoughts of some decades. However, it is not quite clear to what extent he preceded Lobachevsky and Bolyai, as his written remarks are vague and obscure.\nSartorius first mentioned Gauss's work on non-Euclidean geometry in 1856, but only the publication of Gauss's Nachlass in Volume VIII of the Collected Works (1900) showed Gauss's ideas on the matter, at a time when non-Euclidean geometry was still an object of some controversy.\nEarly topology.\nGauss was also an early pioneer of topology or \"Geometria Situs\", as it was called in his lifetime. The first proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra in 1799 contained an essentially topological argument; fifty years later, he further developed the topological argument in his fourth proof of this theorem.\nAnother encounter with topological notions occurred to him in the course of his astronomical work in 1804, when he determined the limits of the region on the celestial sphere in which comets and asteroids might appear, and which he termed \"Zodiacus\". He discovered that if the Earth's and comet's orbits are linked, then by topological reasons the Zodiacus is the entire sphere. In 1848, in the context of the discovery of the asteroid 7 Iris, he published a further qualitative discussion of the Zodiacus.\nIn Gauss's letters of 1820\u20131830, he thought intensively on topics with close affinity to Geometria Situs, and became gradually conscious of semantic difficulty in this field. Fragments from this period reveal that he tried to classify \"tract figures\", which are closed plane curves with a finite number of transverse self-intersections, that may also be planar projections of knots. To do so he devised a symbolical scheme, the Gauss code, that in a sense captured the characteristic features of tract figures.\nIn a fragment from 1833, Gauss defined the linking number of two space curves by a certain double integral, and in doing so provided for the first time an analytical formulation of a topological phenomenon. On the same note, he lamented the little progress made in Geometria Situs, and remarked that one of its central problems will be \"to count the intertwinings of two closed or infinite curves\". His notebooks from that period reveal that he was also thinking about other topological objects such as braids and tangles.\nGauss's influence in later years to the emerging field of topology, which he held in high esteem, was through occasional remarks and oral communications to Mobius and Listing.\nMinor mathematical accomplishments.\nGauss applied the concept of complex numbers to solve well-known problems in a new concise way. For example, in a short note from 1836 on geometric aspects of the ternary forms and their application to crystallography, he stated the fundamental theorem of axonometry, which tells how to represent a 3D cube on a 2D plane with complete accuracy, via complex numbers. He described rotations of this sphere as the action of certain linear fractional transformations on the extended complex plane, and gave a proof for the geometric theorem that the altitudes of a triangle always meet in a single orthocenter.\nGauss was concerned with John Napier's \"Pentagramma mirificum\" \u2013 a certain spherical pentagram \u2013 for several decades; he approached it from various points of view, and gradually gained a full understanding of its geometric, algebraic, and analytic aspects. In particular, in 1843 he stated and proved several theorems connecting elliptic functions, Napier spherical pentagons, and Poncelet pentagons in the plane.\nFurthermore, he contributed a solution to the problem of constructing the largest-area ellipse inside a given quadrilateral, and discovered a surprising result about the computation of area of pentagons.\nSciences.\nAstronomy.\nOn 1 January 1801, Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered a new celestial object, presumed it to be the long searched planet between Mars and Jupiter according to the so-called Titius\u2013Bode law, and named it Ceres. He could track it only for a short time until it disappeared behind the glare of the Sun. The mathematical tools of the time were not sufficient to predict the location of its reappearance from the few data available. Gauss tackled the problem and predicted a position for possible rediscovery in December 1801. This turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when Franz Xaver von Zach on 7 and 31 December at Gotha, and independently Heinrich Olbers on 1 and 2 January in Bremen, identified the object near the predicted position.\nGauss's method leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work, Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.\nThe discovery of Ceres led Gauss to the theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as \"Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum\". It introduced the Gaussian gravitational constant.\nSince the new asteroids had been discovered, Gauss occupied himself with the perturbations of their orbital elements. Firstly he examined Ceres with analytical methods similar to those of Laplace, but his favorite object was Pallas, because of its great eccentricity and orbital inclination, whereby Laplace's method did not work. Gauss used his own tools: the arithmetic\u2013geometric mean, the hypergeometric function, and his method of interpolation. He found an orbital resonance with Jupiter in proportion 18:7 in 1812; Gauss gave this result as cipher, and gave the explicit meaning only in letters to Olbers and Bessel. After long years of work, he finished it in 1816 without a result that seemed sufficient to him. This marked the end of his activities in theoretical astronomy.\nOne fruit of Gauss's research on Pallas perturbations was the \"Determinatio Attractionis...\" (1818) on a method of theoretical astronomy that later became known as the \"elliptic ring method\". It introduced an averaging conception in which a planet in orbit is replaced by a fictitious ring with mass density proportional to the time the planet takes to follow the corresponding orbital arcs. Gauss presents the method of evaluating the gravitational attraction of such an elliptic ring, which includes several steps; one of them involves a direct application of the arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) algorithm to calculate an elliptic integral.\nEven after Gauss's contributions to theoretical astronomy came to an end, more practical activities in observational astronomy continued and occupied him during his entire career. As early as 1799, Gauss dealt with the determination of longitude by use of the lunar parallax, for which he developed more convenient formulas than those were in common use. After appointment as director of observatory he attached importance to the fundamental astronomical constants in correspondence with Bessel. Gauss himself provided tables of nutation and aberration, solar coordinates, and refraction. He made many contributions to spherical geometry, and in this context solved some practical problems about navigation by stars. He published a great number of observations, mainly on minor planets and comets; his last observation was the solar eclipse of 28 July 1851.\nChronology.\nGauss's first publication following his doctoral thesis dealt with the determination of the date of Easter (1800), an elementary mathematical topic. Gauss aimed to present a convenient algorithm for people without any knowledge of ecclesiastical or even astronomical chronology, and thus avoided the usual terms of golden number, epact, solar cycle, domenical letter, and any religious connotations. This choice of topic likely had historical grounds. The replacement of the Julian calendar by the Gregorian calendar had caused confusion in the Holy Roman Empire since the 16th century and was not finished in Germany until 1700, when the difference of eleven days was deleted. Even after this, Easter fell on different dates in Protestant and Catholic territories, until this difference was abolished by agreement in 1776. In the Protestant states, such as the Duchy of Brunswick, the Easter of 1777, five weeks before Gauss's birth, was the first one calculated in the new manner.\nError theory.\nGauss likely used the method of least squares to minimize the impact of measurement error when calculating the orbit of Ceres. The method was published first by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805, but Gauss claimed in \"Theoria motus\" (1809) that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795. In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the \"priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares\". Gauss proved that the method has the lowest sampling variance within the class of linear unbiased estimators under the assumption of normally distributed errors (Gauss\u2013Markov theorem), in the two-part paper \"Theoria combinationis observationum erroribus minimis obnoxiae\" (1823).\nIn the first paper he proved Gauss's inequality (a Chebyshev-type inequality) for unimodal distributions, and stated without proof another inequality for moments of the fourth order (a special case of the Gauss-Winckler inequality). He derived lower and upper bounds for the variance of the sample variance. In the second paper, Gauss described recursive least squares methods. His work on the theory of errors was extended in several directions by the geodesist Friedrich Robert Helmert to the Gauss-Helmert model.\nGauss also contributed to problems in probability theory that are not directly concerned with the theory of errors. One example appears as a diary note where he tried to describe the asymptotic distribution of entries in the continued fraction expansion of a random number uniformly distributed in \"(0,1)\". He derived this distribution, now known as the Gauss-Kuzmin distribution, as a by-product of the discovery of the ergodicity of the Gauss map for continued fractions. Gauss's solution is the first-ever result in the metrical theory of continued fractions.\nGeodesy.\nGauss was busy with geodetic problems since 1799 when he helped Karl Ludwig von Lecoq with calculations during his survey in Westphalia. Beginning in 1804, he taught himself some practical geodesy in Brunswick and G\u00f6ttingen.\nSince 1816, Gauss's former student Heinrich Christian Schumacher, then professor in Copenhagen, but living in Altona (Holstein) near Hamburg as head of an observatory, carried out a triangulation of the Jutland peninsula from Skagen in the north to Lauenburg in the south. This project was the basis for map production but also aimed at determining the geodetic arc between the terminal sites. Data from geodetic arcs were used to determine the dimensions of the earth geoid, and long arc distances brought more precise results. Schumacher asked Gauss to continue this work further to the south in the Kingdom of Hanover; Gauss agreed after a short time of hesitation. Finally, in May 1820, King George IV gave the order to Gauss.\nAn arc measurement needs a precise astronomical determination of at least two points in the network. Gauss and Schumacher used the coincidence that both observatories in G\u00f6ttingen and Altona, in the garden of Schumacher's house, lay nearly in the same longitude. The latitude was measured with both their instruments and a zenith sector of Ramsden that was transported to both observatories.\nGauss and Schumacher had already determined some angles between L\u00fcneburg, Hamburg, and Lauenburg for the geodetic connection in October 1818. During the summers of 1821 until 1825 Gauss directed the triangulation work personally, from Thuringia in the south to the river Elbe in the north. The triangle between Hoher Hagen, Gro\u00dfer Inselsberg in the Thuringian Forest, and Brocken in the Harz mountains was the largest one Gauss had ever measured with a maximum size of . In the thinly populated L\u00fcneburg Heath without significant natural summits or artificial buildings, he had difficulties finding suitable triangulation points; sometimes cutting lanes through the vegetation was necessary.\nFor pointing signals, Gauss invented a new instrument with movable mirrors and a small telescope that reflects the sunbeams to the triangulation points, and named it \"heliotrope\". Another suitable construction for the same purpose was a sextant with an additional mirror which he named \"vice heliotrope\". Gauss was assisted by soldiers of the Hanoverian army, among them his eldest son Joseph. Gauss took part in the baseline measurement (Braak Base Line) of Schumacher in the village of Braak near Hamburg in 1820, and used the result for the evaluation of the Hanoverian triangulation.\nAn additional result was a better value for the flattening of the approximative Earth ellipsoid. Gauss developed the universal transverse Mercator projection of the ellipsoidal shaped Earth (what he named \"conform projection\") for representing geodetical data in plane charts.\nWhen the arc measurement was finished, Gauss began the enlargement of the triangulation to the west to get a survey of the whole Kingdom of Hanover with a Royal decree from 25 March 1828. The practical work was directed by three army officers, among them Lieutenant Joseph Gauss. The complete data evaluation laid in the hands of Gauss, who applied his mathematical inventions such as the method of least squares and the elimination method to it. The project was finished in 1844, and Gauss sent a final report of the project to the government; his method of projection was not edited until 1866.\nIn 1828, when studying differences in latitude, Gauss first defined a physical approximation for the figure of the Earth as the surface everywhere perpendicular to the direction of gravity; later his doctoral student Johann Benedict Listing called this the \"geoid\".\nMagnetism and telegraphy.\nGeomagnetism.\nGauss had been interested in magnetism since 1803. After Alexander von Humboldt visited G\u00f6ttingen in 1826, both scientists began intensive research on geomagnetism, partly independently, partly in productive cooperation. In 1828, Gauss was Humboldt's guest during the conference of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians in Berlin, where he got acquainted with the physicist Wilhelm Weber.\nWhen Weber got the chair for physics in G\u00f6ttingen as successor of Johann Tobias Mayer by Gauss's recommendation in 1831, both of them started a fruitful collaboration, leading to a new knowledge of magnetism with a representation for the unit of magnetism in terms of mass, charge, and time. They founded the \"Magnetic Association\" (German: \"Magnetischer Verein\"), an international working group of several observatories, which carried out measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world using equivalent methods at arranged dates in the years 1836 to 1841.\nIn 1836, Humboldt suggested the establishment of a worldwide net of geomagnetic stations in the British dominions with a letter to the Duke of Sussex, then president of the Royal Society; he proposed that magnetic measures should be taken under standardized conditions using his methods. Together with other instigators, this led to a global program known as \"Magnetical crusade\" under the direction of Edward Sabine. The dates, times, and intervals of observations were determined in advance, the \"G\u00f6ttingen mean time\" was used as the standard. 61 stations on all five continents participated in this global program. Gauss and Weber founded a series for publication of the results, six volumes were edited between 1837 and 1843. Weber's departure to Leipzig in 1843 as late effect of the G\u00f6ttingen Seven affair marked the end of Magnetic Association activity.\nFollowing Humboldt's example, Gauss ordered a magnetic observatory to be built in the garden of the observatory, but the scientists differed over instrumental equipment; Gauss preferred stationary instruments, which he thought to give more precise results, whereas Humboldt was accustomed to movable instruments. Gauss was interested in the temporal and spatial variation of magnetic declination, inclination, and intensity and differentiated, unlike Humboldt, between \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" intensity. Together with Weber, he developed methods of measuring the components of the intensity of the magnetic field and constructed a suitable magnetometer to measure \"absolute values\" of the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, not more relative ones that depended on the apparatus. The precision of the magnetometer was about ten times higher than that of previous instruments. With this work, Gauss was the first to derive a non-mechanical quantity by basic mechanical quantities.\nGauss carried out a \"General Theory of Terrestrial Magnetism\" (1839), in what he believed to describe the nature of magnetic force; according to Felix Klein, this work is a presentation of observations by use of spherical harmonics rather than a physical theory. The theory predicted the existence of exactly two magnetic poles on the Earth, thus Hansteen's idea of four magnetic poles became obsolete, and the data allowed to determine their location with rather good precision.\nGauss influenced the beginning of geophysics in Russia, when Adolph Theodor Kupffer, one of his former students, founded a magnetic observatory in St. Petersburg, following the example of the observatory in G\u00f6ttingen, and similarly, Ivan Simonov in Kazan.\nElectromagnetism.\nThe discoveries of Hans Christian \u00d8rsted on electromagnetism and Michael Faraday on electromagnetic induction drew Gauss's attention to these matters. Gauss and Weber found rules for branched electric circuits, which were later found independently and first published by Gustav Kirchhoff and named after him as Kirchhoff's circuit laws, and made inquiries into electromagnetism. They constructed the first electromechanical telegraph in 1833, and Weber himself connected the observatory with the institute for physics in the town centre of G\u00f6ttingen, but they made no further commercial use of this invention.\nGauss's main theoretical interests in electromagnetism were reflected in his attempts to formulate quantitive laws governing electromagnetic induction. In notebooks from these years, he recorded several innovative formulations; he discovered the vector potential function, independently rediscovered by Franz Ernst Neumann in 1845, and in January 1835 he wrote down an \"induction law\" equivalent to Faraday's law, which stated that the electromotive force at a given point in space is equal to the instantaneous rate of change (with respect to time) of this function.\nGauss tried to find a unifying law for long-distance effects of electrostatics, electrodynamics, electromagnetism, and induction, comparable to Newton's law of gravitation, but his attempt ended in a \"tragic failure\".\nPotential theory.\nSince Isaac Newton had shown theoretically that the Earth and rotating stars assume non-spherical shapes, the problem of attraction of ellipsoids gained importance in mathematical astronomy. In his first publication on potential theory, the \"Theoria attractionis...\" (1813), Gauss provided a closed-form expression to the gravitational attraction of a homogeneous triaxial ellipsoid at every point in space. In contrast to previous research of Maclaurin, Laplace and Lagrange, Gauss's new solution treated the attraction more directly in the form of an elliptic integral. In the process, he also proved and applied some special cases of the so-called Gauss's theorem in vector analysis.\nIn the \"General theorems concerning the attractive and repulsive forces acting in reciprocal proportions of quadratic distances\" (1840) Gauss gave a basic theory of magnetic potential, based on Lagrange, Laplace, and Poisson; it seems rather unlikely that he knew the previous works of George Green on this subject. However, Gauss could never give any reasons for magnetism, nor a theory of magnetism similar to Newton's work on gravitation, that enabled scientists to predict geomagnetic effects in the future.\nOptics.\nGauss's calculations enabled instrument maker Johann Georg Repsold in Hamburg to construct a new achromatic lens system in 1810. A main problem, among other difficulties, was that the refractive index and dispersion of the glass used were not precisely known. In a short article from 1817 Gauss dealt with the problem of removal of chromatic aberration in double lenses, and computed adjustments of the shape and coefficients of refraction required to minimize it. His work was noted by the optician Carl August von Steinheil, who in 1860 introduced the achromatic Steinheil doublet, partly based on Gauss's calculations. Many results in geometrical optics are scattered in Gauss's correspondences and hand notes.\nIn the \"Dioptrical Investigations\" (1840), Gauss gave the first systematic analysis of the formation of images under a paraxial approximation (Gaussian optics). He characterized optical systems under a paraxial approximation only by its cardinal points, and he derived the Gaussian lens formula, applicable without restrictions in respect to the thickness of the lenses.\nMechanics.\nGauss's first work in mechanics concerned the earth's rotation. When his university friend Benzenberg carried out experiments to determine the deviation of falling masses from the perpendicular in 1802, what today is known as the Coriolis force, he asked Gauss for a theory-based calculation of the values for comparison with the experimental ones. Gauss elaborated a system of fundamental equations for the motion, and the results corresponded sufficiently with Benzenberg's data, who added Gauss's considerations as an appendix to his book on falling experiments.\nAfter Foucault had demonstrated the earth's rotation by his pendulum experiment in public in 1851, Gerling questioned Gauss for further explanations. This instigated Gauss to design a new apparatus for demonstration with a much shorter length of pendulum than Foucault's one. The oscillations were observed with a reading telescope, with a vertical scale and a mirror fastened at the pendulum. It is described in the Gauss\u2013Gerling correspondence and Weber made some experiments with this apparatus in 1853, but no data were published.\nGauss's principle of least constraint of 1829 was established as a general concept to overcome the division of mechanics into statics and dynamics, combining D'Alembert's principle with Lagrange's principle of virtual work, and showing analogies to the method of least squares.\nMetrology.\nIn 1828, Gauss was appointed as head of the board for weights and measures of the Kingdom of Hanover. He created standards for length and measure. Gauss himself took care of the time-consuming measures and gave detailed orders for the mechanical construction. In the correspondence with Schumacher, who was also working on this matter, he described new ideas for high-precision scales. He submitted the final reports on the Hanoverian foot and pound to the government in 1841. This work achieved international importance due to an 1836 law that connected the Hanoverian measures with the English ones.\nHonours and awards.\nGauss first became member of a scientific society, the Russian Academy of Sciences, in 1802. Further memberships (corresponding, foreign or full) were awarded by the Academy of Sciences in G\u00f6ttingen (1802/ 1807), the French Academy of Sciences (1804/ 1820), the Royal Society of London (1804), the Royal Prussian Academy in Berlin (1810), the National Academy of Science in Verona (1810), the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1820), the Bavarian Academy of Sciences of Munich (1820), the Royal Danish Academy in Copenhagen (1821), the Royal Astronomical Society in London (1821), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1821), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston (1822), the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences in Prague (1833), the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium (1841/1845), the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala (1843), the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin (1843), the Royal Institute of the Netherlands (1845/ 1851), the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid (1850), the Russian Geographical Society (1851), the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna (1848), the American Philosophical Society (1853), the Cambridge Philosophical Society, and the Royal Hollandish Society of Sciences in Haarlem.\nBoth the University of Kazan and the Philosophy Faculty of the University of Prague appointed him honorary member in 1848.\nGauss received the Lalande Prize from the French Academy of Science in 1809 for the theory of planets and the means of determining their orbits from only three observations, the Danish Academy of Science prize in 1823 for his memoir on conformal projection, and the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1838 for \"his inventions and mathematical researches in magnetism\".\nGauss was appointed Knight of the French Legion of Honour in 1837, and became one of the first members of the Prussian Order Pour le Merite (Civil class) when it was established in 1842. He received the Order of the Crown of Westphalia (1810), the Danish Order of the Dannebrog (1817), the Hanoverian Royal Guelphic Order (1815), the Swedish Order of the Polar Star (1844), the Order of Henry the Lion (1849), and the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art (1853).\nThe Kings of Hanover appointed him the honorary titles \"Hofrath\" (1816) and \"Geheimer Hofrath\" (1845). In 1949, on the occasion of his golden doctor degree jubilee, he received honorary citizenship of both Brunswick and G\u00f6ttingen. Soon after his death a medal was issued by order of King George V of Hanover with the back inscription dedicated \"to the Prince of Mathematicians\".\nThe \"Gauss-Gesellschaft G\u00f6ttingen\" (\"G\u00f6ttingen Gauss Society\") was founded in 1964 for research on the life and work of Carl Friedrich Gauss and related persons. It publishes the \"Mitteilungen der Gauss-Gesellschaft\" (\"Communications of the Gauss Society\").\nSelected writings.\nCorrespondence.\nThe G\u00f6ttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities provides a complete collection of the known letters from and to Carl Friedrich Gauss that is accessible online.

{"id": "6130", "revid": "337066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6130", "title": "Cornish language", "text": "Celtic language native to Cornwall\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nCornish ( or ) is a Celtic language of the Brittonic subgroup that is native to the Cornish people and their homeland, Cornwall. Along with Welsh and Breton, Cornish descends from Common Brittonic, a language once spoken widely across Great Britain. For much of the medieval period Cornish was the main language of Cornwall, until it was gradually pushed westwards by the spread of English. Cornish remained a common community language in parts of Cornwall until the mid-18th century, and there is some evidence for traditional speakers persisting into the 19th century.\nCornish became extinct as a living community language in Cornwall by the end of the 18th century; knowledge of Cornish persisted within some families and individuals. A revival started in the early 20th century, and in 2010 UNESCO reclassified the language as critically endangered, stating that its former classification of the language as extinct was no longer accurate. The language has a growing number of second-language speakers, and a very small number of families now raise children to speak revived Cornish as a first language.\nCornish is currently recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and the language is often described as an important part of Cornish identity, culture and heritage. Since the revival of the language, some Cornish textbooks and works of literature have been published, and an increasing number of people are studying the language. Recent developments include Cornish music, independent films, and children's books. A small number of people in Cornwall have been brought up to be bilingual native speakers, and the language is taught in schools and appears on street nameplates. The first Cornish-language day care opened in 2010.\nClassification.\nCornish is a Southwestern Brittonic language, a branch of the Insular Celtic section of the Celtic language family, which is a sub-family of the Indo-European language family. Brittonic also includes Welsh, Breton, Cumbric and possibly Pictish, the last two of which are extinct. Scottish Gaelic, Irish and Manx are part of the separate Goidelic branch of Insular Celtic.\nJoseph Loth viewed Cornish and Breton as being two dialects of the same language, claiming that \"Middle Cornish is without doubt closer to Breton as a whole than the modern Breton dialect of Quiberon [] is to that of Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on [].\" Also, Kenneth Jackson argued that it is almost certain that Cornish and Breton would have been mutually intelligible as long as Cornish was a living language, and that Cornish and Breton are especially closely related to each other and less closely related to Welsh.\nHistory.\nCornish evolved from the Common Brittonic spoken throughout Britain south of the Firth of Forth during the British Iron Age and Roman period. As a result of westward Anglo-Saxon expansion, the Britons of the southwest were separated from those in modern-day Wales and Cumbria, which Jackson links to the defeat of the Britons at the Battle of Deorham in about 577. The western dialects eventually evolved into modern Welsh and the now extinct Cumbric, while Southwestern Brittonic developed into Cornish and Breton, the latter as a result of emigration to parts of the continent, known as Brittany over the following centuries.\nOld Cornish.\nThe area controlled by the southwestern Britons was progressively reduced by the expansion of Wessex over the next few centuries. During the Old Cornish () period (800\u20131200), the Cornish-speaking area was largely coterminous with modern-day Cornwall, after the Saxons had taken over Devon in their south-westward advance, which probably was facilitated by a second migration wave to Brittany that resulted in the partial depopulation of Devon. The maintaining of close links with Breton-speakers in Brittany allowed for a level of mutual intelligibility between Cornish and Breton.\nThe earliest written record of the Cornish language comes from this period: a 9th-century gloss in a Latin manuscript of by Boethius, which used the words . The phrase may mean \"it [the mind] hated the gloomy places\", or alternatively, as Andrew Breeze suggests, \"she hated the land\". Other sources from this period include the \"Saints' List\", a list of almost fifty Cornish saints, the Bodmin manumissions, which is a list of manumittors and slaves, the latter with mostly Cornish names, and, more substantially, a Latin\u2013Cornish glossary (the or Cottonian Vocabulary), a Cornish translation of \u00c6lfric of Eynsham's Latin\u2013Old English Glossary, which is thematically arranged into several groups, such as the Genesis creation narrative, anatomy, church hierarchy, the family, names for various kinds of artisans and their tools, flora, fauna, and household items. The manuscript was widely thought to be in Old Welsh until the 18th century when it was identified as Cornish by Edward Lhuyd. Some Brittonic glosses in the 9th-century colloquy were once identified as Old Cornish, but they are more likely Old Welsh, possibly influenced by a Cornish scribe. No single phonological feature distinguishes Cornish from both Welsh and Breton until the beginning of the assibilation of dental stops in Cornish, which is not found before the second half of the eleventh century, and it is not always possible to distinguish Old Cornish, Old Breton, and Old Welsh orthographically.\nMiddle Cornish.\nThe Cornish language continued to flourish well through the Middle Cornish () period (1200\u20131600), reaching a peak of about 39,000 speakers in the 13th century, after which the number started to decline. This period provided the bulk of traditional Cornish literature, and was used to reconstruct the language during its revival. Most important is the , a cycle of three mystery plays, , and . Together these provide about 8,734 lines of text. The three plays exhibit a mixture of English and Brittonic influences, and, like other Cornish literature, may have been written at Glasney College near Penryn. From this period also are the hagiographical dramas (\"The Life of Meriasek\") and (\"The Life of Ke\"), both of which feature as an antagonist the villainous and tyrannical King Tewdar (or Teudar), a historical medieval king in Armorica and Cornwall, who, in these plays, has been interpreted as a lampoon of either of the Tudor kings Henry VII or Henry VIII.\nOthers are the \"Charter Fragment\", the earliest known continuous text in the Cornish language, apparently part of a play about a medieval marriage, and (\"The Passion of Our Lord\"), a poem probably intended for personal worship, were written during this period, probably in the second half of the 14th century. Another important text, the , was realized to be Cornish in 1949, having previously been incorrectly classified as Welsh. It is the longest text in the traditional Cornish language, consisting of around 30,000 words of continuous prose. This text is a late 16th century translation of twelve of Bishop Bonner's thirteen homilies by a certain John Tregear, tentatively identified as a vicar of St Allen from Crowan, and has an additional catena, Sacrament an Alter, added later by his fellow priest, Thomas Stephyn. In the reign of Henry VIII, an account was given by Andrew Boorde in his 1542 . He states, \"\"\nWhen Parliament passed the Act of Uniformity 1549, which established the 1549 edition of the English Book of Common Prayer as the sole legal form of worship in England, including Cornwall, people in many areas of Cornwall did not speak or understand English. The passing of this Act was one of the causes of the Prayer Book Rebellion (which may also have been influenced by government repression after the failed Cornish rebellion of 1497), with \"the commoners of Devonshyre and Cornwall\" producing a manifesto demanding a return to the old religious services and included an article that concluded, \"and so we the Cornyshe men (whereof certen of us understande no Englysh) utterly refuse thys newe Englysh.\" In response to their articles, the government spokesman (either Philip Nichols or Nicholas Udall) wondered why they did not just ask the king for a version of the liturgy in their own language. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer asked why the Cornishmen should be offended by holding the service in English, when they had before held it in Latin, which even fewer of them could understand. Anthony Fletcher points out that this rebellion was primarily motivated by religious and economic, rather than linguistic, concerns. The rebellion prompted a heavy-handed response from the government, and 5,500 people died during the fighting and the rebellion's aftermath. Government officials then directed troops under the command of Sir Anthony Kingston to carry out pacification operations throughout the West Country. Kingston subsequently ordered the executions of numerous individuals suspected of involvement with the rebellion as part of the post-rebellion reprisals.\nThe rebellion eventually proved a turning-point for the Cornish language, as the authorities came to associate it with sedition and \"backwardness\". This proved to be one of the reasons why the Book of Common Prayer was never translated into Cornish (unlike Welsh), as proposals to do so were suppressed in the rebellion's aftermath. The failure to translate the Book of Common Prayer into Cornish led to the language's rapid decline during the 16th and 17th centuries. Peter Berresford Ellis cites the years 1550\u20131650 as a century of immense damage for the language, and its decline can be traced to this period. In 1680 William Scawen wrote an essay describing 16 reasons for the decline of Cornish, among them the lack of a distinctive Cornish alphabet, the loss of contact between Cornwall and Brittany, the cessation of the miracle plays, loss of records in the Civil War, lack of a Cornish Bible and immigration to Cornwall. Mark Stoyle, however, has argued that the 'glotticide' of the Cornish language was mainly a result of the Cornish gentry adopting English to dissociate themselves from the reputation for disloyalty and rebellion associated with the Cornish language since the 1497 uprising.\nLate Cornish.\nBy the middle of the 17th century, the language had retreated to Penwith and Kerrier, and transmission of the language to new generations had almost entirely ceased. In his \"Survey of Cornwall\", published in 1602, Richard Carew writes:[M]ost of the inhabitants can speak no word of Cornish, but very few are ignorant of the English; and yet some so affect their own, as to a stranger they will not speak it; for if meeting them by chance, you inquire the way, or any such matter, your answer shall be, \",\" \"I [will] speak no Saxonage.\"\nThe Late Cornish () period from 1600 to about 1800 has a less substantial body of literature than the Middle Cornish period, but the sources are more varied in nature, including songs, poems about fishing and curing pilchards, and various translations of verses from the Bible, the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. Edward Lhuyd's \"Archaeologia Britannica\", which was mainly recorded in the field from native speakers in the early 1700s, and his unpublished field notebook are seen as important sources of Cornish vocabulary, some of which are not found in any other source. \"Archaeologia Britannica\" also features a complete version of a traditional folk tale, \"John of Chyanhor\", a short story about a man from St Levan who goes far to the east seeking work, eventually returning home after three years to find that his wife has borne him a child during his absence.\nIn 1776, William Bodinar, who describes himself as having learned Cornish from old fishermen when he was a boy, wrote a letter to Daines Barrington in Cornish, with an English translation, which was probably the last prose written in the traditional language. In his letter, he describes the sociolinguistics of the Cornish language at the time, stating that there are no more than four or five old people in his village who can still speak Cornish, concluding with the remark that Cornish is no longer known by young people. However, the last recorded traditional Cornish literature may have been the \"Cranken Rhyme\", a corrupted version of a verse or song published in the late 19th century by John Hobson Matthews, recorded orally by John Davey (or Davy) of Boswednack, of uncertain date but probably originally composed during the last years of the traditional language. Davey had traditional knowledge of at least some Cornish. John Kelynack (1796\u20131885), a fisherman of Newlyn, was sought by philologists for old Cornish words and technical phrases in the 19th century.\nDecline of Cornish speakers between 1300 and 1800.\nIt is difficult to state with certainty when Cornish ceased to be spoken, due to the fact that its last speakers were of relatively low social class and that the definition of what constitutes \"a living language\" is not clear cut. Peter Pool argues that by 1800 nobody was using Cornish as a daily language and no evidence exists of anyone capable of conversing in the language at that date. However, passive speakers, semi-speakers and rememberers, who retain some competence in the language despite not being fluent nor using the language in daily life, generally survive even longer.\nThe traditional view that Dolly Pentreath (1692\u20131777) was the last native speaker of Cornish has been challenged, and in the 18th and 19th centuries there was academic interest in the language and in attempting to find the last speaker of Cornish. It has been suggested that, whereas Pentreath was probably the last \"fluent\" speaker, the last \"native\" speaker may have been John Davey of Zennor, who died in 1891. However, although it is clear Davey possessed some traditional knowledge in addition to having read books on Cornish, accounts differ of his competence in the language. Some contemporaries stated he was able to converse on certain topics in Cornish whereas others affirmed they had never heard him claim to be able to do so. Robert Morton Nance, who reworked and translated Davey's Cranken Rhyme, remarked, \"There can be no doubt, after the evidence of this rhyme, of what there was to lose by neglecting John Davey.\"\nThe search for the last speaker is hampered by a lack of transcriptions or audio recordings, so that it is impossible to tell from this distance whether the language these people were reported to be speaking was Cornish, or English with a heavy Cornish substratum, nor what their level of fluency was. Nevertheless, this academic interest, along with the beginning of the Celtic Revival in the late 19th century, provided the groundwork for a Cornish language revival movement.\nNotwithstanding the uncertainty over who was the last speaker of Cornish, researchers have posited the following numbers for the prevalence of the language between 1050 and 1800.\nRevived Cornish.\nIn 1904, the Celtic language scholar and Cornish cultural activist Henry Jenner published \"A Handbook of the Cornish Language\". The publication of this book is often considered to be the point at which the revival movement started. Jenner wrote about the Cornish language in 1905, \"one may fairly say that most of what there was of it has been preserved, and that it has been continuously preserved, for there has never been a time when there were not some Cornishmen who knew some Cornish.\"\nThe revival focused on reconstructing and standardising the language, including coining new words for modern concepts, and creating educational material in order to teach Cornish to others. In 1929 Robert Morton Nance published his Unified Cornish () system, based on the Middle Cornish literature while extending the attested vocabulary with neologisms and forms based on Celtic roots also found in Breton and Welsh, publishing a dictionary in 1938. Nance's work became the basis of revived Cornish () for most of the 20th century. During the 1970s, criticism of Nance's system, including the inconsistent orthography and unpredictable correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, as well as on other grounds such as the archaic basis of Unified and a lack of emphasis on the spoken language, resulted in the creation of several rival systems. In the 1980s, Ken George published a new system, ('Common Cornish'), based on a reconstruction of the phonological system of Middle Cornish, but with an approximately morphophonemic orthography. It was subsequently adopted by the Cornish Language Board and was the written form used by a reported 54.5% of all Cornish language users according to a survey in 2008, but was heavily criticised for a variety of reasons by Jon Mills and Nicholas Williams, including making phonological distinctions that they state were not made in the traditional language c.\u20091500, failing to make distinctions that they believe \"were\" made in the traditional language at this time, and the use of an orthography that deviated too far from the traditional texts and Unified Cornish. Also during this period, Richard Gendall created his Modern Cornish system (also known as Revived Late Cornish), which used Late Cornish as a basis, and Nicholas Williams published a revised version of Unified; however neither of these systems gained the popularity of Unified or Kemmyn.\nThe revival entered a period of factionalism and public disputes, with each orthography attempting to push the others aside. By the time that Cornish was recognised by the UK government under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2002, it had become recognised that the existence of multiple orthographies was unsustainable with regards to using the language in education and public life, as none had achieved a wide consensus. A process of unification was set about which resulted in the creation of the public-body Cornish Language Partnership in 2005 and agreement on a Standard Written Form in 2008. In 2010 a new milestone was reached when UNESCO altered its classification of Cornish, stating that its previous label of \"extinct\" was no longer accurate.\nGeographic distribution and number of speakers.\nEstimates of the number of Cornish speakers vary according to the definition of a speaker, and is difficult to determine accurately due to the individualised nature of language take-up. Nevertheless, there is recognition that the number of Cornish speakers is growing. From before the 1980s to the end of the 20th century there was a sixfold increase in the number of speakers to around 300. One figure for the number of people who know a few basic words, such as knowing that \"Kernow\" means \"Cornwall\", was 300,000; the same survey gave the number of people able to have simple conversations as 3,000.\nA report on the 2011 Census published in 2013 by the Office for National Statistics placed the number of speakers at somewhere between 325 and 625. In 2017 the ONS released data based on the 2011 Census that placed the number of speakers at 557 people in England and Wales who declared Cornish to be their main language, 464 of whom lived in Cornwall. The 2021 census listed the number of Cornish speakers at 563.\nThe Cornish Language Strategy project commissioned research to provide quantitative and qualitative evidence for the number of Cornish speakers: due to the success of the revival project it was estimated that 2,000 people were fluent (surveyed in spring 2008), an increase from the estimated 300 people who spoke Cornish fluently suggested in a study by Kenneth MacKinnon in 2000.&lt;ref name=\"BBC BBC/British Council\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nJenefer Lowe of the Cornish Language Partnership said in an interview with the BBC in 2010 that there were around 300 fluent speakers. Bert Biscoe, a councillor and bard, in a statement to the \"Western Morning News\" in 2014 said there were \"several hundred fluent speakers\". Cornwall Council estimated in 2015 that there were 300\u2013400 fluent speakers who used the language regularly, with 5,000 people having a basic conversational ability in the language.\nA study that appeared in 2018 established the number of people in Cornwall with at least minimal skills in Cornish, such as the use of some words and phrases, to be more than 3,000, including around 500 estimated to be fluent.\nThe Institute of Cornish Studies at the University of Exeter is working with the Cornish Language Partnership to study the Cornish language revival of the 20th century, including the growth in number of speakers.\nLegal status and recognition.\nIn 2002, Cornish was recognized by the UK government under Part II of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. UNESCO's \"Atlas of World Languages\" classifies Cornish as \"critically endangered\". UNESCO has said that a previous classification of 'extinct' \"does not reflect the current situation for Cornish\" and is \"no longer accurate\".\nWithin the UK.\nCornwall Council's policy is to support the language, in line with the European Charter. A motion was passed in November 2009 in which the council promoted the inclusion of Cornish, as appropriate and where possible, in council publications and on signs. This plan has drawn some criticism. In October 2015, the council announced that staff would be encouraged to use \"basic words and phrases\" in Cornish when dealing with the public. In 2021 Cornwall Council prohibited a marriage ceremony from being conducted in Cornish as the Marriage Act 1949 only allowed for marriage ceremonies in English or Welsh.\nIn 2014, the Cornish people were recognised by the UK Government as a national minority under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. The FCNM provides certain rights and protections to a national minority with regard to their minority language.\nIn 2016, British government funding for the Cornish language ceased, and responsibility transferred to Cornwall Council.\nOrthography.\nOld Cornish orthography.\nUntil around the middle of the 11th century, Old Cornish scribes used a traditional spelling system shared with Old Breton and Old Welsh, based on the pronunciation of British Latin. By the time of the , usually dated to around 1100, Old English spelling conventions, such as the use of thorn (\u00de, \u00fe) and eth (\u00d0, \u00f0) for dental fricatives, and wynn (\u01f7, \u01bf) for , had come into use, allowing documents written at this time to be distinguished from Old Welsh, which rarely uses these characters, and Old Breton, which does not use them at all. Old Cornish features include using initial \u27e8ch\u27e9, \u27e8c\u27e9, or \u27e8k\u27e9 for , and, in internal and final position, \u27e8p\u27e9, \u27e8t\u27e9, \u27e8c\u27e9, \u27e8b\u27e9, \u27e8d\u27e9, and \u27e8g\u27e9 are generally used for the phonemes , , , , , and respectively, meaning that the results of Brittonic lenition are not usually apparent from the orthography at this time.\nMiddle Cornish orthography.\nMiddle Cornish orthography has a significant level of variation, and shows influence from Middle English spelling practices. Yogh (\u021c \u021d) is used in certain Middle Cornish texts, where it is used to represent a variety of sounds, including the dental fricatives and , a usage which is unique to Middle Cornish and is never found in Middle English. Middle Cornish scribes tend to use \u27e8c\u27e9 for before back vowels, and \u27e8k\u27e9 for before front vowels, though this is not always true, and this rule is less consistent in certain texts. Middle Cornish scribes almost universally use \u27e8wh\u27e9 to represent (or ), as in Middle English. Middle Cornish, especially towards the end of this period, tends to use orthographic \u27e8g\u27e9 and \u27e8b\u27e9 in word-final position in stressed monosyllables, and \u27e8k\u27e9 and \u27e8p\u27e9 in word-final position in unstressed final syllables, to represent the reflexes of late Brittonic and , respectively.\nLate Cornish orthography.\nWritten sources from this period are often spelled following English spelling conventions since many of the writers of the time had not been exposed to Middle Cornish texts or the Cornish orthography within them. Around 1700, Edward Lhuyd visited Cornwall, introducing his own partly phonetic orthography that he used in his , which was adopted by some local writers, leading to the use of some Lhuydian features such as the use of circumflexes to denote long vowels, \u27e8k\u27e9 before front vowels, word-final \u27e8i\u27e9, and the use of \u27e8dh\u27e9 to represent the voiced dental fricative .\nRevived Cornish orthography.\nAfter the publication of Jenner's \"Handbook of the Cornish Language\", the earliest revivalists used Jenner's orthography, which was influenced by Lhuyd's system. This system was abandoned following the development by Nance of a \"unified spelling\", later known as Unified Cornish, a system based on a standardization of the orthography of the early Middle Cornish texts. Nance's system was used by almost all Revived Cornish speakers and writers until the 1970s. Criticism of Nance's system, particularly the relationship of spelling to sounds and the phonological basis of Unified Cornish, resulted in rival orthographies appearing by the early 1980s, including Gendal's Modern Cornish, based on Late Cornish native writers and Lhuyd, and Ken George's Kernewek Kemmyn, a mainly morphophonemic orthography based on George's reconstruction of Middle Cornish c.\u20091500, which features a number of orthographic, and phonological, distinctions not found in Unified Cornish. Kernewek Kemmyn is characterised by the use of universal \u27e8k\u27e9 for (instead of \u27e8c\u27e9 before back vowels as in Unified); \u27e8hw\u27e9 for , instead of \u27e8wh\u27e9 as in Unified; and \u27e8y\u27e9, \u27e8oe\u27e9, and \u27e8eu\u27e9 to represent the phonemes , , and respectively, which are not found in Unified Cornish. Criticism of all of these systems, especially Kernewek Kemmyn, by Nicolas Williams, resulted in the creation of Unified Cornish Revised, a modified version of Nance's orthography, featuring: an additional phoneme not distinguished by Nance, \"\u00f6 in German \", represented in the UCR orthography by \u27e8ue\u27e9; replacement of \u27e8y\u27e9 with \u27e8e\u27e9 in many words; internal \u27e8h\u27e9 rather than \u27e8gh\u27e9; and use of final \u27e8b\u27e9, \u27e8g\u27e9, and \u27e8dh\u27e9 in stressed monosyllables. A Standard Written Form, intended as a compromise orthography for official and educational purposes, was introduced in 2008, although a number of previous orthographic systems remain in use and, in response to the publication of the SWF, another new orthography, Kernowek Standard, was created, mainly by Nicholas Williams and Michael Everson, which is proposed as an amended version of the Standard Written Form.\nPhonology.\nThe phonological system of Old Cornish, inherited from Proto-Southwestern Brittonic and originally differing little from Old Breton and Old Welsh, underwent various changes during its Middle and Late phases, eventually resulting in several characteristics not found in the other Brittonic languages. The first sound change to distinguish Cornish from both Breton and Welsh, the assibilation of the dental stops and in medial and final position, had begun by the time of the , c.\u20091100 or earlier. This change, and the subsequent, or perhaps dialectical, palatalization (or occasional rhotacization in a few words) of these sounds, results in orthographic forms such as Middle Cornish 'father', Late Cornish (Welsh ), Middle Cornish 'believe', Late Cornish (Welsh ), and Middle Cornish 'leave', Late Cornish (Welsh ). A further characteristic sound change, pre-occlusion, occurred during the 16th century, resulting in the nasals and being realised as and respectively in stressed syllables, and giving Late Cornish forms such as 'head' (Welsh ) and 'crooked' (Welsh ).\nAs a revitalised language, the phonology of contemporary spoken Cornish is based on a number of sources, including various reconstructions of the sound system of middle and early modern Cornish based on an analysis of internal evidence such as the orthography and rhyme used in the historical texts, comparison with the other Brittonic languages Breton and Welsh, and the work of the linguist Edward Lhuyd, who visited Cornwall in 1700 and recorded the language in a partly phonetic orthography.\nVocabulary.\nCornish is a Celtic language, and the majority of its vocabulary, when usage frequency is taken into account, at every documented stage of its history is inherited from Proto-Celtic, either directly from the ancestral Proto-Indo-European language or through vocabulary borrowed from unknown substrate language(s) at some point in the development of the Celtic proto-language from PIE. Examples of the PIE &gt; PCelt. development are various terms related to kinship and people, including 'mother', 'aunt, mother's sister', 'sister', 'son', 'man', 'person, human', and 'people', and words for parts of the body, including 'hand' and 'tooth'. Inherited adjectives with an Indo-European etymology include 'new', 'broad, wide', 'red', 'old', 'young', and 'alive, living'.\nSeveral Celtic or Brittonic words cannot be reconstructed to Proto-Indo-European, and are suggested to have been borrowed from unknown substrate language(s) at an early stage, such as Proto-Celtic or Proto-Brittonic. Proposed examples in Cornish include 'beer' and 'badger'.\nOther words in Cornish inherited direct from Proto-Celtic include a number of toponyms, for example 'hill', 'fort', and 'land', and a variety of animal names such as 'mouse', 'wether', 'pigs', and 'bull'.\nDuring the Roman occupation of Britain a large number (around 800) of Latin loan words entered the vocabulary of Common Brittonic, which subsequently developed in a similar way to the inherited lexicon. These include 'arm' (from British Latin ), 'net' (from ), and 'cheese' (from ).\nA substantial number of loan words from English and to a lesser extent French entered the Cornish language throughout its history. Whereas only 5% of the vocabulary of the Old Cornish Vocabularium Cornicum is thought to be borrowed from English, and only 10% of the lexicon of the early modern Cornish writer William Rowe, around 42% of the vocabulary of the whole Cornish corpus is estimated to be English loan words, without taking frequency into account. (However, when frequency \"is\" taken into account, this figure for the entire corpus drops to 8%.) The many English loanwords, some of which were sufficiently well assimilated to acquire native Cornish verbal or plural suffixes or be affected by the mutation system, include 'to read', 'to understand', 'way', 'boot' and 'art'.\nMany Cornish words, such as mining and fishing terms, are specific to the culture of Cornwall. Examples include 'mine waste' and 'to mend fishing nets'. and are different types of pastries. is a 'traditional Cornish dance get-together' and is a specific kind of ceremonial dance that takes place in Cornwall. Certain Cornish words may have several translation equivalents in English, so for instance may be translated into English as either 'book' or 'volume' and can mean either 'hand' or 'fist'.\nLike other Celtic languages, Cornish lacks a number of verbs commonly found in other languages, including modals and psych-verbs; examples are 'have', 'like', 'hate', 'prefer', 'must/have to' and 'make/compel to'. These functions are instead fulfilled by periphrastic constructions involving a verb and various prepositional phrases.\nGrammar.\nThe grammar of Cornish shares with other Celtic languages a number of features which, while not unique, are unusual in an Indo-European context. The grammatical features most unfamiliar to English speakers of the language are the initial consonant mutations, the verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order, inflected prepositions, fronting of emphasised syntactic elements and the use of two different forms for 'to be'.\nMorphology.\nMutations.\nCornish has initial consonant mutation: The first sound of a Cornish word may change according to grammatical context. As in Breton, there are four types of mutation in Cornish (compared with three in Welsh, two in Irish and Manx and one in Scottish Gaelic). These changes apply to only certain letters (sounds) in particular grammatical contexts, some of which are given below:\nArticles.\nCornish has no indefinite article. can either mean 'harbour' or 'a harbour'. In certain contexts, can be used, with the meaning 'a certain, a particular', e.g. 'a certain harbour'. There is, however, a definite article 'the', which is used for all nouns regardless of their gender or number, e.g. 'the harbour'.\nNouns.\nCornish nouns belong to one of two grammatical genders, masculine and feminine, but are not inflected for case. Nouns may be singular or plural. Plurals can be formed in various ways, depending on the noun:\nSome nouns are collective or mass nouns. Singulatives can be formed from collective nouns by the addition of the suffix \u2afd-enn\u2afd (SWF \"-en\"):\nVerbs.\nVerbs are conjugated for person, number, tense and mood. For example, the verbal noun 'see' has derived forms such as 1st person singular present indicative 'I see', 3rd person plural imperfect indicative 'they saw', and 2nd person singular imperative 'see!' Grammatical categories can be indicated either by inflection of the main verb, or by the use of auxiliary verbs such as 'be' or 'do'.\nPrepositions.\nCornish uses inflected (or conjugated) prepositions: Prepositions are inflected for person and number. For example, (with, by) has derived forms such as 'with me', 'with him', and 'with you (plural)'.\nSyntax.\nWord order in Cornish is somewhat fluid and varies depending on several factors such as the intended element to be emphasised and whether a statement is negative or affirmative. In a study on Cornish word order in the play Bewnans Meriasek (c.\u20091500), Ken George has argued that the most common word order in main clauses in Middle Cornish was, in affirmative statements, SVO, with the verb in the third person singular:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen affirmative statements are in the less common VSO order, they usually begin with an adverb or other element, followed by an affirmative particle, with the verb inflected for person and tense:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn negative statements, the order was usually VSO, with an initial negative particle and the verb conjugated for person and tense:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA similar structure is used for questions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nElements can be fronted for emphasis:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSentences can also be constructed periphrastically using auxiliary verbs such as 'be, exist':\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs Cornish lacks verbs such as 'to have', possession can also be indicated in this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEnquiring about possession is similar, using a different interrogative form of :\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNouns usually precede the adjective, unlike in English:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSome adjectives usually precede the noun, however:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCulture.\nThe Celtic Congress and Celtic League are groups that advocate cooperation amongst the Celtic Nations in order to protect and promote Celtic languages and cultures, thus working in the interests of the Cornish language.\nThere have been films such as , some televised, made entirely, or significantly, in Cornish. Some businesses use Cornish names.\nCornish has significantly and durably affected Cornwall's place-names as well as Cornish surnames and knowledge of the language helps the understanding of these ancient meanings. Cornish names are adopted for children, pets, houses and boats.\nThere is Cornish literature, including spoken poetry and song, as well as traditional Cornish chants historically performed in marketplaces during religious holidays and public festivals and gatherings.\nThere are periodicals solely in the language, such as the monthly , and . BBC Radio Cornwall has a news broadcast in Cornish and sometimes has other programmes and features for learners and enthusiasts. Local newspapers such as the \"Western Morning News\" have articles in Cornish, and newspapers such as \"The Packet\", \"The West Briton\", and \"The Cornishman\" have also been known to have Cornish features. There is an online radio and TV service in Cornish called , publishing a one-hour podcast each week, based on a magazine format. It includes music in Cornish as well as interviews and features.\nThe language has financial sponsorship from sources including the Millennium Commission. A number of language organisations exist in Cornwall: (Our Language), the Cornish sub-group of the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages, , (the Cornish Language Board) and (the Cornish Language Fellowship).\nThere are ceremonies, some ancient, some modern, that use the language or are entirely in the language.\nCultural events.\nCornwall has had cultural events associated with the language, including the international Celtic Media Festival, hosted in St Ives in 1997. The Old Cornwall Society has promoted the use of the language at events and meetings. Two examples of ceremonies that are performed in both the English and Cornish languages are Crying the Neck and the annual mid-summer bonfires.\nSince 1969, there have been three full performances of the \"Ordinalia\", originally written in the Cornish language, the most recent of which took place at the plen-an-gwary in St Just in September 2021. While significantly adapted from the original, as well as using mostly English-speaking actors, the plays used sizable amounts of Cornish, including a character who spoke only in Cornish and another who spoke both English and Cornish. The event drew thousands over two weeks, also serving as a celebration of Celtic culture. The next production, scheduled for 2024, could, in theory, be entirely in Cornish, without English, if assisted by a professional linguist.\nOutside of Cornwall, efforts to revive the Cornish language and culture through community events are occurring in Australia. A biennial festival, Kernewek Lowender, takes place in South Australia, where both cultural displays and language lessons are offered.\nStudy and teaching.\nCornish is taught in some schools; it was previously taught at degree level at the University of Wales, though the only existing course in the language at university level is as part of a course in Cornish studies at the University of Exeter. In March 2008 a course in the language was started as part of the Celtic Studies curriculum at the University of Vienna, Austria.\nThe University of Cambridge offers courses in Cornish through its John Trim Resources Centre, which is part of the university's Language Centre. In addition, the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic (which is part of the Faculty of English) also carries out research into the Cornish language.\nIn 2015 a university-level course aiming at encouraging and supporting practitioners working with young children to introduce the Cornish language into their settings was launched. The \"Cornish Language Practice Project (Early Years)\" is a level 4 course approved by Plymouth University and run at Cornwall College. The course is not a Cornish-language course but students will be assessed on their ability to use the Cornish language constructively in their work with young children. The course will cover such topics as \"Understanding Bilingualism\", \"Creating Resources\" and \"Integrating Language and Play\", but the focus of the language provision will be on Cornish. A non-accredited specialist Cornish-language course has been developed to run alongside the level 4 course for those who prefer tutor support to learn the language or develop their skills for use with young children.\nCornwall's first Cornish-language cr\u00e8che, , was established in 2010 at Cornwall College, Camborne. The nursery teaches children aged between two and five years alongside their parents to ensure the language is also spoken in the home.\nA number of dictionaries are available in the various orthographies, including \"A Learners' Cornish Dictionary in the Standard Written Form\" by Steve Harris (ed.), by Ken George, by Nicholas Williams and \"A Practical Dictionary of Modern Cornish\" by Richard Gendall. Course books include the three-part series, , and , as well as the more recent and . Several online dictionaries are now available, including one organised by An Akademi Kernewek in SWF.\nClasses and conversation groups for adults are available at several locations in Cornwall as well as in London, Cardiff and Bristol. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic a number of conversation groups entitled have been held online, advertised through Facebook and other media. A surge in interest, not just from people in Cornwall but from all over the world, has meant that extra classes have been organised.\nCornish studies.\nWilliam Scawen produced a manuscript on the declining Cornish language that continually evolved until he died in 1689, aged 89. He was one of the first to realise the language was dying out and wrote detailed manuscripts which he started working on when he was 78. The only version that was ever published was a short first draft but the final version, which he worked on until his death, is a few hundred pages long. At the same time a group of scholars led by John Keigwin (nephew of William Scawen) of Mousehole tried to preserve and further the Cornish language and chose to write in Cornish. One of their number, Nicholas Boson, tells how he had been discouraged from using Cornish to servants by his mother. This group left behind a large number of translations of parts of the Bible, proverbs and songs. They were contacted by the Welsh linguist Edward Lhuyd, who came to Cornwall to study the language.\nEarly Modern Cornish was the subject of a study published by Lhuyd in 1707, and differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar. Such differences included sound changes and more frequent use of auxiliary verbs. The medieval language also possessed two additional tenses for expressing past events and an extended set of possessive suffixes.\nJohn Whitaker, the Manchester-born rector of Ruan Lanihorne, studied the decline of the Cornish language. In his 1804 work \"the Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall\" he concluded that: \"[T]he English Liturgy, was not desired by the Cornish, but forced upon them by the tyranny of England, at a time when the English language was yet unknown in Cornwall. This act of tyranny was at once gross barbarity to the Cornish people, and a death blow to the Cornish language.\"\nRobert Williams published the first comprehensive Cornish dictionary in 1865, the . As a result of the discovery of additional ancient Cornish manuscripts, 2000 new words were added to the vocabulary by Whitley Stokes in \"A Cornish Glossary\". William C. Borlase published \"Proverbs and Rhymes in Cornish\" in 1866 while \"A Glossary of Cornish Names\" was produced by John Bannister in the same year. Frederick Jago published his \"English\u2013Cornish Dictionary\" in 1882.\nIn 2002, the Cornish language gained new recognition because of the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Conversely, along with government provision was the governmental basis of \"New Public Management\", measuring quantifiable results as means of determining effectiveness. This put enormous pressure on finding a single orthography that could be used in unison. The revival of Cornish required extensive rebuilding. The Cornish orthographies that were reconstructed may be considered versions of Cornish because they are not traditional sociolinguistic variations. In the middle-to-late twentieth century, the debate over Cornish orthographies angered more people because several language groups received public funding. This caused other groups to sense favouritism as playing a role in the debate.\nA governmental policymaking structure called New Public Management (NPM) has helped the Cornish language by managing public life of the Cornish language and people. In 2007, the Cornish Language Partnership MAGA represents separate divisions of government and their purpose is to further enhance the Cornish Language Developmental Plan. MAGA established an Ad-Hoc Group, which resulted in three orthographies being presented. The relations for the Ad-Hoc Group were to obtain consensus among the three orthographies and then develop a \"single written form\". The result was creating a new form of Cornish, which had to be natural for both new learners and skilled speakers.\nLiterature.\nRecent Modern Cornish literature.\nIn 1981, the Breton library edited (Passion of our lord), a 15th-century Cornish poem. The first complete translation of the Bible into Cornish, translated from English, was published in 2011. Another Bible translation project translating from original languages is underway. The New Testament and Psalms were made available online on YouVersion (Bible.com) and Bibles.org in July 2014 by the Bible Society.\nA few small publishers produce books in Cornish which are stocked in some local bookshops, as well as in Cornish branches of Waterstones and WH Smith, although publications are becoming increasingly available on the Internet. Printed copies of these may also be found from Amazon. The Truro Waterstones hosts the annual literary awards, established by to recognise publications relating to Cornwall or in the Cornish language. In recent years, a number of Cornish translations of literature have been published, including \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (2009), \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" (2009), \"Treasure Island\" (2010), \"The Railway Children\" (2012), \"Hound of the Baskervilles\" (2012), \"The War of the Worlds\" (2012), \"The Wind in the Willows\" (2013), \"Three Men in a Boat\" (2013), \"Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass\" (2014), and \"A Christmas Carol\" (which won the 2012 award for Cornish Language books), as well as original Cornish literature such as \"\" (\"The Lyonesse Stone\") by Craig Weatherhill. Literature aimed at children is also available, such as (\"Where's Spot?\"), (\"The Beast of Bodmin Moor\"), three \"Topsy and Tim\" titles, two \"Tintin\" titles and (\"Briallen and the Alien\"), which won the 2015 award for Cornish Language books for children. In 2014 , Nicholas Williams's translation of J. R. R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\", was published. A comprehensive list has been created of literature published in the Cornish language, both in print and online.\n is a monthly magazine published entirely in the Cornish language. Members contribute articles on various subjects. The magazine is produced by Graham Sandercock who has been its editor since 1976.\nA study in 2025 found that the total number of words written in Cornish literature had expanded from 180,000 in the traditional sources to over 13 million now. However this expansion had also seen a more pluricentric language. The period since the Standard Written Form agreement in 2008 has seen the publication of over half of this literature, but in a greater variety of orthographies. 36% was written in Kernowak Standard, 26% in the quasi-official SWF (M) Mg used by the Council, Gorsedh and Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek, 16% in Kernewek Kemmyn used by Kesva an Taves Kernewek, 15% in Modern Cornish and 7% in Unified Cornish.\nMedia.\nIn 1983 BBC Radio Cornwall started broadcasting around two minutes of Cornish every week. In 1987, however, they gave over 15 minutes of airtime on Sunday mornings for a programme called ('Holdall'), presented by John King, running until the early 1990s. It was eventually replaced with a five-minute news bulletin called ('The News'). The bulletin was presented every Sunday evening for many years by Rod Lyon, then Elizabeth Stewart, and currently a team presents in rotation. Pirate FM ran short bulletins on Saturday lunchtimes from 1998 to 1999. In 2006, Matthew Clarke who had presented the Pirate FM bulletin, launched a web-streamed news bulletin called ('Weekly News'), which in 2008 was merged into a new weekly magazine podcast (RanG).\nCornish television shows have included a 1982 series by Westward Television with each episode containing a three-minute lesson in Cornish. , an eight-episode series produced by Television South West and broadcast between June and July 1984, later on S4C from May to July 1985, and as a schools programme in 1986. Also by Television South West were two bilingual programmes on Cornish Culture called .\nIn 2016 Kelly's Ice Cream of Bodmin introduced a light hearted television commercial in the Cornish language and this was repeated in 2017.\nThe first episode from the third season of the US television program \"Deadwood\" features a conversation between miners, purportedly in the Cornish language, but really in Irish. One of the miners is then shot by thugs working for businessman George Hearst who justify the murder by saying, \"He come at me with his foreign gibberish.\"\nA number of Cornish language films have been made, including \"Hwerow Hweg\", a 2002 drama film written and directed by Hungarian film-maker Antal Kovacs and \"Trengellick Rising\", a short film written and directed by Guy Potter.\nScreen Cornwall works with Cornwall Council to commission a short film in the Cornish language each year, with their FilmK competition. Their website states \"FylmK is an annual contemporary Cornish language short film competition, producing an imaginative and engaging film, in any genre, from distinctive and exciting filmmakers\".\nA monthly half-hour online TV show began in 2017 called (The Month). It contained news items about cultural events and more mainstream news stories all through Cornish. It also ran a cookery segment called \"\" ('Esther's Kitchen').\nMusic.\nEnglish composer Peter Warlock wrote a Christmas carol in Cornish (setting words by Henry Jenner). The Cornish electronic musician Aphex Twin has used Cornish names for track titles, most notably on his \"Drukqs\" album.\nSeveral traditional Cornish folk songs have been collected and can be sung to various tunes. These include \", \", and \"\".\nIn 2018, the singer Gwenno Saunders released an album in Cornish, entitled , saying: \"I speak Cornish with my son: if you're comfortable expressing yourself in a language, you want to share it.\"\nPlace-names and surnames.\nThe Cornish language features in the toponymy of Cornwall, with a significant contrast between English place-names prevalent in eastern Cornwall and Cornish place-names to the west of the Camel-Fowey river valleys, where English place-names are much less common. Hundreds of Cornish family names have an etymology in the Cornish language, the majority of which are derived from Cornish place-names. Long before the agreement of the Standard Written Form of Cornish in the 21st century, Late Cornish orthography in the Early Modern period usually followed Welsh to English transliteration, phonetically rendering C for K, I for Y, U for W, and Z for S. This meant that place names were adopted into English with spellings such as 'Porthcurno' and 'Penzance'; they are written and in the Standard Written Form of Cornish, agreed upon in 2008. Likewise words such as ('island') can be found spelled as \"\" as at Ince Castle. These apparent mistransliterations can, however, reveal an insight into how names and places were actually pronounced, explaining, for example, how anglicised is still pronounced [\u02c8lans\u01ddn] with emphasis on the first element, perhaps from Cornish , though the \"Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names\" considers this unlikely.\nThe following tables present some examples of Cornish place names and surnames and their anglicised versions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSamples.\nFrom the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\nFrom , the Cornish anthem:\nFrom the wrestler's oath:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Charybdis, along with the sea monster Scylla, appears as a challenge to epic characters such as Odysseus, Jason, and Aeneas. Scholarship locates her in the Strait of Messina.\nThe idiom \"between Scylla and Charybdis\" has come to mean being forced to choose between two similarly dangerous situations.\nDescription.\nThe sea monster Charybdis was believed to live under a small rock on one side of a narrow channel. Opposite her was Scylla, another sea monster, who lived inside a much larger rock. The sides of the strait were within an arrow-shot of each other, and sailors attempting to avoid one of them would come in reach of the other. To be \"between Scylla and Charybdis\" therefore means to be presented with two opposite dangers, the task being to find a route that avoids both. Three times a day, Charybdis swallowed a huge amount of water, before belching it back out again, creating large whirlpools capable of dragging a ship underwater. In some variations of the story, Charybdis was simply a large whirlpool instead of a sea monster.\nThrough the descriptions of Greek mythical chroniclers and Greek historians such as Thucydides, modern scholars generally agree that Charybdis was said to have been located in the Strait of Messina, off the coast of Sicily and opposite a rock on the mainland identified with Scylla. A whirlpool does exist there, caused by currents meeting, but it is dangerous only to small craft in extreme conditions.\nFamily.\nAnother myth makes Charybdis the daughter of Poseidon and Gaia and living as a loyal servant to her father.\nMythology.\nOrigin.\nCharybdis aided her father Poseidon in his feud with her paternal uncle Zeus and, as such, helped him engulf lands and islands in water. Zeus, angry over the land she stole from him, sent her to the bottom of the sea with a thunderbolt; from the sea bed, she drank the water from the sea thrice a day, creating whirlpools. She lingered on a rock with Scylla facing her directly on another rock, making a strait.\nIn some myths, Charybdis was a voracious woman who stole oxen from Heracles, and was hurled by the thunderbolt of Zeus into the sea, where she retained her voracious nature.\nThe \"Odyssey\".\n Odysseus faced both Charybdis and Scylla while rowing through a narrow channel. He ordered his men to avoid Charybdis, thus forcing them to pass near Scylla, which resulted in the deaths of six of his men. Later, stranded on a raft, Odysseus was swept back through the strait and passed near Charybdis. His raft was sucked into her maw, but he survived by clinging to a fig tree growing on a rock over her lair. On the next outflow of water, when his raft was expelled, Odysseus recovered it and paddled away safely.\nJason and the Argonauts.\nThe Argonauts were able to avoid both dangers because Hera ordered the Nereid Thetis to guide them through the perilous passage.\nThe \"Aeneid\".\nIn the \"Aeneid\", the Trojans are warned by Helenus of Scylla and Charybdis, and are advised to avoid them by sailing around Pachynus point (Cape Passero) rather than risk the strait. Later, however, they find themselves passing Etna, and have to row for their lives to escape Charybdis.\nAesop.\nAristotle mentions in his \"Meteorologica\" that Aesop once teased a ferryman by telling him a myth concerning Charybdis. With one gulp of the sea, she brought the mountains to view; islands appeared after the next. The third is yet to come and will dry the sea altogether, thus depriving the ferryman of his livelihood.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6136", "revid": "635492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6136", "title": "Carbon monoxide", "text": "Poisonous oxygen-carbon compound\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nCarbon monoxide (chemical formula CO) is a poisonous, flammable gas that is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and slightly less dense than air. Carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom connected by a triple bond. It is the simplest carbon oxide. In coordination complexes, the carbon monoxide ligand is called \"carbonyl\". It is a key ingredient in many processes in industrial chemistry.\nThe most common source of carbon monoxide is the partial combustion of carbon-containing compounds. Numerous environmental and biological sources generate carbon monoxide. In industry, carbon monoxide is important in the production of many compounds, including drugs, fragrances, and fuels. \nIndoors CO is one of the most acutely toxic contaminants affecting indoor air quality. CO may be emitted from tobacco smoke and generated from malfunctioning fuel-burning stoves (wood, kerosene, natural gas, propane) and fuel-burning heating systems (wood, oil, natural gas) and from blocked flues connected to these appliances. Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries.\nCarbon monoxide has important biological roles across phylogenetic kingdoms. It is produced by many organisms, including humans. In mammalian physiology, carbon monoxide is a classical example of hormesis where low concentrations serve as an endogenous neurotransmitter (gasotransmitter) and high concentrations are toxic, resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning. It is isoelectronic with both cyanide anion and molecular nitrogen .\nPhysical and chemical properties.\nCarbon monoxide is the simplest oxocarbon and is isoelectronic with other triply bonded diatomic species possessing 10 valence electrons, including the cyanide anion, the nitrosonium cation, boron monofluoride and molecular nitrogen. It has a molar mass of 28.0, which, according to the ideal gas law, makes it slightly less dense than air, whose average molar mass is 28.8.\nThe carbon and oxygen are connected by a triple bond that consists of a net two pi bonds and one sigma bond. The bond length between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is 112.8\u00a0pm. This bond length is consistent with a triple bond, as in molecular nitrogen (), which has a similar bond length (109.76\u00a0pm) and nearly the same molecular mass. Carbon\u2013oxygen double bonds are significantly longer, 120.8\u00a0pm in formaldehyde, for example. The boiling point (82\u00a0K) and melting point (68\u00a0K) are very similar to those of (77\u00a0K and 63\u00a0K, respectively). The bond-dissociation energy of 1072\u00a0kJ/mol is stronger than that of (942\u00a0kJ/mol) and represents the strongest chemical bond known.\nThe ground electronic state of carbon monoxide is a singlet state since there are no unpaired electrons.\nBonding and dipole moment.\nThe strength of the bond in carbon monoxide is indicated by the high frequency of its vibration, 2143\u00a0cm\u22121. For comparison, organic carbonyls such as ketones and esters absorb at around 1700\u00a0cm\u22121.\nCarbon and oxygen together have a total of 10 electrons in the valence shell. Following the octet rule for both carbon and oxygen, the two atoms form a triple bond, with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or dipolar bond. This causes a C\u2190O polarization of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C\u2192O polarization since oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. In the free carbon monoxide molecule, a net negative charge \u03b4\u2212 remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small dipole moment of 0.122\u00a0D.\nThe molecule is therefore asymmetric: oxygen is more electron dense than carbon and is also slightly positively charged compared to carbon being negative. \nCarbon monoxide has a computed fractional bond order of 2.6, indicating that the \"third\" bond is important but constitutes somewhat less than a full bond. Thus, in valence bond terms, is the most important structure, while :C=O is non-octet, but has a neutral formal charge on each atom and represents the second most important resonance contributor. Because of the lone pair and divalence of carbon in this resonance structure, carbon monoxide is often considered to be an extraordinarily stabilized carbene. Isocyanides are compounds in which the O is replaced by an NR (R = alkyl or aryl) group and have a similar bonding scheme.\nIf carbon monoxide acts as a ligand, the polarity of the dipole may reverse with a net negative charge on the oxygen end, depending on the structure of the coordination complex.\nSee also the section \"Coordination chemistry\" below.\nBond polarity and oxidation state.\nTheoretical and experimental studies show that, despite the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the dipole moment points from the more-negative carbon end to the more-positive oxygen end. The three bonds are in fact polar covalent bonds that are strongly polarized. The calculated polarization toward the oxygen atom is 71% for the \u03c3-bond and 77% for both \u03c0-bonds.\nThe oxidation state of carbon in carbon monoxide is +2 in each of these structures. It is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen. Only the two non-bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon. In this count, carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom.\nOccurrence.\nCarbon monoxide occurs in many environments, usually in trace levels. Photochemical degradation of plant matter, for example, generates an estimated 60 million tons/year. Typical concentrations in parts per million are as follows:\nAtmospheric presence.\nCarbon monoxide (CO) is present in small amounts (about 80 ppb) in the Earth's atmosphere. Most comes from chemical reactions with organic compounds emitted by human activities and natural origins due to photochemical reactions in the troposphere that generate about 5 \u00d7 1012 kilograms per year. Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest and bushfires, and other miscellaneous forms of combustion such as fossil fuels. Small amounts are also emitted from the ocean, and from geological activity because carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the Earth's mantle. Because natural sources of carbon monoxide vary from year to year, it is difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.\nCarbon monoxide has an indirect effect on radiative forcing by elevating concentrations of direct greenhouse gases, including methane and tropospheric ozone. CO can react chemically with other atmospheric constituents (primarily the hydroxyl radical, \u2022OH) that would otherwise destroy methane. Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and ozone. Carbon monoxide is short-lived in the atmosphere (with an average lifetime of about one to two months), and spatially variable in concentration.\nDue to its long lifetime in the mid-troposphere, carbon monoxide is also used as a tracer for pollutant plumes.\nAstronomy.\nBeyond Earth, carbon monoxide is the second-most common diatomic molecule in the interstellar medium, after molecular hydrogen. Because of its asymmetry, this polar molecule produces far brighter spectral lines than the hydrogen molecule, making CO much easier to detect. Interstellar CO was first detected with radio telescopes in 1970. It is now the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies, as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires space telescopes. Carbon monoxide observations provide much of the information about the molecular clouds in which most stars form.\nBeta Pictoris, the second brightest star in the constellation Pictor, shows an excess of infrared emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star.\nIn the atmosphere of Venus carbon monoxide occurs as a result of the photodissociation of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 169 nm. It has also been identified spectroscopically on the surface of Neptune's moon Triton.\nSolid carbon monoxide is a component of comets. The volatile or \"ice\" component of Halley's Comet is about 15% CO. At room temperature and at atmospheric pressure, carbon monoxide is actually only metastable (see Boudouard reaction) and the same is true at low temperatures where CO and are solid, but nevertheless it can exist for billions of years in comets. There is very little CO in the atmosphere of Pluto, which seems to have been formed from comets. This may be because there is (or was) liquid water inside Pluto.\nCarbon monoxide can react with water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen:\nThis is called the water-gas shift reaction when occurring in the gas phase, but it can also take place (very slowly) in an aqueous solution.\nIf the hydrogen partial pressure is high enough (for instance in an underground sea), formic acid will be formed:\nThese reactions can take place in a few million years even at temperatures such as found on Pluto.\nPollution and health effects.\nUrban pollution.\nCarbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas, chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines (including vehicles, portable and back-up generators, lawnmowers, power washers, etc.), but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels (including wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural gas, and trash).\nLarge CO pollution events can be observed from space over cities.\nRole in ground level ozone formation.\nCarbon monoxide is, along with aldehydes, part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form photochemical smog. It reacts with hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH) to produce a radical intermediate \u2022HOCO, which rapidly transfers its radical hydrogen to to form peroxy radical (\u2022) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Peroxy radical subsequently reacts with nitrogen oxide (NO) to form nitrogen dioxide () and hydroxyl radical. gives O(3P) via photolysis, thereby forming following reaction with .\nSince hydroxyl radical is formed during the formation of , the balance of the sequence of chemical reactions starting with carbon monoxide and leading to the formation of ozone is:\nAlthough the creation of is the critical step leading to low level ozone formation, it also increases this ozone in another, somewhat mutually exclusive way, by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with ozone.\nIndoor air pollution.\nCarbon monoxide is one of the most acutely toxic indoor air contaminants. Carbon monoxide may be emitted from tobacco smoke and generated from malfunctioning fuel burning stoves (wood, kerosene, natural gas, propane) and fuel burning heating systems (wood, oil, natural gas) and from blocked flues connected to these appliances. In developed countries the main sources of indoor CO emission come from cooking and heating devices that burn fossil fuels and are faulty, incorrectly installed or poorly maintained. Appliance malfunction may be due to faulty installation or lack of maintenance and proper use. In low- and middle-income countries the most common sources of CO in homes are burning biomass fuels and cigarette smoke.\nMining.\nMiners refer to carbon monoxide as \"whitedamp\" or the \"silent killer\". It can be found in confined areas of poor ventilation in both surface mines and underground mines. The most common sources of carbon monoxide in mining operations are the internal combustion engine and explosives; however, in coal mines, carbon monoxide can also be found due to the low-temperature oxidation of coal. The idiom \"Canary in the coal mine\" pertained to an early warning of a carbon monoxide presence.\nHealth effects.\nCarbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries. Acute exposure can also lead to long-term neurological effects such as cognitive and behavioural changes. Severe CO poisoning may lead to unconsciousness, coma and death. Chronic exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide may lead to lethargy, headaches, nausea, flu-like symptoms and neuropsychological and cardiovascular issues.\nChemistry.\nCarbon monoxide has a wide range of functions across all disciplines of chemistry. The four premier categories of reactivity involve metal-carbonyl catalysis, radical chemistry, cation and anion chemistries.\nCoordination chemistry.\nMost metals form coordination complexes containing covalently attached carbon monoxide. These derivatives, which are called metal carbonyls, tend to be more robust when the metal is in lower oxidation states. For example iron pentacarbonyl () is an air-stable, distillable liquid. Nickel carbonyl is a metal carbonyl complex that forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide with the metal:\n (1 bar, 55 \u00b0C)\nThese volatile complexes are often highly toxic. Some metal\u2013CO complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents, not from CO. For instance, iridium trichloride and triphenylphosphine react in boiling 2-methoxyethanol or DMF to afford .\nAs a ligand, CO binds through carbon, forming a kind of triple bond. The lone pair on the carbon atom donates electron density to form a M-CO sigma bond. The two \u03c0* orbitals on CO bind to filled metal orbitals. The effect is related to the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model. The effects of the quasi-triple M-C bond is reflected in the infrared spectrum of these complexes. Whereas free CO vibrates at 2143\u00a0cm\u22121, its complexes tend to absorb near 1950\u00a0cm\u22121.\nOrganic and main group chemistry.\nIn the presence of strong acids, alkenes react with carboxylic acids. Hydrolysis of this species (an acylium ion) gives the carboxylic acid, a net process known as the Koch\u2013Haaf reaction. In the Gattermann\u2013Koch reaction, arenes are converted to benzaldehyde derivatives in the presence of CO, , and HCl.\nA mixture of hydrogen gas and CO reacts with alkenes to give aldehydes. The process requires the presence of metal catalysts.\nWith main group reagents, CO undergoes several noteworthy reactions. Chlorination of CO is the industrial route to the important compound phosgene. With borane CO forms the adduct , which is isoelectronic with the acylium cation . CO reacts with sodium to give products resulting from C\u2212C coupling such as sodium acetylenediolate . It reacts with molten potassium to give a mixture of an organometallic compound, potassium acetylenediolate , potassium benzenehexolate , and potassium rhodizonate .\nThe compounds cyclohexanehexone or triquinoyl () and cyclopentanepentone or leuconic acid (), which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts, can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide. At pressures exceeding 5 GPa, carbon monoxide converts to polycarbonyl, a solid polymer that is metastable at atmospheric pressure but is explosive.\nLaboratory preparation.\nCarbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the dehydration of formic acid or oxalic acid, for example with concentrated sulfuric acid. Another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered zinc metal and calcium carbonate, which releases CO and leaves behind zinc oxide and calcium oxide:\nSilver nitrate and iodoform also afford carbon monoxide:\nFinally, metal oxalate salts release CO upon heating, leaving a carbonate as byproduct:\nProduction.\nThermal combustion is the most common source for carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of carbon-containing compounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide (CO2), such as when operating a stove or an internal combustion engine in an enclosed space.\nA large quantity of CO byproduct is formed during the oxidative processes for the production of chemicals. For this reason, the process off-gases have to be purified.\nMany methods have been developed for carbon monoxide production.\nIndustrial production.\nA major industrial source of CO is producer gas, a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen, formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon. In an oven, air is passed through a bed of coke. The initially produced CO2 equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO. The reaction of CO2 with carbon to give CO is described as the Boudouard reaction. Above 800\u00a0\u00b0C, CO is the predominant product:\n (\u0394\"H\"r = 170 kJ/mol)\nAnother source is \"water gas\", a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of steam and carbon:\n (\u0394\"H\"r = 131 kJ/mol)\nOther similar \"synthesis gases\" can be obtained from natural gas and other fuels.\nCarbon monoxide can also be produced by high-temperature electrolysis of carbon dioxide with solid oxide electrolyzer cells. One method developed at DTU Energy uses a cerium oxide catalyst and does not have any issues of fouling of the catalyst.\nCarbon monoxide is also a byproduct of the reduction of metal oxide ores with carbon, shown in a simplified form as follows:\nMO + C \u2192 M + CO\nCarbon monoxide is also produced by the direct oxidation of carbon in a limited supply of oxygen or air.\nSince CO is a gas, the reduction process can be driven by heating, exploiting the positive (favorable) entropy of reaction. The Ellingham diagram shows that CO formation is favored over CO2 in high temperatures.\nUse.\nChemical industry.\nCarbon monoxide is an industrial gas that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing. Large quantities of aldehydes are produced by the hydroformylation reaction of alkenes, carbon monoxide, and . Hydroformylation is coupled to the Shell higher olefin process to give precursors to detergents.\nPhosgene, useful for preparing isocyanates, polycarbonates, and polyurethanes, is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and chlorine gas through a bed of porous activated carbon, which serves as a catalyst. World production of this compound was estimated to be 2.74 million tonnes in 1989.\nMethanol is produced by the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide. In a related reaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C\u2212C bond formation, as in the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This technology allows coal or biomass to be converted to diesel.\nIn the Cativa process, carbon monoxide and methanol react in the presence of a homogeneous iridium catalyst and hydroiodic acid to give acetic acid. This process is responsible for most of the industrial production of acetic acid.\nMetallurgy.\nCarbon monoxide is a strong reductive agent and has been used in pyrometallurgy to reduce metals from ores since ancient times. Carbon monoxide strips oxygen off metal oxides, reducing them to pure metal in high temperatures, forming carbon dioxide in the process. Carbon monoxide is not usually supplied as is, in the gaseous phase, in the reactor, but rather it is formed in high temperature in presence of oxygen-carrying ore, or a carboniferous agent such as coke, and high temperature. The blast furnace process is a typical example of a process of reduction of metal from ore with carbon monoxide.\nLikewise, blast furnace gas collected at the top of blast furnace, still contains some 10% to 30% of carbon monoxide, and is used as fuel on Cowper stoves and on Siemens-Martin furnaces on open hearth steelmaking.\nProposed use as a rocket fuel.\nCarbon monoxide has been proposed for use as a fuel on Mars by NASA researcher Geoffrey Landis. Carbon monoxide/oxygen engines have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the carbon dioxide atmosphere of Mars by zirconia electrolysis, without using any Martian water resources to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen-based fuel.\nLandis also proposed manufacturing the fuel from the similar carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus for a sample return mission, in combination with solar-powered UAVs and rocket balloon ascent.\nElectrochemistry.\nCarbon monoxide is used in electrochemistry to study the structure of electrodes thanks to its strong affinity to some metals used as electrocatalysts, through a technique known as CO stripping.\nBiological and physiological properties.\nPhysiology.\nCarbon monoxide is a bioactive molecule which acts as a gaseous signaling molecule. It is naturally produced by many enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways, the best understood of which is the catabolic action of heme oxygenase on the heme derived from hemoproteins such as hemoglobin. Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993, carbon monoxide has received significant clinical attention as a biological regulator.\nBecause of carbon monoxide's role in the body, abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerations, hypertension, heart failure, and pathological inflammation. In many tissues, carbon monoxide acts as anti-inflammatory, vasodilatory, and encouragers of neovascular growth. In animal model studies, carbon monoxide reduced the severity of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis, pancreatitis, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, colitis, osteoarthritis, lung injury, lung transplantation rejection, and neuropathic pain while promoting skin wound healing. Therefore, there is significant interest in the therapeutic potential of carbon monoxide becoming pharmaceutical agent and clinical standard of care.\nMedicine.\nStudies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have the potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Many pharmaceutical drug delivery initiatives have developed methods to safely administer carbon monoxide, and subsequent controlled clinical trials have evaluated the therapeutic effect of carbon monoxide.\nMicrobiology.\nMicrobiota may also utilize carbon monoxide as a gasotransmitter. Carbon monoxide sensing is a signaling pathway facilitated by proteins such as CooA. The scope of the biological roles for carbon monoxide sensing is still unknown.\nThe human microbiome produces, consumes, and responds to carbon monoxide. For example, in certain bacteria, carbon monoxide is produced via the reduction of carbon dioxide by the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase with favorable bioenergetics to power downstream cellular operations. In another example, carbon monoxide is a nutrient for methanogenic archaea which reduce it to methane using hydrogen.\nCarbon monoxide has certain antimicrobial properties which have been studied to treat against infectious diseases.\nFood science.\nCarbon monoxide is used in modified atmosphere packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The benefit is two-fold: carbon monoxide protects against microbial spoilage and it enhances the meat color for consumer appeal. The carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment metmyoglobin. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat. Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% and 0.5%.\nThe technology was first given \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS) status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2002 for use as a secondary packaging system, and does not require labeling. In 2004, the FDA approved CO as primary packaging method, declaring that CO does not mask spoilage odor. The process is currently unauthorized in many other countries, including Japan, Singapore, and the European Union.\nWeaponization.\nIn ancient history, Hannibal executed Roman prisoners with coal fumes during the Second Punic War.\nCarbon monoxide had been used for genocide during the Holocaust at some extermination camps, the most notable by gas vans in Che\u0142mno, and in the Action T4 \"euthanasia\" program.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nHumans have maintained a complex relationship with carbon monoxide since first learning to control fire circa 800,000 BC. Early humans probably discovered the toxicity of carbon monoxide poisoning upon introducing fire into their dwellings. The early development of metallurgy and smelting technologies emerging circa 6,000 BC through the Bronze Age likewise plagued humankind from carbon monoxide exposure. Apart from the toxicity of carbon monoxide, indigenous Native Americans may have experienced the neuroactive properties of carbon monoxide through shamanistic fireside rituals.\nAncient history.\nEarly civilizations developed mythological tales to explain the origin of fire, such as Prometheus from Greek mythology who shared fire with humans. Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes. Greek physician Galen (129\u2013199 AD) speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled, and many others of the era developed a basis of knowledge about carbon monoxide in the context of coal fume toxicity. Cleopatra may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning.\nPre\u2013industrial revolution.\nGeorg Ernst Stahl mentioned \"carbonarii halitus\" in 1697 in reference to toxic vapors thought to be carbon monoxide. Friedrich Hoffmann conducted the first modern scientific investigation into carbon monoxide poisoning from coal in 1716. Herman Boerhaave conducted the first scientific experiments on the effect of carbon monoxide (coal fumes) on animals in the 1730s.\nJoseph Priestley is considered to have first synthesized carbon monoxide in 1772. Carl Wilhelm Scheele similarly isolated carbon monoxide from charcoal in 1773 and thought it could be the carbonic entity making fumes toxic. Torbern Bergman isolated carbon monoxide from oxalic acid in 1775. Later in 1776, the French chemist de Lassone produced CO by heating zinc oxide with coke, but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was hydrogen, as it burned with a blue flame. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide. Antoine Lavoisier conducted similar inconclusive experiments to Lassone in 1777. The gas was identified as a compound containing carbon and oxygen by William Cruickshank in 1800.\nThomas Beddoes and James Watt recognized carbon monoxide (as hydrocarbonate) to brighten venous blood in 1793. Watt suggested coal fumes could act as an antidote to the oxygen in blood, and Beddoes and Watt likewise suggested hydrocarbonate has a greater affinity for animal fiber than oxygen in 1796. In 1854, Adrien Chenot similarly suggested carbon monoxide to remove the oxygen from blood and then be oxidized by the body to carbon dioxide. The mechanism for carbon monoxide poisoning is widely credited to Claude Bernard whose memoirs beginning in 1846 and published in 1857 phrased, \"prevents arterials blood from becoming venous\". Felix Hoppe-Seyler independently published similar conclusions in the following year.\nAdvent of industrial chemistry.\nCarbon monoxide gained recognition as an essential reagent in the 1900s. Three industrial processes illustrate its evolution in industry. In the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process, coal and related carbon-rich feedstocks are converted into liquid fuels via the intermediacy of CO. Originally developed as part of the German war effort to compensate for their lack of domestic petroleum, this technology continues today. Also in Germany, a mixture of CO and hydrogen was found to combine with olefins to give aldehydes. This process, called hydroformylation, is used to produce many large scale chemicals such as surfactants as well as specialty compounds that are popular fragrances and drugs. For example, CO is used in the production of vitamin A. In a third major process, attributed to researchers at Monsanto, CO combines with methanol to give acetic acid. Most acetic acid is produced by the Cativa process. Hydroformylation and the acetic acid syntheses are two of myriad carbonylation processes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6138", "revid": "6727347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6138", "title": "Conjecture", "text": "Proposition in mathematics that is unproven\nIn mathematics, a conjecture is a proposition that is proffered on a tentative basis without proof. Some conjectures, such as the Riemann hypothesis or Fermat's conjecture (now a theorem, proven in 1995 by Andrew Wiles), have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them.\nResolution of conjectures.\nProof.\nFormal mathematics is based on \"provable\" truth. In mathematics, any number of cases supporting a universally quantified conjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a single counterexample could immediately bring down the conjecture. Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended the search for a counterexample farther than previously done. For instance, the Collatz conjecture, which concerns whether or not certain sequences of integers terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 \u00d7 1012 (1.2 trillion). However, the failure to find a counterexample after extensive search does not constitute a proof that the conjecture is true\u2014because the conjecture might be false but with a very large minimal counterexample.\nNevertheless, mathematicians often regard a conjecture as strongly supported by evidence even though not yet proved. That evidence may be of various kinds, such as verification of consequences of it or strong interconnections with known results.\nA conjecture is considered proven only when it has been shown that it is logically impossible for it to be false. There are various methods of doing so; see methods of mathematical proof for more details.\nOne method of proof, applicable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as \"brute force\": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples. In some occasions, the number of cases is quite large, in which case a brute-force proof may require as a practical matter the use of a computer algorithm to check all the cases. For example, the validity of the 1976 and 1997 brute-force proofs of the four color theorem by computer was initially doubted, but was eventually confirmed in 2005 by theorem-proving software.\nWhen a conjecture has been proven, it is no longer a conjecture but a theorem. Many important theorems were once conjectures, such as the Geometrization theorem (which resolved the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture), Fermat's Last Theorem, and others.\nDisproof.\nConjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to as \"false conjectures\" (cf. the P\u00f3lya conjecture and Euler's sum of powers conjecture). In the case of the latter, the first counterexample found for the n=4 case involved numbers in the millions, although it has been subsequently found that the minimal counterexample is actually smaller.\nIndependent conjectures.\nNot every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. The continuum hypothesis, which tries to ascertain the relative cardinality of certain infinite sets, was eventually shown to be independent from the generally accepted set of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms of set theory. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new axiom in a consistent manner (much as Euclid's parallel postulate can be taken either as true or false in an axiomatic system for geometry).\nIn this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof that \"does not\" require the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements in Euclidean geometry be proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. without the parallel postulate). The one major exception to this in practice is the axiom of choice, as the majority of researchers usually do not worry whether a result requires it\u2014unless they are studying this axiom in particular.\nConditional proofs.\nSometimes, a conjecture is called a \"hypothesis\" when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture from number theory that \u2014 amongst other things \u2014 makes predictions about the distribution of prime numbers. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In fact, in anticipation of its eventual proof, some have even proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are called \"conditional proofs\": the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.\nThese \"proofs\", however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.\nImportant examples.\nFermat's Last Theorem.\nIn number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers formula_1, \"formula_2\", and \"formula_3\" can satisfy the equation \"formula_4\" for any integer value of \"formula_5\" greater than two.\nThis theorem was first conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 in the margin of a copy of \"Arithmetica\", where he claimed that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. The first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of algebraic number theory in the 19th century, and the proof of the modularity theorem in the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in the history of mathematics, and prior to its proof it was in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" for \"most difficult mathematical problems\".\nFour color theorem.\nIn mathematics, the four color theorem, or the four color map theorem, states that given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, producing a figure called a \"map\", no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map\u2014so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are called \"adjacent\" if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions. For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a point that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.\nM\u00f6bius mentioned the problem in his lectures as early as 1840. The conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852 when Francis Guthrie, while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. The five color theorem, which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century; however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs and false counterexamples have appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852.\nThe four color theorem was ultimately proven in 1976 by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. It was the first major theorem to be proved using a computer. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem (i.e., if they did appear, one could make a smaller counter-example). Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this with hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexample exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by mathematicians at all because the computer-assisted proof was infeasible for a human to check by hand. However, the proof has since then gained wider acceptance, although doubts still remain.\nHauptvermutung.\nThe Hauptvermutung (German for main conjecture) of geometric topology is the conjecture that any two triangulations of a triangulable space have a common refinement, a single triangulation that is a subdivision of both of them. It was originally formulated in 1908, by Steinitz and Tietze.\nThis conjecture is now known to be false. The non-manifold version was disproved by John Milnor in 1961 using Reidemeister torsion.\nThe manifold version is true in dimensions \"m\" \u2264 3. The cases \"m\" = 2 and 3 were proved by Tibor Rad\u00f3 and Edwin E. Moise in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively.\nWeil conjectures.\nIn mathematics, the Weil conjectures were some highly influential proposals by Andr\u00e9 Weil\u00a0(1949) on the generating functions (known as local zeta-functions) derived from counting the number of points on algebraic varieties over finite fields.\nA variety \"V\" over a finite field with \"q\" elements has a finite number of rational points, as well as points over every finite field with \"q\"\"k\" elements containing that field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers \"N\"\"k\" of points over the (essentially unique) field with \"q\"\"k\" elements.\nWeil conjectured that such \"zeta-functions\" should be rational functions, should satisfy a form of functional equation, and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the Riemann zeta function and Riemann hypothesis. The rationality was proved by , the functional equation by , and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by .\nPoincar\u00e9 conjecture.\nIn mathematics, the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture is a theorem about the characterization of the 3-sphere, which is the hypersphere that bounds the unit ball in four-dimensional space. The conjecture states that: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism called homotopy equivalence: if a 3-manifold is \"homotopy equivalent\" to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily \"homeomorphic\" to it.\nOriginally conjectured by Henri Poincar\u00e9 in 1904, the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a closed 3-manifold). The Poincar\u00e9 conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each loop in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere. An analogous result has been known in higher dimensions for some time.\nAfter nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, Grigori Perelman presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on arXiv. The proof followed on from the program of Richard S. Hamilton to use the Ricci flow to attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called \"Ricci flow with surgery\" to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method \"converged\" in three dimensions. Perelman completed this portion of the proof. Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman's proof is correct.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, before being proven, was one of the most important open questions in topology.\nRiemann hypothesis.\nIn mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis, proposed by Bernhard Riemann\u00a0(1859), is a conjecture that the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function all have real part 1/2. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.\nThe Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution of prime numbers. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem in pure mathematics. The Riemann hypothesis, along with the Goldbach conjecture, is part of Hilbert's eighth problem in David Hilbert's list of 23 unsolved problems; it is also one of the Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problems.\nP versus NP problem.\nThe P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no. It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written by Kurt G\u00f6del to John von Neumann. G\u00f6del asked whether a certain NP-complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time. The precise statement of the P=NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook in his seminal paper \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\" and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.\nIn other sciences.\nKarl Popper pioneered the use of the term \"conjecture\" in scientific philosophy. Conjecture is related to hypothesis, which in science refers to a testable conjecture.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, Claudius was born to Drusus and Antonia Minor at Lugdunum in Roman Gaul, where his father was stationed as a military legate. He was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy.\nAs he had a limp, a stammer, and a tremor due to an illness he suffered when young, he was ostracized by his family and was excluded from public office until his consulship (which was shared with his nephew, Caligula, in 37). Claudius's infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges throughout the reigns of Tiberius and Caligula, as potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to him being declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last adult male of his family.\nDespite his lack of experience, Claudius was an able and efficient administrator. He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen, and helped restore the empire's finances after the excesses of Caligula's reign. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign, the Empire started its successful conquest of Britain. Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued edicts daily. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position, which resulted in the deaths of many senators. Those events damaged his reputation among the ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised that opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife, Agrippina the Younger. After his death at the age of 63, his grandnephew and legally adopted step-son, Nero, succeeded him as emperor.\nName.\nAs a consequence of Roman customs, society, and personal preference, Claudius's full name varied throughout his life:\nFamily and youth.\nEarly life.\nClaudius was born on 1 August 10\u00a0BC at Lugdunum (modern Lyon, France). He had two older siblings, Germanicus and Livilla. His mother, Antonia Minor, may have had two other children who died young. Claudius's maternal grandparents were Mark Antony and Octavia Minor, Augustus's sister, and he was therefore the great-great-grandnephew of Gaius Julius Caesar. His paternal grandparents were Livia, Augustus's third wife, and Tiberius Claudius Nero. During his reign, Claudius revived the rumour that his father Nero Claudius Drusus was actually the illegitimate son of Augustus, to give the appearance that Augustus was Claudius's paternal grandfather.\nIn 9\u00a0BC, Claudius's father Drusus died on campaign in Germania from a fall from a horse. Claudius was then raised by his mother, who never remarried. When his disability became evident, the relationship with his family turned sour. Antonia referred to him as a monster, and used him as a standard for stupidity. She seems to have passed her son off to his grandmother Livia for a number of years.\nLivia was a little kinder, but nevertheless sent Claudius short, angry letters of reproof. He was put under the care of a former mule-driver to keep him disciplined, under the logic that his condition was due to laziness and a lack of willpower. However, by the time he reached his teenage years, his symptoms apparently waned and his family began to take some notice of his scholarly interests. In AD\u00a07, Livy was hired to tutor Claudius in history, with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus. He spent a lot of his time with the latter, as well as the philosopher Athenodorus. Augustus, according to a letter, was surprised at the clarity of Claudius's oratory.\nPublic life.\nClaudius's work as a historian damaged his prospects for advancement in public life. According to Vincent Scramuzza and others, he began work on a history of the Civil Wars that was either too truthful or too critical of Octavian, then reigning as Caesar Augustus. In either case, it was far too early for such an account, and may have only served to remind Augustus that Claudius was Antony's descendant. His mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it, and this may have convinced them that Claudius was not fit for public office, since he could not be trusted to toe the existing party line.\nWhen Claudius returned to the narrative later in life, he skipped over the wars of the Second Triumvirate altogether; but the damage was done, and his family pushed him into the background. When the Arch of Pavia was erected to honour the Imperial clan in AD 8, Claudius's name (now Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus after his elevation to \"pater familias\" of the Claudii Nerones on the adoption of his brother) was inscribed on the edge, past the deceased princes, Gaius and Lucius, and Germanicus's children. There is some speculation that the inscription was added by Claudius himself decades later, and that he originally did not appear at all.\nWhen Augustus died in AD\u00a014, Claudius \u2013 then aged 23 \u2013 appealed to his uncle Tiberius to allow him to begin the \"cursus honorum\". Tiberius, the new Emperor, responded by granting Claudius consular ornaments. Claudius requested office once more and was snubbed. Since the new emperor was no more generous than the old, Claudius gave up hope of public office and retired to a scholarly, private life.\nDespite the disdain of the Imperial family, it seems that from very early on the general public respected Claudius. At Augustus's death, the \"equites\", or knights, chose Claudius to head their delegation. When his house burned down, the Senate demanded it be rebuilt at public expense. They also requested that Claudius be allowed to debate in the Senate. Tiberius turned down both motions, but the sentiment remained.\nDuring the period immediately after the death of Tiberius's son, Drusus, Claudius was pushed by some quarters as a potential heir to the throne. This again suggests the political nature of his exclusion from public life. However, as this was also the period during which the power and terror of the commander of the Praetorian Guard, Sejanus, was at its peak, Claudius chose to downplay this possibility. After the death of Tiberius, the new emperor Caligula (the son of Claudius's brother Germanicus) recognized Claudius to be of some use. He appointed Claudius his co-consul in 37 to emphasize the memory of Caligula's deceased father Germanicus.\nDespite this, Caligula tormented his uncle: playing practical jokes, charging him enormous sums of money, humiliating him before the Senate, and the like. According to Cassius Dio, Claudius became sickly and thin by the end of Caligula's reign, most likely due to stress. A possible surviving portrait of Claudius from this period may support this.\nAssassination of Caligula and Declaration of Claudius as Emperor (AD\u00a041).\nOn 24 January 41, Caligula was assassinated in a conspiracy involving Cassius Chaerea \u2013 a military tribune in the Praetorian Guard \u2013 and several senators. There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the assassination, although it has been argued that he knew about the plot \u2013 particularly since he left the scene of the crime shortly before his nephew was murdered. However, after the deaths of Caligula's wife and daughter, it became apparent that Cassius intended to go beyond the terms of the conspiracy and wipe out the Imperial family.\nIn the chaos following the murder, Claudius witnessed the German guard cut down several uninvolved noblemen, including many of his friends. He fled to the palace to hide. According to tradition, a Praetorian named Gratus found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly proclaimed him \"princeps\". Claudius was spirited away to the Praetorian camp and put under their protection.\nThe Senate met and debated a change of government, but this devolved into an argument over which of them would be the new \"princeps\". When they heard of the Praetorians' claim, they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval, but he refused, sensing the danger that would come with complying. Some historians, particularly Josephus, claim that Claudius was directed in his actions by the Judaean King Herod Agrippa. However, an earlier version of events by the same ancient author downplays Agrippa's role so it remains uncertain. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in. In return, Claudius granted a general amnesty, although he executed a few junior officers involved in the conspiracy. The actual assassins, including Cassius Chaerea and Julius Lupus, the murderer of Caligula's wife and daughter, were put to death to ensure Claudius's own safety and as a future deterrent.\nSince Claudius was the first emperor proclaimed on the initiative of the Praetorian Guard instead of the Senate, his repute suffered at the hands of commentators (such as Seneca). Moreover, they accused him of being the first emperor to resort to bribery as a means to secure army loyalty and rewarded the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard that had elevated him with 15,000 sesterces, although Tiberius and Augustus had both left gifts to the army and guard in their wills and upon Caligula's death the same would have been expected, even if no will existed. Claudius remained grateful to the guard, issuing coins with tributes to the Praetorians in the early part of his reign.\nEmperor.\nClaudius took several steps to legitimize his rule against potential usurpers, most of them emphasizing his place within the Julio-Claudian family. He adopted the name \"Caesar\" as a cognomen, as the name still carried great weight with the populace. To do so, he dropped the cognomen \"Nero\", which he had adopted as \"pater familias\" of the Claudii Nerones when his brother Germanicus was adopted. As Pharaoh of Egypt, Claudius adopted the royal titulary \"Tiberios Klaudios, Autokrator Heqaheqau Meryasetptah, Kanakht Djediakhshuemakhet\" (\"Tiberius Claudius, Emperor and ruler of rulers, beloved of Isis and Ptah, the strong bull of the stable moon on the horizon\").\nWhile Claudius had never been formally adopted either by Augustus or his successors, he was nevertheless the grandson of Augustus's sister Octavia, and so he felt that he had the right of family. He also adopted the name \"Augustus\" as the two previous emperors had done at their accessions. He kept the honorific \"Germanicus\" to display the connection with his heroic brother. He deified his paternal grandmother Livia to highlight her position as wife of the divine Augustus. Claudius frequently used the term \"filius Drusi\" (son of Drusus) in his titles, to remind the people of his legendary father and lay claim to his reputation.\nPliny the Elder noted, according to the 1938 Loeb Classical Library translation by Harris Rackham, \"...\u00a0many people do not allow any gems in a signet-ring, and seal with the gold itself; this was a fashion invented when Claudius C\u00e6sar was emperor.\"\nSenate.\nBecause of the circumstances of his accession, Claudius took great pains to please the Senate. During regular sessions, the Emperor sat among the Senate body, speaking in turn. When introducing a law, he sat on a bench between the consuls in his position as holder of the power of Tribune, (the Emperor could not officially serve as a Tribune of the Plebes since he was a patrician, but this was a power taken by previous rulers, which he continued). He refused to accept all his predecessors' titles (including Imperator) at the beginning of his reign, preferring to earn them in due course. He allowed the Senate to issue its own bronze coinage for the first time since Augustus. He also restored the peaceful Imperial provinces of Macedonia and Achaea as senatorial provinces.\nClaudius set about remodeling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as noted in the fragments of a surviving speech:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If you accept these proposals, Conscript Fathers, say so at once and simply, in accordance with your convictions. If you do not accept them, find alternatives, but do so here and now; or if you wish to take time for consideration, take it, provided you do not forget that you must be ready to pronounce your opinion whenever you may be summoned to meet. It ill befits the dignity of the Senate that the consul designate should repeat the phrases of the consuls word for word as his opinion, and that every one else should merely say 'I approve', and that then, after leaving, the assembly should announce 'We debated'.\nIn 47, he assumed the office of \"censor\" with Lucius Vitellius, which had been allowed to lapse for some time. He struck out the names of many senators and \"equites\" who no longer met qualifications, but showed respect by allowing them to resign in advance. At the same time, he sought to admit to the senate eligible men from the provinces. The Lyon Tablet preserves his speech on the admittance of Gallic senators, in which he addresses the Senate with reverence but also with criticism for their disdain of these men. He even joked about how the Senate had admitted members from beyond Gallia Narbonensis (Lyon), i.e. himself. He also increased the number of patricians by adding new families to the dwindling number of noble lines. Here he followed the precedent of Lucius Junius Brutus and Julius Caesar.\nNevertheless, many in the Senate remained hostile to Claudius, and many plots were made on his life. This hostility carried over into the historical accounts. As a result, Claudius reduced the Senate's power for the sake of efficiency. The administration of Ostia was turned over to an Imperial procurator after construction of the port. Administration of many of the empire's financial concerns was turned over to Imperial appointees and freedmen. This led to further resentment and suggestions that these same freedmen were ruling the Emperor.\nSecretariat and centralization of powers.\nClaudius was hardly the first emperor to use freedmen to help with the day-to-day running of the Empire. He has however become famous for the new extents at which he made use of such men in the administration of the government, forced by the centralization of the powers of the \"princeps\" and not wanting free-born magistrates to serve under him as if they were not peers.\nThe secretariat was divided into bureaus, with each being placed under the leadership of one freedman. Narcissus was the secretary of correspondence. Pallas became the secretary of the treasury. Callistus became secretary of justice. There was a fourth bureau for miscellaneous issues, which was put under Polybius until his execution for treason. The freedmen could also officially speak for the Emperor, as when Narcissus addressed the troops in Claudius's stead before the conquest of Britain.\nSince these were important positions, the senators were aghast at their being placed in the hands of former slaves and \"well-known eunuchs\". If freedmen had total control of money, letters and law, it seemed it would not be hard for them to manipulate the Emperor. This is exactly the accusation put forth by ancient sources. However, these same sources admit that the freedmen were loyal to Claudius.\nHe had shown himself to be similarly appreciative of their help, giving them due credit for policies which they advised; but punished them with just force if they showed treacherous inclinations, as was the case of Polybius and Pallas's brother, Felix. There is no evidence that the character of Claudius's policies and edicts changed with the rise and fall of the various freedmen, suggesting that he was firmly in control throughout.\nRegardless of the extent of their political power, the freedmen did manage to amass wealth through their positions. Pliny the Elder describes several of them as being richer than Crassus, the richest man of the Republican era.\nExpansion of the Empire.\nClaudius conducted a census in 48 that found 5,984,072 (adult male) Roman citizens (women, children, slaves, and free adult males without Roman citizenship were not counted), an increase of around a million since the census conducted at Augustus's death. He had helped increase this number through the foundation of Roman colonies that were granted blanket citizenship. These colonies were often made out of existing communities, especially those with elites who could rally the populace to the Roman cause. Several colonies were placed in new provinces or on the border of the Empire to secure Roman holdings as quickly as possible.\nAdditionally under Claudius, the Empire underwent its first major territorial expansion since the reign of Augustus. The provinces of Thrace, Noricum, Lycia, and Judea were annexed (or put under direct rule) under various circumstances during his term. The annexation of Mauretania, begun under Caligula, was completed after the defeat of rebel forces, as well as the official division of the former client kingdom into two Imperial provinces.\nThe British Campaign.\nThe most far-reaching conquest however was that of Britannia: In 43, Claudius sent Aulus Plautius with four legions to Britain (\"Britannia\") after an appeal from an ousted tribal ally. Britain was an attractive target for Rome because of its mines and the potential of slave labor, as well as being a haven for Gallic rebels. Claudius himself traveled to the island after the completion of initial offensives, bringing with him reinforcements. Although it has been claimed that Claudius brought elephants with him to Britain, this claim has been doubted. The Roman \"colonia\" of \"Colonia Claudia Victricensis\" was established as the provincial capital of the newly established province of Britannia at Camulodunum, where a large temple was dedicated in his honour.\nHe left Britain after 16 days, but remained in the provinces for some time. The Senate granted him a triumph for his efforts. Only members of the Imperial family were allowed such honours, but Claudius subsequently lifted this restriction for some of his conquering generals. He was granted the honorific \"Britannicus\" but only accepted it on behalf of his son, never using the title himself. When the British general Caractacus was captured in 50, Claudius granted him clemency. Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state, an unusual end for an enemy commander.\nPublic works.\nClaudius embarked on many public works throughout his reign, both in the capital and in the provinces. He built or finished two aqueducts, the Aqua Claudia, begun by Caligula, and the Aqua Anio Novus. These entered the city in 52 and met at the Porta Maggiore. He also restored a third, the Aqua Virgo.\nHe paid special attention to transportation. Throughout Italy and the provinces he built roads and canals. Among these was a large canal leading from the Rhine to the sea, as well as a road from Italy to Germany \u2013 both begun by his father, Drusus. Closer to Rome, he built a navigable canal on the Tiber, leading to Portus, his new port just north of Ostia. This port was constructed in a semicircle with two moles and a lighthouse at its mouth, reducing flooding in Rome.\nThe port at Ostia was part of Claudius's solution to the constant grain shortages that occurred in winter, after the Roman shipping season. The other part of his solution was to insure the ships of grain merchants who were willing to risk travelling to Egypt in the off-season. He also granted their sailors special privileges, including citizenship and exemption from the Lex Papia Poppaea, a law that regulated marriage. In addition, he repealed the taxes that Caligula had instituted on food, and further reduced taxes on communities suffering drought or famine.\nThe last part of Claudius's plan to avoid famine was to increase the amount of arable land in Italy. This was to be achieved by draining the Fucine lake, also making the nearby river navigable year-round. A serious famine is mentioned in the book of Acts as taking place during Claudius's reign, and had been prophesied by a Christian called Agabus while visiting Antioch.\nA tunnel was dug through the lake bed, but the plan was a failure. The tunnel was crooked and not large enough to carry the water, which caused it to back up when opened. The resultant flood washed out a large gladiatorial exhibition held to commemorate the opening, causing Claudius to run for his life along with the other spectators. The draining of the lake continued to present a problem well into the Middle Ages. It was finally achieved by the Prince Torlonia in the 19th century, producing over of new arable land; he expanded the Claudian tunnel to three times its original size.\nReligious reforms.\nClaudius, as the author of a treatise on Augustus's religious reforms, thought himself to be in a good position to institute some of his own. He had strong opinions about the proper form for state religion. He refused the request of Alexandrian Greeks to dedicate a temple to his divinity, saying that only gods may choose new gods; he restored lost days to festivals and got rid of many extraneous celebrations added by Caligula. He also re-established old observances and archaic language.\nClaudius was concerned with the spread of eastern mysteries within the city and searched for more Roman replacements. He emphasized the Eleusinian Mysteries, which had been practiced by so many during the Republic. He expelled foreign astrologers, and at the same time rehabilitated the old Roman soothsayers (known as haruspices) as a replacement. He was especially hard on Druidism, because of its incompatibility with the Roman state religion and its proselytizing activities.\nJudicial and legislative affairs.\nClaudius personally judged many of the legal cases tried during his reign. Ancient historians have many complaints about this, stating that his judgments were variable and sometimes did not follow the law. He was also easily swayed. Nevertheless, Claudius paid detailed attention to the operation of the judicial system. He extended the summer court session, as well as the winter term, by shortening the traditional breaks. Claudius also made a law requiring plaintiffs to remain in the city while their cases were pending, as defendants had previously been required to do. These measures had the effect of clearing out the docket. The minimum age for jurors was also raised to 25 to ensure a more experienced jury pool.\nClaudius also settled disputes in the provinces. He freed the island of Rhodes from Roman rule for their good faith and exempted Ilium (Troy) from taxes. Early in his reign, the Greeks and Jews of Alexandria each sent him embassies after riots broke out between the two communities. This resulted in the famous \"Letter to the Alexandrians\", which reaffirmed Jewish rights in the city but forbade them to move in more families en masse. According to Josephus, he then reaffirmed the rights and freedoms of all the Jews in the Empire. However, Claudius also expelled Jews from the city of Rome, following disturbances allegedly instigated by Christians. This expulsion is attested to in Acts of the Apostles (), and by Roman historians Suetonius and Cassius Dio along with the fifth-century Christian author Paulus Orosius.\nOne of Claudius's investigators discovered that many old Roman citizens based in the city of Tridentum (modern Trento) were not in fact citizens. The Emperor issued a declaration, contained in the \"Tabula clesiana\", that they would be allowed to hold citizenship from then on, since to strip them of their status would cause major problems. However, in individual cases, Claudius punished the false assumption of citizenship harshly, making it a capital offense. Similarly, any freedmen found to be laying false claim to membership of the Roman equestrian order were to have their property confiscated and selling into slavery, in the words of Suetonius, \"such as were ungrateful and a cause of complaint to their patrons\".\nNumerous edicts were issued throughout Claudius's reign. These were on a number of topics, everything from medical advice to moral judgments. A famous medical example is one promoting yew juice as a cure for snakebite. Suetonius wrote that he is even said to have thought of an edict allowing public flatulence for good health. One of the more famous edicts concerned the status of sick slaves. Masters had been abandoning ailing slaves at the temple of Aesculapius on Tiber Island to die instead of providing them with medical assistance and care, and then reclaiming them if they lived. Claudius ruled that slaves who were thus abandoned and recovered after such treatment would be free. Furthermore, masters who chose to kill slaves rather than take care of them were liable to be charged with murder.\nPublic games and entertainments.\nAccording to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters. Claudius also presided over many new and original events. Soon after coming into power he instituted games to be held in honor of his father on the latter's birthday; annual games were also held in honor of his accession, and took place at the Praetorian camp where Claudius had first been proclaimed Emperor.\nClaudius organized a performance of the Secular Games, marking the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Augustus had performed the same games less than a century prior. Augustus's excuse was that the interval for the games was 110 years, not 100, but his date actually did not qualify under either reasoning. Claudius also presented staged naval battles to mark the attempted draining of the Fucine Lake, as well as many other public games and shows.\nAt Ostia, in front of a crowd of spectators, Claudius fought an orca which was trapped in the harbour. The event was witnessed by Pliny the Elder:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A killer whale was actually seen in the harbour of Ostia in battle with the Emperor Claudius; it had come at the time when he was engaged in completing the structure of the harbour, being tempted by the wreck of a cargo of hides imported from Gaul, and in glutting itself for a number of days had furrowed a hollow in the shallow bottom and had been banked up with sand by the waves so high that it was quite unable to turn round, and while it was pursuing its food which was driven forward to the shore by the waves its back projected far above the water like a capsized boat. Caesar gave orders for a barrier of nets to be stretched between the mouths of the harbour and setting out in person with the praetorian cohorts afforded a show to the Roman public, the soldiery hurling lances from the vessels against the creatures when they leapt up alongside, and we saw one of the boats sunk from being filled with water owing to a beast's snorting.\nClaudius also restored and adorned many public venues in Rome. At the Circus Maximus, the turning posts and starting stalls were replaced in marble and embellished, and an embankment was probably added to prevent flooding of the track. Claudius also reinforced or extended the seating rules that reserved front seating at the Circus for senators. He rebuilt Pompey's Theatre after it had been destroyed by fire, organising special fights at the re-dedication, which he observed from a special platform in the orchestra box.\nPlots and coup attempts.\nSeveral coup attempts were made during Claudius's reign, resulting in the deaths of many senators. Appius Silanus was executed early in Claudius's reign under questionable circumstances. Shortly after this, a large rebellion was undertaken by the Senator Vinicianus and Scribonianus - governor of Dalmatia - and gained quite a few senatorial supporters. It ultimately failed because of the reluctance of Scribonianus' troops, which led to the suicide of the main conspirators.\nMany other senators tried different conspiracies and were condemned. Claudius's son-in-law Pompeius Magnus was executed for his part in a conspiracy with his father Crassus Frugi. Another plot involved the consulars Lusius Saturninus, Cornelius Lupus, and Pompeius Pedo.\nIn 46, Asinius Gallus, grandson of Asinius Pollio, and Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus were exiled for a plot hatched with several of Claudius's own freedmen. Valerius Asiaticus was executed without public trial for unknown reasons. Ancient sources say the charge was adultery, and that Claudius was tricked into issuing the punishment. However, Claudius singles out Asiaticus for special damnation in his speech on the Gauls, which dates over a year later, suggesting that the charge must have been much more serious.\nAsiaticus had been a claimant to the throne in the chaos following Caligula's death and a co-consul with Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus. Most of these conspiracies took place before Claudius's term as Censor, and may have induced him to review the Senatorial rolls. The conspiracy of Gaius Silius in the year after his Censorship, 48, is detailed in book 11 of Tacitus's Annals. This section of Tacitus's history narrates the alleged conspiracy of Claudius's third wife, Messalina. Suetonius states that a total of 35 senators and 300 knights were executed for offenses during Claudius's reign.\nMarriages and personal life.\nSuetonius and the other ancient authors accused Claudius of being dominated by women and wives, and of being a womanizer.\nClaudius married four times, after two failed betrothals. The first betrothal was to his distant cousin Aemilia Lepida, but was broken for political reasons. The second was to Livia Medullina Camilla, which ended with Medullina's sudden death on their wedding day.\nPlautia Urgulanilla.\nPlautia Urgulanilla was the granddaughter of Livia's confidant Urgulania. During their marriage she gave birth to a son, Claudius Drusus. Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens, shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla, daughter of Sejanus.\nClaudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce, Claudius repudiated the baby girl, Claudia, as the father was allegedly one of his own freedmen. Later, this action made him the target of criticism by his enemies.\nAelia Paetina.\nSoon after, (possibly in 28) Claudius married Aelia Paetina, a relative of Sejanus, if not Sejanus's adoptive sister. During their marriage, Claudius and Paetina had a daughter, Claudia Antonia. He later divorced her after the marriage became a political liability. One version suggests that it may have been due to emotional and mental abuse by Paetina.\nValeria Messalina.\nSome years after divorcing Aelia Paetina, in 38 or early 39, Claudius married Valeria Messalina, who was his first cousin once removed (Claudius's grandmother, Octavia the Younger, was Valeria's great-grandmother on both her mother and father's side) and closely allied with Caligula's circle. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a daughter, Claudia Octavia. A son, first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, and later known as Britannicus, was born just after Claudius's accession.\nThis marriage ended in tragedy. The ancient historians allege that Messalina was a nymphomaniac who was regularly unfaithful to Claudius\u2014Tacitus states she went so far as to compete with a prostitute to see who could have more sexual partners in a night\u00a0\u2013 and manipulated his policies to amass wealth. In 48, Messalina married her lover Gaius Silius in a public ceremony while Claudius was at Ostia.\nSources disagree as to whether or not she divorced the Emperor first, and whether the intention was to usurp the throne. Under Roman law, the spouse needed to be informed that he or she had been divorced before a new marriage could take place; the sources state that Claudius was in total ignorance until after the marriage. Scramuzza, in his biography, suggests that Silius may have convinced Messalina that Claudius was doomed, and the union was her only hope of retaining her rank and protecting her children. The historian Tacitus suggests that Claudius's ongoing term as Censor may have prevented him from noticing the affair before it reached such a critical point, after which she was executed.\nAgrippina the Younger.\nClaudius married once more. Ancient sources tell that his freedmen put forward three candidates, Caligula's third wife Lollia Paulina, Claudius's divorced second wife Aelia Paetina and Claudius's niece Agrippina the Younger. According to Suetonius, Agrippina won out through her feminine wiles. She gradually seized power from Claudius and successfully conspired to eliminate his son's rivals, opening the way for her son to become emperor.\nThe truth is probably more political. The attempted coup d'\u00e9tat by Silius and Messalina probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position as a member of the Claudian (but not the Julian) family. This weakness was compounded by the fact that he did not yet have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy. Agrippina was one of the few remaining descendants of Augustus, and her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future Nero) was one of the last males of the Imperial family. Coup attempts might rally around the pair and Agrippina was already showing such ambition. It has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage, an attempt to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches. This feud dated back to Agrippina's mother's actions against Tiberius after the death of her husband Germanicus (Claudius's brother), actions that Tiberius had punished.\nAnother reason was to bring in Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus as a candidate for the succession. His prestige as the descendent of Augustus and Germanicus made him popular, and marking him as an heir would have helped the survival of Claudius's regime. In any case, Claudius accepted Agrippina and later adopted the mature Ahenobarbus as his son, renaming him as 'Nero Claudius Caesar'.\nNero was married to Claudius's daughter Octavia, made joint heir with the underage Britannicus, and promoted; Augustus had similarly named his grandson Postumus Agrippa and his stepson Tiberius as joint heirs, and Tiberius had named Caligula as his joint heir with his grandson Tiberius Gemellus. Adoption of adults or near adults was an old tradition in Rome when a suitable natural adult heir was unavailable, as was the case during Britannicus's minority. Claudius may have previously looked to adopt one of his sons-in-law to protect his own reign.\nFaustus Cornelius Sulla Felix, who was married to Claudius's daughter Claudia Antonia, was only descended from Octavia and Antony on one side\u00a0\u2013 not close enough to the Imperial family to ensure his right to be Emperor (although that did not stop others from making him the object of a coup attempt against Nero a few years later), besides being the half-brother of Valeria Messalina, which told against him. Nero was more popular with the general public as both the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus.\nAffliction and personality.\nThe historian Suetonius describes the physical manifestations of Claudius's condition. His knees were weak and gave way under him and his head shook. He stammered and his speech was confused. He slobbered and his nose ran when he was excited. The Stoic Seneca states in his \"Apocolocyntosis\" that Claudius's voice belonged to no land animal, and that his hands were weak as well.\nHowever, he showed no physical deformity, as Suetonius notes that when calm and seated he was a tall, well-built figure of \"dignitas\". When angered or stressed, his symptoms became worse. Historians agree that this condition improved upon his accession to the throne. Claudius himself claimed that he had exaggerated his ailments to save his life.\nModern assessments of his health have changed several times in the past century. Prior to World War II, infantile paralysis (or polio) was widely accepted as the cause. This is the diagnosis used in Robert Graves's Claudius novels, first published in the 1930s. \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1934 that Claudius suffered from infantile paralysis (which led to his limp state) and measles (which made him deaf) at seven months of age, among several other ailments. Polio does not explain many of the described symptoms, however, and a more recent theory implicates cerebral palsy as the cause. Tourette syndrome has also been considered a possibility.\nAs a person, ancient historians described Claudius as generous and lowbrow, a man who sometimes lunched with the plebeians. They also paint him as bloodthirsty and cruel, over-fond of gladiatorial combat and executions, and very quick to anger; Claudius himself acknowledged the latter trait, and apologized publicly for his temper. According to the ancient historians he was also excessively trusting, and easily manipulated by his wives and freedmen, but at the same time they portray him as paranoid and apathetic, dull and easily confused.\nScholarly works and their impact.\nClaudius wrote copiously throughout his life. Arnaldo Momigliano states that during the reign of Tiberius, which covers the peak of Claudius's literary career, it became impolitic to speak of republican Rome. The trend among the young historians was either to write about the new empire or about obscure antiquarian topics. Claudius was the rare scholar who covered both.\nBesides his history of Augustus' reign that caused him so much grief, his major works included \"Tyrrhenika\", a twenty-book Etruscan history, and \"Carchedonica\", an eight-volume history of Carthage, as well as an Etruscan dictionary. He also wrote a book on dice-playing. Despite the general avoidance of the topic of the Republican era, he penned a defense of Cicero against the charges of Asinius Gallus. Modern historians have used this to determine the nature of his politics and of the aborted chapters of his civil war history.\nHe proposed a reform of the Latin alphabet by the addition of three new letters; he officially instituted the change during his censorship but they did not survive his reign. Claudius also tried to revive the old custom of putting dots between successive words (Classical Latin was written with no spacing). Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography that Suetonius describes as lacking in taste. Claudius (like most of the members of his dynasty) harshly criticized his predecessors and relatives in surviving speeches.\nNone of the works survived, but other sources' reference to him provide material for the surviving histories of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Suetonius quotes Claudius's autobiography once and must have used it as a source numerous times. Tacitus uses Claudius's arguments for the orthographical innovations mentioned above and may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals. Claudius is the source for numerous passages of Pliny's \"Natural History\".\nThe influence of historical study on Claudius is obvious. In his speech on Gallic senators, he uses a version of the founding of Rome identical to that of Livy, his tutor in adolescence. Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by Julius Caesar. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies.\nHis censorship seems to have been based on those of his ancestors, particularly Appius Claudius Caecus, and he used the office to put into place many policies based on those of Republican times. This is when many of his religious reforms took effect; also, his building efforts greatly increased during his tenure. In fact, his assumption of the office of Censor may have been motivated by a desire to see his academic labors bear fruit. For example, he believed (as most Romans did) that Caecus had used the power of the censorship office to introduce the letter \"R\" and so used his own term to introduce his new letters.\nDeath.\nAncient historians agree that Claudius was murdered by poison \u2013 possibly contained in mushrooms or on a feather (ostensibly put down his throat to induce vomiting) \u2013 and died in the early hours of 13 October 54.\nNearly all implicate his final and powerful wife, Agrippina, as the instigator. Agrippina and Claudius had become more combative in the months leading up to his death. This carried on to the point where Claudius openly lamented his bad wives, and began to comment on Britannicus' approaching manhood with an eye towards restoring his status within the imperial family. Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power.\nSome implicate either his taster Halotus, his doctor Xenophon, or the infamous poisoner Locusta as the administrator of the fatal substance. Some say he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at dinner, and some have him recovering only to be poisoned again. Among his contemporary sources, Seneca the Younger ascribed the emperor's death to natural causes, while Josephus only spoke of rumors of his poisoning.\nSome historians have cast doubt on whether Claudius was murdered or merely died from illness or old age. Evidence against his murder include his serious illnesses in his last years, his unhealthy lifestyle and the fact that his taster Halotus continued to serve in the same position under Nero. Claudius had been so ill the year before that Nero vowed games for his recovery and the year of 54 seems to have been such an unhealthy year that one sitting member of each magistracy died within the span of a few months. He may even have died by eating a naturally poisonous mushroom, possibly \"Amanita muscaria\". On the other hand, some modern scholars claim the near universality of the accusations in ancient texts lends credence to the crime. Claudius's ashes were interred in the Mausoleum of Augustus on 24 October 54, after a funeral similar to that of his great-uncle Augustus 40 years earlier.\nLegacy.\nDivine honours.\nAlready, while alive, he received the widespread private worship of a living \"princeps\" and was worshipped in Britannia in his own temple in Camulodunum.\nClaudius was deified by Nero and the Senate almost immediately.\nViews of the new regime.\nAgrippina had sent Narcissus away shortly before Claudius's death, and now had the freedman murdered.\nThe last act of this secretary of letters was to burn all of Claudius's correspondence \u2013 most likely so it could not be used against him and others in an already hostile new regime. Thus Claudius's private words about his own policies and motives were lost to history. Just as Claudius had criticized his predecessors in official edicts, Nero often criticized the deceased Emperor, and many Claudian laws and edicts were disregarded under the reasoning that he was too stupid and senile to have meant them.\nSeneca's Apocolocyntosis mocks the deification of Claudius and reinforces the view of Claudius as an unpleasant fool; this remained the official view for the duration of Nero's reign. Eventually Nero stopped referring to his deified adoptive father at all. Claudius's temple was left unfinished after only some of the foundation had been laid down. Eventually the site was overtaken by Nero's Golden House.\nFlavian and later perspectives.\nThe Flavians, who had risen to prominence under Claudius, took a different tack. They needed to shore up their legitimacy, but also justify the fall of the Julio-Claudians. They reached back to Claudius in contrast with Nero, to show that they were associated with a good regime. Commemorative coins were issued of Claudius and his son Britannicus, who had been a friend of Emperor Titus (Titus was born in 39, Britannicus was born in 41). When Nero's Golden House was burned, the Temple of Claudius was finally completed on the Caelian Hill.\nHowever, as the Flavians became established, they needed to emphasize their own credentials more, and their references to Claudius ceased. Instead, he was lumped with the other emperors of the fallen dynasty. His state-cult in Rome probably continued until the abolition of all cults of dead Emperors by Maximinus Thrax in 237\u2013238. The \"Feriale Duranum\", probably identical to the festival calendars of every regular army unit, assigns him a sacrifice of a steer on his birthday, the Kalends of August. And such commemoration (and consequent feasting) probably continued until the Christianization and disintegration of the army in the late 4th century.\nViews of ancient historians.\nThe ancient historians Tacitus, Suetonius (in \"The Twelve Caesars\"), and Cassius Dio all wrote after the last of the Flavians had gone. All three were senators or \"equites\". They took the side of the Senate in most conflicts with the Princeps, invariably viewing him as being in the wrong. This resulted in biases, both conscious and unconscious. Suetonius lost access to the official archives shortly after beginning his work. He was forced to rely on second-hand accounts when it came to Claudius (with the exception of Augustus's letters, which had been gathered earlier). Suetonius painted Claudius as a ridiculous figure, belittling many of his acts and crediting his good works to his retinue.\nTacitus wrote a narrative for his fellow senators and fitted each of the emperors into a simple mold of his choosing. He wrote of Claudius as a passive pawn and an idiot in affairs relating to the palace and public life. During his Censorship of 47\u201348 Tacitus allows the reader a glimpse of a Claudius who is more statesmanlike (XI.23\u201325), but it is a mere glimpse. Tacitus is usually held to have 'hidden' his use of Claudius's writings and to have omitted Claudius's character from his works. Even his version of Claudius's Lyon tablet speech is edited to be devoid of the emperor's personality. Dio was less biased, but seems to have used Suetonius and Tacitus as sources. Thus, the conception of Claudius as a weak fool, controlled by those he supposedly ruled, was preserved for the ages.\nAs time passed, Claudius was mostly forgotten outside of the historians' accounts. His books were lost first, as their antiquarian subjects became unfashionable. In the 2nd century, Pertinax, who shared his birthday, became emperor, overshadowing commemoration of Claudius.\nIn modern media.\nIn literature, Claudius and his contemporaries appear in the historical novel \"The Roman\" by Mika Waltari. Canadian-born science fiction writer A. E. van Vogt reimagined Robert Graves's Claudius story, in his two novels, \"Empire of the Atom\" and \"The Wizard of Linn\".\nThe historical novel\u00a0\"Chariot of the Soul\" by\u00a0Linda Proud\u00a0features Claudius as host and mentor of the young Togidubnus, son of King Verica of the Atrebates, during his ten-year stay in Rome. When Togidubnus returns to Britain in advance of the Roman army, it is with a mission given to him by Claudius.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was discovered in 1874 by Henry John Stephen Smith and mentioned by German mathematician Georg Cantor in 1883. As it contrasts with a linear continuum, the Cantor set has been called the Cantor discontinuum.\nThrough consideration of this set, Cantor and others helped lay the foundations of modern point-set topology. The most common construction is the Cantor ternary set, built by removing the middle third of a line segment and then repeating the process with the remaining shorter segments. Cantor mentioned this ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a perfect set that is nowhere dense.\nMore generally, in topology, a Cantor space is a topological space homeomorphic to the Cantor ternary set (equipped with its subspace topology). The Cantor set is naturally homeomorphic to the countable product formula_1 of the discrete two-point space formula_2. By a theorem of L. E. J. Brouwer, this is equivalent to being perfect, nonempty, compact, metrizable and zero-dimensional.\nConstruction and formula of the ternary set.\nThe Cantor ternary set formula_3 is created by iteratively deleting the \"open\" middle third from a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third formula_4 from the interval formula_5, leaving two line segments: formula_6. Next, the open middle third of each of these remaining segments is deleted, leaving four line segments: formula_7.\nThe Cantor ternary set contains all points in the interval formula_8 that are not deleted at any step in this infinite process. The same construction can be described recursively by setting\n formula_9\nand\n formula_10\nfor formula_11, so that\n formula_12 formula_13 formula_14 for any formula_15.\nThe first six steps of this process are illustrated below.\nUsing the idea of self-similar transformations, formula_16 formula_17 and formula_18 the explicit closed formulas for the Cantor set are\n formula_19\nwhere every middle third is removed as the open interval formula_20 from the closed interval formula_21 surrounding it, or\n formula_22\nwhere the middle third formula_23 of the foregoing closed interval formula_24 is removed by intersecting with formula_25\nThis process of removing middle thirds is a simple example of a finite subdivision rule. The complement of the Cantor ternary set is an example of a fractal string.\nIn arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers of the unit interval formula_8 that do not require the digit 1 in order to be expressed as a ternary (base 3) fraction. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. \"Requiring\" the digit 1 is critical: formula_27, which is included in the Cantor set, can be written as formula_28, but also as formula_29, which contains no 1 digits and corresponds to an initial left turn followed by infinitely many right turns in the binary tree.\nMandelbrot's construction by \"curdling\".\nIn \"The Fractal Geometry of Nature\", mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot provides a whimsical thought experiment to assist non-mathematical readers in imagining the construction of formula_3. His narrative begins with imagining a bar, perhaps of lightweight metal, in which the bar's matter \"curdles\" by iteratively shifting towards its extremities. As the bar's segments become smaller, they become thin, dense slugs that eventually grow too small and faint to see.CURDLING: The construction of the Cantor bar results from the process I call curdling. It begins with a round bar. It is best to think of it as having a very low density. Then matter \"curdles\" out of this bar's middle third into the end thirds, so that the positions of the latter remain unchanged. Next matter curdles out of the middle third of each end third into its end thirds, and so on ad infinitum until one is left with an infinitely large number of infinitely thin slugs of infinitely high density. These slugs are spaced along the line in the very specific fashion induced by the generating process. In this illustration, curdling (which eventually requires hammering!) stops when both the printer's press and our eye cease to follow; the last line is indistinguishable from the last but one: each of its ultimate parts is seen as a gray slug rather than two parallel black slugs.\nComposition.\nSince the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., measure) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed. This total is the geometric progression\nformula_31\nSo that the proportion left is formula_32.\nThis calculation suggests that the Cantor set cannot contain any interval of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left\u2014after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the \"middle third\" of each interval involved removing open sets (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment formula_4 from the original interval formula_34 leaves behind the points and . Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining. So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).\nIt may appear that \"only\" the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number , for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202... = 0.02. It is in the bottom third, and the top third of that third, and the bottom third of that top third, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of .\nAll endpoints of segments are \"terminating\" ternary fractions and are contained in the set\nformula_35\nwhich is a countably infinite set.\nAs to cardinality, almost all elements of the Cantor set are not endpoints of intervals, nor rational points like . The whole Cantor set is in fact not countable.\nProperties.\nCardinality.\nIt can be shown that there are as many points left behind in this process as there were to begin with, and that therefore, the Cantor set is uncountable. To see this, we show that there is a function \"f\" from the Cantor set formula_3 to the closed interval formula_34 that is surjective (i.e. \"f\" maps from formula_3 onto formula_34) so that the cardinality of formula_3 is no less than that of formula_34. Since formula_3 is a subset of formula_34, its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem.\nTo construct this function, consider the points in the formula_34 interval in terms of base 3 (or ternary) notation. Recall that the proper ternary fractions, more precisely: the elements of formula_45, admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example , that can be written as 0.13 = 0.103, but also as 0.0222...3 = 0.023, and , that can be written as 0.23 = 0.203 but also as 0.1222...3 = 0.123.\nWhen we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...3 where xxxxx...3 is strictly between 00000...3 and 22222...3. So the numbers remaining after the first step consist of\nThis can be summarized by saying that those numbers with a ternary representation such that the first digit after the radix point is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.\nThe second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx...3 and 0.21xxxx...3, and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral where neither of the first \"two\" digits is 1.\nContinuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step \"n\", it must have a ternary representation whose \"n\"th digit is not 1. For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.\nIt is worth emphasizing that numbers like 1, = 0.13 and = 0.213 are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.222...3 = 0.23, = 0.0222...3 = 0.023 and = 0.20222...3 = 0.2023.\nAll the latter numbers are \"endpoints\", and these examples are right limit points of formula_3. The same is true for the left limit points of formula_3, e.g. = 0.1222...3 = 0.123 = 0.203 and = 0.21222...3 = 0.2123 = 0.2203. All these endpoints are \"proper ternary\" fractions (elements of formula_48) of the form , where denominator \"q\" is a power of 3 when the fraction is in its irreducible form. The ternary representation of these fractions terminates (i.e., is finite) or \u2014 recall from above that proper ternary fractions each have 2 representations \u2014 is infinite and \"ends\" in either infinitely many recurring 0s or infinitely many recurring 2s. Such a fraction is a left limit point of formula_3 if its ternary representation contains no 1's and \"ends\" in infinitely many recurring 0s. Similarly, a proper ternary fraction is a right limit point of formula_3 if it again its ternary expansion contains no 1's and \"ends\" in infinitely many recurring 2s.\nThis set of endpoints is dense in formula_3 (but not dense in formula_34) and makes up a countably infinite set. The numbers in formula_3 which are \"not\" endpoints also have only 0s and 2s in their ternary representation, but they cannot end in an infinite repetition of the digit 0, nor of the digit 2, because then it would be an endpoint.\nThe function from formula_3 to formula_34 is defined by taking the ternary numerals that do consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a binary representation of a real number. In a formula,\nformula_56 where formula_57\nFor any number \"y\" in formula_34, its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number \"x\" in formula_3 by replacing all the 1s by 2s. With this, \"f\"(\"x\") = \"y\" so that \"y\" is in the range of \"f\". For instance if \"y\" = = 0.100110011001...2 = 0.1001, we write \"x\" = 0.2002 = 0.200220022002...3 = . Consequently, \"f\" is surjective. However, \"f\" is \"not\" injective \u2014 the values for which \"f\"(\"x\") coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the \"middle thirds\" removed. For instance, take\n = 0.023 (which is a right limit point of formula_3 and a left limit point of the middle third [, ]) and\n = 0.203 (which is a left limit point of formula_3 and a right limit point of the middle third [, ])\nso\nformula_62\nThus there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in the interval formula_34 (which has the uncountable cardinality However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is , which can be written as 0.020202...3 = 0.02 in ternary notation. In fact, given any formula_64, there exist formula_65 such that formula_66. This was first demonstrated by Steinhaus in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that formula_67 for every formula_64. Since this construction provides an injection from formula_69 to formula_70, we have formula_71 as an immediate corollary. Assuming that formula_72 for any infinite set formula_73 (a statement shown to be equivalent to the axiom of choice by Tarski), this provides another demonstration that formula_74.\nThe Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even dense in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.\nIt has been conjectured that all algebraic irrational numbers are normal. Since members of the Cantor set are not normal in base 3, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or transcendental.\nSelf-similarity.\nThe Cantor set is the prototype of a fractal. It is self-similar, because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, the Cantor set is equal to the union of two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations of itself, formula_75 and formula_17, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to homeomorphism: formula_77\nRepeated iteration of formula_78 and formula_79 can be visualized as an infinite binary tree. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set formula_80 together with function composition forms a monoid, the dyadic monoid.\nElements of the Cantor set can be associated with the 2-adic integers, so as with usual integers, the automorphism group is the modular group. Thus the automorphisms of the Cantor set are hyperbolic motions, particular isometries of the hyperbolic plane. Thus, the Cantor set is a homogeneous space in the sense that for any two points formula_81 and formula_82 in the Cantor set formula_3, there exists a homeomorphism formula_84 with formula_85. An explicit construction of formula_86 can be described more easily if we see the Cantor set as a product space of countably many copies of the discrete space formula_87. Then the map formula_88 defined by formula_89 is an involutive homeomorphism exchanging formula_81 and formula_82.\nTopological and analytical properties.\nAlthough \"the\" Cantor set typically refers to the original, middle-thirds Cantor set described above, topologists often talk about \"a\" Cantor set, which means any topological space that is homeomorphic (topologically equivalent) to it.\nAs the above summation argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has Lebesgue measure 0. Since the Cantor set is the complement of a union of open sets, it itself is a closed subset of the reals, and therefore a complete metric space. Since it is also totally bounded, the Heine\u2013Borel theorem says that it must be compact.\nFor any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s. Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an accumulation point (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an interior point. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a perfect set in topology, while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is nowhere dense in the interval.\nEvery point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the complement of the Cantor set.\nFor any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ \u2014 one will have 0 and the other 2. By splitting the Cantor set into \"halves\" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points. In the relative topology on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a clopen set. Consequently, the Cantor set is totally disconnected. As a compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space, the Cantor set is an example of a Stone space.\nAs a topological space, the Cantor set is naturally homeomorphic to the product of countably many copies of the space formula_92, where each copy carries the discrete topology. This is the space of all sequences in two digits \nformula_93\nwhich can also be identified with the set of 2-adic integers. The basis for the open sets of the product topology are cylinder sets; the homeomorphism maps these to the subspace topology that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real line. This characterization of the Cantor space as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via Tychonoff's theorem.\nFrom the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the \"p\"-adic integers, and, if one point is removed from it, to the \"p\"-adic numbers.\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a metric space with respect to the ordinary distance metric; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the \"p\"-adic metric on formula_94: given two sequences formula_95, the distance between them is formula_96, where formula_97 is the smallest index such that formula_98; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same topology on the Cantor set.\nWe have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See Cantor space for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.\nThe Cantor set is sometimes regarded as \"universal\" in the category of compact metric spaces, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not universal in the precise categorical sense. The \"universal\" property has important applications in functional analysis, where it is sometimes known as the \"representation theorem for compact metric spaces\".\nFor any integer \"q\" \u2265 2, the topology on the group G = Z\"q\"\u03c9 (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the Pontrjagin dual \u0393 is also Z\"q\"\u03c9, the topology of \u0393 is compact. One can see that \u0393 is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case \"q\" = 2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)\nMeasure and probability.\nThe Cantor set can be seen as the compact group of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural Haar measure. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual Lebesgue measure on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a singular measure. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any probability, making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.\nIn Lebesgue measure theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure. In contrast, the set has a Hausdorff measure of formula_99 in its dimension of formula_100.\nCantor numbers.\nIf we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, then\nDescriptive set theory.\nThe Cantor set is a meagre set (or a set of first category) as a subset of formula_34 (although not as a subset of itself, since it is a Baire space). The Cantor set thus demonstrates that notions of \"size\" in terms of cardinality, measure, and (Baire) category need not coincide. Like the set formula_103, the Cantor set formula_3 is \"small\" in the sense that it is a null set (a set of measure zero) and it is a meagre subset of formula_34. However, unlike formula_103, which is countable and has a \"small\" cardinality, formula_107, the cardinality of formula_3 is the same as that of formula_34, the continuum formula_110, and is \"large\" in the sense of cardinality. In fact, it is also possible to construct a subset of formula_34 that is meagre but of positive measure and a subset that is non-meagre but of measure zero: By taking the countable union of \"fat\" Cantor sets formula_112 of measure formula_113 (see Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set below for the construction), we obtain a set formula_114which has a positive measure (equal to 1) but is meagre in [0,1], since each formula_112 is nowhere dense. Then consider the set formula_116. Since formula_117, formula_118 cannot be meagre, but since formula_119, formula_118 must have measure zero.\nVariants.\nSmith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set.\nInstead of repeatedly removing the middle third of every piece as in the Cantor set, we could also keep removing any other fixed percentage (other than 0% and 100%) from the middle. In the case where the middle of the interval is removed, we get a remarkably accessible case \u2014 the set consists of all numbers in [0,1] that can be written as a decimal consisting entirely of 0s and 9s. If a fixed percentage is removed at each stage, then the limiting set will have measure zero, since the length of the remainder formula_121 as formula_122 for any formula_123 such that formula_124.\nOn the other hand, \"fat Cantor sets\" of positive measure can be generated by removal of smaller fractions of the middle of the segment in each iteration. Thus, one can construct sets homeomorphic to the Cantor set that have positive Lebesgue measure while still being nowhere dense. If an interval of length formula_125 (formula_126) is removed from the middle of each segment at the \"n\"th iteration, then the total length removed is formula_127, and the limiting set will have a Lebesgue measure of formula_128. Thus, in a sense, the middle-thirds Cantor set is a limiting case with formula_129. If formula_130, then the remainder will have positive measure with formula_131. The case formula_132 is known as the Smith\u2013Volterra\u2013Cantor set, which has a Lebesgue measure of formula_133.\nCantor dust.\nCantor dust is a multi-dimensional version of the Cantor set. It can be formed by taking a finite Cartesian product of the Cantor set with itself, making it a Cantor space. Like the Cantor set, Cantor dust has zero measure.\nA different 2D analogue of the Cantor set is the Sierpinski carpet, where a square is divided up into nine smaller squares, and the middle one removed. The remaining squares are then further divided into nine each and the middle removed, and so on ad infinitum. One 3D analogue of this is the Menger sponge.\nHistorical remarks.\nCantor introduced what we call today the Cantor ternary set formula_134 as an example \"of a perfect point-set, which is not everywhere-dense in any interval, however small.\" Cantor described formula_134 in terms of ternary expansions, as \"the set of all real numbers given by the formula: formula_136where the coefficients formula_137 arbitrarily take the two values 0 and 2, and the series can consist of a finite number or an infinite number of elements.\"\nA topological space formula_138 is perfect if all its points are limit points or, equivalently, if it coincides with its derived set formula_139. Subsets of the real line, like formula_134, can be seen as topological spaces under the induced subspace topology.\nCantor was led to the study of derived sets by his results on uniqueness of trigonometric series. The latter did much to set him on the course for developing an abstract, general theory of infinite sets.\nBenoit Mandelbrot wrote much on Cantor dusts and their relation to natural fractals and statistical physics. He further reflected on the puzzling or even upsetting nature of such structures to those in the mathematics and physics community. In The Fractal Geometry of Nature, he described how \"When I started on this topic in 1962, everyone was agreeing that Cantor dusts are at least as monstrous as the Koch and Peano curves,\" and added that \"every self-respecting physicist was automatically turned off by a mention of Cantor, ready to run a mile from anyone claiming formula_134 to be interesting in science.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6173", "revid": "17350134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6173", "title": "Cardinal number", "text": "Size of a possibly infinite set\nIn mathematics, a cardinal number, or cardinal for short, is what is commonly called the number of elements of a set. In the case of a finite set, its cardinal number, or cardinality is therefore a natural number. For dealing with the case of infinite sets, the infinite cardinal numbers have been introduced, which are often denoted with the Hebrew letter formula_1 (aleph) marked with subscript indicating their rank among the infinite cardinals.\nCardinality is defined in terms of bijective functions. Two sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of number of elements. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to Georg Cantor shows that it is possible for two infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the cardinality of the set of real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. It is also possible for a proper subset of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set\u2014something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.\nThere is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:\nformula_2\nThis sequence starts with the natural numbers including zero (finite cardinals), which are followed by the aleph numbers. The aleph numbers are indexed by ordinal numbers. If the axiom of choice is true, this transfinite sequence includes every cardinal number. If the axiom of choice is not true (see ), there are infinite cardinals that are not aleph numbers.\nCardinality is studied for its own sake as part of set theory. It is also a tool used in branches of mathematics including model theory, combinatorics, abstract algebra and mathematical analysis. In category theory, the cardinal numbers form a skeleton of the category of sets.\nHistory.\nThe notion of cardinality, as now understood, was formulated by Georg Cantor, the originator of set theory, in 1874\u20131884. Cardinality can be used to compare an aspect of finite sets. For example, the sets {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} are not \"equal\", but have the \"same cardinality\", namely three. This is established by the existence of a bijection (i.e., a one-to-one correspondence) between the two sets, such as the correspondence {1\u21924, 2\u21925, 3\u21926}.\nCantor applied his concept of bijection to infinite sets (for example the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}). Thus, he called all sets having a bijection with N \"denumerable (countably infinite) sets\", which all share the same cardinal number. This cardinal number is called formula_3, aleph-null. He called the cardinal numbers of infinite sets transfinite cardinal numbers.\nCantor proved that any unbounded subset of N has the same cardinality as N, even though this might appear to run contrary to intuition. He also proved that the set of all ordered pairs of natural numbers is denumerable; this implies that the set of all rational numbers is also denumerable, since every rational can be represented by a pair of integers. He later proved that the set of all real algebraic numbers is also denumerable. Each real algebraic number \"z\" may be encoded as a finite sequence of integers, which are the coefficients in the polynomial equation of which it is a solution, i.e. the ordered n-tuple (\"a\"0, \"a\"1, ..., \"an\"), \"ai\" \u2208 Z together with a pair of rationals (\"b\"0, \"b\"1) such that \"z\" is the unique root of the polynomial with coefficients (\"a\"0, \"a\"1, ..., \"an\") that lies in the interval (\"b\"0, \"b\"1).\nIn his 1874 paper \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\", Cantor proved that there exist higher-order cardinal numbers, by showing that the set of real numbers has cardinality greater than that of N. His proof used an argument with nested intervals, but in an 1891 paper, he proved the same result using his ingenious and much simpler diagonal argument. The new cardinal number of the set of real numbers is called the cardinality of the continuum and Cantor used the symbol formula_4 for it.\nCantor also developed a large portion of the general theory of cardinal numbers; he proved that there is a smallest transfinite cardinal number (formula_3, aleph-null), and that for every cardinal number there is a next-larger cardinal\nformula_6\nHis continuum hypothesis is the proposition that the cardinality formula_4 of the set of real numbers is the same as formula_8. This hypothesis is independent of the standard axioms of mathematical set theory, that is, it can neither be proved nor disproved from them. This was shown in 1963 by Paul Cohen, complementing earlier work by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1940.\nMotivation.\nIn informal use, a cardinal number is what is normally referred to as a \"counting number\", provided that 0 is included: 0, 1, 2, ... They may be identified with the natural numbers beginning with 0. The counting numbers are exactly what can be defined formally as the finite cardinal numbers. Infinite cardinals only occur in higher-level mathematics and logic.\nMore formally, a non-zero number can be used for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence. For finite sets and sequences it is easy to see that these two notions coincide, since for every number describing a position in a sequence we can construct a set that has exactly the right size. For example, 3 describes the position of 'c' in the sequence &lt;'a','b','c','d'...&gt;, and we can construct the set {a,b,c}, which has 3 elements.\nHowever, when dealing with infinite sets, it is essential to distinguish between the two, since the two notions are in fact different for infinite sets. Considering the position aspect leads to ordinal numbers, while the size aspect is generalized by the cardinal numbers described here.\nThe intuition behind the formal definition of cardinal is the construction of a notion of the relative size or \"bigness\" of a set, without reference to the kind of members which it has. For finite sets this is easy; one simply counts the number of elements a set has. In order to compare the sizes of larger sets, it is necessary to appeal to more refined notions.\nA set \"Y\" is at least as big as a set \"X\" if there is an injective mapping from the elements of \"X\" to the elements of \"Y\". An injective mapping identifies each element of the set \"X\" with a unique element of the set \"Y\". This is most easily understood by an example; suppose we have the sets \"X\" = {1,2,3} and \"Y\" = {a,b,c,d}, then using this notion of size, we would observe that there is a mapping:\n 1 \u2192 a\n 2 \u2192 b\n 3 \u2192 c\nwhich is injective, and hence conclude that \"Y\" has cardinality greater than or equal to \"X\". The element d has no element mapping to it, but this is permitted as we only require an injective mapping, and not necessarily a bijective mapping. The advantage of this notion is that it can be extended to infinite sets.\nWe can then extend this to an equality-style relation. Two sets \"X\" and \"Y\" are said to have the same \"cardinality\" if there exists a bijection between \"X\" and \"Y\". By the Schroeder\u2013Bernstein theorem, this is equivalent to there being \"both\" an injective mapping from \"X\" to \"Y\", \"and\" an injective mapping from \"Y\" to \"X\". We then write |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|. The cardinal number of \"X\" itself is often defined as the least ordinal \"a\" with |\"a\"| = |\"X\"|. This is called the von Neumann cardinal assignment; for this definition to make sense, it must be proved that every set has the same cardinality as \"some\" ordinal; this statement is the well-ordering principle. It is however possible to discuss the relative cardinality of sets without explicitly assigning names to objects.\nThe classic example used is that of the infinite hotel paradox, also called Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel. Supposing there is an innkeeper at a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. The hotel is full, and then a new guest arrives. It is possible to fit the extra guest in by asking the guest who was in room 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on, leaving room 1 vacant. We can explicitly write a segment of this mapping:\n 1 \u2192 2\n 2 \u2192 3\n 3 \u2192 4\n \"n\" \u2192 \"n\" + 1\nWith this assignment, we can see that the set {1,2,3...} has the same cardinality as the set {2,3,4...}, since a bijection between the first and the second has been shown. This motivates the definition of an infinite set being any set that has a proper subset of the same cardinality (i.e., a Dedekind-infinite set); in this case {2,3,4...} is a proper subset of {1,2,3...}.\nWhen considering these large objects, one might also want to see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets. It happens that it does not; by considering the above example we can see that if some object \"one greater than infinity\" exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started out with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called ordinals, based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.\nIt can be proved that the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than that of the natural numbers just described. This can be visualized using Cantor's diagonal argument; classic questions of cardinality (for instance the continuum hypothesis) are concerned with discovering whether there is some cardinal between some pair of other infinite cardinals. In more recent times, mathematicians have been describing the properties of larger and larger cardinals.\nSince cardinality is such a common concept in mathematics, a variety of names are in use. Sameness of cardinality is sometimes referred to as \"equipotence\", \"equipollence\", or \"equinumerosity\". It is thus said that two sets with the same cardinality are, respectively, \"equipotent\", \"equipollent\", or \"equinumerous\".\nCardinality function.\nThe cardinality function is a cardinal function which takes in a set formula_9 and returns its cardinal number: formula_10. For finite sets, this is simply the natural number found by counting the elements. This function applied to a set formula_9 is generally denoted by formula_12 with a vertical bar on each side, though it may also be denoted by formula_9, formula_14 or formula_15\nFor infinite sets, \"cardinal number\" is somewhat more difficult to define formally. Cardinal numbers are not usually thought of in terms of their formal definition, but immaterially in terms of their arithmetic/algebraic properties. Thus, The assumption that there is \"some\" cardinal function formula_10 which satisfies formula_17, sometimes called the \"axiom of cardinality\" or \"Hume's principle\", is sufficient for deriving most properties of cardinal numbers. It will be shown later that such a function can be constructed without the need to define it axiomatically.\nConstructive definition.\nFormally, assuming the axiom of choice, the cardinality of a set \"X\" is the least ordinal number \u03b1 such that there is a bijection between \"X\" and \u03b1. This definition is known as the von Neumann cardinal assignment. If the axiom of choice is not assumed, then a different approach is needed. The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set \"X\" (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and \"Principia Mathematica\") is as the class [\"X\"] of all sets that are equinumerous with \"X\". This does not work in ZFC or other related systems of axiomatic set theory because if \"X\" is non-empty, this collection is too large to be a set. In fact, for \"X\" \u2260 \u2205 there is an injection from the universe into [\"X\"] by mapping a set \"m\" to {\"m\"} \u00d7 \"X\", and so by the axiom of limitation of size, [\"X\"] is a proper class. The definition does work however in type theory and in New Foundations and related systems. However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with \"X\" that have the least rank, then it will work (this is a trick due to Dana Scott: it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).\nVon Neumann cardinal assignment implies that the cardinal number of a finite set is the common ordinal number of all possible well-orderings of that set, and cardinal and ordinal arithmetic (addition, multiplication, power, proper subtraction) then give the same answers for finite numbers. However, they differ for infinite numbers. For example, formula_18 in ordinal arithmetic while formula_19 in cardinal arithmetic, although the von Neumann assignment puts formula_20. On the other hand, Scott's trick implies that the cardinal number 0 is formula_21, which is also the ordinal number 1, and this may be confusing. A possible compromise (to take advantage of the alignment in finite arithmetic while avoiding reliance on the axiom of choice and confusion in infinite arithmetic) is to apply von Neumann assignment to the cardinal numbers of finite sets (those which can be well ordered and are not equipotent to proper subsets) and to use Scott's trick for the cardinal numbers of other sets.\nFormally, the order among cardinal numbers is defined as follows: |\"X\"| \u2264 |\"Y\"| means that there exists an injective function from \"X\" to \"Y\". The Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schroeder theorem states that if |\"X\"| \u2264 |\"Y\"| and |\"Y\"| \u2264 |\"X\"| then |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|. The axiom of choice is equivalent to the statement that given two sets \"X\" and \"Y\", either |\"X\"| \u2264 |\"Y\"| or |\"Y\"| \u2264 |\"X\"|.\nA set \"X\" is Dedekind-infinite if there exists a proper subset \"Y\" of \"X\" with |\"X\"| = |\"Y\"|, and Dedekind-finite if such a subset does not exist. The finite cardinals are just the natural numbers, in the sense that a set \"X\" is finite if and only if |\"X\"| = |\"n\"| = \"n\" for some natural number \"n\". Any other set is infinite.\nAssuming the axiom of choice, it can be proved that the Dedekind notions correspond to the standard ones. It can also be proved that the cardinal formula_3 (aleph null or aleph-0, where aleph is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet, represented formula_1) of the set of natural numbers is the smallest infinite cardinal (i.e., any infinite set has a subset of cardinality formula_3). The next larger cardinal is denoted by formula_8, and so on. For every ordinal \u03b1, there is a cardinal number formula_26 and this list exhausts all infinite cardinal numbers.\nCardinal arithmetic.\nWe can define arithmetic operations on cardinal numbers that generalize the ordinary operations for natural numbers. It can be shown that for finite cardinals, these operations coincide with the usual operations for natural numbers. Furthermore, these operations share many properties with ordinary arithmetic.\nSuccessor cardinal.\nIf the axiom of choice holds, then every cardinal \u03ba has a successor, denoted \u03ba+, where \u03ba+ &gt; \u03ba and there are no cardinals between \u03ba and its successor. (Without the axiom of choice, using Hartogs' theorem, it can be shown that for any cardinal number \u03ba, there is a minimal cardinal \u03ba+ such that formula_27) For finite cardinals, the successor is simply \u03ba + 1. For infinite cardinals, the successor cardinal differs from the successor ordinal.\nCardinal addition.\nIf \"X\" and \"Y\" are disjoint, addition is given by the union of \"X\" and \"Y\". If the two sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by disjoint sets of the same cardinality (e.g., replace \"X\" by \"X\"\u00d7{0} and \"Y\" by \"Y\"\u00d7{1}).\nformula_28\nZero is an additive identity \"\u03ba\" + 0 = 0 + \"\u03ba\" = \"\u03ba\".\nAddition is associative (\"\u03ba\" + \"\u03bc\") + \"\u03bd\" = \"\u03ba\" + (\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03bd\").\nAddition is commutative \"\u03ba\" + \"\u03bc\" = \"\u03bc\" + \"\u03ba\".\nAddition is non-decreasing in both arguments:\nformula_29\nAssuming the axiom of choice, addition of infinite cardinal numbers is easy. If either \"\u03ba\" or \"\u03bc\" is infinite, then\nformula_30\nSubtraction.\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \"\u03c3\" and a cardinal \"\u03bc\", there exists a cardinal \"\u03ba\" such that \"\u03bc\" + \"\u03ba\" = \"\u03c3\" if and only if \"\u03bc\" \u2264 \"\u03c3\". It will be unique (and equal to \"\u03c3\") if and only if \"\u03bc\" &lt; \"\u03c3\".\nCardinal multiplication.\nThe product of cardinals comes from the Cartesian product.\nformula_31\nZero is a multiplicative absorbing element: \"\u03ba\"\u00b70 = 0\u00b7\"\u03ba\" = 0.\nThere are no nontrivial zero divisors: \"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\" = 0 \u2192 (\"\u03ba\" = 0 or \"\u03bc\" = 0).\nOne is a multiplicative identity: \"\u03ba\"\u00b71 = 1\u00b7\"\u03ba\" = \"\u03ba\".\nMultiplication is associative: (\"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\")\u00b7\"\u03bd\" = \"\u03ba\"\u00b7(\"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03bd\").\nMultiplication is commutative: \"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\" = \"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\".\nMultiplication is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n\"\u03ba\" \u2264 \"\u03bc\" \u2192 (\"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bd\" \u2264 \"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03bd\" and \"\u03bd\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\" \u2264 \"\u03bd\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\").\nMultiplication distributes over addition:\n\"\u03ba\"\u00b7(\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03bd\") = \"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bd\" and\n(\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03bd\")\u00b7\"\u03ba\" = \"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\" + \"\u03bd\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\".\nAssuming the axiom of choice, multiplication of infinite cardinal numbers is also easy. If either \"\u03ba\" or \"\u03bc\" is infinite and both are non-zero, then\nformula_32\nThus the product of two infinite cardinal numbers is equal to their sum.\nDivision.\nAssuming the axiom of choice and given an infinite cardinal \"\u03c0\" and a non-zero cardinal \"\u03bc\", there exists a cardinal \"\u03ba\" such that \"\u03bc\" \u00b7 \"\u03ba\" = \"\u03c0\" if and only if \"\u03bc\" \u2264 \"\u03c0\". It will be unique (and equal to \"\u03c0\") if and only if \"\u03bc\" &lt; \"\u03c0\".\nCardinal exponentiation.\nExponentiation is given by\nformula_33\nwhere \"XY\" is the set of all functions from \"Y\" to \"X\". It is easy to check that the right-hand side depends only on formula_34 and formula_34.\n\u03ba0 = 1 (in particular 00 = 1), see empty function.\nIf \"\u03bc\" \u2265 1, then 0\"\u03bc\" = 0.\n1\"\u03bc\" = 1.\n\"\u03ba\"1 = \"\u03ba\".\n\"\u03ba\"\"\u03bc\" + \"\u03bd\" = \"\u03ba\"\"\u03bc\"\u00b7\"\u03ba\"\"\u03bd\".\n\u03ba\"\u03bc\" \u00b7 \"\u03bd\" = (\"\u03ba\"\"\u03bc\")\"\u03bd\".\n(\"\u03ba\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\")\"\u03bd\" = \"\u03ba\"\"\u03bd\"\u00b7\"\u03bc\"\"\u03bd\".\nExponentiation is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n(1 \u2264 \"\u03bd\" and \"\u03ba\" \u2264 \"\u03bc\") \u2192 (\"\u03bd\"\"\u03ba\" \u2264 \"\u03bd\"\"\u03bc\") and\n(\"\u03ba\" \u2264 \"\u03bc\") \u2192 (\"\u03ba\"\"\u03bd\" \u2264 \"\u03bc\"\"\u03bd\").\n2|\"X\"| is the cardinality of the power set of the set \"X\" and Cantor's diagonal argument shows that 2|\"X\"| &gt; |\"X\"| for any set \"X\". This proves that no largest cardinal exists (because for any cardinal \"\u03ba\", we can always find a larger cardinal 2\"\u03ba\"). In fact, the class of cardinals is a proper class. (This proof fails in some set theories, notably New Foundations.)\nAll the remaining propositions in this section assume the axiom of choice:\nIf \"\u03ba\" and \"\u03bc\" are both finite and greater than 1, and \"\u03bd\" is infinite, then \"\u03ba\"\"\u03bd\" = \"\u03bc\"\"\u03bd\".\nIf \"\u03ba\" is infinite and \"\u03bc\" is finite and non-zero, then \"\u03ba\"\"\u03bc\" = \"\u03ba\".\nIf 2 \u2264 \"\u03ba\" and 1 \u2264 \"\u03bc\" and at least one of them is infinite, then:\nMax (\"\u03ba\", 2\"\u03bc\") \u2264 \"\u03ba\"\"\u03bc\" \u2264 Max (2\"\u03ba\", 2\"\u03bc\").\nUsing K\u00f6nig's theorem, one can prove \"\u03ba\" &lt; \"\u03ba\"cf(\"\u03ba\") and \"\u03ba\" &lt; cf(2\"\u03ba\") for any infinite cardinal \"\u03ba\", where cf(\"\u03ba\") is the cofinality of \"\u03ba\".\nRoots.\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \"\u03ba\" and a finite cardinal \"\u03bc\" greater than 0, the cardinal \"\u03bd\" satisfying formula_36 will be formula_37.\nLogarithms.\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \"\u03ba\" and a finite cardinal \"\u03bc\" greater than 1, there may or may not be a cardinal \"\u03bb\" satisfying formula_38. However, if such a cardinal exists, it is infinite and less than \"\u03ba\", and any finite cardinality \"\u03bd\" greater than 1 will also satisfy formula_39.\nThe logarithm of an infinite cardinal number \"\u03ba\" is defined as the least cardinal number \"\u03bc\" such that \"\u03ba\" \u2264 2\"\u03bc\". Logarithms of infinite cardinals are useful in some fields of mathematics, for example in the study of cardinal invariants of topological spaces, though they lack some of the properties that logarithms of positive real numbers possess.\nThe continuum hypothesis.\nThe continuum hypothesis (CH) states that there are no cardinals strictly between formula_3 and formula_41 The latter cardinal number is also often denoted by formula_4; it is the cardinality of the continuum (the set of real numbers). In this case formula_43\nSimilarly, the generalized continuum hypothesis (GCH) states that for every infinite cardinal formula_37, there are no cardinals strictly between formula_37 and formula_46. Both the continuum hypothesis and the generalized continuum hypothesis have been proved to be independent of the usual axioms of set theory, the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms together with the axiom of choice (ZFC).\nIndeed, Easton's theorem shows that, for regular cardinals formula_37, the only restrictions ZFC places on the cardinality of formula_46 are that formula_49, and that the exponential function is non-decreasing.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography"}

The concept is understood through one-to-one correspondences between sets. That is, if their objects can be paired such that each object has a pair, and no object is paired more than once. \nThe basic concepts of cardinality go back as early as the 6th century BCE, and there are several close encounters with it throughout history, however, the results were generally dismissed as paradoxical. It is considered to have been first introduced formally to mathematics by Georg Cantor at the turn of the 20th century. Cantor's theory of cardinality was then formalized, popularized, and explored by many influential mathematicians of the time, and has since become a fundamental concept of mathematics. \nTwo sets are said to be equinumerous or \"have the same cardinality\" if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between them. Otherwise, one is said to be \"strictly larger\" or \"strictly smaller\" than the other. A set is countably infinite if it can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers formula_1 For example, the set of even numbers formula_2 and the set of rational numbers are countable. Uncountable sets are those strictly larger than the set of natural numbers\u2014for example, the set of all real numbers or the powerset of the set of natural numbers. \nFor finite sets, cardinality coincides with the natural number found by counting their elements. However, it is more often difficult to ascribe \"sizes\" to infinite sets. Thus, a system of cardinal numbers can be developed to extend the role of natural numbers as abstractions of the sizes of sets. The cardinal number corresponding to a set formula_3 is written as formula_4 between two vertical bars. Most commonly, the Aleph numbers formula_5 are used, since it can be shown every infinite set has cardinality equivalent to some Aleph. \nThe set of natural numbers has cardinality formula_6. The question of whether the real numbers have cardinality formula_7 is known as the continuum hypothesis, which has been shown to be unprovable in standard set theories such as Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory. Alternative set theories and additional axioms give rise to different properties and have often strange or unintuitive consequences. However, every theory of cardinality using standard logical foundations of mathematics admits Skolem's paradox, which roughly asserts that basic properties of cardinality are not absolute, but relative to the model in which the cardinality is measured. \nDefinition and etymology.\nCardinality is an intrinsic property of sets which defines their size, roughly corresponding to the number of individual objects they contain. Fundamentally however, it is different from the concepts of number or counting as the cardinalities of two sets can be compared without referring to their number of elements, or defining number at all. For example, in the image above, a set of apples is compared to a set of oranges such that every fruit is used exactly once which shows these two sets have the same cardinality, even if one doesn't know how many of each there are. Thus, cardinality is measured by putting sets in one-to-one correspondence. If it is possible, the sets are said to have the \"same cardinality\", and if not, one set is said to be \"strictly larger\" or \"strictly smaller\" than the other.\nGeorg Cantor, the originator of the concept, defined cardinality as \"the general concept which, with the aid of our intelligence, results from a set when we abstract from the nature of its various elements and from the order of their being given.\" This definition was considered to be imprecise, unclear, and purely psychological. Thus, cardinal numbers, a means of measuring cardinality, became the main way of presenting the concept. The distinction between the two is roughly analogous to the difference between an object's mass and its mass \"in kilograms\". However, somewhat confusingly, the phrases \"The cardinality of M\" and \"The cardinal number of M\" are used interchangeably. \nThe term \"cardinality\" originates from the post-classical Latin \"cardo\" (\"to hinge\"), which referred to something central or pivotal, both literally and metaphorically. This passed into medieval Latin and then into English, where \"cardinal\" came to describe things considered to be, in some sense, fundamental, such as, \"cardinal sins\", \"cardinal directions\", and (in linguistics) \"cardinal numbers\". The last of which referred to numbers used for counting (e.g., \"one\", \"two\", \"three\"), as opposed to \"ordinal numbers\", which express order (e.g., \"first, second, third\"), and \"nominal numbers\" used for labeling without meaning (e.g., jersey numbers and serial numbers). \nIn mathematics, the notion of cardinality was first introduced by Georg Cantor in the late 19th century, wherein he used the term \"M\u00e4chtigkeit\", which may be translated as \"magnitude\" or \"power\", though Cantor credited the term to a work by Jakob Steiner on projective geometry. The terms \"cardinality\" and \"cardinal number\" were eventually adopted from the grammatical sense, and later translations would use these terms.\nHistory.\nAncient history.\nFrom the 6th century BCE, the writings of Greek philosophers, such as Anaximander, show hints of comparing infinite sets or shapes, however, it was generally viewed as paradoxical and imperfect (cf. \"Zeno's paradoxes\"). Aristotle distinguished between the notions of actual infinity and potential infinity, arguing that Greek mathematicians understood the difference, and that they \"do not need the [actual] infinite and do not use it.\" The Greek notion of number (\"\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\", \"arithmos\") was used exclusively for a definite number of definite objects (i.e. finite numbers). This would be codified in Euclid's \"Elements\", where the fifth common notion states \"The whole is greater than the part\", often called the \"Euclidean principle\". This principle would be the dominating philosophy in mathematics until the 19th century.\nAround the 4th century BCE, Jaina mathematics would be the first to discuss different sizes of infinity. They defined three major classes of number: enumerable (finite numbers), unenumerable (\"asamkhyata\", roughly, countably infinite), and infinite (\"ananta\"). Then they had five classes of infinite numbers: infinite in one direction, infinite in both directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually. \nOne of the earliest explicit uses of a one-to-one correspondence is recorded in Aristotle's \"Mechanics\" (c.\u2009350 BCE), known as Aristotle's wheel paradox. The paradox can be briefly described as follows: A wheel is depicted as two concentric circles. The larger, outer circle is tangent to a horizontal line (e.g. a road that it rolls on), while the smaller, inner circle is rigidly affixed to the larger. Assuming the larger circle rolls along the line without slipping (or skidding) for one full revolution, the distances moved by both circles are the same: the circumference of the larger circle. Further, the lines traced by the bottom-most point of each is the same length. Since the smaller wheel does not skip any points, and no point on the smaller wheel is used more than once, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two circles.\nPre-Cantorian set theory.\nGalileo Galilei presented what was later coined Galileo's paradox in his book \"Two New Sciences\" (1638), where he presents a seeming paradox in infinite sequences of numbers. It goes roughly as follows: for each perfect square formula_8 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on, there is a unique square root formula_9 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on. Therefore, there are as many perfect squares as there are square roots. However, every number is a square root, since it can be squared, but not every number is a perfect square. Moreover, the proportion of perfect squares as one passes larger values diminishes, and is eventually smaller than any given fraction. Galileo denied that this was fundamentally contradictory, however he concluded that this meant we could not compare the sizes of infinite sets, missing the opportunity to discover cardinality.\nIn \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1739), David Hume is quoted for saying \"\"When two numbers are so combined, as that the one has always a unit answering to every unit of the other, we pronounce them equal\",\" now called \"Hume's principle\", which was used extensively by Gottlob Frege later during the rise of set theory.\nBernard Bolzano's \"Paradoxes of the Infinite\" (\"Paradoxien des Unendlichen\", 1851) is often considered the first systematic attempt to introduce the concept of sets into mathematical analysis. In this work, Bolzano defended the notion of actual infinity, presented an early formulation of what would later be recognized as one-to-one correspondence between infinite sets. He discussed examples such as the pairing between the intervals formula_10 and formula_11 by the relation formula_12 and revisited Galileo's paradox. However, he too resisted saying that these sets were, in that sense, the same size. While \"Paradoxes of the Infinite\" anticipated several ideas central to later set theory, the work had little influence on contemporary mathematics, in part due to its posthumous publication and limited circulation.\nEarly set theory.\nGeorg Cantor.\nThe concept of cardinality emerged nearly fully formed in the work of Georg Cantor during the 1870s and 1880s, in the context of mathematical analysis. In a series of papers beginning with \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\" (1874), Cantor introduced the idea of comparing the sizes of infinite sets, through the notion of one-to-one correspondence. He showed that the set of real numbers was, in this sense, strictly larger than the set of natural numbers using a nested intervals argument. This result was later refined into the more widely known diagonal argument of 1891, published in \"\u00dcber eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre,\" where he also proved the more general result (now called Cantor's Theorem) that the power set of any set is strictly larger than the set itself. \nCantor introduced the notion cardinal numbers in terms of ordinal numbers. He viewed cardinal numbers as an abstraction of sets, introduced the notations, where, for a given set formula_13, the order type of that set was written formula_14, and the cardinal number was formula_13, a double abstraction. He also introduced the Aleph sequence for infinite cardinal numbers. These notations appeared in correspondence and were formalized in his later writings, particularly the series \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur Begr\u00fcndung der transfiniten Mengenlehre\" (1895\u20131897). In these works, Cantor developed an arithmetic of cardinal numbers, defining addition, multiplication, and exponentiation of cardinal numbers based on set-theoretic constructions. This led to the formulation of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), the proposition that no set has cardinality strictly between the cardinality of the natural numbers formula_6 and the cardinality of the continuum formula_17, that is whether formula_18. Cantor was unable to resolve CH and left it as an open problem.\nOther contributors.\nParallel to Cantor\u2019s development, Richard Dedekind independently formulated many advanced theorems of set theory, and helped establish set-theoretic foundations of algebra and arithmetic. Dedekind's \"The Nature and Meaning of Numbers\" (1888) emphasized structural properties over extensional definitions, and supported the bijective formulation of size and number. Dedekind was in correspondence with Cantor during the development of set theory; he supplied Cantor with a proof of the countability of the algebraic numbers, and gave feedback and modifications on Cantor's proofs before publishing.\nAfter Cantor's 1883 proof that all finite-dimensional spaces formula_19 have the same cardinality, in 1890, Giuseppe Peano introduced the Peano curve, which was a more visual proof that the unit interval formula_20 has the same cardinality as the unit square on formula_21 This created a new area of mathematical analysis studying what is now called space-filling curves. \nGerman logician Gottlob Frege attempted to ground the concepts of number and arithmetic in logic using Cantor's theory of cardinality and Hume's principle in \"Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik\" (1884) and the subsequent \"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik\" (1893, 1903). Frege defined cardinal numbers as equivalence classes of sets under equinumerosity. However, Frege's approach to set theory was later shown to be flawed. His approach was eventually reformalized by Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead in \"Principia Mathematica\" (1910\u20131913, vol. II) using a theory of types. Though Russell initially had difficulties understanding Cantor's and Frege\u2019s intuitions of cardinality. This definition of cardinal numbers is now referred to as the \"Frege\u2013Russell\" definition. This definition was eventually superseded by the convention established by John von Neumann in 1928 which uses representatives to define cardinal numbers. \nAt the Paris conference of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900, David Hilbert, one of the most influential mathematicians of the time, gave a speech wherein he presented ten unsolved problems (of a total of 23, later published, now called \"Hilbert's problems\"). Of these, he placed \"Cantor's problem\" (now called the Continuum Hypothesis) as the first on the list. This list of problems would prove to be very influential in 20th century mathematics, and attracted a lot of attention from other mathematicians toward Cantor's theory of cardinality.\nAxiomatic set theory.\nIn 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed the first axiomatization of set theory, now called Zermelo set theory, primarily to support his earlier (1904) proof of the Well-ordering theorem, which showed that all cardinal numbers could be represented as Alephs, though the proof required a controversial principle now known as the Axiom of Choice (AC). Zermelo's system would later be extended by Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem in the 1920s to create the standard foundation of set theory, called Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZFC, \"C\" for the Axiom of Choice). ZFC provided a rigorous foundation through which infinite cardinals could be systematically studied while avoiding the paradoxes of naive set theory.\nIgnoring possible foundational issues, during the early 1900s, Felix Hausdorff would begin studying \"exorbitant numbers\": roughly, very large cardinal numbers, or what are now called inaccessible cardinals. This work would be continued and popularized by several other influential set theorists such as Paul Mahlo\u2014who introduced Mahlo cardinals\u2014as well as Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski, and Alfred Tarski. Their work would eventually be known collectively as the study of large cardinals.\nIn 1940, Kurt G\u00f6del showed that the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) cannot be \"disproved\" from the axioms of ZFC by showing that both CH and AC hold in his constructible universe: an inner model of ZFC. The existence of a model of ZFC in which additional axioms hold shows that the additional axioms are (relatively) consistent with ZFC. In 1963, Paul Cohen showed that CH cannot be \"proven\" from the ZFC axioms, which showed that CH was independent from ZFC. To prove his result, Cohen developed the method of forcing, which has become a standard tool in set theory. Cohen was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 for his proof.\nComparing sets.\nIntroduction.\nThe basic notions of sets and functions are used to develop the concept of cardinality, and technical terms therein are used throughout this article. A set can be understood as any collection of objects, usually represented with curly braces. For example, formula_22 specifies a set, called formula_23, which contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The symbol formula_24 represents set membership, for example formula_25 says \"1 is a member of the set formula_23\" which is true by the definition of formula_23 above.\nA function is an association that maps elements of one set to the elements of another, often represented with an arrow diagram. For example, the adjacent image depicts a function which maps the set of natural numbers to the set of even numbers by multiplying by 2. If a function does not map two elements to the same place, it is called injective. If a function covers every element in the output space, it is called surjective. If a function is both injective and surjective, it is called bijective. (For further clarification, see \"Bijection, injection and surjection\".)\nEquinumerosity.\nThe intuitive property of two sets having the \"same size\" is that their objects can be paired one-to-one. A one-to-one pairing between two sets defines a bijective function between them by mapping each object to its pair. Similarly, a bijection between two sets defines a pairing of their elements by pairing each object with the one it maps to. Therefore, these notions of \"pairing\" and \"bijection\" are intuitively equivalent. In fact, it is often the case that functions are defined literally as this set of pairings (see \"\"). Thus, the following definition is given:\nTwo sets formula_3 and formula_29 are said to have the \"same cardinality\" if their elements can be paired one-to-one. That is, if there exists a function formula_30 which is bijective. This is written as formula_31 formula_32 formula_33 and eventually formula_34 once formula_4 has been defined. Alternatively, these sets, formula_36 and formula_37 may be said to be \"equivalent\", \"similar\", \"equinumerous\", \"equipotent\", or \"equipollent\". For example, the set formula_38 of non-negative even numbers has the same cardinality as the set formula_39 of natural numbers, since the function formula_40 is a bijection from &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; (see picture above).\nThe intuitive property for finite sets that \"the whole is greater than the part\" is no longer true for infinite sets, and the existence of surjections or injections that don't work does not prove that there is no bijection. For example, the function &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; from &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, defined by formula_41 is injective, but not surjective (since 2, for instance, is not mapped to), and &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; from &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; to &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, defined by formula_42 (see: \"floor function\") is surjective, but not injective, (since 0 and 1 for instance both map to 0). Neither &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; nor &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; can challenge formula_43 which was established by the existence of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;.\nEquivalence.\nA fundamental result necessary in developing a theory of cardinality is relating it to an equivalence relation. A binary relation is an equivalence relation if it satisfies the three basic properties of equality: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.\nSince equinumerosity satisfies these three properties, it forms an equivalence relation. This means that cardinality, in some sense, partitions sets into equivalence classes, and one may assign a representative to denote this class. This motivates the notion of a cardinal number. Somewhat more formally, a relation must be a certain set of ordered pairs. Since there is no set of all sets in standard set theory, equinumerosity is not a relation in the usual sense, but a predicate or a relation over classes.\nInequality.\nA set formula_3 is not larger than a set formula_29 if it can be mapped into formula_29 without overlap. That is, the cardinality of formula_3 is less than or equal to the cardinality of formula_29 if there is an injective function from formula_3 to formula_29. This is written formula_80 formula_81 and eventually formula_82 and read as formula_3 is \"not greater than\" formula_51 or formula_3 is \"dominated by formula_86\" If formula_80 but there is no injection from formula_29 to formula_46 then formula_3 is said to be \"strictly\" smaller than formula_51 written without the underline as formula_92 or formula_93 For example, if formula_3 has four elements and formula_29 has five, then the following are true formula_96 formula_80 and formula_98\nThe basic properties of an inequality are reflexivity (for any formula_99 formula_100), transitivity (if formula_101 and formula_102 then formula_103) and antisymmetry (if formula_101 and formula_105 then formula_106) (See \"Inequality \u00a7 Formal definitions\"). Cardinal inequality formula_107 as defined above is reflexive since the identity function is injective, and is transitive by function composition. Antisymmetry is established by the Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein theorem. The proof roughly goes as follows. \nGiven sets formula_3 and formula_29, where formula_30 is the function that proves formula_111 and formula_112 proves formula_113, then consider the sequence of points given by applying formula_52 then formula_67 to each element over and over. Then we can define a bijection formula_116 as follows: If a sequence forms a cycle, begins with an element formula_117 not mapped to by formula_67, or extends infinitely in both directions, define formula_119 for each formula_120 in those sequences. The last case, if a sequence begins with an element formula_121, not mapped to by formula_52, define formula_123 for each formula_120 in that sequence. Then formula_125 is a bijection.\nThe above shows that cardinal inequality is a partial order. A total order has the additional property that, for any formula_126 and formula_127, either formula_101 or formula_129 This can be established by the well-ordering theorem. Every well-ordered set is isomorphic to a unique ordinal number, called the order type of the set. Then, by comparing their order types, one can show that formula_111 or formula_113. This result is equivalent to the axiom of choice.\nCountability.\nCountable sets.\nA set is called \"countable\" if it is finite or has a bijection with the set of natural numbers formula_132 in which case it is called \"countably infinite\". The term \"denumerable\" is also sometimes used for countably infinite sets. For example, the set of all even natural numbers is countable, and therefore has the same cardinality as the whole set of natural numbers, even though it is a proper subset. Similarly, the set of square numbers is countable, which was considered paradoxical for hundreds of years before modern set theory (cf. \"\"). However, several other examples have historically been considered surprising or initially unintuitive since the rise of set theory.\nThe rational numbers formula_133 are those which can be expressed as the quotient or fraction &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; of two integers. The rational numbers can be shown to be countable by considering the set of fractions as the set of all ordered pairs of integers, denoted formula_134 which can be visualized as the set of all integer points on a grid. Then, an intuitive function can be described by drawing a line in a repeating pattern, or spiral, which eventually goes through each point in the grid. For example, going through each diagonal on the grid for positive fractions, or through a lattice spiral for all integer pairs. These technically over cover the rationals, since, for example, the rational number formula_135 gets mapped to by all the fractions formula_136 as the grid method treats these all as distinct ordered pairs. So this function shows formula_137 not formula_138 This can be corrected by \"skipping over\" these numbers in the grid, using the Schr\u00f6der\u2013Bernstein theorem, or by designing a function which does this naturally, for example using the Calkin\u2013Wilf tree.\nA number is called algebraic if it is a solution of some polynomial equation (with integer coefficients). For example, the square root of two formula_139 is a solution to formula_140 and the rational number formula_141 is the solution to formula_142 Conversely, a number which cannot be the root of any polynomial is called transcendental. Two examples include Euler's number (\"e\") and pi (\u03c0). In general, proving a number is transcendental is considered to be very difficult, and only a few classes of transcendental numbers are known. However, it can be shown that the set of algebraic numbers is countable by ordering the polynomials lexicographically (for example, see \"\"). Since the set of algebraic numbers is countable while the real numbers are uncountable (shown in the following section), the transcendental numbers must form the vast majority of real numbers, even though they are individually much harder to identify. That is to say, almost all real numbers are transcendental.\nHilbert's hotel.\nHilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel is a popular thought experiment devised by the German mathematician David Hilbert to illustrate a counterintuitive property of countably infinite sets, allowing them to have the same cardinality as a proper subset of themselves. The scenario begins by imagining a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, one for each natural number, all of which are occupied. But then a new guest walks in asking for a room. The hotel accommodates by moving the occupant of room 1 to room 2, the occupant of room 2 to room 3, room 3 to room 4, and in general, room n to room n+1. Then every guest still has a room, but room 1 is open for the new guest.\nThen, the scenario continues by imagining an infinitely long bus of new guests seeking a room. The hotel accommodates by moving the person in room 1 to room 2, room 2 to room 4, and in general, room n to room 2n. Thus, all the even-numbered rooms are occupied, but all the odd-numbered rooms are vacant, leaving room for the infinite bus of new guests. The scenario continues further by assuming an infinite number of these infinite buses arrive at the hotel, and showing that the hotel is still able to accommodate. Finally, an infinite bus which has a seat for every real number arrives, and the hotel is no longer able to accommodate.\nUncountable sets.\nA set is called \"uncountable\" if it is not countable; that is, it is infinite and strictly larger than the set of natural numbers. The usual first example of this is the set of real numbers formula_143, which can be understood as the set of all numbers on the number line. One method of proving that the reals are uncountable is called Cantor's diagonal argument, credited to Cantor for his 1891 proof, though his method differs from the more common presentation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nformula_144\nIt begins by assuming, by contradiction, that there is some one-to-one mapping between the natural numbers and the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 (the interval formula_20). Then, take the decimal representation of each real number, for example, formula_146 with a leading zero followed by any sequence of digits. The number 1 is included in this set since 1 \n 0.999... Considering these real numbers in a column, it is always possible to create a new number such that the first digit of the new number is different from that of the first number in the column, the second digit is different from the second number in the column, and so on. The new number must also have a unique decimal representation, that is, it cannot end in repeating nines or repeating zeros. For example, if the digit isn't 2, make the digit of the new number 2, and if it was 2, make it 3. Then, this new number will be different from each of the numbers in the list by at least one digit, and therefore must not be in the list. This shows that the real numbers cannot be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the naturals, and thus must be strictly larger.\nAnother classical example of an uncountable set, established using a related reasoning, is the power set of the natural numbers, denoted formula_147. This is the set of all subsets of formula_148, including the empty set and formula_148 itself. The method is much closer to Cantor's original diagonal argument. Again, assume by contradiction that there exists a one-to-one correspondence formula_52 between formula_148 and formula_147, so that every subset of formula_148 is assigned to some natural number. These subsets are then placed in a column, in the order defined by formula_52 (see image). Now, one may define a subset formula_155 of formula_148 which is not in the list by taking the negation of the \"diagonal\" of this column as follows: \nIf formula_157, then formula_158, that is, if 1 is in the first subset of the list, then 1 is \"not\" in the subset formula_155. Further, if formula_160, then formula_161, that is if the number 2 is not in the second subset of the column, then 2 \"is\" in the subset formula_155. Then in general, for each natural number formula_163, formula_164 if and only if formula_165, meaning formula_163 is put in the subset formula_155 only if the nth subset in the column does not contain the number formula_163. Then, for each natural number formula_163, formula_170, meaning, formula_155 is not the nth subset in the list, for any number formula_163, and so it cannot appear anywhere in the list defined by formula_52. Since formula_52 was chosen arbitrarily, this shows that every function from formula_148 to formula_147 must be missing at least one element, therefore no such bijection can exist, and so formula_147 must be not be countable. \nThese two sets, formula_178 and formula_147 can be shown to have the same cardinality (by, for example, assigning each subset to a decimal expansion) called the cardinality of the continuum. Whether there exists a set formula_3 with cardinality between these two sets formula_181 is known as the continuum hypothesis.\nCantor's theorem generalizes the second theorem above, showing that every set is strictly smaller than its powerset. The proof roughly goes as follows: Given a set formula_3, assume by contradiction that there is a bijection formula_52 from formula_3 to formula_185. Then, the subset formula_186 given by taking the negation of the \"diagonal\", formally, formula_187, cannot be in the list. Therefore, every function is missing at least one element, and so formula_188. Further, since formula_185 is itself a set, the argument can be repeated to show formula_190. Taking formula_191, this shows that formula_192 is even larger than formula_193, which was already shown to be uncountable. Repeating this argument shows that there are infinitely many \"sizes\" of infinity.\nCardinal numbers.\nIn the above sections, \"the cardinality of a set\" was described relationally. In other words, one set could be compared to another, intuitively comparing their \"size\". Cardinal numbers are a means of measuring this \"size\" more explicitly. For finite sets, this is simply the natural number found by counting the elements. This number is called the \"cardinal number\" of that set, or simply \"the cardinality\" of that set. The cardinal number of a set formula_3 is generally denoted by formula_195 with a vertical bar on each side, though it may also be denoted by formula_3, formula_197 or formula_198\nFor infinite sets, \"cardinal number\" is somewhat more difficult to define formally. Cardinal numbers are not usually thought of in terms of their formal definition, but immaterially in terms of their arithmetic/algebraic properties. The assumption that there is \"some\" cardinal function formula_199 which satisfies formula_200, sometimes called the \"axiom of cardinality\" or \"Hume's principle\", is sufficient for deriving most properties of cardinal numbers. \nCommonly in mathematics, if a relation satisfies the properties of an equivalence relation, the objects used to materialize this relation are equivalence classes, which groups all the objects equivalent to one another. These called the \"Frege\u2013Russell\" cardinal numbers. However, this would mean that cardinal numbers are too large to form sets (apart from the cardinal number formula_201 whose only element is the empty set), since, for example, the cardinal number formula_202 would be the set of all sets with one element, and would therefore be a proper class. Thus, due to John von Neumann, it is more common to assign representatives of these classes.\nFinite sets.\nGiven a basic sense of natural numbers, a set is said to have cardinality formula_163 if it can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set formula_204 analogous to counting its elements. For example, the set formula_205 has a natural correspondence with the set formula_206 and therefore is said to have cardinality 4. Other terminologies include \"Its cardinality is 4\" or \"Its cardinal number is 4\". In formal contexts, the natural numbers can be understood as some construction of objects satisfying the Peano axioms.\nShowing that such a correspondence exists is not always trivial. Combinatorics is the area of mathematics primarily concerned with counting, both as a means and as an end to obtaining results, and certain properties of finite structures. The notion cardinality of finite sets is closely tied to many basic combinatorial principles, and provides a set-theoretic foundation to prove them. It can be shown by induction on the possible sizes of sets that finite cardinality corresponds uniquely with natural numbers (cf. \"\"). This is related\u2014though not equivalent\u2014to the pigeonhole principle.\nThe addition principle asserts that given disjoint sets formula_3 and formula_29, formula_209, intuitively meaning that the sum of the parts is equal to the whole. The multiplication principle asserts that given two sets formula_3 and formula_29, formula_212, intuitively meaning that there are formula_213 ways to pair objects from these sets. Both of these can be proven by a bijective proof, together with induction. The more general result is the inclusion\u2013exclusion principle, which defines how to count the number of elements in overlapping sets.\nNaturally, a set is defined to be finite if it is empty or can be put in correspondence with the set formula_204 for some natural number formula_215 However, there exist other definitions of \"finite\" which don't rely on a definition of \"number.\" For example, a set is called Dedekind-finite if it cannot be put in one-to-one correspondece with a proper subset of itself.\nAleph numbers.\nThe aleph numbers are a sequence of cardinal numbers that represent the sizes of infinite sets, denoted with an aleph formula_216 the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The first aleph number is formula_217 called \"aleph-nought\", \"aleph-zero\", or \"aleph-null\", which represents the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers: formula_218 Then, formula_7 represents the next largest cardinality, then formula_220, and so on. The most common way this is formalized in set theory is through Von Neumann ordinals, known as Von Neumann cardinal assignment.\nOrdinal numbers generalize the notion of \"order\" to infinite sets. For example, 2 comes after 1, denoted formula_221 and 3 comes after both, denoted formula_222 Then, one defines a new number, formula_223 which comes after every natural number, denoted formula_224 Further formula_225 and so on. More formally, these ordinal numbers can be defined as follows:\nformula_226 the empty set, formula_227 formula_228 formula_229 and so on. Then one can define formula_230 for example, formula_231 therefore formula_232 Defining formula_233 (a limit ordinal) gives formula_234 the desired property of being the smallest ordinal greater than all finite ordinal numbers. Further, formula_235, and so on.\nSince formula_236 by the natural correspondence, one may define formula_6 as the set of all finite ordinals. That is, formula_238 Then, formula_7 is the set of all countable ordinals (all ordinals formula_240 with cardinality formula_241), the first uncountable ordinal. Since a set cannot contain itself, formula_7 must have a strictly larger cardinality: formula_243 Furthermore, formula_220 is the set of all ordinals with cardinality less than or equal to formula_245 and in general the successor cardinal formula_246is the set of all ordinals with cardinality up to formula_247. Put another way for infinite cardinals, formula_246 is the number of possible well-orderings on formula_247 up to order isomorphism. This is sometimes called the Hartogs number of formula_247. Then, formula_251 for a limit ordinal formula_252 is the union of all lesser alephs. By the well-ordering theorem, there cannot exist any set with cardinality between formula_6 and formula_245 and every infinite set has some cardinality corresponding to some aleph formula_255 for some ordinal formula_256\nCardinal arithmetic.\nBasic arithmetic can be done on cardinal numbers in a very natural way, by extending the theorems for finite combinatorial principles above. The intuitive principle that is formula_3 and formula_29 are disjoint then addition of these sets is simply taking their union, written as formula_209. Thus if formula_3 and formula_29 are infinite, cardinal addition is defined as formula_262 where formula_263 denotes disjoint union. Similarly, the multiplication of two sets is intuitively the number of ways to pair their elements (as in the multiplication principle), therefore cardinal multiplication is defined as formula_264, where formula_265 denotes the Cartesian product. These definitions can be shown to satisfy the basic properties of standard arithmetic:\nCardinal exponentiation formula_271 is defined via set exponentiation, the set of all functions formula_272, that is, formula_273 For finite sets this can be shown to coincide with standard natural number exponentiation, but includes as a corollary that zero to the power of zero is one formula_274 since there is exactly one function from the empty set to itself: the empty function. A combinatorial argument can be used to show formula_275. In general, cardinal exponentiation is not as well-behaved as cardinal addition and multiplication. For example, even though it can be proven that the expression formula_276does indeed correspond to some aleph, it is unprovable from standard set theories which aleph it corresponds to. \nSet of all cardinal numbers.\nThe \"set of all cardinal numbers\" refers to a hypothetical set which contains all cardinal numbers. Such a set cannot exist, which has been considered paradoxical, and related to the Burali-Forti paradox. Using the definition of cardinal numbers as representatives of their cardinalities. It begins by assuming there is some set formula_277 Then, if there is some largest cardinal formula_278 then the powerset formula_279 is strictly greater, and thus not in formula_280 Conversely, if there is no largest element, then the union formula_281 contains the elements of all elements of formula_282 and is therefore greater than or equal to each element. Since there is no largest element in formula_282 for any element formula_284 there is another element formula_285 such that formula_286 and formula_287 Thus, for any formula_284 formula_289 and so formula_290 Thus, the collection of cardinal numbers is too large to form a set, and is a proper class.\nCardinality of the continuum.\nThe number line is a geometric construct of the intuitive notions of \"space\" and \"distance\" wherein each point corresponds to a distinct quantity or position along a continuous path. The terms \"continuum\" and \"continuous\" refer to the totality of this line, having some space (other points) between any two points on the line (dense and archimedian) and the absence of any gaps (completeness), This intuitive construct is formalized by the set of real numbers formula_143 which model the continuum as a complete, densely ordered, uncountable set. \nThe cardinality of the continuum, denoted by \"formula_292\" (a lowercase fraktur script \"c\"), remains invariant under various transformations and mappings, many considered surprising. For example, all intervals on the real line e.g. formula_20, and formula_294, have the same cardinality as the entire set formula_178. First, formula_296 is a bijection from formula_20 to formula_294. Then, the tangent function is a bijection from the interval formula_299 to the whole real line. A more surprising example is the Cantor set, which is defined as follows: take the interval formula_20 and remove the middle third formula_301, then remove the middle third of each of the two remaining segments, and continue removing middle thirds (see image). The Cantor set is the set of points that survive this process. This set that remains is all of the points whose decimal expansion can be written in ternary without a 1. Reinterpreting these decimal expansions as binary (e.g. by replacing the 2s with 1s) gives a bijection between the Cantor set and the interval formula_20.\nSpace-filling curves are continuous surjective maps from the unit interval formula_20 onto the unit square on formula_304, with classical examples such as the Peano curve and Hilbert curve. Although such maps are not injective, they are indeed surjective, and thus suffice to demonstrate cardinal equivalence. They can be reused at each dimension to show that formula_305 for any dimension formula_306 The infinite cartesian product formula_307, can also be shown to have cardinality formula_292. This can be established by cardinal exponentiation: formula_309. Thus, the real numbers, all finite-dimensional real spaces, and the countable cartesian product share the same cardinality.\nAs shown in , the set of real numbers is strictly larger than the set of natural numbers. Specifically, formula_310. The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) asserts that the real numbers have the next largest cardinality after the natural numbers, that is formula_18. As shown by G\u00f6del and Cohen, the continuum hypothesis is independent of ZFC, a standard axiomatization of set theory; that is, it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC\u2014provided that ZFC is consistent. The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) extends this to all infinite cardinals, stating that formula_312 for every ordinal formula_240. Research on CH and GCH continues independent of ZFC, especially in descriptive set theory and through the exploration of large cardinal axioms. Without GHC, the cardinality of formula_178 cannot be written in terms of specific alephs. The Beth numbers provide a concise notation for powersets of the real numbers starting from formula_315, then formula_316, and formula_317, and in general formula_318 and formula_319 if formula_252 is a limit ordinal.\nSkolem's paradox.\nIn model theory, a model corresponds to a specific interpretation of a formal language or theory. It consists of a domain (a set of objects) and an interpretation of the symbols in the language, such that the axioms of the theory are satisfied within this structure. In first-order logic, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem states that if a theory has an infinite model, then it also has models of every other infinite cardinality. Applied to set theory, it asserts that Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, which proves the existence of uncountable sets such as formula_321, nevertheless has a countable model. Thus, Skolem's paradox was posed as follows: how can it be that there exists a domain of set theory which only contains countably many objects, but is capable of satisfying the statement \"there exists a set with uncountably many elements\"?\nSkolem's paradox does not only apply to ZFC, but \"any\" first-order set theory, if it is consistent, has a model which is countable. A mathematical explanation of the paradox, showing that it is not a true contradiction in mathematics, was first given in 1922 by Thoralf Skolem. He explained that the countability or uncountability of a set is not absolute, but relative to the model in which the cardinality is measured. This is because, for example, if the set formula_322 is countable in a model of set theory then there is a bijection formula_323 But a submodel containing formula_322 which excludes all such functions would thus contain no bijection between formula_322 and formula_148, and therefore formula_322 would be uncountable. In second-order and higher-order logics, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem does not hold. This is due to the fact that second-order logic quantifies over all subsets of the domain. Skolem's work was harshly received by Ernst Zermelo, who argued against the limitations of first-order logic and Skolem's notion of \"relativity\", but the result quickly came to be accepted by the mathematical community.\nAlternative and additional axioms.\nAround the turn of the 20th century, set theory turned to an axiomatic approach to avoid rampant foundational issues related to its naive study (cf. \"\"). The most common axiomatic set theory used today is Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). In this system, the relevant axioms include: the Axiom of Infinity, stating roughly \"there is an infinite set\", specifically, a set with cardinality of the natural numbers formula_148; the Axiom of power set, which says that, for any set formula_3, the powerset formula_330 also exists; and the Axiom of Choice, explained below. ZFC has been criticized both for being too strong, and too weak. Similarly, there are many \"natural extensions\" of ZFC studied by set theorists. Thus, there exist many alternative systems of axioms each of which has implications to the standard theory of cardinality discussed above.\nWithout the axiom of choice.\nThe Axiom of Choice (AC) is a fundamental principle in the foundations of mathematics which has seen much controversy in its history. Roughly, it states that given any collection of non-empty sets, it is possible to construct a new set by choosing one element from each set, even if the collection is infinite. In many cases, a set created by choosing elements can be made without invoking the axiom of choice. But it is not possible to do this in general, in which case, the axiom of choice must be invoked.\nIf the Axiom of Choice is assumed to be false in ZF, it has several implications:\nProper classes.\nSome set theories allow for proper classes, which are, roughly, collections \"too large\" to form sets. For example, the Universe of all sets, the class of all cardinal numbers, or the class of all ordinal numbers. Such set theories include Von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory, and Morse\u2013Kelley set theory. In such set theories, some authors find this definition more elegant than assigning representatives, as it more accurately describes the concept by \"definition by abstraction\".\nProper classes can, in a sense, be assigned cardinalities. Cantor originally called the cardinality of a proper class \"Absolute infinite\", denoted with tav (the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet), and associated the concept with God. The first to distinguish between sets and classes was John von Neumann, who formalized the notion of \"too large to form sets\". More accurately, he defined a class to be a proper class if and only if it was equinumerous with the whole Universe of sets (cf. \"Axiom of limitation of size\"). Thus, all proper classes have the same \"size\". The axiom has several implications, mostly relating to the limitation of size principles of early set theory. It implies the axiom of specification, the axiom of replacement, the axiom of union, and the axiom of global choice. \nLarge cardinals.\nLarge cardial axioms assert the existence of cardinal numbers which, as the name suggests, are very large\u2014so large that they cannot be proven to exist within ZFC. For example, an inaccessible cardinal is, roughly, a cardinal that cannot be approached from below using basic set-theoretic operations such as unions, limits, and powersets (more formally, a regular, limit cardinal). Large cardinals are understood in terms of the Von Neumann hierarchy, denoted formula_343 (for some ordinal formula_240), which can be roughly understood as the sets that can be obtained from the empty set, followed by recursively applying the powerset formula_240 times. Specifically, formula_346, formula_347 and formula_348 for a limit ordinal formula_252.\nThere exist many known properties defining large cardinals, which come roughly in a linear higherarchy, in terms of consistency strength. As an analogy, in ZFC without the Axiom of Infinity can only prove the existence of finite sets. Therefore formula_350, whose existence is provable in usual ZFC, can serve as a model of ZFC\u2013Infinity, and thus if ZFC is consistent, ZFC\u2013Infinity is consistent. Analogously, ZFC+\"There exists an inaccessible cardinal\" implies the consistency of ZFC, since if formula_247 is inaccessible, formula_352 can serve as a model of ZFC (cf. \"Grothendieck universe\"). Stronger and stronger large cardinal axioms assert the existence of larger and larger cardinals, each of which proves the consistency of the weaker systems.\nLarge cardinals are at the forefront of set-theoretic research for both practical and philosophical reasons. In a practical sense, it is often the case that unproven or unprovable conjectures can be settled by sufficiently strong large cardinal axioms. In a philosophical sense, according to a platonic view among set-theorists such as W. Hugh Woodin, these axioms simply extend the system to include sets that are \"supposed\" to be considered. That is, there is some fundamental universe of sets, which these axioms grant further access to. For this reason, large cardinal axioms are generally given preference compared to other possible axioms of set theory. This view is controversial among a competing philosophy, sometimes called pluralsim, which posits that set theory should be understood as a multiverse of set theories, but no \"absolute\" or \"true\" model.\nConstructability.\nThe axiom of constructibility was the axiom introduced by Kurt G\u00f6del to prove the relative consistency of the axiom of choice and generalized continuum hypothesis. It states that all sets are \"constructable\" (cf. \"\"). It has several consequences, naturally, including AC and GCH, but resolves several other important questions in set theory. The axiom, however, is not well-accepted by set-theorists, most believing it to be \"too restrictive\". In part it is because the axiom is contradicted by sufficiently strong large cardinal axioms.\nDeterminacy.\nThe Axiom of Determinacy (AD) asserts that certain kinds of mathematical games on the natural numbers are determined; that is, one player will always have a guaranteed winning strategy. The first serious study of the consequences of AD started durring the 1960s in descriptive set theory\u2014which, roughly, studies the definable sets of the real numbers\u2014after it was noticed that it leads to very nice regulatory properties of the real numbers. Specifically, it implies the perfect set property, the property of Baire, and that all sets of real numbers are Lebesgue measurable. However, it was shown that this axiom is inconsistent with AC (cf. \"\"), and thus was never taken as a fundamental axiom of set theory. However, its relationship to and consistency with large cardinals is still of heavy interest among set theorists such as Donald A. Martin, John R. Steel, and W. Hugh Woodin.\nReplacing the Axiom of Choice with the Axiom of Determinacy has several implications:\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

DeMille", "text": "American film director, producer and actor (1881\u20131959)\nCecil Blount DeMille (; August 12, 1881\u00a0\u2013 January 21, 1959), often known in popular culture as Mr. DeMille, was an American filmmaker and actor. Between 1914 and 1958, he made 70 features, both silent and sound films. He is acknowledged as a founding father of American cinema and the most commercially successful producer-director in film history, with many films dominating the box office three or four at a time. His films were distinguished by their epic scale and by his cinematic showmanship. His silent films included social dramas, comedies, Westerns, farces, morality plays, and historical pageants.\nBorn in Ashfield, Massachusetts and raised in New York City, DeMille began his career as a stage actor in 1900. He later began to write and direct stage plays, a few with his older brother William de Mille, and some with Jesse L. Lasky, who was then a vaudeville producer. DeMille's first film, \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), was the first full-length feature film shot in Hollywood. Its interracial love story was commercially successful, and the film marked Hollywood as the new home of the U.S. film industry. Based on continued film successes, DeMille founded Famous Players Lasky which was later reverse merged into Paramount Pictures with Lasky and Adolph Zukor. His first biblical epic, \"The Ten Commandments\" (1923), was both a critical and commercial success; it held the Paramount revenue record for 25 years.\nDeMille directed \"The King of Kings\" (1927), a biography of Jesus, which gained approval for its sensitivity and reached more than 800\u00a0million viewers. \"The Sign of the Cross\" (1932) is said to be the first sound film to integrate all aspects of cinematic technique. \"Cleopatra\" (1934) as his first film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. After more than 30 years in film production, DeMille reached a pinnacle in his career with \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), a biblical epic that became the highest-grossing film of 1950. Along with biblical and historical narratives, he also directed films oriented toward \"neo-naturalism\", which focused on portraying the laws of man fighting the forces of nature.\nDeMille received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director for his circus drama \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), which won both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2014 Drama. His 1956 remake of \"The Ten Commandments\" became his final and best-known film; also a Best Picture Academy Award nominee, it is the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation. In addition to his Best Picture Awards, DeMille received an Academy Honorary Award for his film contributions, the Palme d'Or (posthumously) for \"Union Pacific\" (1939), a DGA Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. He was the first recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, which was named in his honor. DeMille's reputation had a renaissance in the 2010s, and his work has influenced numerous other films and directors.\nBiography.\n1881\u20131899: early years.\nCecil Blount DeMille was of paternal Dutch ancestry. His surname was spelled de Mil before his grandfather William added an \"le\" for \"visual symmetry\".\nAs an adult, Cecil De Mille adopted the spelling \"DeMille\" because he believed it would look better on a marquee, but continued to use \"de Mille\" in private life. The family name \"de Mille\" was used by his children Cecilia, John, Richard, and Katherine. Cecil's brother, William, and his daughters, Margaret and Agnes, as well as DeMille's granddaughter, Cecilia de Mille Presley, also used the \"de Mille\" spelling.\nDeMille was born on August 12, 1881, in a boarding house on Main Street in Ashfield, Massachusetts, where his parents had been vacationing for the summer. On September 1, 1881, the family returned with the newborn DeMille to their flat in New York. DeMille was named after his grandmothers Cecilia Wolff and Margarete Blount. He was the second of three children of Henry Churchill de Mille (September 4, 1853 \u2013 February 10, 1893) and his wife, Matilda Beatrice deMille (n\u00e9e Samuel; January 30, 1853 \u2013 October 8, 1923), known as Beatrice. His older brother, William C. deMille, was born on July 25, 1878.\nHenry de Mille, whose ancestors were of English and Dutch-Belgian descent, was a North Carolina-born dramatist, actor, and lay reader in the Episcopal Church. In New York, Henry also taught English at Columbia College (now Columbia University). He worked as a playwright, administrator, and faculty member during the early years of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, established in New York City in 1884. Henry de Mille frequently collaborated with David Belasco in playwriting; their best-known collaborations included \"The Wife\", \"Lord Chumley\", \"The Charity Ball\", and \"Men and Women\".\nCecil B. DeMille's mother, Beatrice, a literary agent and scriptwriter, was the daughter of German Jews. She had emigrated from England with her parents in 1871 when she was 18; the newly arrived family settled in Brooklyn, New York, where they maintained a middle-class, English-speaking household.\nDeMille's parents met as members of a music and literary society in New York. Henry was a tall, red-headed student. Beatrice was intelligent, educated, forthright, and strong-willed. They married on July 1, 1876, despite Beatrice's parents' objections because of the young couple's differing religions; Beatrice converted to Episcopalianism.\nDeMille was a brave and confident child. He gained his love of theater while watching his father and Belasco rehearse their plays. A lasting memory for DeMille was a lunch with his father and actor Edwin Booth. As a child, DeMille created an alter ego, Champion Driver, a Robin Hood-like character, evidence of his creativity and imagination.\nHis father and his family had lived in Washington, North Carolina, until Henry built a three-story Victorian-style house for his family in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey; they named this estate \"Pamlico\". John Philip Sousa was a friend of the family, and DeMille recalled throwing mud balls in the air so neighbor Annie Oakley could practice her shooting. DeMille's sister, Agnes, was born on April 23, 1891; his mother nearly did not survive the birth. Agnes died on February 11, 1894, from spinal meningitis.\nDeMille's parents operated a private school in Pompton Lakes and attended Christ Episcopal Church. DeMille recalled that this church was the place where he visualized the story of his 1923 version of \"The Ten Commandments\".\nOn January 8, 1893, at age 40, Henry de Mille died suddenly from typhoid fever, leaving Beatrice with three children. To provide for her family, she opened the Henry C. de Mille School for Girls in her home in February 1893. The aim of the school was to teach young women to properly understand and fulfill the women's duty to themselves, their home, and their country. Beatrice had \"enthusiastically supported\" Henry's theatrical aspirations. She later became the second female play broker on Broadway. On Henry's deathbed, he told his wife that he did not want his sons to become playwrights. DeMille's mother sent him to Pennsylvania Military College (now Widener University) in Chester, Pennsylvania, at age 15. He fled the school to join the Spanish\u2013American War, but failed to meet the age requirement. At the military college, even though his grades were average, he reportedly excelled in personal conduct.\nDeMille attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts (tuition-free due to his father's service to the academy). He graduated in 1900, and for graduation, his performance was the play \"The Arcady Trail\". In the audience was Charles Frohman, who cast DeMille in his play \"Hearts are Trumps\", DeMille's Broadway debut.\nDeMille was an active Freemason and member of Prince of Orange Lodge #16 in New York City.\n1900\u20131912: theater.\nCharles Frohman, Constance Adams, and David Belasco.\nCecil B. DeMille began his career as an actor on stage in 1900 in the theatrical company of Charles Frohman. He debuted on February 21, 1900, in the play \"Hearts Are Trumps\" at New York's Garden Theater. In 1901, DeMille starred in productions of \"A Repentance\", \"To Have and to Hold\", and \"Are You a Mason?\" At age 21, he married Constance Adams on August 16, 1902, at Adams's father's home in East Orange, New Jersey. The wedding party was small. Beatrice DeMille's family did not attend. Simon Louvish suggests that this was to conceal DeMille's partial Jewish heritage. Adams was 29 years old at the time of the marriage. They had met in a theater in Washington D.C. while they were both acting in \"Hearts Are Trumps\".\nThey were sexually incompatible; according to DeMille, Adams was too \"pure\" to \"feel such violent and evil passions\" as he. DeMille had more violent sexual preferences and fetishes than his wife. Adams allowed DeMille to have several long-term mistresses during their marriage as an outlet while maintaining an appearance of a faithful marriage. One of DeMille's affairs was with his screenwriter Jeanie MacPherson. Despite his reputation for extramarital affairs, DeMille did not like to have affairs with his stars, as he believed it would cause him to lose control as a director. He once said he maintained his self-control when Gloria Swanson sat on his lap, and refused to touch her.\nIn 1902, he played a small part in \"Hamlet\". Publicists wrote that he became an actor in order to learn how to direct and produce, but DeMille admitted that he became an actor in order to pay the bills. From 1904 to 1905, he attempted to make a living as a stock theater actor with his wife, Constance. DeMille made a 1905 reprise in \"Hamlet\" as Osric. In the summer of 1905, DeMille joined the stock cast at the Elitch Theatre in Denver, Colorado. He appeared in 11 of the 15 plays presented that season, all in minor roles. Maude Fealy was the featured actress in several productions that summer and developed a lasting friendship with DeMille. (He later cast her in \"The Ten Commandments\".)\nHis brother, William, was establishing himself as a playwright and sometimes invited DeMille to collaborate. DeMille and William collaborated on \"The Genius\", \"The Royal Mounted\", and \"After Five\". None of these was very successful. William de Mille was most successful when he worked alone.\nDeMille and his brother at times worked with the legendary impresario David Belasco, who had been a friend and collaborator of their father. DeMille later adapted Belasco's \"The Girl of the Golden West\", \"Rose of the Rancho\", and \"The Warrens of Virginia\" into films. He was credited with the conception of Belasco's \"The Return of Peter Grimm\". \"The Return of Peter Grimm\" sparked controversy, because Belasco had taken DeMille's unnamed screenplay, changed the characters, and named it \"The Return of Peter Grimm\", producing and presenting it as his own work. DeMille was credited in small print as \"based on an idea by Cecil DeMille\". The play was successful, and DeMille was distraught that his childhood idol had plagiarized his work.\nLosing interest in theater.\nDeMille performed on stage with actors he later directed in films: Charlotte Walker, Mary Pickford, and Pedro de Cordoba. He also produced and directed plays. His 1905 performance in \"The Prince Chap\" as the Earl of Huntington was well received by audiences.\nDeMille wrote a few of his own plays in between stage performances, but his playwriting was less successful. His first play was \"The Pretender-A Play in a Prologue and 4 Acts\" set in 17th-century Russia. Another unperformed play he wrote was \"Son of the Winds\", a mythological Native American story. Life was difficult for DeMille and his wife as traveling actors, but travel allowed him to experience parts of the United States he had not yet seen. DeMille sometimes worked with the director E. H. Sothern, who influenced DeMille's later perfectionism. In 1907, due to a scandal with one of Beatrice's students, Evelyn Nesbit, the Henry de Mille School lost students. The school closed, and Beatrice filed for bankruptcy. DeMille wrote another play originally called \"Sergeant Devil May Care\" and renamed \"The Royal Mounted\". He also toured with the Standard Opera Company, but there are few records of his singing ability.\nOn November 5, 1908, Constance and DeMille had a daughter, Cecilia, their only biological child. In the 1910s, DeMille began directing and producing other writers' plays.\nDeMille was poor and struggled to find work. Consequently, his mother hired him for her agency, The DeMille Play Company, and taught him how to be an agent and a playwright. He became the agency's manager and later a junior partner with his mother. In 1911, DeMille became acquainted with vaudeville producer Jesse Lasky when Lasky was searching for a writer for his new musical. He initially sought out William deMille. William had been a successful playwright, but DeMille was suffering from the failure of his plays \"The Royal Mounted\" and \"The Genius\".\nBeatrice introduced Lasky to Cecil DeMille instead. The collaboration of DeMille and Lasky produced a successful musical, \"California\", which opened in New York in January 1912. Another DeMille-Lasky production that opened in January 1912 was \"The Antique Girl\". In the spring of 1913, DeMille found success producing \"Reckless Age\" by Lee Wilson, a play about a high-society girl wrongly accused of manslaughter, starring Frederick Burton and Sydney Shields. But changes in the theater rendered DeMille's melodramas obsolete before they were produced, and true theatrical success eluded him. He produced many flops. Having become uninterested in working in theater, DeMille became ignited by passion for film when he watched the 1912 French film \"Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth\".\n1913\u20131914: entering films.\nDesiring a change of scene, DeMille, Lasky, Sam Goldfish (later Samuel Goldwyn), and a group of East Coast businessmen created the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company in 1913, of which DeMille became director-general. Lasky and DeMille were said to have sketched out the organization of the company on the back of a restaurant menu. As director-general, DeMille's job was to make the films. In addition to directing, he was the supervisor and consultant for the first year of films the company made. Sometimes, he directed scenes for other directors at the company in order to release films on time. Moreover, he co-authored other Lasky Company scripts and created screen adaptations that others directed.\nThe Lasky Play Company tried to recruit William de Mille, but he rejected the offer because he did not believe there was any promise in a film career. When William found out that DeMille had begun working in the motion picture industry, he wrote his brother a letter, saying that he was disappointed that Cecil was willing \"to throw away [his] future\" when he was \"born and raised in the finest traditions of the theater\".\nThe Lasky Company wanted to attract high-class audiences to their films, so it began producing films from literary works. The company bought the rights to Edwin Milton Royle's play \"The Squaw Man\" and cast Dustin Farnum in the lead role. It offered Farnum a choice between a quarter stock in the company or $250 in weekly salary. Farnum chose the salary. Already $15,000 in debt to Royle for the screenplay of \"The Squaw Man\", Lasky's relatives bought the $5,000 stock to save the Lasky Company from bankruptcy. With no knowledge of filmmaking, DeMille was introduced to observe the process at film studios. He was eventually introduced to Oscar Apfel, a stage director who had been a director with the Edison Company.\nOn December 12, 1913, DeMille, his cast, and crew boarded a Southern Pacific train bound for Flagstaff via New Orleans. His tentative plan was to shoot a film in Arizona, but he felt that Arizona lacked the Western look they were searching for. They also learned that other filmmakers were successfully shooting in Los Angeles, even in winter. He continued to Los Angeles. Once there, he chose not to shoot in Edendale, where many studios were, but in Hollywood. DeMille rented a barn to function as their film studio. Filming began on December 29, 1913, and lasted three weeks. Apfel filmed most of \"The Squaw Man\" due to DeMille's inexperience, but DeMille learned quickly and was particularly adept at impromptu screenwriting as necessary. He made his first film run 60 minutes, as long as a short play. \"The Squaw Man\" (1914), co-directed by Apfel, was a sensation, and it established the Lasky Company. It was the first feature-length film made in Hollywood. There were problems with the perforation of the film stock, and it was discovered the DeMille had brought a cheap British film perforator that had punched in 65 holes per foot instead of the industry standard of 64. Lasky and DeMille convinced film pioneer Siegmund Lubin of the Lubin Manufacturing Company to have his experienced technicians reperforate the film.\nThis was the first American feature film, according to its release date. D.\u00a0W. Griffith's \"Judith of Bethulia\" was filmed earlier than \"The Squaw Man\", but released later. This as the only film in which DeMille shared director's credit with Apfel.\n\"The Squaw Man\" was a success, which led to the eventual founding of Paramount Pictures and Hollywood becoming the \"film capital of the world\". The film grossed more than ten times its budget after its New York premiere in February 1914. DeMille's next project was to aid Apfel in directing \"Brewster's Millions\", which was wildly successful. In December 1914, Constance Adams brought home John DeMille, a 15-month-old boy, whom the couple legally adopted three years later. Biographer Scott Eyman suggested that she may have decided to adopt after recently having had a miscarriage.\n1915\u20131928: silent era.\nWesterns, Paradise, and World War I.\nCecil B. DeMille's second film, credited exclusively to him, was \"The Virginian\". It is the earliest of DeMille's films available in a quality, color-tinted video format, but that version is actually a 1918 rerelease. The Lasky Company's first few years were spent making films nonstop. DeMille directed 20 films by 1915. The most successful films during this period were \"Brewster's Millions\" (co-directed by DeMille), \"Rose of the Rancho\", and \"The Ghost Breaker\". DeMille adapted Belasco's dramatic lighting techniques to film technology, mimicking moonlight with U.S. cinema's first attempts at \"motivated lighting\" in \"The Warrens of Virginia\". This was the first of a few film collaborations with his brother William. They struggled to adapt the play from the stage to the set. After the film was shown, viewers complained that the shadows and lighting prevented the audience from seeing the actors' full faces and said they would pay only half price. Sam Goldwyn suggested that if they called it \"Rembrandt\" lighting, the audience would pay double the price. Additionally, because of DeMille's cordiality after the \"Peter Grimm\" incident, DeMille was able to rekindle his partnership with Belasco. He adapted several of Belasco's screenplays into film.\nDeMille's most successful film was \"The Cheat\"; his direction in the film was acclaimed. In 1916, exhausted from three years of nonstop filmmaking, DeMille purchased land in the Angeles National Forest for a ranch that would become his getaway. He called this place \"Paradise\", declaring it a wildlife sanctuary; no shooting of animals besides snakes was allowed. His wife did not like Paradise, so DeMille often brought his mistresses there with him, including actress Julia Faye. In 1921, DeMille purchased a yacht he called \"The Seaward\".\nWhile filming \"The Captive\" in 1915, an extra, Charles Chandler, died on set when another extra failed to heed DeMille's orders to unload all guns for rehearsal. DeMille instructed the guilty man to leave town and never revealed his name. Lasky and DeMille maintained Chandler's widow on the payroll and, according to leading actor House Peters Sr., DeMille refused to stop production for Chandler's funeral. Peters said that he encouraged the cast to attend the funeral with him anyway since DeMille would not be able to shoot the film without him. On July 19, 1916, the Jesse Lasky Feature Play Company merged with Adolph Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, becoming Famous Players\u2013Lasky. Zukor became president, Lasky vice president, DeMille director-general, and Goldwyn chairman of the board. Famous Players\u2013Lasky later fired Goldwyn for frequent clashes with Lasky, DeMille, and Zukor. While on a European vacation in 1921, DeMille contracted rheumatic fever in Paris. He was confined to bed and unable to eat. His poor physical condition upon his return home affected the production of his 1922 film \"Manslaughter\". According to Richard Birchard, DeMille's weakened state during production may have led to the film being received as uncharacteristically substandard.\nDuring World War I, the Famous Players\u2013Lasky organized a military company underneath the National Guard, the Home Guard, made up of film studio employees, with DeMille as captain. Eventually, the Guard was enlarged to a battalion and recruited soldiers from other film studios. They took time off weekly to practice military drills. Additionally, during the war, DeMille volunteered for the Justice Department's Intelligence Office, investigating friends, neighbors, and others he came in contact with in connection with the Famous Players\u2013Lasky. He also volunteered for the Intelligence Office during World War II. DeMille considered enlisting in World War I, but stayed in the U.S. and made films. He did take a few months to set up a movie theater for the French front. Famous Players\u2013Lasky donated the films. DeMille and Adams adopted Katherine Lester in 1920, whom Adams had found in the orphanage she directed. In 1922, the couple adopted Richard deMille.\nScandalous dramas, Biblical epics, and departure from Paramount.\nFilm started becoming more sophisticated and the Lasky company's subsequent films were criticized for primitive and unrealistic set design. Consequently, Beatrice deMille introduced the Famous Players\u2013Lasky to Wilfred Buckland, whom DeMille knew from his time at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and he became DeMille's art director. William deMille reluctantly became a story editor. William later converted from theater to Hollywood and spent the rest of his career as a film director. DeMille frequently remade his own films. In 1917, he remade \"The Squaw Man\" (1918), only four years after the original. Despite its quick turnaround, the film was fairly successful. DeMille's second remake at MGM in 1931 was a failure.\nAfter five years and 30 hit films, DeMille became the American film industry's most successful director. In the silent era, he was renowned for \"Male and Female\" (1919), \"Manslaughter\" (1922), \"The Volga Boatman\" (1926), and \"The Godless Girl\" (1928). His trademark scenes included bathtubs, lion attacks, and Roman orgies. Many of his films featured scenes in two-color Technicolor. In 1923, DeMille released the modern melodrama \"The Ten Commandments\", a significant change from his previous irreligious films. The film was produced on a budget of $600,000, Paramount's most expensive production. This concerned Paramount executives, but the film was the studio's highest-grossing film. It held the Paramount record for 25 years until DeMille broke the record again.\nIn the early 1920s, scandal surrounded Paramount; religious groups and the media opposed portrayals of immorality in films. A censorship board called the Hays Code was established. DeMille's film \"The Affairs of Anatol\" came under fire. Furthermore, DeMille argued with Zukor over his extravagant and over-budget production costs. Consequently, DeMille left Paramount in 1924 despite having helped establish it. He joined the Producers Distributing Corporation. His first film in the new production company, DeMille Pictures Corporation, was \"The Road to Yesterday\" in 1925. He directed and produced four films on his own, working with Producers Distributing Corporation because he found front office supervision too restricting. Aside from \"The King of Kings,\" none of DeMille's films away from Paramount were successful. \"The King of Kings\" established DeMille as \"master of the grandiose and of biblical sagas\". Considered at the time the most successful Christian film of the silent era, DeMille calculated that it had been viewed over 800 million times around the world. After the release of DeMille's \"The Godless Girl\", silent films in America became obsolete, and DeMille was forced to shoot a shoddy final reel with the new sound production technique. Although this final reel looked so different from the first 11 reels that it appeared to be from another movie, according to Simon Louvish, the film is one of DeMille's strangest and most \"DeMillean\" film.\nThe immense popularity of DeMille's silent films enabled him to branch out into other areas. The Roaring Twenties were the boom years and DeMille took full advantage, opening the Mercury Aviation Company, one of America's first commercial airlines. He was also a real estate speculator, an underwriter of political campaigns, vice president of Bank of America, and vice president of the Commercial National Trust and Savings Bank in Los Angeles, where he approved loans for other filmmakers. In 1916, DeMille purchased a mansion in Hollywood. Charlie Chaplin lived next door for a time, and after he moved, DeMille purchased the other house and combined the estates.\n1929\u20131956: sound era.\nMGM and return to Paramount.\nWhen \"talking pictures\" were invented in 1928, DeMille made a successful transition, offering his own innovations to the painful process; he devised a microphone boom and a soundproof camera blimp. He also popularized the camera crane. His first three sound films, \"Dynamite\", \"Madame Satan\", and his 1931 remake of \"The Squaw Man\", were produced at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. These films were critically and financially unsuccessful. He had completely adapted to the production of sound film despite the film's poor dialogue. After his contract ended at MGM, he left, but no production studios would hire him. He attempted to create a guild of a half a dozen directors with the same creative desires called the Director's Guild, but the idea failed due to lack of funding and commitment. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service audited DeMille due to issues with his production company. This was, according to DeMille, the lowest point of his career. He traveled abroad to find employment until he was offered a deal at Paramount.\nIn 1932, DeMille returned to Paramount at Lasky's request, bringing with him his own production unit. His first film back at Paramount, \"The Sign of the Cross\", was also his first success since leaving Paramount besides \"The King of Kings\". Zukor approved DeMille's return on the condition that DeMille not exceed his production budget of $650,000 for \"The Sign of the Cross\". Produced in eight weeks without exceeding budget, the film was financially successful. \"The Sign of the Cross\" was the first film to integrate all cinematic techniques. The film was considered a \"masterpiece\" and surpassed the quality of other sound films of the time. DeMille followed this epic with two dramas released in 1933 and 1934, \"This Day and Age\" and \"Four Frightened People\". These were box-office disappointments, though \"Four Frightened People\" received good reviews. DeMille stuck to large-budget spectaculars for the rest of his career.\nPolitics and \"Lux Radio Theatre\".\nDeMille was outspoken about his Episcopalian integrity, but his private life included mistresses and adultery. He was a conservative Republican activist, becoming more conservative as he aged. He was known as anti-union and worked to prevent the unionization of film production studios. But according to DeMille himself, he was not anti-union and belonged to a few unions. He said he was rather against union leaders such as Walter Reuther and Harry Bridges, whom he compared to dictators. He supported Herbert Hoover and in 1928 made his largest campaign donation to Hoover. But DeMille also liked Franklin D. Roosevelt, finding him charismatic, tenacious, and intelligent, and agreeing with Roosevelt's abhorrence of Prohibition. DeMille lent Roosevelt a car for his 1932 United States presidential election campaign and voted for him. He never again voted for a Democratic candidate in a presidential election.\nFrom June 1, 1936, until January 22, 1945, DeMille hosted and directed \"Lux Radio Theatre\", a weekly digest of current feature films. Broadcast on the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) from 1935 to 1954, \"Lux Radio\" was one of the most popular weekly shows in radio history. While DeMille was host, the show had 40 million weekly listeners and DeMille had an annual salary of $100,000. From 1936 to 1945, he produced, hosted, and directed every show, with the occasional exception of a guest director. He resigned from \"Lux Radio\" because he refused to pay a dollar to the American Federation of Radio Artists (AFRA), on the principle that no organization had the right to \"levy a compulsory assessment upon any member\".\nDeMille sued the union for reinstatement but lost. He appealed to the California Supreme Court and lost again. When the AFRA expanded to television, DeMille was banned from television appearances. Consequently, he formed the DeMille Foundation for Political Freedom to campaign for the right to work. He gave speeches across the nation for the next few years. DeMille's primary criticism was of closed shops, but later included criticism of communism and unions in general. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review his case, but DeMille lobbied for the Taft\u2013Hartley Act, which passed. It prohibited denying anyone the right to work if they refuse to pay a political assessment. But the law did not apply retroactively, so DeMille's television and radio appearance ban lasted the rest of his life, though he was permitted to appear on radio or television to publicize a movie. William Keighley replaced him. DeMille never worked in radio again.\nAdventure films and dramatic spectacles.\nIn 1939, DeMille's \"Union Pacific\" was successful through DeMille's collaboration with the Union Pacific Railroad. The Union Pacific gave DeMille access to historical data, early period trains, and expert crews, adding to the film's authenticity. During pre-production, DeMille was dealing with his first serious health issue. In March 1938, he underwent a major emergency prostatectomy. He had a post-surgery infection from which he nearly did not recover, citing streptomycin as his saving grace. The surgery caused him to suffer from sexual dysfunction for the rest of his life, according to some family members. After his surgery and the success of \"Union Pacific\", DeMille first used three-strip Technicolor in 1940, in \"North West Mounted Police\". DeMille wanted to film in Canada, but due to budget constraints, the film was instead shot in Oregon and Hollywood. Critics were impressed with the visuals but found the scripts dull, calling it DeMille's \"poorest Western\". Despite the criticism, it was Paramount's highest-grossing film of the year. Audiences liked its highly saturated color, so DeMille made no further black-and-white features. DeMille was anti-communist and abandoned a project in 1940 to film Ernest Hemingway's \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" due to its communist themes, even though he had already paid $100,000 for the rights to the novel. He was so eager to produce the film that he hadn't yet read it. He claimed he abandoned the project in order to complete a different project, but it was actually to preserve his reputation and avoid appearing reactionary. While concurrently filmmaking, he served during World War II at age 60 as his neighborhood air-raid warden.\nIn 1942, DeMille worked with Jeanie MacPherson and William deMille to produce a film, \"Queen of Queens\", that was intended to be about Mary, mother of Jesus. After reading the screenplay, Daniel A. Lord warned DeMille that Catholics would find the film too irreverent while non-Catholics would consider it Catholic propaganda. Consequently, the film was never made. MacPherson worked as a scriptwriter on many of DeMille's films. In 1938, DeMille supervised the film compilation \"Land of Liberty\" as the American film industry's contribution to the 1939 New York World's Fair. He used clips from his own films in it. \"Land of Liberty\" was not high-grossing, but it was well-received, and DeMille was asked to shorten its running time to allow for more showings per day. MGM distributed the film in 1941 and donated profits to World War II relief charities.\nIn 1942, DeMille released Paramount's most successful film, \"Reap the Wild Wind\". It had a large budget and many special effects, including an electronically operated giant squid. After working on it, DeMille was the master of ceremonies at a rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey\u2013Bricker presidential ticket as well as Governor Earl Warren of California. DeMille's 1947 film \"Unconquered\" had the longest running time (146 minutes), longest filming schedule (102 days), and largest budget ($5\u00a0million). Its sets and effects were so realistic that 30 extras needed to be hospitalized due to a scene with fireballs and flaming arrows. It was commercially very successful.\nDeMille's next film, \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), was Paramount's highest-grossing film up to that time. A Biblical epic with sex, it was a characteristically DeMille film. 1952's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" became Paramount's highest-grossing film to that point and won the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Academy Award for Best Story. It began production in 1949. Ringling Brothers-Barnum and Bailey were paid $250,000 for use of the title and facilities. DeMille toured with the circus while helping write the script. Noisy and bright, the film was not well-liked by critics but was an audience favorite. In 1953, DeMille signed a contract with Prentice Hall to publish an autobiography. He reminisced into a voice recorder, the recording was transcribed, and the information was organized by topic. Art Arthur also interviewed people for the autobiography. DeMille did not like the biography's first draft, saying he thought the person portrayed in it was an egotistical \"SOB\". In the early 1950s, Allen Dulles and Frank Wisner recruited DeMille to serve on the board of the anti-communist National Committee for a Free Europe, the public face of the organization that oversaw Radio Free Europe. In 1954, Secretary of the Air Force Harold E. Talbott asked DeMille for help designing the cadet uniforms at the newly established United States Air Force Academy. DeMille's designs, most notably that of the cadet parade uniform, were praised by Air Force and Academy leadership, adopted, and still worn.\nFinal works and unrealized projects.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe have just lived through a war where our people were systematically executed. Here we have a man who made a film praising the Jewish people, that tells of Samson, one of the legends of our Scripture. Now he wants to make the life of Moses. We should get down on our knees to Cecil and say \"Thank you!\"\n\u2013 Alfred Zukor responding to DeMille's proposal of \"The Ten Commandments\" remake\nIn 1952, DeMille sought approval for a lavish remake of his 1923 silent film \"The Ten Commandments\". He went before the Paramount board of directors, which was mostly Jewish-American. The board rejected his proposal, even though his last two films, \"Samson and Delilah\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", had been record-breaking hits. Adolph Zukor convinced the board to change its mind on the grounds of morality. DeMille did not have an exact budget proposal for the project, and it promised to be the most costly in U.S. film history. Still, the board unanimously approved it. \"The Ten Commandments\", released in 1956, was DeMille's final film. It was the longest (3 hours, 39 minutes) and most expensive ($13\u00a0million) film in Paramount history. Production began in October 1954. The Exodus scene was filmed on-site in Egypt with four Technicolor-VistaVision cameras filming 12,000 people. Filming continued in 1955 in Paris and Hollywood on 30 different sound stages. They even expanded to RKO sound studios for filming. Post-production lasted a year, and the film premiered in Salt Lake City. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, it grossed over $80\u00a0million, which surpassed the gross of \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" and every other film in history except \"Gone with the Wind\". DeMille offered ten percent of his profit to the crew, a unique practice at the time.\nOn November 7, 1954, while in Egypt filming the Exodus sequence for \"The Ten Commandments\", DeMille (who was 73) climbed a ladder to the top of the set and had a serious heart attack. Despite the urging of his associate producer, DeMille wanted to return to the set right away. He developed a plan with his doctor to allow him to continue directing while reducing his physical stress. DeMille completed the film, but his health was diminished by several more heart attacks. His daughter Cecilia took over as director as DeMille sat behind the camera with Loyal Griggs as the cinematographer. This film was his last.\nDue to his frequent heart attacks, DeMille asked his son-in-law, actor Anthony Quinn, to direct a remake of his 1938 film \"The Buccaneer\". DeMille served as executive producer, overseeing producer Henry Wilcoxon. Despite a cast led by Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner, the 1958 film \"The Buccaneer\" was a disappointment. DeMille attended its Santa Barbara premiere in December 1958. He was unable to attend its Los Angeles premiere. In the months before his death, DeMille was researching a film biography of Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement. DeMille asked David Niven to star in the film, but it was never made. DeMille also was planning a film about the space race and a biblical epic based on the Book of Revelation. His autobiography was mostly complete when he died, and was published in November 1959.\nDeath.\nDeMille suffered a series of heart attacks from June 1958 to January 1959, and died on January 21, 1959, following an attack. His funeral was held on January 23 at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. He was entombed at the Hollywood Memorial Cemetery (now known as Hollywood Forever). After his death, news outlets such as \"The New York Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Guardian\" called DeMille a \"pioneer of movies\", \"the greatest creator and showman of our industry\", and \"the founder of Hollywood\". DeMille left his multi-million dollar estate in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, in Laughlin Park to his daughter Cecilia because his wife had dementia and was unable to care for an estate. She died a year later. His personal will drew a line between Cecilia and his three adopted children, with Cecilia receiving a majority of DeMille's inheritance and estate. The other three children were surprised by this, as DeMille had not treated them differently in life. Cecilia lived in the house until her death in 1984. The house was auctioned by his granddaughter Cecilia DeMille Presley, who also lived there in the late 1980s.\nFilmmaking.\nInfluences.\nDeMille believed his first influences to be his parents, Henry and Beatrice DeMille. His playwright father introduced him to the theater at a young age. Henry was heavily influenced by the work of Charles Kingsley, whose ideas trickled down to DeMille. DeMille noted that his mother had a \"high sense of the dramatic\" and was determined to continue the artistic legacy of her husband after he died. Beatrice became a play broker and author's agent, influencing DeMille's early life and career. DeMille's father worked with David Belasco who was a theatrical producer, impresario, and playwright. Belasco was known for adding realistic elements in his plays such as real flowers, food, and aromas that could transport his audiences into the scenes. While working in theatre, DeMille used real fruit trees in his play \"California\", as influenced by Belasco. Similar to Belasco, DeMille's theatre revolved around entertainment rather than artistry. Generally, Belasco's influence of DeMille's career can be seen in DeMille's showmanship and narration. E. H. Sothern's early influence on DeMille's work can be seen in DeMille's perfectionism. DeMille recalled that one of the most influential plays he saw was \"Hamlet\", directed by Sothern.\nMethod.\nDeMille's filmmaking process always began with extensive research. Next, he would work with writers to develop the story that he was envisioning. Then, he would help writers construct a script. Finally, he would leave the script with artists and allow them to create artistic depictions and renderings of each scene. Plot and dialogue were not a strong point of DeMille's films. Consequently, he focused his efforts on his films' visuals. He worked with visual technicians, editors, art directors, costume designers, cinematographers, and set carpenters in order to perfect the visual aspects of his films. With his editor, Anne Bauchens, DeMille used editing techniques to allow the visual images to bring the plot to climax rather than dialogue. DeMille had large and frequent office conferences to discuss and examine all aspects of the working film including story-boards, props, and special effects.\nDeMille rarely gave direction to actors; he preferred to \"office-direct\", where he would work with actors in his office, going over characters and reading through scripts. Any problems on the set were often fixed by writers in the office rather than on the set. DeMille did not believe a large movie set was the place to discuss minor character or line issues. DeMille was particularly adept at directing and managing large crowds in his films. Martin Scorsese recalled that DeMille had the skill to maintain control of not only the lead actors in a frame but the many extras in the frame as well. DeMille was adept at directing \"thousands of extras\", and many of his pictures include spectacular set pieces: the toppling of the pagan temple in \"Samson and Delilah\"; train wrecks in \"The Road to Yesterday\", \"Union Pacific\" and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\"; the destruction of an airship in \"Madam Satan\"; and the parting of the Red Sea in both versions of \"The Ten Commandments\".\nIn his early films, DeMille experimented with photographic light and shade, which created dramatic shadows instead of glare. His specific use of lighting, influenced by his mentor David Belasco, was for the purpose of creating \"striking images\" and heightening \"dramatic situations\". DeMille was unique in using this technique. In addition to his use of volatile and abrupt film editing, his lighting and composition were innovative for the time period as filmmakers were primarily concerned with a clear, realistic image. Another important aspect of DeMille's editing technique was to put the film away for a week or two after an initial edit in order to re-edit the picture with a fresh mind. This allowed for the rapid production of his films in the early years of the Lasky Company. The cuts were sometimes rough, but the movies were always interesting.\nDeMille often edited in a manner that favored psychological space rather than physical space through his cuts. In this way, the characters' thoughts and desires are the visual focus rather than the circumstances regarding the physical scene. As DeMille's career progressed, he increasingly relied on artist Dan Sayre Groesbeck's concept, costume, and storyboard art. Groesbeck's art was circulated on set to give actors and crew members a better understanding of DeMille's vision. His art was even shown at Paramount meetings when pitching new films. DeMille adored the art of Groesbeck, even hanging it above his fireplace, but film staff found it difficult to convert his art into three-dimensional sets. As DeMille continued to rely on Groesbeck, the nervous energy of his early films transformed into more steady compositions of his later films. While visually appealing, this made the films appear more old-fashioned.\nComposer Elmer Bernstein described DeMille as \"sparing no effort\" when filmmaking. Bernstein recalled that DeMille would scream, yell, or flatter\u2014whatever it took to achieve the perfection he required in his films. DeMille was painstakingly attentive to details on set and was as critical of himself as he was of his crew. Costume designer Dorothy Jeakins, who worked with DeMille on \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956), said that he was skilled in humiliating people. Jeakins admitted that she received quality training from him, but that it was necessary to become a perfectionist on a DeMille set to avoid being fired. DeMille had an authoritarian persona on set; he required absolute attention from the cast and crew. He had a band of assistants who catered to his needs. He would speak to the entire set, sometimes enormous with countless numbers of crew members and extras, via a microphone to maintain control of the set. He was disliked by many inside and outside of the film industry for his cold and controlling reputation.\nDeMille was known for autocratic behavior on the set, singling out and berating extras who were not paying attention. Many of these displays were thought to be staged, however, as an exercise in discipline. He despised actors who were unwilling to take physical risks, especially when he had first demonstrated that the required stunt would not harm them. This occurred with Victor Mature in \"Samson and Delilah\". Mature refused to wrestle Jackie the Lion, even though DeMille had just tussled with the lion, proving that he was tame. DeMille told the actor that he was \"one hundred percent yellow\". Paulette Goddard's refusal to risk personal injury in a scene involving fire in \"Unconquered\" cost her DeMille's favor and a role in \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". DeMille did receive help in his films, notably from Alvin Wyckoff, who shot forty-three of DeMille's films; brother William deMille who would occasionally serve as his screenwriter; and Jeanie Macpherson, who served as DeMille's exclusive screenwriter for fifteen years; and Eddie Salven, DeMille's favorite assistant director.\nDeMille made stars of unknown actors: Gloria Swanson, Bebe Daniels, Rod La Rocque, William Boyd, Claudette Colbert, and Charlton Heston. He also cast established stars such as Gary Cooper, Robert Preston, Paulette Goddard and Fredric March in multiple pictures. DeMille cast some of his performers repeatedly, including Henry Wilcoxon, Julia Faye, Joseph Schildkraut, Ian Keith, Charles Bickford, Theodore Roberts, Akim Tamiroff, and William Boyd. DeMille was credited by actor Edward G. Robinson with saving his career following his eclipse in the Hollywood blacklist.\nStyle and themes.\nCecil B. DeMille's film production career evolved from critically significant silent films to financially significant sound films. He began his career with reserved yet brilliant melodramas; from there, his style developed into marital comedies with outrageously melodramatic plots. In order to attract a high-class audience, DeMille based many of his early films on stage melodramas, novels, and short stories. He began the production of epics earlier in his career until they began to solidify his career in the 1920s. By 1930, DeMille had perfected his film style of mass-interest spectacle films with Western, Roman, or Biblical themes. DeMille was often criticized for making his spectacles too colorful and for being too occupied with entertaining the audience rather than accessing the artistic and auteur possibilities that film could provide. However, others interpreted DeMille's work as visually impressive, thrilling, and nostalgic. Along the same lines, critics of DeMille often qualify him by his later spectacles and fail to consider several decades of ingenuity and energy that defined him during his generation. Throughout his career, he did not alter his films to better adhere to contemporary or popular styles. Actor Charlton Heston admitted DeMille was, \"terribly unfashionable\" and Sidney Lumet called DeMille, \"the cheap version of D.\u00a0W. Griffith\", adding that DeMille, \"[didn't have]...an original thought in his head\", though Heston added that DeMille was much more than that.\nAccording to Scott Eyman, DeMille's films were at the same time masculine and feminine due to his thematic adventurousness and his eye for the extravagant. DeMille's distinctive style can be seen through camera and lighting effects as early as \"The Squaw Man\" with the use of daydream images; moonlight and sunset on a mountain; and side-lighting through a tent flap. In the early age of cinema, DeMille differentiated the Lasky Company from other production companies due to the use of dramatic, low-key lighting they called \"Lasky lighting\" and marketed as \"Rembrandt lighting\" to appeal to the public. DeMille achieved international recognition for his unique use of lighting and color tint in his film \"The Cheat\". DeMille's 1956 version of \"The Ten Commandments\", according to director Martin Scorsese, is renowned for its level of production and the care and detail that went into creating the film. He stated that \"The Ten Commandments\" was the final culmination of DeMille's style.\nDeMille was interested in art and his favorite artist was Gustave Dor\u00e9; DeMille based some of his most well-known scenes on the work of Dor\u00e9. DeMille was the first director to connect art to filmmaking; he created the title of \"art director\" on the film set. DeMille was also known for his use of special effects without the use of digital technology. Notably, DeMille had cinematographer John P. Fulton create the parting of the Red Sea scene in his 1956 film \"The Ten Commandments\", which was one of the most expensive special effects in film history, and has been called by Steven Spielberg \"the greatest special effect in film history\". The actual parting of the sea was created by releasing 360,000 gallons of water into a huge water tank split by a U-shaped trough, overlaying it with a film of a giant waterfall that was built on the Paramount backlot, and playing the clip backward.\nAside from his Biblical and historical epics, which are concerned with how man relates to God, some of DeMille's films contained themes of \"neo-naturalism\", which portray the conflict between the laws of man and the laws of nature. Although he is known for his later \"spectacular\" films, his early films are held in high regard by critics and film historians. DeMille discovered the possibilities of the \"bathroom\" or \"boudoir\" in the film without being \"vulgar\" or \"cheap\". DeMille's films \"Male and Female\", \"Why Change Your Wife?\", and \"The Affairs of Anatol\" can be retrospectively described as high camp and are categorized as \"early DeMille films\" due to their particular style of production and costume and set design. However, his earlier films \"The Captive\", \"Kindling\", \"Carmen\", and \"The Whispering Chorus\" are more serious films. It is difficult to typify DeMille's films into one specific genre. His first three films were Westerns, and he filmed many Westerns throughout his career. However, throughout his career, he filmed comedies, periodic and contemporary romances, dramas, fantasies, propaganda, Biblical spectacles, musical comedies, suspense, and war films. At least one DeMille film can represent each film genre. DeMille produced the majority of his films before the 1930s, and by the time sound films were invented, film critics saw DeMille as antiquated, with his best filmmaking years behind him.\nDeMille's films contained many similar themes throughout his career. However, the films of his silent era were often thematically different from the films of his sound era. His silent-era films often included the \"battle of the sexes\" theme due to the era of women's suffrage and the enlarging role of women in society. Moreover, before his religious-themed films, many of his silent era films revolved around \"husband-and-wife-divorce-and-remarry satires\", considerably more adult-themed. According to Simon Louvish, these films reflected DeMille's inner thoughts and opinions about marriage and human sexuality. Religion was a theme that DeMille returned to throughout his career. Of his seventy films, five revolved around stories of the Bible and the New Testament; however many others, while not direct retellings of Biblical stories, had themes of faith and religious fanaticism in films such as \"The Crusades\" and \"The Road to Yesterday\". Western and frontier American were also themes that DeMille returned to throughout his career. His first several films were Westerns, and he produced a chain of westerns during the sound era. Instead of portraying the danger and anarchy of the West, he portrayed the opportunity and redemption found in Western America. Another common theme in DeMille's films is the reversal of fortune and the portrayal of the rich and the poor, including the war of the classes and man versus society conflicts such as in \"The Golden Chance\" and \"The Cheat\". In relation to his own interests and sexual preferences, sadomasochism was a minor theme present in some of his films. Another minor characteristic of DeMille's films include train crashes, which can be found in several of his films.\nLegacy.\nKnown as the father of the Hollywood motion picture industry, Cecil B. DeMille made 70 films including several box-office hits. DeMille is one of the more commercially successful film directors in history, with his films before the release of \"The Ten Commandments\" estimated to have grossed $650\u00a0 million worldwide. Adjusted for inflation, DeMille's remake of \"The Ten Commandments\" is the eighth highest-grossing film in the world.\nAccording to Sam Goldwyn, critics did not like DeMille's films, but the audiences did, and \"they have the final word\". Similarly, scholar David Blanke, argued that DeMille had lost the respect of his colleagues and film critics by his late film career. However, his final films maintained that DeMille was still respected by his audiences. Five of DeMille's films were the highest-grossing films at the year of their release, with only Spielberg topping him with six of his films as the highest-grossing films of the year. DeMille's highest-grossing films include: \"The Sign of the Cross\" (1932), \"Unconquered\" (1947), \"Samson and Delilah\" (1949), \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" (1952), and \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956). Director Ridley Scott has been called \"the Cecil B. DeMille of the digital era\" due to his classical and medieval epics.\nDespite his box-office success, awards, and artistic achievements, DeMille has been dismissed and ignored by critics both during his life and posthumously. He was consistently criticized for producing shallow films without talent or artistic care. Compared to other directors, few film scholars have taken the time to academically analyze his films and style. During the French New Wave, critics began to categorize certain filmmakers as auteurs such as Howard Hawks, John Ford, and Raoul Walsh. DeMille was omitted from the list, thought to be too unsophisticated and antiquated to be considered an auteur. However, Simon Louvish wrote \"he was the complete master and auteur of his films\", and Anton Kozlovic called him the \"unsung American auteur\". Andrew Sarris, a leading proponent of the auteur theory, ranked DeMille highly as an auteur in the \"Far Side of Paradise\", just below the \"Pantheon\". Sarris added that despite the influence of the styles of contemporary directors throughout his career, DeMille's style remained unchanged. Robert Birchard wrote that one could argue the auteurship of DeMille on the basis that DeMille's thematic and visual style remained consistent throughout his career. However, Birchard acknowledged that Sarris's point was more likely that DeMille's style was behind the development of film as an art form. Meanwhile, Sumiko Higashi sees DeMille as \"not only a figure who was shaped and influenced by the forces of his era but as a filmmaker who left his own signature on the culture industry.\" The critic Camille Paglia has called \"The Ten Commandments\" one of the ten greatest films of all time.\nDeMille was one of the first directors to become a celebrity in his own right. He cultivated the image of the omnipotent director, complete with megaphone, riding crop, and jodhpurs. He was known for his unique working wardrobe, which included riding boots, riding pants, and soft, open necked shirts. Joseph Henabery recalled that DeMille looked like \"a king on a throne surrounded by his court\" while directing films on a camera platform.\nDeMille was liked by some of his fellow directors and disliked by others, though his actual films were usually dismissed by his peers as a vapid spectacle. Director John Huston intensely disliked both DeMille and his films. \"He was a thoroughly bad director\", Huston said. \"A dreadful showoff. Terrible. To diseased proportions.\" Said fellow director William Wellman: \"Directorially, I think his pictures were the most horrible things I've ever seen in my life. But he put on pictures that made a fortune. In that respect, he was better than any of us.\" Producer David O. Selznick wrote: \"There has appeared only one Cecil B. DeMille. He is one of the most extraordinarily able showmen of modern times. However much I may dislike some of his pictures, it would be very silly of me, as a producer of commercial motion pictures, to demean for an instant his unparalleled skill as a maker of mass entertainment.\" Salvador Dal\u00ed wrote that DeMille, Walt Disney, and the Marx Brothers were \"the three great American Surrealists\". DeMille appeared as himself in numerous films, including the MGM comedy \"Free and Easy\". He often appeared in his coming-attraction trailers and narrated many of his later films, even stepping on screen to introduce \"The Ten Commandments\". DeMille was immortalized in Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" when Gloria Swanson spoke the line: \"All right, Mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close-up.\" DeMille plays himself in the film. DeMille's reputation had a renaissance in the 2010s.\nAs a filmmaker, DeMille was the aesthetic inspiration of many directors and films due to his early influence during the crucial development of the film industry. DeMille's early silent comedies influenced the comedies of Ernst Lubitsch and Charlie Chaplin's \"A Woman of Paris\". Additionally, DeMille's epics such as \"The Crusades\" influenced Sergei Eisenstein's \"Alexander Nevsky\". Moreover, DeMille's epics inspired directors such as Howard Hawks, Nicholas Ray, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and George Stevens to try producing epics. Cecil B. DeMille has influenced the work of several well-known directors. Alfred Hitchcock cited DeMille's 1921 film \"Forbidden Fruit\" as an influence of his work and one of his top ten favorite films. DeMille has influenced the careers of many modern directors. Martin Scorsese cited \"Unconquered\", \"Samson and Delilah\", and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" as DeMille films that have imparted lasting memories on him. Scorsese said he had viewed \"The Ten Commandments\" forty or fifty times. Famed director Steven Spielberg stated that DeMille's \"The Greatest Show on Earth\" was one of the films that influenced him to become a filmmaker. Furthermore, DeMille influenced about half of Spielberg's films, including \"War of the Worlds\". \"The Ten Commandments\" inspired DreamWorks Animation's later film about Moses, \"The Prince of Egypt\". As one of the establishing members of Paramount Pictures and co-founder of Hollywood, DeMille had a role in the development of the film industry. Consequently, the name \"DeMille\" has become synonymous with filmmaking.\nPublicly Episcopalian, DeMille drew on his Christian and Jewish ancestors to convey a message of tolerance. DeMille received more than a dozen awards from Christian and Jewish religious and cultural groups, including B'nai B'rith. However, not everyone received DeMille's religious films favorably. DeMille was accused of antisemitism after the release of \"The King of Kings\", and director John Ford despised DeMille for what he saw as \"hollow\" biblical epics meant to promote DeMille's reputation during the politically turbulent 1950s. In response to the claims, DeMille donated some of the profits from \"The King of Kings\" to charity. In the 2012 \"Sight &amp; Sound\" poll, both DeMille's \"Samson and Delilah\" and 1923 version of \"The Ten Commandments\" received votes, but did not make the top 100 films. Although many of DeMille's films are available on DVD and Blu-ray release, only 20 of his silent films are commercially available on DVD.\nCommemoration and tributes.\nThe original Lasky-DeMille Barn in which \"The Squaw Man\" was filmed was converted into a museum named the \"Hollywood Heritage Museum\". It opened on December 13, 1985, and features some of DeMille's personal artifacts. The Lasky-DeMille Barn was dedicated as a California historical landmark in a ceremony on December 27, 1956; DeMille was the keynote speaker. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The Dunes Center in Guadalupe, California, contains an exhibition of artifacts uncovered in the desert near Guadalupe from DeMille's set of his 1923 version of \"The Ten Commandments\", known as the \"Lost City of Cecil B. DeMille\". Donated by the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation in 2004, the moving image collection of Cecil B. DeMille is held at the Academy Film Archive and includes home movies, outtakes, and never-before-seen test footage.\nIn summer 2019, The Friends of the Pompton Lakes Library hosted a Cecil B DeMille film festival to celebrate DeMille's achievements and connection to Pompton Lakes. They screened four of his films at Christ Church, where DeMille and his family attended church when they lived there. Two schools have been named after him: Cecil B. DeMille Middle School, in Long Beach, California, which was closed and demolished in 2010 to make way for a new high school; and Cecil B. DeMille Elementary School in Midway City, California. The former film building at Chapman University in Orange, California, is named in honor of DeMille. During the Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Aldrin referred to himself in one instance as \"Cecil B. DeAldrin\", as a humorous nod to DeMille. The title of the 2000 John Waters film \"Cecil B. Demented\" alludes to DeMille.\nDeMille's legacy is maintained by his granddaughter Cecilia DeMille Presley who serves as the president of the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation, which strives to support higher education, child welfare, and film in Southern California. In 1963, the Cecil B. DeMille Foundation donated the \"Paradise\" ranch to the Hathaway Foundation, which cares for emotionally disturbed and abused children. A large collection of DeMille's materials including scripts, storyboards, and films resides at Brigham Young University in L. Tom Perry Special Collections.\nAwards and recognition.\nCecil B. DeMille received many awards and honors, especially later in his career.\nIn August 1941, DeMille was honored with a block in the forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\nThe American Academy of Dramatic Arts honored DeMille with an Alumni Achievement Award in 1958.\nIn 1957, DeMille gave the commencement address for the graduation ceremony of Brigham Young University, wherein he received an honorary Doctorate of Letter degree. Additionally, in 1958, he received an honorary Doctorate of Law degree from Temple University.\nFrom the film industry, DeMille received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the Academy Awards in 1953, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of America Award the same year. In the same ceremony, DeMille received a nomination from Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures for \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". In 1952, DeMille was awarded the first Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Globes. An annual award, the Golden Globe's Cecil B. DeMille Award recognizes lifetime achievement in the film industry. For his contribution to the motion picture and radio industry, DeMille has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The first, for radio contributions, is located at 6240 Hollywood Blvd. The second star is located at 1725 Vine Street.\nDeMille received two Academy Awards: an Honorary Award for \"37 years of brilliant showmanship\" in 1950 and a Best Picture award in 1953 for \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". DeMille received a Golden Globe Award for Best Director and was additionally nominated for the Best Director category at the 1953 Academy Awards for the same film. He was further nominated in the Best Picture category for \"The Ten Commandments\" at the 1957 Academy Awards. DeMille's \"Union Pacific\" received a Palme d'Or in retrospect at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.\nTwo of DeMille's films have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress: \"The Cheat\" (1915) and \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956).\nFilmography.\nDeMille made 70 features, 52 of which are silent. The first 24 of his silents were produced during the first three years of his career (1913\u20131916). Eight of his films were \"epics\" with five classified as \"Biblical\". Six of DeMille's films \u2014 \"The Arab\", \"The Wild Goose Chase\", \"The Dream Girl\", \"The Devil-Stone\", \"We Can't Have Everything\", and \"The Squaw Man\" (1918) \u2014 were destroyed by nitrate decomposition, and are considered lost. \"The Ten Commandments\" is broadcast every Saturday at Passover in the United States on the ABC Television Network.\nDirected features.\nFilmography obtained from \"Fifty Hollywood Directors\".\nSound films\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* \"Dynamite\" (1929)\nDirecting or producing credit.\nThese are films which DeMille produced or assisted in directing, credited or uncredited.\nActing and cameos.\nDeMille frequently made cameos as himself in other Paramount films.

{"id": "6181", "revid": "8766034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6181", "title": "Chinese Islamic cuisine", "text": "Culinary traditions of Chinese Muslims\nChinese Islamic cuisine consists of variations of regionally popular foods that are typical of Han Chinese cuisine, in particular to make them halal. Dishes borrow ingredients from Middle Eastern, Turkic, Iranian and South Asian cuisines, notably mutton and spices. Much like other northern Chinese cuisines, Chinese Islamic cuisine uses wheat noodles as the staple, rather than rice. Chinese Islamic dishes include clear-broth beef noodle soup and \"chuanr\".\nThe Hui (ethnic Chinese Muslims), Bonan, Dongxiang, Salar and Uyghurs of China, as well as the Dungans of Central Asia and the Panthays of Burma, collectively contribute to Chinese Islamic cuisine.\nHistory.\nDue to the large Muslim population in Western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to or are run by Muslims. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in China proper. It is heavily influenced by Beijing cuisine, with nearly all cooking methods identical and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine though seldom in east coast restaurants.\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, halal and kosher methods of slaughtering animals and preparing food was banned and forbidden by the Mongol emperors, starting with Genghis Khan who banned Muslims and Jews from slaughtering their animals their own way and made them follow the Mongol method.\nAmong all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say \"we do not eat Mongol food.\" [Cinggis Qa'an replied:] \"By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?\" He thereupon made them eat. \"If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.\" He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under Qubilai] all the Muslims say: \u201cif someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat.\" Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.\nTraditionally, there is a distinction between Northern and Southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both using lamb and mutton. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. The reason for this difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to Northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese and shrimp are rare in comparison to Southern China due to the arid climate of Northern China.\nA Chinese Islamic restaurant () can be similar to a Mandarin restaurant with the exception that there is no pork on the menu and the dishes are primarily noodle/soup based.\nIn most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/Halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., Uyghurs). They primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as Islamic writing.\nAnother difference is that lamb and mutton dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of Western Chinese regions. (Refer to image 1.)\nOther Muslim ethnic minorities like the Bonan, Dongxiang, Salar and Tibetan Muslims have their own cuisines as well. Dongxiang people operate their own restaurants serving their cuisine.\nMany cafeterias (canteens) at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students (Hui or Western Chinese minorities), typically labeled \"qingzhen\". Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim and will allow access to these dining areas or will allow access on special occasions such as the Eid feast following Ramadan.\nSeveral Hui restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine exist in Los Angeles. San Francisco, despite its huge number of Chinese restaurants, appears to have only one whose cuisine would qualify as halal.\nMany Chinese Hui Muslims who moved from Yunnan to Burma (Myanmar) are known as Panthays operate restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine such as noodles. Chinese Hui Muslims from Yunnan who moved to Thailand are known as Chin Haw and they also own restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic food.\nIn Central Asia, Dungan people, descendants of Hui, operate restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine, which is respectively referred to as \"Dungan cuisine\" there. They cater to Chinese businessmen. Chopsticks are used by Dungans. The cuisine of the Dungan resembles northwestern Chinese cuisine.\nMost Chinese regard Hui halal food as cleaner than food made by non-Muslims so their restaurants are popular in China. Hui who migrated to Northeast China (Manchuria) after the Chuang Guandong opened many new inns and restaurants to cater to travelers, which were regarded as clean.\nThe Hui who migrated to Taiwan operate Qingzhen restaurants and stalls serving Chinese Islamic cuisine in Taipei and other big cities.\nThe Thai Department of Export Promotion claims that \"China's halal food producers are small-scale entrepreneurs whose products have little value added and lack branding and technology to push their goods to international standards\" to encourage Thai private sector halal producers to market their products in China.\nA 1903-started franchise serving Muslim food is Dong Lai Shun in Hankou.\n400 meters have to be kept as a distance from each restaurant serving beef noodles to another of its type if they belong to Hui Muslims, since Hui have a pact between each other in Ningxia, Gansu and Shaanxi.\nHalal restaurants are checked up upon by clerics from mosques.\nHalal food manufacture has been sanctioned by the government of the Ningxia Autonomous Region.\nFamous dishes.\nLamian.\nLamian (, Dungan: \u041b\u0430\u043c\u044f\u043d) is a Chinese dish of hand-made noodles, usually served in a beef or mutton-flavored soup (\u6e6f\u9eaa, \u0434\u0430\u04a3\u043c\u044f\u043d, t\u0101ngmi\u00e0n), but sometimes stir-fried (\u7092\u9eaa, \u0427\u0430\u043e\u043c\u044f\u043d, ch\u01ceomi\u00e0n) and served with a tomato-based sauce. Literally, \u62c9, \u043b\u0430 (l\u0101) means to pull or stretch, while \u9eaa, \u043c\u044f\u043d (mi\u00e0n) means noodle. The hand-making process involves taking a lump of dough and repeatedly stretching it to produce a single very long noodle. There exists a local variant in Lanzhou, the Lanzhou beef noodles, also known as Lanzhou lamian.\nWords that begin with L are not native to Turkic \u2014 l\u00e4ghm\u00e4n is a loanword as stated by Uyghur linguist Abdlikim: It is of Chinese derivation and not originally Uyghur.\nBeef noodle soup.\nBeef noodle soup is a noodle soup dish composed of stewed beef, beef broth, vegetables and wheat noodles. It exists in various forms throughout East and Southeast Asia. It was created by the Hui people during the Qing dynasty of China.\nIn the west, this food may be served in a small portion as a soup. In China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish.\nChuanr.\nChuanr (Chinese: \u4e32\u513f, Dungan: \u0427\u045e\u0430\u043d\u0440, Pinyin: chu\u00e0nr (shortened from \"chuan er\"), \"kebab\"), originating in the Xinjiang (\u65b0\u7586) province of China and in recent years has been disseminated throughout the rest of that country, most notably in Beijing. It is a product of the Chinese Islamic cuisine of the Uyghur (\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14) people and other Chinese Muslims. Yang rou chuan or lamb kebabs, is particularly popular.\nSuan cai.\nSuan cai is a traditional fermented vegetable dish, similar to Korean kimchi and German sauerkraut, used in a variety of ways. It consists of pickled Chinese cabbage. Suan cai is a unique form of pao cai due to the material used and the method of production. Although \"suan cai\" is not exclusive to Chinese Islamic cuisine, it is used in Chinese Islamic cuisine to top off noodle soups, especially beef noodle soup.\nNang.\n\"Nang\" (Chinese: \u9995, Dungan: \u041d\u04d9\u04a3) is a type of round unleavened bread, topped with sesame. It is similar to South and Central Asia naan.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6182", "revid": "50241327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6182", "title": "Cantonese cuisine", "text": "Chinese regional cuisine from Guangdong\nCantonese or Guangdong cuisine, also known as Yue cuisine ( or ), is the cuisine of Cantonese people, associated with the Guangdong province of China, particularly the provincial capital Guangzhou, and the surrounding regions in the Pearl River Delta including Hong Kong and Macau. Strictly speaking, Cantonese cuisine is the cuisine of Guangzhou or of Cantonese speakers, but it often includes the cooking styles of all the speakers of Yue Chinese languages in Guangdong.\nThe Teochew cuisine and Hakka cuisine of Guangdong are considered their own styles. However, scholars may categorize Guangdong cuisine into three major groups based on the region's dialect: Cantonese, Hakka and Chaozhou cuisines. Neighboring Guangxi's cuisine is also considered separate despite eastern Guangxi being considered culturally Cantonese due to the presence of ethnic Zhuang influences in the rest of the province.\nCantonese cuisine is one of the Eight Great Traditions of Chinese cuisine,\nand chefs trained in Cantonese cuisine are highly sought after throughout China.\nIts prominence outside China is due to the large number of Cantonese emigrants; until the late 20th century, most Chinese restaurants in the West served largely Cantonese dishes.\nBackground.\nGuangzhou (Canton) City, the provincial capital of Guangdong and the centre of Cantonese culture, has long been a trading hub, and many imported foods and ingredients are used in Cantonese cuisine. During the early to middle Qing dynasty period from 1757 to 1842, Guangdong, known as Canton at the time, was the only port where trade was permitted between Chinese and foreign merchants. Cantonese cooks aimed to serve European tastes in restaurants, lending to an ongoing European influence on Cantonese cuisine. Staples of the European nobility diet at the time, particularly turtle soup, were available to British merchants and dignitaries visiting Guangdong. The British taught Cantonese cooks how to make the dish, with the Caribbean sea turtle typically used in Europe replaced by the Chinese softshell turtle. Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including offal, chicken feet, duck's tongue, frog legs, snakes and snails. Lamb and goat are less commonly used than in the cuisines of northern or western China. Many cooking methods are used, with steaming and stir-frying favoured due to their convenience and rapidity. \n\"Wok hay\" is the name given to the unique Cantonese cooking technique, emphasizing the energy, or \"hay\", of the cooking vessel itself. \"Wok hay\" emphasizes the multiple flavors at play when cooking, using certain ingredients to balance the harshness of others. Additionally, dishes are typically cooked over a medium heat for a more prolonged period. Guangzhou is known for its year-round warm and humid climate; \"wok hay\" helps prevent chefs from working in an environment where they can easily overheat from the sweltering kitchen temperatures. This concept lends to a sense of superiority among Cantonese cooks with respect to stir-fry technique. Other techniques include shallow frying, double steaming, braising and deep frying. Compared to other Chinese regional cuisines, the flavours of most traditional Cantonese dishes should be well-balanced and not greasy. Spices should be used in modest amounts to avoid overwhelming the flavours of the primary ingredients, which in turn should be at the peak of their freshness and quality. There is no widespread use of fresh herbs in Cantonese cooking, in contrast with their liberal use in other cuisines such as Sichuanese, Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and European. Garlic chives and coriander leaves are notable exceptions, although the former are often used as a vegetable and the latter are typically used as mere garnish in most dishes. \nGuangzhou\u2019s notability in its restaurants, teahouses, and snack shops was targeted by the reforms of the CCP, as top party leaders made efforts to transform Guangzhou from a center of culinary arts into an industrial powerhouse. Well-established culinary institutions were targeted as traditionalist remnants, replaced with communal-style eating halls. \u201cMassification\u201d became key to the reforming of Guangzhou\u2019s culinary scene, with many delicacies such as sharkfin soup, bird's nest soup, and sea cucumber, which were often imported, ushered out of restaurants in favor of less expensive ingredients. Frugality was emphasized as a revolutionary ideal, with restaurants previously reserved for the wealthy elites now serving the working class, who had felt that these \u201cOld Society\u201d delicacies were withheld from them.\nFoods.\nSauces and condiments.\nIn Cantonese cuisine, ingredients such as sugar, salt, soy sauce, rice wine, corn starch, vinegar, scallion and sesame oil suffice to enhance flavour, although garlic is heavily used in some dishes, especially those in which internal organs, such as entrails, may emit unpleasant odours. Ginger, chili peppers, five-spice powder, powdered black pepper, star anise and a few other spices are also used, but often sparingly.\nDried and preserved ingredients.\nAlthough Cantonese cooks pay much attention to the freshness of their primary ingredients, Cantonese cuisine also uses a long list of preserved food items to add flavour to a dish. This may be influenced by Hakka cuisine, since the Hakkas were once a dominant group occupying imperial Hong Kong and other southern territories.\nSome items gain very intense flavours during the drying/preservation/oxidation process and some foods are preserved to increase their shelf life. Some chefs combine both dried and fresh varieties of the same items in a dish. Dried items are usually soaked in water to rehydrate before cooking. These ingredients are generally not served \"a la carte\", but rather with vegetables or other Cantonese dishes.\nTraditional dishes.\nA number of dishes have been part of Cantonese cuisine since the earliest territorial establishments of Guangdong. While many of these are on the menus of typical Cantonese restaurants, some simpler ones are more commonly found in Cantonese homes. Home-made Cantonese dishes are usually served with plain white rice.\nDeep fried dishes.\nThere are a small number of deep-fried dishes in Cantonese cuisine, which can often be found as street food. They have been extensively documented in colonial Hong Kong records of the 19th and 20th centuries. A few are synonymous with Cantonese breakfast and lunch, even though these are also part of other cuisines.\nSoups.\nOld fire soup, or \"lou fo tong\" (), is a clear broth prepared by simmering meat and other ingredients over a low heat for several hours. Chinese herbs are often used as ingredients. There are basically two ways to make old fire soup \u2013 put ingredients and water in the pot and heat it directly on fire, which is called \"bou tong\" (); or put the ingredients in a small stew pot, and put it in a bigger pot filled with water, then heat the bigger pot on fire directly, which is called \"dun tong\" (). The latter way can keep the most original taste of the soup.\nSoup chain stores or delivery outlets in cities with significant Cantonese populations, such as Hong Kong, serve this dish due to the long preparation time required of slow-simmered soup.\nSeafood.\nDue to Guangdong's location along the South China Sea coast, fresh seafood is prominent in Cantonese cuisine, and many Cantonese restaurants keep aquariums or seafood tanks on the premises. In Cantonese cuisine, as in cuisines from other parts of Asia, if seafood has a repugnant odour, strong spices and marinating juices are added; the freshest seafood is odourless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of soy sauce, ginger and spring onion is added to steamed fish. In Cantonese cuisine, the light seasoning is used only to bring out the natural sweetness of the seafood. As a rule of thumb, the spiciness of a dish is usually negatively correlated to the freshness of the ingredients.\nNoodle dishes.\nNoodles are served either in soup broth or fried. These are available as home-cooked meals, on dim sum side menus, or as street food at dai pai dongs, where they can be served with a variety of toppings such as fish balls, beef balls, or fish slices.\nSiu mei.\n\"Siu mei\" () is essentially the Chinese rotisserie style of cooking. Unlike most other Cantonese dishes, \"siu mei\" solely consists of meat, with no vegetables.\nAll Cantonese-style cooked meats, including siu mei, lou mei and preserved meat can be classified as siu laap ().\nLou mei.\nLou mei () is the name given to dishes made from internal organs, entrails and other left-over parts of animals. It is widely available in southern Chinese regions.\nMeat and rice plates.\nA portion of meat, such as char siu, served on a bed of steamed white rice. A typical variant consists of half-and-half portions of two types of siu mei and lou mei (or sometimes more than two). A steamed vegetable (such as choy sum) is frequently, but not always included.\nLittle pot rice.\nLittle pot rice () are dishes cooked and served in a flat-bottomed pot (as opposed to a round-bottomed wok). Usually this is a saucepan or braising pan (see clay pot cooking). Such dishes are cooked by covering and steaming, making the rice and ingredients very hot and soft. Usually the ingredients are layered on top of the rice with little or no mixing in between. Many standard combinations exist.\nBanquet/dinner dishes.\nA number of dishes are traditionally served in Cantonese restaurants only at dinner time. Said banquets were typically served in the capital's famous tea houses. Guangzhou\u2019s tea houses have historically served as meeting places for the public, where political movements could foment and lead to action. The main draw of these tea houses was to enjoy dim sum. While eating dim sum in tea houses grew in popularity during the nineteenth century, the different snacks and small bites that were enjoyed grew Guangzhou staples to encompassing culinary traditions from China\u2019s numerous provinces. After the Qing\u2019s defeat in the first Opium War, culinary influences outside of China found there way into the dim sum served at tea houses, with ingredients such as Worcestershire sauce and Ketchup becoming staple ingredients. Dim sum restaurants stop serving bamboo-basket dishes after the yum cha period (equivalent to afternoon tea) and begin offering an entirely different menu in the evening. Some dishes are standard while others are regional. Some are customised for special purposes such as Chinese marriages or banquets. Salt and pepper dishes are one of the few spicy dishes.\nDessert.\nAfter the evening meal, most Cantonese restaurants offer \"tong sui\" (), a sweet soup. Many varieties of \"tong sui\" are also found in other Chinese cuisines. Some desserts are traditional, while others are recent innovations. The more expensive restaurants usually offer their specialty desserts. Sugar water is the general name of dessert in Guangdong province. It is cooked by adding water and sugar to some other cooking ingredients.\nDelicacies.\nCertain Cantonese delicacies consist of parts taken from rare or endangered animals, which raises controversy over animal rights and environmental issues. This is often due to alleged health benefits of certain animal products. For example, the continued spreading of the idea that shark cartilage can cure cancer has led to decreased shark populations even though scientific research has found no evidence to support the credibility of shark cartilage as a cancer cure. Consumption of shark fin soup dates back to the Song dynasty, with the dish ultimately becoming ingrained into Cantonese food culture and Chinese food culture as a whole in the royal banquets of the Ming. Conservation efforts by the Chinese government and various NGOs have been historically difficult to implement. It can be difficult for fishermen who rely on the sale of shark fins to adopt alternative occupations, in addition to corruption at the local level impeding attempts at dismantling the shark fin trade.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6183", "revid": "117624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6183", "title": "Teochew cuisine", "text": "Chinese regional cuisine\nTeochew cuisine, also known as Chiuchow cuisine, Chaozhou cuisine or Teo-swa cuisine, originated from the Chaoshan region in the eastern part of China's Guangdong Province, which includes the cities of Chaozhou, Shantou and Jieyang. Teochew cuisine bears more similarities to that of Fujian cuisine, particularly Southern Min cuisine, due to the similarity of Teochew's and Fujian's culture, language, and their geographic proximity to each other. However, Teochew cuisine is also influenced by Cantonese cuisine in its style and technique.\nBackground.\nTeochew cuisine is well known for its seafood and vegetarian dishes. Its use of flavouring is much less heavy-handed than most other Chinese cuisines and depends much on the freshness and quality of the ingredients for taste and flavour. As a delicate cuisine, oil is not often used in large quantities and there is a relatively heavy emphasis on poaching, steaming and braising, as well as the common Chinese method of stir-frying. Teochew cuisine is also known for serving congee (; or \"mue\"), in addition to steamed rice or noodles with meals. The Teochew \"\" is rather different from the Cantonese counterpart, being very watery with the rice sitting loosely at the bottom of the bowl, while the Cantonese dish is more a thin gruel.\nAuthentic Teochew restaurants serve very strong oolong tea called Tieguanyin in very tiny cups before and after the meal. Presented as \"gongfu\" tea, the tea has a thickly bittersweet taste, colloquially known as \"gam gam\" ().\nA condiment that is popular in Fujian and Taiwanese cuisine and commonly associated with cuisine of certain Teochew groups is shacha sauce (). It is made from soybean oil, garlic, shallots, chilies, brill fish and dried shrimp. The paste has a savoury and slightly spicy taste. As an ingredient, it has multiple uses: as a base for soups, as a rub for barbecued meats, as a seasoning for stir-fried dishes, or as a component for dipping sauces.\nIn addition to soy sauce (widely used in all Chinese cuisines), Teochew people also use fish sauce in their cooking.\nTeochew chefs often use a special stock called siang teng (), literally translates from the Teochew dialect as \"superior broth\". This stock remains on the stove and is continuously replenished (a perpetual stew). Portrayed in popular media, some Hong Kong chefs allegedly use the same superior broth that is preserved for decades. This stock can as well be seen on Chaozhou TV's cooking programmes.\nThere is a notable feast in Teochew cuisine called \"\" (). A myriad of dishes are often served, which include shark fin soup, bird's nest soup, lobster, steamed fish, roasted suckling pig and braised goose.\nTeochew chefs take pride in their skills of vegetable carving, and carved vegetables are used as garnishes on cold dishes and on the banquet table.\nTeochew cuisine is also known for a late night meal known as \"meh siao\" () or \"daa laang\" () among the Cantonese. Teochew people enjoy eating out close to midnight in restaurants or at roadside food stalls. Some dai pai dong-like eateries stay open till dawn.\nUnlike the typical menu selections of many other Chinese cuisines, Teochew restaurant menus often have a dessert section.\nMany people of Teochew origin, also known as Teochiu or Teochew people, have settled in Hong Kong and places in Southeast Asia like Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia and Thailand. Influences they bring can be noted in Singaporean cuisine and that of other settlements. A large number of Teochew people have also settled in Taiwan, evident in Taiwanese cuisine. Other notable Teochew diaspora communities are in Vietnam, Cambodia and France. A popular noodle soup in both Vietnam and Cambodia, known as hu tieu, originated from the Teochew . There is also a large diaspora of Teochew people (most were from Southeast Asia) in the United States - particularly in California. There is a Teochew Chinese Association in Paris called L'Amicale des Teochews en France.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6184", "revid": "18872885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6184", "title": "Co-NP", "text": "Complexity class\nIn computational complexity theory, co-NP is a complexity class. A decision problem X is a member of co-NP if and only if its complement X is in the complexity class NP. The class can be defined as follows: a decision problem is in co-NP if and only if for every \"no\"-instance we have a polynomial-length \"certificate\" and there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can be used to verify any purported certificate.\nThat is, co-NP is the set of decision problems where there exists a polynomial &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; and a polynomial-time bounded Turing machine \"M\" such that for every instance \"x\", \"x\" is a \"no\"-instance if and only if: for some possible certificate \"c\" of length bounded by &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the Turing machine \"M\" accepts the pair (\"x\", \"c\").\nComplementary problems.\nWhile an NP problem asks whether a given instance is a \"yes\"-instance, its \"complement\" asks whether an instance is a \"no\"-instance, which means the complement is in co-NP. Any \"yes\"-instance for the original NP problem becomes a \"no\"-instance for its complement, and vice versa.\nUnsatisfiability.\nAn example of an NP-complete problem is the Boolean satisfiability problem: given a Boolean formula, is it \"satisfiable\" (is there a possible input for which the formula outputs true)? The complementary problem asks: \"given a Boolean formula, is it \"unsatisfiable\" (do all possible inputs to the formula output false)?\". Since this is the \"complement\" of the satisfiability problem, a certificate for a \"no\"-instance is the same as for a \"yes\"-instance from the original NP problem: a set of Boolean variable assignments which make the formula true. On the other hand, a certificate of a \"yes\"-instance for the complementary problem (whatever form it might take) would be equally as complex as for the \"no\"-instance of the original NP satisfiability problem.\nco-NP-completeness.\nA problem \"L\" is co-NP-complete if and only if \"L\" is in co-NP and for any problem in co-NP, there exists a polynomial-time reduction from that problem to \"L\".\nTautology reduction.\nDetermining if a formula in propositional logic is a tautology is co-NP-complete: that is, if the formula evaluates to true under every possible assignment to its variables.\nRelationship to other classes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in computer science\nMore unsolved problems in computer science\nP, the class of polynomial time solvable problems, is a subset of both NP and co-NP. P is thought to be a strict subset in both cases. Because P is closed under complementation, and NP and co-NP are complementary, it cannot be strict in one case and not strict in the other: if P equals NP, it must also equal co-NP, and vice versa.\nNP and co-NP are also thought to be unequal, and their equality would imply the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy PH to NP. If they are unequal, then no NP-complete problem can be in co-NP and no co-NP-complete problem can be in NP. This can be shown as follows. Suppose for the sake of contradiction there exists an NP-complete problem X that is in co-NP. Since all problems in NP can be reduced to X, it follows that for every problem in NP, we can construct a non-deterministic Turing machine that decides its complement in polynomial time; i.e., &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. From this, it follows that the set of complements of the problems in NP is a subset of the set of complements of the problems in co-NP; i.e., &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. Thus &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak;. The proof that no co-NP-complete problem can be in NP if &amp;NoBreak;}&amp;NoBreak; is symmetrical.\nco-NP is a subset of PH, which itself is a subset of PSPACE.\nInteger factorization.\nAn example of a problem that is known to belong to both NP and co-NP (but not known to be in P) is Integer factorization: given positive integers \"m\" and \"n\", determine if \"m\" has a factor less than \"n\" and greater than one. Membership in NP is clear; if \"m\" does have such a factor, then the factor itself is a certificate. Membership in co-NP is also straightforward: one can just list the prime factors of \"m\", all greater or equal to \"n\", which the verifier can confirm to be valid by multiplication and the AKS primality test. It is presently not known whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm for factorization, equivalently that integer factorization is in P, and hence this example is interesting as one of the most natural problems known to be in NP and co-NP but not known to be in P.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His career began in World War II as a private in the United States Army, assigned to the Army Air Forces in 1941. After serving as an aircraft mechanic, in September 1942, he entered enlisted pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of flight officer (the World War II Army Air Force version of the Army's warrant officer), later achieving most of his aerial victories as a P-51 Mustang fighter pilot on the Western Front, where he was credited with shooting down 11.5 enemy aircraft. The half credit is from a second pilot assisting him in a single shootdown. On October 12, 1944, he attained \"ace in a day\" status, shooting down five enemy aircraft in one mission.\nAfter the war, Yeager became a test pilot and flew many types of aircraft, including experimental rocket-powered aircraft for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). Through the NACA program, he became the first human to officially break the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, when he flew the experimental Bell X-1 at Mach 1.05 at an altitude of , for which he won both the Collier and Mackay trophies in 1948. He broke several other speed and altitude records in the following years. In 1962, he became the first commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School, which trained and produced astronauts for NASA and the Air Force.\nYeager later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in Germany, as well as in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. In recognition of his achievements and the outstanding performance ratings of those units, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1969 and inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1973, retiring on March 1, 1975, for its colloquial similarity to \"Mach 1\". His three-war active-duty flying career spanned more than 30 years and took him to many parts of the world, including the Korean War zone and the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War.\nYeager is referred to by many as one of the greatest pilots of all time, and was ranked fifth on \"Flying\"'s list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation in 2013. He flew more than 360 different types of aircraft over a 70-year period, and continued to fly for two decades after retirement as a consultant pilot for the United States Air Force. In 2020 at the age of 97, Yeager died in a Los Angeles-area hospital.\nEarly life and education.\nYeager was born February 13, 1923, in Myra, West Virginia, to farming parents Albert Hal Yeager (1896\u20131963) and Susie Mae Yeager (n\u00e9e\u00a0Sizemore; 1898\u20131987). When he was five years old, his family moved to Hamlin, West Virginia. Yeager had two brothers, Roy and Hal Jr., and two sisters, Doris Ann (accidentally killed at age two by four-year-old Roy playing with a firearm) and Pansy Lee.\nHe attended Hamlin High School, where he played basketball and football, receiving his best grades in geometry and typing. He graduated from high school in June 1941.\nHis first experience with the military was as a teen at the Citizens Military Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana, during the summers of 1939 and 1940. On February 26, 1945, Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse. The couple had four children. Glennis Yeager died in 1990, predeceasing her husband by 30 years.\nHis cousin, Steve Yeager, was a professional baseball catcher.\nCareer.\nWorld War II.\nOn September 12, 1941, Yeager enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), and became an aircraft mechanic at George Air Force Base, Victorville, California. At enlistment, Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background, but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than three months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards. Yeager had unusually sharp vision, a visual acuity rated 20/10, which once enabled him to shoot a deer at .\nAt the time of his flight training acceptance, he was a crew chief on an AT-11. He received his pilot wings and a promotion to flight officer at Luke Field, Arizona, where he graduated from Class 43C on March 10, 1943. Assigned to the 357th Fighter Group at Tonopah, Nevada, he initially trained as a fighter pilot, flying Bell P-39 Airacobras (being grounded for seven days for clipping a farmer's tree during a training flight), and shipped overseas with the group on November 23, 1943.\nStationed in the United Kingdom at RAF Leiston, Yeager flew P-51 Mustangs in combat with the 363d Fighter Squadron. He named his aircraft \"Glamorous Glen\" after his girlfriend, Glennis Faye Dickhouse, who became his wife in February 1945. Yeager had gained one victory before he was shot down over France in his first aircraft (P-51B-5-NA s/n 43-6763) on March 5, 1944, on his eighth mission. He escaped to Spain on March 30, 1944, with the help of the \"Maquis\" (French Resistance) and returned to England on May 15, 1944. During his stay with the \"Maquis\", Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat; he helped construct bombs for the group, a skill that he had learned from his father. He was awarded the Bronze Star for helping a navigator, Omar M. \"Pat\" Patterson Jr., to cross the Pyrenees.\nDespite a regulation prohibiting \"evaders\" (escaped pilots) from flying over enemy territory again, the purpose of which was to prevent resistance groups from being compromised by giving the enemy a second chance to possibly capture him, Yeager was reinstated to flying combat. He had joined another evader, fellow P-51 pilot 1st Lt Fred Glover, in speaking directly to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, on June 12, 1944. \"I raised so much hell that General Eisenhower finally let me go back to my squadron\" Yeager said. \"He cleared me for combat after D Day, because all the free Frenchmen \u2013 Maquis and people like that \u2013 had surfaced\". Eisenhower, after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests, concurred with Yeager and Glover. In the meantime, Yeager shot down his second enemy aircraft, a German Junkers Ju 88 bomber, over the English Channel.\nYeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On October 12, 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make \"ace in a day,\" downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of these victories were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a Messerschmitt Bf 109, the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to port and colliding with his wingman. Yeager said both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter, a German Messerschmitt Me 262 that he shot down as it was on final approach for landing.\nYeager's official statement of the 12 October mission states: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"I was leading the Group with Cement Squadron and was roving out to the right of the first box of bombers.\u00a0 I was over STEINHUDER LAKE when 22 Me. 109s crossed in front of my Squadron from 11:00 O\u2019Clock to 1:00 O\u2019Clock.\u00a0 I was coming out of the sun and they were about 1 \u00bd miles away at the same level of 28,000 feet.\u00a0 I fell in behind the enemy formation and followed them for about 3 minutes, climbing to 30,000 feet.\u00a0 I still had my wing tanks and had closed up to around 1,000 yards, coming within firing range and positioning the Squadron behind the entire enemy formation.\u00a0 Two of the Me. 109s were lagging over to the right.\u00a0 One slowed up and, before I could start firing, rolled over and bailed out.\u00a0 The other Me. 109, flying his wing, bailed out immediately after as I was ready to line him in my sights.\u00a0 I was the closest to the tail-end of the enemy formation and no one, but myself, was in shooting range and no one was firing.\u00a0 I dropped my tanks and then closed up to the last Jerry and opened fire from 600 yards, using the K-14 sight.\u00a0 I observed strikes all over the ship, particularly heavy in the cockpit.\u00a0 He skidded off to the left and was smoking and streaming coolant and went into a slow diving turn to the left.\u00a0 I was closing up on another Me. 109 so I did not follow him down.\u00a0 Lt. STERN, flying in Blue Flight, reports this E/A on fire as it passed him and went into a spin.\u00a0 I closed up on the next Me. 109 to 100 yards, skidded to the right and took a deflection shot of about 10o.\u00a0 I gave about a 3 second burst and the whole fuselage splitopen and blew up after we passed.\u00a0 Another Me. 109 to the right had cut his throttle and was trying to get behind.\u00a0 I broke to the right and quickly rolled to the left on his tail.\u00a0 He started pulling it in and I was pulling 6\u201dG\u201d.\u00a0 I got a lead from around 300 yards and gave him a short burst.\u00a0 There were hits on wings and tail section.\u00a0 He snapped to the right 3 times and bailed out when he quit snapping at around 18,000 feet.\nI did not blackout during this engagement due to the efficiency of the \u201cG\u201d Suit.\u00a0 Even though I was skidding I hit the second Me. 109s by keeping the bead and range on the E/A.\u00a0 To my estimation the K-14 Sight is the biggest improvement to combat equipment for Fighters up to this date.\nThe Me. 109s appeared to have a type of bubble canopy and had purple noses and were a mousey brown all over.\nI claim Five Me. 109s destroyed.\"\nIn his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that \"atrocities were committed by both sides\", and said he went on a mission with orders from the Eighth Air Force to \"strafe anything that moved\". During the mission briefing, he whispered to Major Donald H. Bochkay, \"If we are going to do things like this, we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side\". Yeager said, \"I'm certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians. But it is there, on the record and in my memory\". He also expressed bitterness at his treatment in England during World War II, describing the British as \"arrogant\" and \"nasty\" on Twitter.\nYeager was commissioned a second lieutenant while at Leiston, and was promoted to captain before the end of his tour. He flew his 61st and final mission on January 15, 1945, and returned to the United States in early February 1945. As an evader, he received his choice of assignments and, because his new wife was pregnant, chose Wright Field to be near his home in West Virginia. His high number of flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft, which brought him under the command of Colonel Albert Boyd, head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division.\nPost-World War II.\nTest pilot \u2013 breaking the sound barrier.\nAfter the war, Yeager remained in the U.S. Army Air Forces. Upon graduating from Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School (Class 46C), Yeager became a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field (now Edwards Air Force Base). After Bell Aircraft test pilot Chalmers \"Slick\" Goodlin demanded US$ to break the sound barrier, the USAAF selected the 24-year-old Yeager to fly the rocket-powered Bell XS-1 in a NACA program to research high-speed flight. Under the National Security Act of 1947, the USAAF became the United States Air Force (USAF) on September 18.\nYeager's flight was scheduled for October 14. Two nights before his flight, Yeager went horseback riding with his wife and fell, breaking two ribs under his right arm. Worried the injury would remove him from the mission, Yeager had a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond tape his ribs.\nTo seal the hatch of the XS-1, the pilot needed to hold the hatch in position and use their right arm to slam down a heavy lever. Yeager would not be able to seal the hatch with his broken ribs, so Yeager secretly asked his friend and fellow project pilot Jack Ridley for a solution. Ridley sawed off the end of a broom handle for Yeager to use as a lever to seal the hatch.\nYeager broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, in level flight while piloting the X-1 \"Glamorous Glennis\" at Mach 1.05 at an altitude of over the Rogers Dry Lake of the Mojave Desert in California. The success of the mission was not announced to the public for nearly eight months, until June 10, 1948. Yeager was awarded the Mackay Trophy and the Collier Trophy in 1948 for his mach-transcending flight, and the Harmon International Trophy in 1954. The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. During 1952, he attended the Air Command and Staff College.\nYeager continued to break many speed and altitude records. He was one of the first American pilots to fly a Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15, after its pilot, No Kum-sok, defected to South Korea. Returning to Muroc, during the latter half of 1953, Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the X-1A, an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight. That year, he flew a chase aircraft for the civilian pilot Jackie Cochran as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound.\nOn November 20, 1953, the U.S. Navy program involving the Douglas D-558-II Skyrocket and its pilot, Scott Crossfield, became the first team to reach twice the speed of sound. After they were bested, Ridley and Yeager decided to beat rival Crossfield's speed record in a series of test flights that they dubbed \"Operation NACA Weep\". They not only beat Crossfield by setting a new record at Mach 2.44 on December 12, 1953, but also did so in time to spoil a celebration planned for the 50th anniversary of flight, at which Crossfield was to be called \"the fastest man alive\".\nThe new record flight, however, did not entirely go to plan, since shortly after reaching Mach 2.44, Yeager lost control of the X-1A at about due to inertia coupling, a phenomenon largely unknown at the time. With the aircraft simultaneously rolling, pitching, and yawing out of control, Yeager dropped in less than a minute before regaining control at around . He then managed to land without further incident. For this feat, Yeager was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) in 1954.\nMilitary command.\nYeager was foremost a fighter pilot and held several squadron and wing commands. From 1954 to 1957, he commanded the F-86H Sabre-equipped 417th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (50th Fighter-Bomber Wing) at Hahn AB, West Germany, and Toul-Rosieres Air Base, France; and from 1957 to 1960 the F-100D Super Sabre-equipped 1st Fighter Day Squadron at George Air Force Base, California, and Mor\u00f3n Air Base, Spain.\nHe was a full colonel in 1962, after completion of a year's studies and final thesis on STOL aircraft at the Air War College. He became the first commandant of the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School, which produced astronauts for NASA and the USAF, after its redesignation from the USAF Flight Test Pilot School. He had only a high school education, so he was not eligible to become an astronaut like those he trained. In April 1962, Yeager made his only flight with Neil Armstrong. Their job, flying a T-33, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake in Nevada for use as an emergency landing site for the North American X-15.\nIn his autobiography, he wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As Armstrong suggested that they do a touch-and-go, Yeager advised against it, telling him \"You may touch, but you ain't gonna go!\" When Armstrong did touch down, the wheels became stuck in the mud, bringing the plane to a sudden stop and provoking Yeager to fits of laughter. They had to wait for rescue.\nYeager's participation in the test pilot training program for NASA included controversial behavior. Yeager reportedly did not believe that Ed Dwight, the first African American pilot admitted into the program, should be a part of it. In the 2019 documentary series \"Chasing the Moon\", the filmmakers made the claim that Yeager instructed staff and participants at the school that \"Washington is trying to cram the nigger down our throats. [President] Kennedy is using this to make 'racial equality,' so do not speak to him, do not socialize with him, do not drink with him, do not invite him over to your house, and in six months he'll be gone.\" In his autobiography, Dwight details how Yeager's leadership led to discriminatory treatment throughout his training at Edwards Air Force Base.\nBetween December 1963 and January 1964, Yeager completed five flights in the NASA M2-F1 lifting body. An accident during a December 1963 test flight in one of the school's NF-104s resulted in serious injuries. After climbing to a near-record altitude, the plane's controls became ineffective, and it entered a flat spin. After several turns, and an altitude loss of approximately 95,000 feet, Yeager ejected from the plane. During the ejection, the seat straps released normally, but the seat base slammed into Yeager, with the still-hot rocket motor breaking his helmet's plastic faceplate and causing his emergency oxygen supply to catch fire. The resulting burns to his face required extensive and agonizing medical care. This was Yeager's last attempt at setting test-flying records due to his apparent inability to fly the required flight profiles for optimum climb performance.\nIn 1966, Yeager took command of the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing at Clark Air Base, the Philippines, whose squadrons were deployed on rotational temporary duty (TDY) in South Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. There he flew 127 missions. In February 1968, Yeager was assigned command of the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, and led the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II wing in South Korea during the \"Pueblo\" crisis.\nYeager was promoted to brigadier general and was assigned in July 1969 as the vice-commander of the Seventeenth Air Force.\nFrom 1971 to 1973, at the behest of Ambassador Joseph Farland, Yeager was assigned as the Air Attache in Pakistan to advise the Pakistan Air Force which was led by Abdur Rahim Khan (the first Pakistani to break the sound barrier). He arrived in Pakistan at a time when tensions with India were at a high level. One of Yeager's jobs during this time was to assist Pakistani technicians in installing AIM-9 Sidewinders on PAF's Shenyang F-6 fighters. He also had a keen interest in interacting with PAF personnel from various Pakistani Squadrons and helping them develop combat tactics. \nIn one instance in 1972, while visiting the No. 15 Squadron \"Cobras\" at Peshawar Airbase, the Squadron's OC Wing Commander Najeeb Khan escorted him to K2 in a pair of F-86Fs after Yeager requested a visit to the second highest mountain on Earth. After hostilities broke out in 1971, he decided to stay in West Pakistan and continued overseeing the PAF's operations. Yeager recalled \"the Pakistanis whipped the Indians' asses in the sky... the Pakistanis scored a three-to-one kill ratio, knocking out 102 Russian-made Indian jets and losing 34 airplanes of their own\". \nDuring the war, he flew around the western front in a helicopter documenting wreckages of Indian aircraft of Soviet origin, which included Sukhoi Su-7s and MiG-21s. These aircraft were transported to the United States after the war for analysis. Yeager also flew around in his Beechcraft Queen Air, a small passenger aircraft that was assigned to him by the Pentagon, picking up shot-down Indian fighter pilots. The Beechcraft was later destroyed during an air raid by the IAF at a Pakistani airbase when Yeager was not present. Edward C. Ingraham, a U.S. diplomat who had served as political counselor to Ambassador Farland in Islamabad, recalled this incident in the \"Washington Monthly\" of October 1985: \"After Yeager's Beechcraft was destroyed during an Indian air raid, he raged to his cowering colleagues that the Indian pilot had been specifically instructed by Indira Gandhi to blast his plane. 'It was', he later wrote, 'the Indian way of giving Uncle Sam the finger'\". Yeager was incensed over the incident and demanded U.S. retaliation.\nPost-retirement and in popular culture.\nOn March 1, 1975, Yeager retired from the Air Force at Norton Air Force Base, California.\nYeager made a cameo appearance in the movie \"The Right Stuff\" (1983). He played \"Fred\", a bartender at \"Pancho's Place\", which was most appropriate, because he said, \"if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years\". Sam Shepard portrayed Yeager in the film, which chronicles in part his famous 1947 record-breaking flight.\nYeager has been referenced several times in the shared \"Star Trek\" universe, including having a namesake fictional type of starship, a dangerous starship formation-maneuver named after him called the \"Yeager Loop\" (most notably mentioned in the ' episode \"The First Duty\"), and appearing in archival footage within the opening title sequence for the series ' (2001\u20132005). For \"Enterprise\", executive producer Rick Berman said that he envisaged the lead character, Captain Jonathan Archer, as being \"halfway between Chuck Yeager and Han Solo\".\nFor several years in the 1980s, Yeager was connected to General Motors, publicizing ACDelco, the company's automotive parts division. In 1986, he was invited to drive the Chevrolet Corvette pace car for the 70th running of the Indianapolis 500. In 1988, Yeager was again invited to drive the pace car, this time at the wheel of an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. In 1986, President Reagan appointed Yeager to the Rogers Commission that investigated the explosion of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\".\nDuring this time, Yeager also served as a technical adviser for three Electronic Arts flight simulator video games. The games include \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer\", \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer 2.0\", and \"Chuck Yeager's Air Combat\". The game manuals feature quotes and anecdotes from Yeager and were well received by players. Missions feature several of Yeager's accomplishments and let players challenge his records. \"Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer\" was Electronic Art's top-selling game for 1987.\nIn 2009, Yeager participated in the documentary \"The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club\", a profile of his friend Pancho Barnes. The documentary was screened at film festivals, aired on public television in the United States, and won an Emmy Award.\nOn October 14, 1997, on the 50th anniversary of his historic flight past Mach 1, he flew a new \"Glamorous Glennis III\", an F-15D Eagle, past Mach 1. The chase plane for the flight was an F-16 Fighting Falcon piloted by Bob Hoover, a longtime test, fighter, and aerobatic pilot who had been Yeager's wingman for the first supersonic flight. At the end of his speech to the crowd in 1997, Yeager concluded, \"All that I am ... I owe to the Air Force\". Later that month, he was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his achievements.\nOn October 14, 2012, on the 65th anniversary of breaking the sound barrier, Yeager did it again at the age of 89, flying as co-pilot in a McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain David Vincent out of Nellis Air Force Base.\nIn October 2016, Yeager reached international headlines when a Twitter argument he was having with an Irish teenager led to him lashing out at the British and Irish, namely calling Irish people British, and labeling all British people as \"nasty\" and \"arrogant\". No stranger to controversy in his life, this was one of Yeager's last major public faux-pas.\nAwards and decorations.\nIn 1973, Yeager was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame, arguably aviation's highest honor. In 1974, Yeager received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In December 1975, the U.S. Congress awarded Yeager a silver medal \"equivalent to a noncombat Medal of Honor ... for contributing immeasurably to aerospace science by risking his life in piloting the X-1 research airplane faster than the speed of sound on October 14, 1947\". President Gerald Ford presented the medal to Yeager in a ceremony at the White House on December 8, 1976.\nYeager never attended college and was often modest about his background, but is considered by many, including \"Flying Magazine\", the California Hall of Fame, the State of West Virginia, National Aviation Hall of Fame, a few U.S. presidents, and the United States Army Air Force, to be one of the greatest pilots of all time. \"Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian\" magazine ranked him the fifth greatest pilot of all time in 2003. Regardless of his lack of higher education, West Virginia's Marshall University named its highest academic scholarship the Society of Yeager Scholars in his honor. He was the chairman of Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)'s Young Eagle Program from 1994 to 2004, and was named the program's chairman emeritus.\nIn 1966, Yeager was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1981. He was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor 1990 inaugural class.\nYeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, is named in his honor. The Interstate 64/Interstate 77 bridge over the Kanawha River in Charleston is named in his honor. He also flew directly under the Kanawha Bridge and West Virginia named it the Chuck E. Yeager Bridge. On October 19, 2006, the state of West Virginia also honored Yeager with a marker along Corridor G (part of U.S. Highway 119) in his home Lincoln County, and also renamed part of it the \"Yeager Highway\".\nYeager was an honorary board member of the humanitarian organization Wings of Hope. On August 25, 2009, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver announced that Yeager would be one of 13 California Hall of Fame inductees in The California Museum's yearlong exhibit. The induction ceremony was on December 1, 2009, in Sacramento, California. \"Flying Magazine\" ranked Yeager number 5 on its 2013 list of The 51 Heroes of Aviation; for many years, he was the highest-ranked living person on the list.\nThe Civil Air Patrol, the volunteer auxiliary of the USAF, awards the Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager Award to its senior members as part of its Aerospace Education program.\nPersonal life.\nYeager named his plane after his wife, Glennis, as a good-luck charm: \"You're my good-luck charm, hon. Any airplane I name after you always brings me home.\" Yeager and Glennis moved to Grass Valley, California, after his retirement from the Air Force in 1975. The couple prospered as a result of Yeager's best-selling autobiography, speaking engagements, and commercial ventures. Glennis Yeager died of ovarian cancer in 1990. They had four children (Susan, Don, Mickey, and Sharon). Yeager's son Mickey (Michael) died unexpectedly in Oregon, on March 26, 2011.\nYeager appeared in a Texas advertisement for George H. W. Bush's 1988 presidential campaign.\nIn 2000, Yeager met actress Victoria Scott D'Angelo on a hiking trail in Nevada County. The pair started dating shortly thereafter, and married in August 2003. A bitter dispute arose between Yeager, his children, and D'Angelo. The children contended that she, at least 35 years Yeager's junior, had married him for his fortune. Yeager and D'Angelo both denied the charge. Litigation ensued, in which his children accused D'Angelo of \"undue influence\" on Yeager, and Yeager accused his children of diverting millions of dollars from his assets. In August 2008, the California Court of Appeal ruled for Yeager, finding that his daughter Susan had breached her duty as trustee.\nYeager lived in Grass Valley, Northern California and died in the afternoon of December 7, 2020 (National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day), at age 97, in a Los Angeles hospital. Following his death, President Donald Trump issued a statement of condolences stating Yeager \"was one of the greatest pilots in history, a proud West Virginian, and an American original who relentlessly pushed the boundaries of human achievement\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6186", "revid": "22604547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6186", "title": "Cajun cuisine", "text": "Franco-American food developed by the Cajun people\nCajun cuisine ( , ) is a subset of Louisiana cooking developed by the Cajuns, itself a Louisianan development incorporating elements of Native American, West African, French, and Spanish cuisine.\nCajun cuisine is often referred to as a \"rustic\" cuisine, meaning that it is based on locally available ingredients and that preparation is simple. Cajuns historically cooked their dishes, gumbo for example, in one pot.\nCrawfish, shrimp, and andouille sausage are staple meats used in a variety of dishes. The aromatic vegetables green bell pepper (), onion, and celery are called \"the trinity\" by chefs in Cajun and Louisiana Creole cuisines. Roughly diced and combined in cooking, the method is similar to the use of the \"mirepoix\" in traditional French cuisine which blends roughly diced carrot, onion, and celery. Additional characteristic aromatics for both the Creole and Cajun versions may include parsley, bay leaf, thyme, green onions, ground cayenne pepper, and ground black pepper. Cayenne and Louisiana-style hot sauce are the primary sources of spice in Cajun cuisine, which usually tends towards a moderate, well-balanced heat, despite the national \"Cajun hot\" craze of the 1980s and 1990s.\nHistory.\nThe Acadians are an ethnic group descended from French colonists who settled in what is today Eastern Canada in the early 17th century. In the mid-18th century, thousands were deported by the British during the French and Indian War in what they termed \"le Grand D\u00e9rangement\", and many of them resettled in southern Louisiana where they are known as Cajuns.\nDue to the extreme change in climate from that of Acadia, Acadians were unable to cook their original dishes. Soon, their former culinary traditions were adapted and, in time, incorporated Native American and African American traditions\u2014as exemplified in the classic Cajun dish gumbo, which takes its name from the word for its principal ingredient, okra, in the West African Bambara language. In Louisiana, the Acadian settlers replaced the whole-wheat bread they were accustomed to with cornbread, which by the beginning of the 19th century they were eating with cane syrup. Between 1790 and 1810 most Louisiana Acadians bought one to three enslaved black persons, many from the West Indies, from whom they learned the use of new ingredients, including okra. The ragu sauces that the Cajuns developed are very similar to sauces used in French West Africa, possibly introduced by enslaved cooks.\nMany other meals developed along these lines, adapted in part from Haiti, to become what are now considered classic Cajun cuisine traditions (in contrast to the more modern concepts associated with Paul Prudhomme's style).\nUp through the 20th century, the meals were basic, not elaborate.23 The public's false perception of \"Cajun\" cuisine was based on Prudhomme's style of Cajun cooking, which was spicy, flavorful, and not true to the classic form of the cuisine.\nCajun and Creole cuisine have mistakenly been considered the same, but the origins of Creole cooking are in New Orleans, and Cajun cooking arose 40 years after its establishment. Today, most restaurants serve dishes that consist of Cajun styles, which Prudhomme dubbed \"Louisiana cooking\". In Cajun home cooking, these individual styles are still kept separate. However, there are fewer people cooking the classic Cajun dishes that would have been eaten by the original settlers.30\nCultural aspects.\nAccording to political scientist Kevin V. Mulcahy writing on cultural identity, Cajun cuisine today is different from that of the 19th and early 20th centuries, but still defines Cajun culture for many people within and outside Acadiana. Its heritage reflects French, Spanish, American Indian, German, and Afro-Caribbean influences. Cajun food is the result of this assimilation or \"cultural blending\". Rural Cajun cuisine is distinct from the urban Creole cuisine, having arisen by economic necessity among the Acadian immigrants who came to Louisiana in the 18th century. These settlers lived off the land and survived on foods they could obtain by hunting, fishing, ranching, foraging, or growing crops.\nAlthough there is a large variety of dishes within the regions that make up Cajun country in Louisiana, rural Cajuns generally prefer strong dark roast coffee, highly seasoned foods, hot peppers, vegetables smothered in brown gravy, and one-pot dishes served with rice. Each region has its own specialties, such as \"andouille\" sausage on the west bank of the Mississippi River above New Orleans, formerly known as the German Coast; barbecued shrimp in Terrebonne Parish; tasso ham made from hog's shoulder in the area around Opelousas; and crawfish all across the parishes of southern Louisiana, where they are abundant in the fresh water wetlands and waterways.\nMany Cajun recipes are based on rice and the \"holy trinity\" of onions, celery, and green pepper, and use locally caught shell fish such as shrimp and crawfish. Much of Cajun cookery starts with a \"roux\" made of wheat flour cooked and slowly stirred with a fat such as oil, butter or lard, known especially as the base for \u00e9touff\u00e9e, gumbo and sauce piquante. Cajun cooks in south Louisiana historically have cooked meals in single pots, and still cook meats by braising. Almost all Cajun households had gardens up until the latter years of the 20th century, and lifted regional culinary standards by adding the fresh vegetables they grew to their dishes.\nThere was continuity in cuisines between the southern Bayou Teche area and the northern boundary of Cajun country in Avoyelles Parish. Fresh sausage, pork, and the use of salt and pepper as the main seasonings were universal in the region's foodway traditions, north and south. The role of seafood in the cuisine of the southern parishes distinguished it from that of the prairies, where more wild game was consumed instead.\nAnthropologist Charlotte Paige Gutierrez has written extensively on Louisiana's traditional foodways. She writes: \"The term foodways, as it is now used by writers in various disciplines, has a broad definition. The study of foodways may include the production, distribution, preparation, preservation, serving, and eating of food, as well as the social, symbolic, psychological, and behavioral aspects of food.\" Modern conveniences influenced Louisiana's culinary traditions: with the introduction of electricity and refrigerators, consuming freshly butchered meat immediately was not imperative as in the past, thus community events such as hog-killings (\"boucheries\") occurred less frequently. Improved transportation and increased incomes made food stores more accessible and buying produce became more affordable for working families. Cajuns now bought their bread at a grocery store rather than baking their own. According to Gutierrez, when the economy of southern Louisiana boomed with the expansion of oil industry operations in the 1970s, Cajuns gained a renewed pride in their ethnicity.\nOnly those Cajuns who live near the coast are able to regularly harvest seafood such as crabs, oysters, shrimp, and saltwater fish directly from their habitats. Shrimping, crabbing, fishing, frog-gigging, and gardening have been practiced in Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes as subsistence and commercial pursuits for many generations. Before the introduction of modern transportation and refrigeration, Cajuns who lived in the southwestern prairie parishes away from the coast had little opportunity to incorporate seafood into their diets. Today, fresh seafood is available all across Acadiana, so that now it is regarded as a regional food rather than one available only to coastal residents.\nThe cooking traditions of the western prairies and those of the Bayou country in southeastern Louisiana overlap in the lower and middle Bayou Teche region. The complicated network of lakes, streams, bayous, and the flood plains with their rich soil characterize the terrain of Iberia, St. Martin, and St. Mary parishes. The traditional cuisine uses those resources available in the area: pork from hog farms on the plains and seafood from the lowlands.\nSeasoning practices in the Teche country occupy a middle place between the salt and black pepper-based approach to spices in the Bayou country and the prevalent use of cayenne pepper in the Cajun prairies. People along the lower and middle Teche use cayenne more often than in the Laforche area. Hot pepper sauce has a more dominant role in the Teche country cuisine than in other Cajun regions.\nIn the upper Teche region, wild game, freshwater fish, and pork are important in the local diet, with rabbit, duck, and venison being eaten more often than among their neighbors to southward. Avoyelles Parish, along the northern edge of Cajun country where cultural influences converge, shares some of these dietary features, although local cooking traditions are somewhat different than in the Teche country. Natives of the parish make fresh sausage, but cling to certain European customs, notably the preparation of \"cochon de lait r\u00f3ti\", or roasted suckling pig. After the young pigs are slaughtered, they are suspended vertically by a rope tied to a tree limb and hang over a hardwood fire. For even cooking of the pig, it is rotated with a stick. Halfway through the roasting, the carcass is turned end for end to assure even heating of the meat. Local cooks have constructed improvised rotisseries, some fitting theirs with small motors for mechanized rotation.\nThe upper prairie, historically an area of small farms, ranches, and rice fields, has its own distinctive cuisine, well known for its smoked meats and \"boudin blanc\", white sausage made of pork, rice, and seasonings. Local hardwoods such as oak, pecan, and hickory are used to smoke sausages and tasso. Smoked meats are comparatively rare, however, in other Cajun communities.\nCajun cooking methods.\nDeep frying of turkeys or oven-roasted turduckens entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, blackening of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine. Blackening was actually an invention by chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1970s, becoming associated with Cajun cooking, and presented as such by him, but is not a true historical or traditional Cajun cooking process.\nIngredients.\nIn the late 18th century, about the same time that Acadian musicians embraced the Spanish guitar, spices from the Iberian Peninsula were adopted in the Acadian cuisine. With the cross-cultural borrowing that took place between them and their neighbors in southern Louisiana, Acadians were eating African okra and American Indian corn by the time of the Louisiana Purchase (1803) in such dishes as \"gumbo\", \"pain de ma\u00efs\", and \"soupe de ma\u00efs\", which did not closely resemble the African and Indian versions.\nThe following is a partial list of ingredients used in Cajun cuisine and some of the staple ingredients of the Acadian food culture.\nMeat and seafood.\nCajun foodways include many ways of preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and mass-produced meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or duck confit (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.\nGame (and hunting) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.\nThe recent increase of catfish farming in the Mississippi Delta has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in place of the more traditional wild-caught speckled trout.\nBeef and dairy&lt;br&gt;\nThough parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the US, although seasoned differently.\nDairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine. Traditional Cajun and New Orleans Creole-influenced desserts are common.\nSeasonings.\nThyme, sage, mint, marjoram, savory, and basil are considered sweet herbs. In colonial times a herbes de Provence would be several sweet herbs tied up in a muslin.\nCajun seasonings consist of a blend of salt with a variety of spices, most common being cayenne pepper and garlic. The spicy heat comes from the cayenne pepper, while other flavors come from bell pepper, paprika, green onions, parsley and more.\nPreparation of a dark roux is probably the most involved or complicated procedure in Cajun cuisine, involving heating fat and flour very carefully, constantly stirring for about 15\u201345 minutes (depending on the color of the desired product), until the mixture has darkened in color and developed a nutty flavor. The temperature should not be too high, as a burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable.\nA light roux, on the other hand, is better suited for strictly seafood dishes and unsuitable for meat gumbos for the reason that it does not support the heavier meat flavor as well. Pairing roux with protein follows the same orthodox philosophy as pairing wine with protein.\nCajun dishes.\nWell-known dishes.\nBoudin\u2014a type of sausage made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic, green onions and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. \"Boudin\" is typically stuffed in a natural casing and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, \"maque choux\" or bread. \"Boudin\" balls are commonly served in southern Louisiana restaurants and are made by taking the \"boudin\" out of the case and frying it in spherical form.\nGumbo\u2014Among the best-known elements of Cajun cooking are the soups called gumbos. Contrary to non-Cajun or Continental beliefs, gumbo does not mean simply \"everything in the pot\". Gumbo exemplifies the influence of French, Spanish, African and Native American food cultures on Cajun cuisine.\nThe origins of the word \"gumbo\" are in West Africa. Kellersberger Vass lists \"kingumbo\" and \"tshingombo\" as the Bantu words for okra, while John Laudon of the University of Louisiana says the word \"gombo\" is a French word that came to the Western Hemisphere from West Africa, where okra was known as \"(ki) ngombo\" along much of the region's coast.\nBoth fil\u00e9 and okra can be used as thickening agents in gumbo. Historically, large amounts of fil\u00e9 were added directly to the pot when okra was out of season. While a distinction between fil\u00e9 gumbo and okra gumbo is still held by some, many people enjoy putting fil\u00e9 in okra gumbo simply as a flavoring. Regardless of which is the dominant thickener, fil\u00e9 is also provided at the table and added to taste.\nMany claim that gumbo is a Cajun dish, but gumbo was established long before the Acadian arrival. Its early existence came via the early French Creole culture in New Orleans, where French, Spanish and Africans frequented, and it was later also influenced by Italian, German and Irish settlers.\nThe backbone of a gumbo is roux, as described above. Cajun gumbo typically favors darker roux, often approaching the color of chocolate or coffee beans. Since the starches in the flour break down more with longer cooking time, a dark roux has less thickening power than a lighter one. While the stovetop method is traditional, flour may also be dry-toasted in an oven for a fat-free roux, or a regular roux may be prepared in a microwave oven for a hands-off method. If the roux is for immediate use, the \"trinity\" may be sauteed in it, which stops the cooking process.\nA classic gumbo is made with chicken and andouille, especially in the colder months, but the ingredients vary according to what is available. Seafood gumbos are also very popular in Cajun country.\nJambalaya\u2014The only certain thing that can be said about jambalaya is that it contains rice, some sort of meat (often chicken, ham, sausage, or a combination), seafood (such as shrimp or crawfish), plus other items that may be available. Usually, it will include green peppers, onions, celery, tomatoes and hot chili peppers. This is also a great pre-Acadian dish, established by the Spanish in Louisiana. Jambalaya may be a tomato-rich New Orleans-style \"red\" jambalaya of Spanish Creole roots, or a Cajun-style \"brown\" jambalaya which draws its color and flavor from browned meat and caramelized onions. Historically, tomatoes were not as widely available in Acadiana as the area around New Orleans, but in modern times, both styles are popular across the state. Brown is the style served at the annual World Jambalaya Festival in Gonzales.\nRice and gravy\u2014Rice and gravy dishes are a staple of Cajun cuisine and is usually a brown gravy based on pan drippings, which are deglazed and simmered with extra seasonings and served over steamed or boiled rice.\nThe dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a cast-iron pot, typically for an extended time period to let the tough cuts of meat become tender. Beef, pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation. Popular local varieties include hamburger steak, smothered rabbit, turkey necks, and chicken fricassee.\nFood as an event.\nCrawfish boil.\nThe crawfish boil is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn in large pots over propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper, and other spices, commonly known as \"crab boil\" or \"crawfish boil\" are added to the water for seasoning.\nThe results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in Creole/Cajun spice blends, such as REX, Zatarain's, Louisiana Fish Fry, or Tony Chachere's. Also, cocktail sauce, mayonnaise, and hot sauce are sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand.\nDuring times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner.\nAttendees are encouraged to \"suck the head\" of a crawfish by separating the head from the abdomen of the crustacean and sucking out the fat and juices from the head.\nOften, newcomers to the crawfish boil or those unfamiliar with the traditions are jokingly warned \"not to eat the dead ones.\" This comes from the common belief that when live crawfish are boiled, their tails curl beneath themselves, but when dead crawfish are boiled, their tails are straight and limp.\nSeafood boils with crabs and shrimp are also popular.\nFamily.\nThe traditional Cajun outdoor food event is hosted by a farmer in the rural areas of Acadiana. Family and friends of the farmer gather to socialize, play games, dance, drink, and have a copious meal consisting of hog and other dishes.111 Men have the task of slaughtering a hog, cutting it into usable parts, and cooking the main pork dishes while women have the task of making boudin.110\nSimilar to a family , the is a food event that revolves around pork but does not need to be hosted by a farmer. Traditionally, a suckling pig was purchased for the event, but in modern , adult pigs are used.111\nUnlike the family , a hog is not butchered by the hosts and there are generally not as many guests or activities.112 The host and male guests have the task of roasting the pig (see pig roast) while female guests bring side dishes.\nRural Mardi Gras.\nThe traditional Cajun Mardi Gras (\"Courir de Mardi Gras\") is celebrated in rural Cajun parishes. The tradition originated in the 18th century with the Cajuns of Louisiana, but it was abandoned in the early 20th century because of unwelcome violence associated with the event. In the early 1950s the tradition was revived in Mamou in Evangeline Parish.112\nThe event revolves around male maskers on horseback who ride into the countryside to collect food ingredients for the party later on. They entertain householders with Cajun music, dancing, and festive antics in return for the ingredients. The preferred ingredient is fresh chicken: the householder throws a live chicken to the maskers, allowing them to chase it down (symbolizing a hunt); other ingredients include rice, sausage, vegetables, or a frozen chicken if a live one is not available.112\nUnlike other Cajun events, men take no part in cooking the main course for the party, and women prepare the chicken and ingredients for the gumbo.113 Once the festivities begin, the Cajun community members eat and dance to Cajun music until midnight, after which Lent begins.113\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Cologne is also part of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, the second biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union. Centered on the left bank of the Rhine, Cologne is located on the River Rhine (Lower Rhine), about southeast of the North Rhine-Westphalia state capital D\u00fcsseldorf and northwest of Bonn, the former capital of West Germany.\nThe city's medieval Cologne Cathedral () was the from 1880 to 1890 and is today the third-tallest church and tallest cathedral in the world. It was constructed to house the Shrine of the Three Kings and is a globally recognized landmark and one of the most visited sights and pilgrimage destinations in Europe. The cityscape is further shaped by the Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne. Cologne is famous for Eau de Cologne, which has been produced in the city since 1709; \"cologne\" has since come to be a generic term.\nCologne was founded and established in Germanic Ubii territory in the 1st century AD as the Roman , hence its name. was later dropped (except in Latin), and became the name of the city in its own right, which developed into modern German as . , the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. Cologne functioned as the capital of the Roman province of and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the Franks in 462. During the Middle Ages the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major trade routes between eastern and western Europe (including the Brabant Road, Via Regia and Publica). Cologne was a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire and one of the major members of the trade union Hanseatic League. It was one of the largest European cities in medieval and renaissance times.\nPrior to World War II, the city had undergone occupations by the French (1794\u20131815) and the British (1918\u20131926), and was part of Prussia beginning in 1815. Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War\u00a0II. The bombing reduced the population by 93% mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed around 80% of the millennia-old city center. The post-war rebuilding has resulted in a mixed cityscape, restoring most major historic landmarks like city gates and churches (31 of them being Romanesque). The city nowadays consists of around 25% pre World War II buildings and boasts around 9,000 historic buildings.\nCologne is a major cultural center for the Rhineland; it hosts more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries. There are many institutions of higher education, most notably the University of Cologne, one of Europe's oldest and largest universities; the Technical University of Cologne, Germany's largest university of applied sciences; and the German Sport University Cologne. It hosts three Max Planck science institutes and is a major research hub for the aerospace industry, with the German Aerospace Center and the European Astronaut Centre headquarters. Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline, have their main corporate headquarters in Cologne. It also has a significant chemical and automobile industry. Cologne Bonn Airport is a regional hub, the main airport for the region being D\u00fcsseldorf Airport. The Cologne Trade Fair hosts a number of trade shows.\nHistory.\nRoman Cologne.\nThe first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was \"Oppidum Ubiorum\", founded in 38\u00a0BC by the Ubii, a Cisrhenian Germanic tribe. In AD 50, the Romans founded Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium (Cologne) on the river Rhine, a colonia which was named after Emperor Claudius and his wife, who was born here, Agrippina the Younger. In 85, the city became the provincial capital of Germania Inferior. It was also known as . Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a 1,900-year-old Roman boat was discovered in late 2007. From 260 to 271, Cologne was the capital of the Gallic Empire under Postumus, Marius, and Victorinus. In 310, under emperor Constantine I, a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centers in the Roman Empire north of the Alps. Cologne is shown on the 4th century Peutinger Map.\nMaternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until it was occupied by the Ripuarian Franks in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the new sewerage system having opened in 1890.\nAfter the destruction of the Second Temple in the Siege of Jerusalem and the associated dispersion (diaspora) of the Jews, there is evidence of a Jewish community in Cologne. In 321, Emperor Constantine approved the settlement of a Jewish community with all the freedoms of Roman citizens. It is assumed that it was located near the Marspforte within the city wall. The Edict of Constantine to the Jews is the oldest documented evidence in Germany.\nMiddle Ages.\nEarly medieval Cologne was part of Austrasia within the Frankish Empire. Cunibert, made bishop of Cologne in 623, was an important advisor to the Merovingian King Dagobert I and served with domesticus Pepin of Landen as tutor to the king's son and heir Siegebert III, the future king of Austrasia. In 716, Charles Martel commanded an army for the first time and suffered the only defeat of his life when Chilperic II, King of Neustria, invaded Austrasia and the city fell to him in the Battle of Cologne. Charles fled to the Eifel mountains, rallied supporters and took the city back that same year after defeating Chilperic in the Battle of Ambl\u00e8ve. Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under Charlemagne, in 795, bishop Hildebold was promoted to archbishop. In the 843 Treaty of Verdun Cologne fell into the dominion of Lothair I's Middle Francia \u2013 later called Lotharingia (Lower Lorraine).\nIn 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power when bishop Bruno was appointed as duke by his brother Otto I, King of Germany. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his archiepiscopal successors with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the Electorate of Cologne, formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of J\u00fclich, as well as the Duchy of Westphalia on the other side of the Rhine, beyond Berg and Mark. By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was Archchancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.\nFollowing the Battle of Worringen in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a Free City. Archbishop Sigfried II von Westerburg was forced to reside in Bonn. The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, the sentence for which was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge known as the greve. This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.\nBesides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's archbishop, Rainald of Dassel, gave the relics of the Three Wise Men to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they had been taken from Milan). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of Saint Ursula and Albertus Magnus.\nCologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major trade routes between east and west as well as the main south\u2013north Western Europe trade route, Venice to Netherlands; even by the mid-10th century, merchants in the town were already known for their prosperity and luxurious standard of living due to the availability of trade opportunities. The intersection of these trade routes was the basis of Cologne's growth. By the end of the 12th century, Archbishop Phillip von Heinsberg enclosed the entire city with walls. By 1300 the city population was 50,000\u201355,000. Cologne was a member of the Hanseatic League in 1475, when Frederick III confirmed the city's imperial immediacy. Cologne was so influential in regional commerce that its systems of weights and measurements (e.g. the Cologne mark) were used throughout Europe.\nEarly modern history.\nThe economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.\nAs a free imperial city, Cologne was a self-ruling state within the Holy Roman Empire, an imperial estate with seat and vote at the Imperial Diet, and as such had the right (and obligation) to contribute to the defense of the Empire and maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the \"Rote Funken\" (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the Holy Roman Empire (\"Reichskontingent\"). They fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France in which the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the \"Rote Funken\".\nThe Free Imperial City of Cologne must not be confused with the Electorate of Cologne, which was a state of its own within the Holy Roman Empire. Since the second half of the 16th century, the majority of archbishops were drawn from the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in Bonn and later in Br\u00fchl on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as electors, the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.\nFrom the 19th century until World War I.\nCologne lost its status as a free city during the French period. According to the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville (1801) all the territories of the Holy Roman Empire on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the French Republic (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of Napoleon's Empire. Cologne was part of the French D\u00e9partement Roer (named after the river Roer, German: Rur) with Aachen (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the Napoleonic Code and removing the old elites from power. The Napoleonic code remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the \"B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch\") was introduced in the German Empire. In 1815 at the Congress of Vienna, Cologne was made part of the Kingdom of Prussia, first in the Province of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg and then the Rhine Province.\nThe permanent tensions between the Catholic Rhineland and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, Clemens August von Droste-Vischering, was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Catholics and Protestants (\"Mischehenstreit\"). In 1874, during the Kulturkampf, Archbishop Paul Melchers was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer, became the first West German chancellor.\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War\u00a0I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the Ruhr area. The cathedral, started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded German empire and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.\nCologne was designated as one of the Fortresses of the German Confederation. It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of Verdun and Li\u00e8ge) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day. The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.\nDuring World War\u00a0I Cologne was the target of several minor air raids but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the British Army of the Rhine until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent Versailles Peace Treaty. In contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. Konrad Adenauer, the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.\nAs part of the demilitarisation of the Rhineland, the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (\"Gr\u00fcng\u00fcrtel\") around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the University of Cologne, closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the University of Strasbourg on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of Alsace. Cologne prospered during the Weimar Republic (1919\u201333), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at M\u00fcngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to Berlin Tempelhof Airport.\nThe democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the Nazi Party and other extreme-right parties. The Nazis then arrested the Communist and Social Democrats members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in Reichstag elections had always been the national average.) By 1939, the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters () for Wehrkreis VI (headquartered at M\u00fcnster). Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in Bonn, Siegburg, Aachen, J\u00fclich, D\u00fcren, and Monschau. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.\nThe Allies dropped 44,923.2 tons of bombs on the city during World War II, destroying 61% of its built-up area. During the Bombing of Cologne in World War II, Cologne endured 262 air raids by the Western Allies, which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of \"Operation Millennium\", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the Royal Air Force in World War\u00a0II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary. This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed of built-up area (61%), killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. The devastation was recorded by Hermann Claasen from 1942 until the end of the war, and presented in his exhibition and book of 1947 \"Singing in the furnace. Cologne \u2013 Remains of an old city\".\nCologne was taken by the American First Army in early March 1945 during the Invasion of Germany after a battle. By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95%. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities in the last two years of war. By the end of 1945, however, the population had already recovered to approximately 450,000. By the end of the war, essentially all of Cologne's pre-war Jewish population of 11,000 had been deported or killed by the Nazis. The six synagogues of the city were destroyed. The synagogue on Roonstra\u00dfe was rebuilt in 1959.\nPost-war and Cold War eras.\nDespite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby D\u00fcsseldorf was chosen as the political capital of the federated state of North Rhine-Westphalia. With Bonn being chosen as the provisional federal capital (\"provisorische Bundeshauptstadt\") and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally West Germany), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became\u2013and still is\u2013home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.\nIn 1945 architect and urban planner Rudolf Schwarz called Cologne the \"world's greatest heap of rubble\". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the \"Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt\" (\"North-South-Drive\"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.\nThe destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous Twelve Romanesque churches such as St.\u00a0Gereon, Great St.\u00a0Martin, St.\u00a0Maria im Kapitol and several other monuments in World War\u00a0II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the G\u00fcrzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of St.\u00a0Kunibert was finished.\nIn 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1\u00a0million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1\u00a0million again.\nPost-reunification.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strong visual focal point in Cologne's city centre and includes the \"K\u00f6lnTurm\", one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.\nDue to the economic success of the Cologne Trade Fair, the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to RTL, Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.\nCologne was the focus of the 2015-16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, with over 500 women reporting that they were sexually assaulted by persons of African and Arab appearance.\nGeography.\nThe metropolitan area encompasses over , extending around a central point that lies at 50\u00b0 56' 33 latitude and 6\u00b0 57' 32 longitude. The city's highest point is above sea level (the Monte Troodel\u00f6h) and its lowest point is above sea level (the Worringer Bruch). The city of Cologne lies within the larger area of the Cologne Lowland, a cone-shaped area of the central Rhineland that lies between Bonn, Aachen and D\u00fcsseldorf.\nDistricts.\nCologne is divided into 9 boroughs (\"Stadtbezirke\") and 85 districts (\"Stadtteile\"):\nClimate.\nLocated in the Rhine-Ruhr area, Cologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany. It has a temperate\u2013oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfb\") with cool winters and warm summers. It is also one of the cloudiest cities in Germany, with just 1,567.5 hours of sun a year. Its average annual temperature is : during the day and at night. In January, the mean temperature is , while the mean temperature in July is . The record high temperature of happened on 25 July 2019 during the July 2019 European heat wave in which Cologne saw three consecutive days over . Especially the inner urban neighbourhoods experience a greater number of hot days, as well as significantly higher temperatures during nighttime compared to the surrounding area (including the airport, where temperatures are classified). Still temperatures can vary noticeably over the course of a month with warmer and colder weather. Precipitation is spread evenly throughout the year with a light peak in summer due to showers and thunderstorms.\nThe progressing climate change can be seen by looking at the climate data of the previous decade with lower mean temperatures.\nFlood protection.\nCologne is regularly affected by flooding from the Rhine and is considered the most flood-prone European city. A city agency (\"Stadtentw\u00e4sserungsbetriebe K\u00f6ln\", \"Cologne Urban Drainage Operations\") manages an extensive flood control system which includes both permanent and mobile flood walls, protection from rising waters for buildings close to the river banks, monitoring and forecasting systems, pumping stations and programmes to create or protect floodplains, and river embankments. The system was redesigned after a 1993 flood, which resulted in heavy damage.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;In the Roman Empire, the city was large and rich with a population of 40,000 in 100\u2013200\u00a0AD. The city was home to around 20,000 people in 1000\u00a0AD, growing to 50,000 in 1200\u00a0AD. The Rhineland metropolis still had 50,000 residents in 1300\u00a0AD.\nCologne is the fourth-largest city by population in Germany after Berlin, Hamburg and Munich. As of 31 December 2021, there were 1,079,301 people registered as living in Cologne in an area of , which makes Cologne the third largest city by area. The population density was . Cologne first reached the population of 1,000,000 in 1975 due to the incorporation of Wesseling, however this was reversed after public opposition. In 2009 Cologne's population again reached 1,000,000 and it became one of the four cities in Germany with a population exceeding 1 Million. The metropolitan area of the Cologne Bonn Region is home to 3,573,500 living on . It is part of the polycentric megacity region Rhine-Ruhr with a population of over 11,000,000 people.\nThere were 551,528 women and 527,773 men in Cologne. In 2021, there were 11,127 births in Cologne; 5,844 marriages and 1,808 divorces, and 10,536 deaths. In the city, the population was spread out, with 16.3% under the age of 18, and 17.8% were 65 years of age or older. 203 people in Cologne were over the age of 100.\nAccording to the Statistical Office of the City of Cologne, the number of people with a migrant background is at 40.5% (436,660). 2,254 people acquired German citizenship in 2021. In 2021, there were 559,854 households, of which 18.4% had children under the age of 18; 51% of all households were made up of singles. 8% of all households were single-parent households. The average household size was 1.88.\nResidents with foreign citizenship.\nCologne residents with a foreign citizenship as of 31 December 2021 is as follows:\nTurkish community.\nCologne is home to 90,000 people of Turkish origin and is the second largest German city with Turkish population after Berlin. Cologne has a Little Istanbul in Keupstra\u00dfe that has many Turkish restaurants and markets. Famous Turkish-German people like rapper Eko Fresh and TV presenter Nazan Eckes were born in Cologne.\nLanguage.\nColognian or K\u00f6lsch () (natively \"K\u00f6lsch Platt\") is a small set of very closely related dialects, or variants, of the Ripuarian Central German group of languages. These dialects are spoken in the area covered by the Archdiocese and former Electorate of Cologne reaching from Neuss in the north to just south of Bonn, west to D\u00fcren and east to Olpe in the North-West of Germany. K\u00f6lsch is one of the very few city dialects in Germany, which also include the dialect spoken in Berlin, for example.\nReligion.\nAs of 2015, 35.5% of the population belonged to the Catholic Church, the largest religious body, and 15.5% to the Protestant Church. Irenaeus of Lyons claimed that Christianity was brought to Cologne by Roman soldiers and traders at an unknown early date. It is known that in the early second century it was a bishop's seat. The first historical Bishop of Cologne was Saint Maternus. Thomas Aquinas studied in Cologne in 1244 under Albertus Magnus. Cologne is the seat of the Archdiocese of Cologne.\nAccording to the 2011 census, 2.1% of the population was Eastern Orthodox, 0.5% belonged of an Evangelical Free Church and 4.2% belonged to further religious communities officially recognized by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (such as Jehovah's Witnesses).\nThere are several mosques, including the Cologne Central Mosque run by the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs. In 2011, about 11.2% of the population was Muslim.\nCologne also has one of the oldest and largest Jewish communities in Germany. In 2011, 0.3% of Cologne's population was Jewish.\nOn 11 October 2021, the Mayor of Cologne, Henriette Reker, announced that all of Cologne's 35 mosques would be allowed to broadcast the Adhan (prayer call) for up to five minutes on Fridays between noon and 3 p.m. She commented that the move \"shows that diversity is appreciated and loved in Cologne\".\nGovernment and politics.\nThe city's administration is headed by the mayor and the three deputy mayors.\nPolitical traditions and developments.\nThe long tradition of a free imperial city, which long dominated an exclusively Catholic population and the age-old conflict between the church and the bourgeoisie (and within it between the patricians and craftsmen) have created its own political climate in Cologne. Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a \"waste scandal\" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.\nMayor.\nThe incumbent Lord Mayor of Cologne is Torsten Burmester of the SPD. He received 53.51% of the vote at the runoff election.\nThe most recent mayoral election was held on 14 September 2025, with a runoff held on 28 September, and the results were as follows:\nCity council.\nThe Cologne city council (\"K\u00f6lner Stadtrat\") governs the city alongside the mayor. It serves a term of five years. The most recent city council election was held on 14 September 2025, and the results were as follows:\nState Landtag.\nIn the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia, Cologne is divided among seven constituencies. After the 2022 North Rhine-Westphalia state election, the composition and representation of each was as follows:\nFederal parliament.\nIn the Bundestag, Cologne is divided among four constituencies. In the 21st Bundestag, elected 23 February 2025, the composition and representation of each was as follows:\nCityscape.\nThe inner city of Cologne was largely destroyed during World War\u00a0II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city centre today is characterized by modern architecture, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example, the opera house by Wilhelm Riphahn, are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture. Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the Cologne Opera house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.\nThe districts outside the city center consist mostly of 19th and 20th century buildings. Around 25% of Cologne was built before 1945.\nGreen areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately of public green space for every inhabitant.\nWildlife.\nThe dominant wildlife of Cologne is insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. Pigeons are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of feral exotics, most visibly parrots such as the rose-ringed parakeet. The sheltered climate in southeast North Rhine-Westphalia allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases, they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green parrots is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.\nHedgehogs, rabbits and squirrels are common in parks and the greener parts of town. In the outer suburbs foxes and wild boar can be seen, even during the day.\nTourism.\nCologne had 5.8\u00a0million overnight stays booked and 3.35\u00a0million arrivals in 2016.\nLandmarks.\nMedieval houses.\nThe Cologne City Hall (\"K\u00f6lner Rathaus\"), founded in the 12th century, is the oldest city hall in Germany still in use. The Renaissance-style loggia and tower were added in the 15th century. Other famous buildings include the G\u00fcrzenich, Haus Saaleck and the Overstolzenhaus.\nMedieval city gates.\nOf the twelve medieval city gates that once existed, only the Eigelsteintorburg at Ebertplatz, the Hahnentor at Rudolfplatz and the Severinstorburg at Chlodwigplatz still stand today.\nBridges.\nSeveral bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from south to north): the Rodenkirchen Bridge, South Bridge (railway), Severin Bridge, Deutz Bridge, Hohenzollern Bridge (railway), Zoo Bridge (\"Zoobr\u00fccke\") and M\u00fclheim Bridge. In particular the iron tied arch Hohenzollern Bridge (\"Hohenzollernbr\u00fccke\") is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine crossing of a special kind is provided by the Cologne Cable Car (German: \"K\u00f6lner Seilbahn\"), a cableway that runs across the river between the Cologne Zoological Garden in Riehl and the Rheinpark in Deutz.\nHigh-rise structures.\nCologne's tallest structure is the Colonius telecommunication tower at . The observation deck has been closed since 1992. A selection of the tallest buildings in Cologne is listed below. Other tall structures include the Hansahochhaus (designed by architect Jacob Koerfer and completed in 1925 \u2013 it was at one time Europe's tallest office building), the Kranhaus buildings at Rheinauhafen, and the Messeturm K\u00f6ln (\"trade fair tower\").\nCulture.\nCologne has numerous museums. The famous Roman-Germanic Museum features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the Museum Ludwig houses one of the most important collections of modern art in Europe, including a Picasso collection matched only by the museums in Barcelona and Paris. The Museum Schn\u00fctgen of religious art is partly housed in St.\u00a0Cecilia, one of Cologne's Twelve Romanesque churches. Many art galleries in Cologne enjoy a worldwide reputation like e.g. Galerie Karsten Greve, one of the leading galleries for postwar and contemporary art.\nCologne has more than 60 music venues and the third-highest density of music venues of Germany's four largest cities, after Munich and Hamburg and ahead of Berlin.\nSeveral orchestras are active in the city, among them the G\u00fcrzenich Orchestra, which is also the orchestra of the Cologne Opera and the WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne (\"German State Radio Orchestra\"), both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building (K\u00f6lner Philharmonie). Other orchestras are the Musica Antiqua K\u00f6ln, the WDR Rundfunkorchester K\u00f6ln and WDR Big Band, and several choirs, including the WDR Rundfunkchor K\u00f6ln. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio f\u00fcr elektronische Musik, Karlheinz Stockhausen) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station WDR was involved in promoting musical movements such as Krautrock in the 1970s; the influential Can was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the \"Kwartier Lat\u00e4ng\" (the student quarter around the Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe) and the nightclub-studded areas around Hohenzollernring, Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.\nThe large annual literary festival lit.COLOGNE with its Silberschweinpreis features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is the writer Heinrich B\u00f6ll, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Since 2012, there is also an annual international festival of philosophy called phil.cologne.\nThe city also has the most pubs per capita in Germany. Cologne is well known for its beer, called K\u00f6lsch. K\u00f6lsch is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of K\u00f6lsch being the only language one can drink.\nCologne is also famous for Eau de Cologne (German: \"K\u00f6lnisch Wasser\"; lit: \"Water of Cologne\"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate Johann Maria Farina at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and \"Farina\" became a household name for \"Eau de Cologne\". In 1803 Wilhelm M\u00fclhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and M\u00fchlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson Ferdinand M\u00fclhens was forced to abandon the name \"Farina\" for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, 4711. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the Farina family, in the eighth generation, and by M\u00e4urer &amp; Wirtz who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.\nCarnival.\nThe Cologne carnival is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11\u00a0a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until Ash Wednesday. However, the so-called \"Tolle Tage\" (crazy days) do not start until \"Weiberfastnacht\" (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, \"Wieverfastelovend\", the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Z\u00fclpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.\nCuisine.\nCologne is shaped by a long culinary tradition that has been enriched with imported and sometimes exotic elements. Because of its prominent role in international trade, the local cuisine incorporated herring, mussels, and many spices very early on. In the Middle Ages, when salmon (usually called \"Salm\" in Cologne) and allis shad (\"Maifisch\") were still abundant in the Rhine, these fish were considered poor people\u2019s food, while herring was very popular in bourgeois households. The Rhenish herring salad (\"Heringsstipp\") with apples, onions, and cream still bears witness to this tradition. Mussels \u201cRhenish style\u201d are now a staple of local gastronomy.\nAs is typical in the Rhineland, sweet and savory flavors are often combined. The fertile soil and favorable climate also make vegetables a major part of Cologne\u2019s cuisine. A sweet-and-sour specialty is \"Rheinischer Sauerbraten\" (Rhenish pot roast), which was originally made with horse meat, as well as the simpler \"Himmel un \u00c4\u00e4d\" (Heaven and Earth)\u2014a mix of mashed potatoes and apple sauce\u2014served with fried blood sausage (\"Fl\u00f6nz\"). Savoy cabbage and asparagus are also commonly offered as seasonal vegetables.\nA special role in Cologne is played by the \"Brauh\u00e4user\" (brewpubs). These establishments were originally created for serving beer from Cologne\u2019s breweries but have since become key venues for traditional, hearty cuisine. In addition to the dishes mentioned, one can find filling meals such as \"Kr\u00fcstchen\" (breaded pork cutlet with egg), \"Eisbein\" (\u201cH\u00e4mchen\u201d, boiled pork knuckle), \"Hachse\" (roasted pork knuckle), and potato pancakes (\"Reibekuchen\" or \"Rievkooche\"). Because they require considerable preparation, the latter are often available only on certain days. Popular accompaniments to \"K\u00f6lsch\"\u2014the local beer, served fresh from the barrel in these brewpubs\u2014include steak tartare (\"Tatar\"), blood sausage (\"Fl\u00f6nz\"), or \"Halver Hahn\" (a rye roll with cheese and mustard).\nLocal pastry specialties include \"Mutze\", \"Muzemandeln\", and doughnuts (\"Krapfen\"), along with a wide variety of open and covered cakes, most commonly topped with apples or plums. Sweetening is sometimes done with sugar beet syrup (\"R\u00fcbenkraut\"), which is also used as a bread spread.\nRivalry with D\u00fcsseldorf.\nCologne and D\u00fcsseldorf have a \"fierce regional rivalry\", which includes carnival parades, ice hockey, football, and beer. People in Cologne prefer K\u00f6lsch while people in D\u00fcsseldorf prefer Altbier (\"Alt\"). Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne or K\u00f6lsch in D\u00fcsseldorf. The rivalry has been described as a \"love\u2013hate relationship\". The K\u00f6ln Guild of Brewers was established in 1396. The K\u00f6lsch beer style first appeared in the 1800s and in 1986 the breweries established an appellation under which only breweries in the city are allowed to use the term K\u00f6lsch.\nMusic fairs and festivals.\nThe city was home to the internationally famous Ringfest, and now to the C/o pop festival.&lt;ref name=\"C/o pop\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn addition, Cologne enjoys a thriving Christmas Market (\"Weihnachtsmarkt\") presence with several locations in the city.\nEconomy.\nAs the largest city in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, Cologne benefits from a large market structure. In competition with D\u00fcsseldorf, the economy of Cologne is primarily based on insurance and media industries, while the city is also an important cultural and research centre and home to a number of corporate headquarters.\nAmong the largest media companies based in Cologne are Westdeutscher Rundfunk, RTL Television (with subsidiaries), n-tv, Deutschlandradio, Brainpool TV and publishing houses like J.\u00a0P. Bachem, Taschen, Tandem Verlag, and M.\u00a0DuMont Schauberg. Several clusters of media, arts and communications agencies, TV production studios, and state agencies work partly with private and government-funded cultural institutions. Among the insurance companies based in Cologne are Central, DEVK, DKV, Generali Deutschland, Gen Re, Gothaer, HDI Gerling and national headquarters of Axa Insurance, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group and Zurich Financial Services.\nThe German flag carrier Lufthansa and its subsidiary Lufthansa CityLine have their main corporate headquarters in Cologne. The largest employer in Cologne is Ford Europe, which has its European headquarters and a factory in Niehl (Ford-Werke GmbH). Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG), Toyota's official motorsports team, responsible for Toyota rally cars, and then Formula One cars, has its headquarters and workshops in Cologne. Other large companies based in Cologne include the REWE Group, T\u00dcV Rheinland, Deutz AG and a number of K\u00f6lsch breweries. The largest three K\u00f6lsch breweries of Cologne are Reissdorf, Gaffel, and Fr\u00fch.\nHistorically, Cologne has always been an important trade city, with land, air, and sea connections. The city has five Rhine ports, the second largest inland port in Germany and one of the largest in Europe. Cologne Bonn Airport is the second largest freight terminal in Germany. Today, the Cologne trade fair (\"Koelnmesse\") ranks as a major European trade fair location with over 50 trade fairs and other large cultural and sports events. In 2008 Cologne had 4.31\u00a0million overnight stays booked and 2.38\u00a0million arrivals. Cologne's largest daily newspaper is the \"K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger\".\nCologne shows a significant increase in startup companies, especially when considering digital business.\nCologne has also become the first German city with a population of more than a million people to declare climate emergency.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nRoad building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor Konrad Adenauer. The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and Bonn. Today, this is the Bundesautobahn 555. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (\"Stadtautobahn\") was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became \"Bundesstra\u00dfe (\"Federal Road\") B 55a\", which begins at the \"Zoobr\u00fccke\" (\"Zoo Bridge\") and meets with A\u00a04 and A\u00a03 at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as \"Stadtautobahn\" by most locals. In contrast to this, the \"Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt\" (\"North-South-Drive\") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as Fritz Schumacher in the 1920s. The last section south of \"Ebertplatz\" was completed in 1972.\nIn 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in North Rhine-Westphalia was opened to traffic on Bundesautobahn\u00a03, part of the eastern section of the Cologne Beltway between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.\nCycling.\nCompared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very bicycle-friendly. It has repeatedly ranked among the worst in an independent evaluation conducted by the Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club. In 2014, it ranked 36th out of 39 German cities with a population greater than 200,000.\nRailway.\nCologne has a railway service with InterCity and ICE-trains stopping at K\u00f6ln Hauptbahnhof (Cologne Main Station), K\u00f6ln Messe/Deutz and Cologne/Bonn Airport. ICE and TGV Thalys high-speed trains link Cologne with Amsterdam, Brussels (in 1h47, 9 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including Frankfurt am Main and Berlin. ICE trains to London via the Channel Tunnel were planned for 2013.\nThe Cologne Stadtbahn operated by K\u00f6lner Verkehrsbetriebe (KVB) is an extensive light rail system that is partially underground and serves Cologne and a number of neighbouring cities. It evolved from the tram system. Nearby Bonn is linked by both the Stadtbahn and main line railway trains, with occasional recreational boats on the Rhine. D\u00fcsseldorf is also linked by S-Bahn trains, which are operated by .\nThe Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn has 5 lines which cross Cologne. The S13/S19 runs 24/7 between Cologne Hbf and Cologne/Bonn airport.\nBuses.\nThere are frequent buses covering most of the city and surrounding suburbs, and Eurolines coaches to London via Brussels.\nWater.\nH\u00e4fen und G\u00fcterverkehr K\u00f6ln (Ports and Goods traffic Cologne, HGK) is one of the largest operators of inland ports in Germany. Ports include K\u00f6ln-Deutz, K\u00f6ln-Godorf and K\u00f6ln-Niehl\u00a0I and II.\nAir.\nCologne's international airport is Cologne/Bonn Airport (CGN). It is also called \"Konrad Adenauer Airport\" after Germany's first post-war Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who was born in the city and was mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933. The airport is shared with the neighbouring city of Bonn. Cologne is headquarters to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).\nEducation.\nCologne is home to numerous universities and colleges, and host to some 72,000 students. Its oldest university, the University of Cologne (founded in 1388) is the largest university in Germany, as the Cologne University of Applied Sciences is the largest university of Applied Sciences in the country. The Cologne University of Music and Dance is the largest conservatory in Europe. Foreigners can have German lessons in the VHS (Adult Education Centre).\nLauder Morijah School (), a Jewish school in Cologne, previously closed. After Russian immigration increased the Jewish population, the school reopened in 2002.\nMedia.\nCologne, alongside Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich, is one of Germany\u2019s largest and most important centers for mass media, employing around 30,000 to 40,000 people in this sector. The city\u2019s media landscape is highly diverse: in addition to major television and radio broadcasters and large publishing houses, a well-developed supporting industry has emerged in Cologne, encompassing a wide range of businesses\u2014from agencies and production companies to technical service providers and equipment suppliers. The city is \"Germany's capital of TV crime stories\". A third of all German TV productions are made in the Cologne region. Furthermore, the city hosts the Cologne Comedy Festival, which is considered to be the largest comedy festival in mainland Europe.\nRadio, television, and music industry.\nThe public broadcaster Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR), Germany\u2019s largest ARD broadcasting institution and the country\u2019s biggest broadcaster overall, employs around 3,500 people at its headquarters in Cologne. WDR operates television channels such as WDR Fernsehen and one, as well as several radio stations, including 1LIVE and COSMO. The nationwide public broadcaster Deutschlandradio also transmits from its Cologne headquarters, home to Deutschlandfunk (Dlf) and Deutschlandfunk Nova. In addition, the Beitragsservice (formerly \"GEZ\", the public broadcasting fee collection service) is based in Cologne.\nRTL Deutschland, Europe\u2019s largest private television company\u2014with channels such as RTL Television, VOX, Super RTL, Nitro, and several specialized stations\u2014has its headquarters in the Rheinhallen complex. The country\u2019s first all-news channel, n-tv, also belongs to RTL Deutschland and operates its main broadcast center in Cologne.\nOther radio stations based in the city include Domradio and Radio K\u00f6ln, which is part of Radio NRW. The private broadcasters bigFM and RPR1 maintain studios in the Capitol building. Cologne also hosts K\u00f6lncampus, its own campus radio station.\nThe most successful German music television channel, VIVA, was founded in Cologne in 1993 as VIVA Media. From the cathedral city, it broadcast its main program until 2005, along with VIVA Zwei. After being acquired by MTV\u2019s parent company Viacom, VIVA was relocated to Berlin and later discontinued. From October 2005 to December 2014, center.tv broadcast daily programs exclusively about life in and around Cologne. From January 2015 to March 2016, the channel continued under the new name K\u00f6ln.tv. The international broadcaster Deutsche Welle was also based in Cologne until its move to Bonn in 2003. The British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) operated from the Marienburg district between January 1954 and October 1990.\nThe record label EMI Music Germany, which moved its headquarters from Cologne-Braunsfeld to the MediaPark in August 2000 and later to Cologne-Bickendorf, was acquired by Universal Music in 2011. As a result, only the local K\u00f6lsch-language label Rhingt\u00f6n remained in Cologne. Several smaller record labels and music publishers are also located in the city.\nPrint media.\nCologne is home to the publishing house M. DuMont Schauberg, one of Germany\u2019s most influential newspaper publishers. The \"K\u00f6lner Stadt-Anzeiger\" and the \"K\u00f6lnische Rundschau\", both printed there, cover Cologne, its metropolitan area, and extend into the Eifel and Bergisches Land regions. The tabloid \"Express\", produced by the same publisher, is also distributed in the D\u00fcsseldorf area.\nBusiness magazines such as \"Capital\" and \"Impulse\" are also published in Cologne. Local monthly city magazines like \"StadtRevue\", \"K\u00f6lner\", and the \"K\u00f6lner Wochenspiegel\"\u2014published by K\u00f6lner Anzeigenblatt GmbH &amp; Co. KG\u2014play an important role in the local press landscape.\nInternationally active publishing houses based in Cologne include Taschen and \"Verlag der Buchhandlung Walther K\u00f6nig\", both known for their focus on art, architecture, and erotica. The city also hosts major literary publishers such as Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch and DuMont Buchverlag. Founded in 1918, the subreport \"Verlag Schawe\" has been based in Cologne since its inception. The L\u00fcbbe publishing group, one of Germany\u2019s largest book publishers, relocated from Bergisch Gladbach to Cologne-M\u00fclheim in 2010.\nInstitutions and locations.\nA prominent media site in Cologne is the MediaPark, located near Hansaring in the city center. Built between 1992 and 2003 on the grounds of the former Gereon railway yard, it covers 20 hectares and provides 174,000 m\u00b2 of office space. Among its modern buildings, including the 148-meter-high K\u00f6lnTurm, around 250 companies with approximately 5,000 employees are based\u2014about 60% of them working in the media and communications sector.\nKey media institutions in Cologne include the Academy of Media Arts Cologne (\"Kunsthochschule f\u00fcr Medien K\u00f6ln\"), the International Film School Cologne (IFS K\u00f6ln), and the GAG Academy for aspiring comedians. The city is also home to the Film Office of North Rhine-Westphalia (\"Filmb\u00fcro NRW\"). Many small film production companies, especially in the Belgian Quarter, provide services and equipment to larger production firms.\nLarge-scale studios and production facilities, which require more space, are located on the city\u2019s outskirts\u2014such as the WDR studios in Bocklem\u00fcnd or the media center in M\u00fclheim. Around the E-Werk, a major event hall on a former industrial site, many artists, agencies, and several television studios have established themselves; productions for channels like Sat.1 and ProSieben take place there.\nIn the northwest of the city, the Coloneum\u2014one of Europe\u2019s largest studio complexes with a usable area of 157,000 m\u00b2\u2014is located on the grounds of the former Butzweilerhof airfield. In the southwest, between Cologne and H\u00fcrth, large studio complexes for Nobeo and MMC were built, where numerous shows for Sat.1 and RTL are produced, including those by the production company action concept.\nSports.\nCologne hosts the football club 1. FC K\u00f6ln, who play currently in the Bundesliga after being promoted from the second division in 2025. They play their home matches in RheinEnergieStadion which also hosted five matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The International Olympic Committee and the International Association of Sports and Leisure Facilities gave RheinEnergieStadion a bronze medal for \"being one of the best sporting venues in the world\". The city also hosts the two football clubs FC Viktoria K\u00f6ln and SC Fortuna K\u00f6ln, who play in the 3. Liga (third division) and the Regionalliga West (fourth division) respectively.

{"id": "6188", "revid": "1313431610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6188", "title": "Buddhist cuisine", "text": "East Asian cuisine informed by Buddhism\nBuddhist cuisine is an Asian cuisine that is followed by monks and many believers from areas historically influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of ahimsa (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism, as well as East Asian religions like Taoism. While monks, nuns and a minority of believers are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet for celebrations.\nIn Buddhism, cooking is often seen as a spiritual practice that produces the nourishment which the body needs to work hard and meditate. The origin of \"Buddhist food\" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to monasteries, where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of Buddhist precepts. Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this culinary custom, recognized as \"sh\u014djin ry\u014dri\" (\u7cbe\u9032\u6599\u7406) or devotion cuisine, is commonly offered at numerous temples, notably in Kyoto. This centuries-old culinary tradition, primarily associated with religious contexts, is seldom encountered beyond places like temples, religious festivals, and funerals. A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the \u014cbaku school of zen, and known as ; this is served at the head temple of Manpuku-ji, as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.\nPhilosophies governing food.\nVegetarianism.\nMost of the dishes considered to be uniquely Buddhist are vegetarian, but not all Buddhist traditions require vegetarianism of lay followers or clergy. Vegetarian eating is primarily associated with the East and Southeast Asian tradition in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea where it is commonly practiced by clergy and may be observed by laity on holidays or as a devotional practice.\nIn the Mahayana tradition, several sutras of the Mahayana canon contain explicit prohibitions against consuming meat, including sections of the Lankavatara Sutra and Surangama Sutra. The monastic community in Chinese Buddhism, Vietnamese Buddhism and most of Korean Buddhism strictly adhere to vegetarianism. \nTheravada Buddhist monks and nuns consume food by gathering alms themselves, and generally must eat whatever foods are offered to them, including meat. The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be karmically negative, as well as meat from certain animals, such as dogs and snakes, that were regarded as impure in ancient India. The same restriction is also followed by some lay Buddhists and is known as the consumption of \"Threefold Pure Meat\" (\u4e09\u51c0\u8089). The P\u0101li Scriptures also indicated that Lord Buddha refused a proposal by his traitor disciple Devadatta to mandate vegetarianism in the monastic precepts.\nTibetan Buddhism has long accepted that the practical difficulties in obtaining vegetables and grains within most of Tibet make it impossible to insist upon vegetarianism; however, many leading Tibetan Buddhist teachers agree upon the great worth of practicing vegetarianism whenever and wherever possible, such as Chatral Rinpoche, a lifelong advocate of vegetarianism who famously released large numbers of fish caught for food back into the ocean once a year, and who wrote about the practice of saving lives.\nBoth Mahayana and Theravada Buddhists consider that one may practice vegetarianism as part of cultivating Bodhisattvas's paramita.\nOther restrictions.\nIn addition to the ban on garlic, practically all Mahayana monastics in China, Korea, Vietnam and Japan specifically avoid eating strong-smelling plants, traditionally asafoetida, shallot, mountain leek and Chinese onion, which together with garlic are referred to as \"w\u01d4 h\u016bn\" (\u4e94\u8477, or 'Five Acrid and Strong-smelling Vegetables') or \"w\u01d4 x\u012bn\" (\u4e94\u8f9b or 'Five Spices') as they tend to excite senses. This is based on teachings found in the Brahmajala Sutra, the Surangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra. In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the onion genus, as well as coriander. The origin of this additional restriction is from the Indic region and can still be found among some believers of Hinduism and Jainism.\nThe consumption of non-vegetarian food by strict Buddhists is also subject to various restrictions. As well as the aforementioned \"triply clean meat\" rule followed by Theravada monks, nuns, and some lay Buddhists, many Chinese Buddhists avoid the consumption of beef, large animals, and exotic species. Some Buddhists abstain from eating offal (organ meat), known as \"xi\u00e0shui\" (\u4e0b\u6c34).\nAlcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and \"mindfulness\". It is part of the Five Precepts which dictate that one is \"not to take any substance that will cloud the mind.\" Caffeinated drinks may sometimes be included under this restriction.\nSimple and natural.\nIn theory and practice, many regional styles of cooking may be adapted to be \"Buddhist\" as long as the cook, with the above restrictions in mind, prepares the food, generally in simple preparations, with expert attention to its quality, wholesomeness and flavor. Often working on a tight budget, the monastery cook would have to make the most of whatever ingredients were available.\nIn \"Tenzo kyokun\" (\"Instructions for the Zen Cook\"), Soto Zen founder Eihei Dogen wrote:\nIn preparing food, it is essential to be sincere and to respect each ingredient regardless of how coarse or fine it is. (...) A rich buttery soup is not better as such than a broth of wild herbs. In handling and preparing wild herbs, do so as you would the ingredients for a rich feast, wholeheartedly, sincerely, clearly. When you serve the monastic assembly, they and you should taste only the flavour of the Ocean of Reality, the Ocean of unobscured Awake Awareness, not whether or not the soup is creamy or made only of wild herbs. In nourishing the seeds of living in the Way, rich food and wild grass are not separate.\nIngredients.\nFollowing its dominant status in most parts of East Asia where Buddhism is most practiced, rice features heavily as a staple in the Buddhist meal, especially in the form of rice porridge or congee as the usual morning meal. Noodles and other grains may often be served as well. Vegetables of all sorts are generally either stir-fried or cooked in vegetarian broth with seasonings and may be eaten with various sauces. Onions and garlic are usually avoided as consumption of these is thought to increase undesirable emotions such as anger or sexual desire. Traditionally, eggs are not considered vegetarian. Seasonings will be informed by whatever is common in the local region; for example, soy sauce and vegan dashi figure strongly in Japanese monastery food while Thai curry and t\u01b0\u01a1ng (as a vegetarian replacement for fish sauce) may be prominent in Southeast Asia. Sweets and desserts are not often consumed, but are permitted in moderation and may be served at special occasions, such as in the context of a tea ceremony in the Zen tradition.\nBuddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared wheat gluten, also known as seitan, kao fu (\u70e4\u9eb8) or wheat meat, soy (such as tofu or tempeh), agar, konnyaku and other plant products. Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined meat analogues in the world. Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavorings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavorings), while having very little flavor of their own. With the proper seasonings, they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.\nSome of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many monasteries and temples which serve allium-free and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months). Many Buddhist restaurants also serve vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic or allium-free dishes.\nSome Buddhists eat vegetarian on the 1st and 15th of the lunar calendar (lenten days), on Chinese New Year eve, and on saint and ancestral holy days. To cater to this type of customer, as well as full-time vegetarians, the menu of a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant usually shows no difference from a typical Chinese or East Asian restaurant, except that in recipes originally made to contain meat, a soy chicken substitute might be served instead.\nVariations by sect or region.\nAccording to cookbooks published in English, formal monastery meals in the Zen tradition generally follow a pattern of \"three bowls\" in descending size. The first and largest bowl is a grain-based dish such as rice, noodles or congee; the second contains the protein dish which is often some form of stew or soup; the third and smallest bowl is a vegetable dish or a salad.\nHistory.\nThe earliest surviving written accounts of Buddhism are the Edicts written by King Ashoka, a well-known Buddhist king who propagated Buddhism throughout Asia, and is honored by both Theravada and Mahayana schools of Buddhism. The authority of the Edicts of Ashoka as a historical record is suggested by the mention of numerous topics omitted as well as corroboration of numerous accounts found in the Theravada and Mahayana Tripitakas written down centuries later.\nAsoka Rock Edict 1, dated to c. 257 BCE, mentions the prohibition of animal sacrifices in Ashoka's Maurya Empire as well as his commitment to vegetarianism; however, whether the Sangha was vegetarian in part or in whole is unclear from these edicts. However, Ashoka's personal commitment to, and advocating of, vegetarianism suggests Early Buddhism (at the very least for the layperson) most likely already had a vegetarian tradition (the details of what that entailed besides not killing animals and eating their flesh were not mentioned, and therefore are unknown).\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1844, he discovered the world's oldest and most complete Bible dated to around the mid-4th century and called Codex Sinaiticus after Saint Catherine's Monastery at Mount Sinai.\nTischendorf was made an honorary doctor by the University of Oxford on 16 March 1865, and by the University of Cambridge on 9 March 1865 following his discovery. While a student gaining his academic degree in the 1840s, he earned international recognition when he deciphered the \"Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus\", a 5th-century Greek manuscript of the New Testament.\nEarly life and education.\nTischendorf was born in Lengenfeld, Saxony, the son of a forensic physician. After attending primary school in Lengenfield, he went to grammar school in nearby Plauen. From Easter 1834, having achieved excellent marks at school, he studied theology and philosophy at the University of Leipzig.\nAt Leipzig he was mainly influenced by JGB Winer, and he began to take special interest in New Testament criticism. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible. Despite his father's death in 1835 and his mother's just a year later, he was still able to achieve his doctorate in 1838, before accepting a tutoring job in the home of Reverend Ferdinand Leberecht Zehme in Grossstadeln where he met and fell in love with the clergyman's daughter Angelika. He published a volume of poetry in 1838, Maiknospen (Buds of May) and Der junge Mystiker (The Young Mystic) was published under a pseudonym in 1839. At this time he also began his first critical edition of the New Testament in Greek which was to become his life's work.\nAfter a journey through southern Germany and Switzerland, and a visit to Strassburg, he returned to Leipzig to begin work on a critical study of the New Testament text.\nCareer.\nIn 1840, he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the recensions of the New Testament text, the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. These early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact collations of manuscripts.\nFrom October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, Firmin Didot, several editions of the Greek New Testament, one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the Vulgate. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.\nIn 1845 before he left paris, decipherment of the palimpsest \"Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus\" and the Old Testament were completed. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of Ephrem the Syrian, had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became \"professor extraordinarius\" at Leipzig, where he was married in 1845. He also began to publish \"Reise in den Orient\", an account of his travels in the east (in 2 volumes, 1845\u201346, translated as \"Travels in the East\" in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the \"Archimedes Palimpsest\", a torn leaf of which he held and after his death was sold to the Cambridge University Library.\nTischendorf briefly visited the Netherlands in 1841 and England in 1842. In 1843 he visited Italy for thirteen months, before continuing on to Egypt, Sinai, and the Levant, returning via Vienna and Munich.\nDiscovery of the Codex Sinaiticus Bible manuscripts.\nIn 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to Saint Catherine's Monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai in Egypt, where he found a portion of what would later be hailed as the oldest complete known New Testament.\nOf the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages containing a part of the Old Testament as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony (reigned 1836\u20131854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischendorf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at Leipzig University, also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put two of the leaves on display in 2011.\nTischendorf reported in his 1865 book \"Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst\", translated to English in 1866 as \"When Were Our Gospels Written\" in the section \"The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript\" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the University of Leipzig, under the title of the \"Codex Friderico-Augustanus\", a name given in honour of his patron, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.\nMany have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames. J. Rendel Harris referred to the story as a \"myth\". The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. \nIn 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Tsar Alexander II of Russia with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the \"Codex Frederico-Augustanus\" or similar ancient Biblical texts. On 4 February, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant \u2013 the \"Codex Sinaiticus\" \u2013 a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.\nTischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to Tsar Alexander II of Russia, at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those ignorant of the details of his discovery of the \"Codex Sinaiticus\" accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant monastery librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a \"Schenkungsurkunde\". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the National Russian Library the existence cannot be disputed in earnest.\nIn 1869 the Tsar awarded Tischendorf the style of \"von\" Tischendorf as a Russian noble. 327 facsimile editions of the Codex were printed in Leipzig for the Tsar (instead of a salary for the three-year work of Tischendorf the Tsar gave him 100 copies for reselling) in order to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the traditional foundation of the Rus' state in 862 with the publication of this most amazing find. Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.\nWhen the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Tsar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the British Museum in London, England. The official certificate with signatures in Russian/ French/ Greek sections has been refound in St Petersburg.\nNovum Testamentum Graece \u2013 publication with 21 editions.\nIn the winter of 1849 the first edition of his great work now titled \"Novum Testamentum Graece. Ad antiquos testes recensuit. Apparatum criticum multis modis\" appeared (translated as \"Greek New Testament. The ancient witnesses reviewed. Preparations critical in many ways\"), containing canons of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:\nBasic rule: \"The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and fathers.\"\nThese were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, \"to clear up in this way,\" he wrote, \"the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine apostolic text which is the foundation of our faith.\"\nIn 1850 appeared his edition of the \"Codex Amiatinus\" (in 1854 corrected) and of the Septuagint version of the Old Testament (7th edition, 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the \"Codex Claromontanus\". In 1859, he was named \"professor ordinarius\" of theology and of Biblical paleography, this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, \"Aus dem heiligen Lande\", appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.\nBesides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both Robert Schumann, with whom he corresponded, and Felix Mendelssohn, who dedicated a song to him. His colleague Samuel Prideaux Tregelles wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the University of Glasgow, where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.\nDeath.\nLobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf died in Leipzig on 7 December 1874, aged 59.\nCodex Sinaiticus.\nThe \"Codex Sinaiticus\" contains a 4th-century manuscript of New Testament texts. Two other Bibles of similar age exist, though they are less complete: Codex Vaticanus in the Vatican Library and Codex Alexandrinus, currently owned by the British Library. The Codex Sinaiticus is deemed by some to be the most important surviving New Testament manuscript, as no older manuscript is as nearly complete as the Codex. The codex can be viewed in the British Library in London, or as a digitized version on the Internet.\nTischendorf's motivation.\nThroughout his life, Tischendorf sought old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament that was based on the oldest possible manuscripts. He intended to be as close as possible to the sources. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the Sinai Peninsula, which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).\nIn 1862, Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and a less costly text edition, the latter to enable as many scholars as possible to have access to the contents of the Codex.\nTischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labors, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leipzig University, Prof. of Theology) explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter that he was motivated to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustworthily transmitted over the centuries.\nWorks.\nHis \"magnum opus\" was the \"Critical Edition of the New Testament.\"\nThe great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself \"editio viii\"; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from stereotype plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869\u201372 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the Vatican manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend Samuel Prideaux Tregelles.\nOf relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the \"Codex Ephraemi\", and the \"Friderico-Augustanus\", was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of Eberhard Nestle's appendix to the 6th issue (1880).\nBesides this may be mentioned editions of the New Testament apocrypha, \"De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu\" (1851); \"Acta Apostolorum apocrypha\" (1851); \"Evangelia apocrypha\" (1853; 2nd edition, 1876); \"Apocalypses apocryphae\" (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as \"Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?\" (\"When Were Our Gospels Written?\"; 1865; 4th edition, 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), \"Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?\" (1873), and \"Synopsis evangelica\" (7th edition, 1898).\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "6195", "revid": "270405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6195", "title": "Calvin Coolidge", "text": "President of the United States from 1923 to 1929\nCalvin Coolidge (born John Calvin Coolidge Jr.; ; July 4, 1872\u00a0\u2013 January 5, 1933) was the 30th president of the United States, serving from 1923 to 1929. A Republican lawyer from Massachusetts, he previously served as the 29th vice president from 1921 to 1923, under President Warren G. Harding, and as the 48th governor of Massachusetts from 1919 to 1921. Coolidge gained a reputation as a small-government conservative, with a taciturn personality and dry sense of humor that earned him the nickname \"Silent Cal\".\nCoolidge began his career as a member of the Massachusetts State House. He rose up the ranks of Massachusetts politics and was elected governor in 1918. As governor, Coolidge ran on the record of fiscal conservatism, strong support for women's suffrage, and vague opposition to Prohibition. His prompt and effective response to the Boston police strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight as a man of decisive action. The following year, the Republican Party nominated Coolidge as the running mate to Senator Warren G. Harding in the 1920 presidential election, which they won in a landslide. Coolidge served as vice president until Harding's death in 1923, after which he assumed the presidency. \nDuring his presidency, Coolidge restored public confidence in the White House after the Harding administration's many scandals. He signed into law the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans, and oversaw a period of rapid and expansive economic growth known as the \"Roaring Twenties\", leaving office with considerable popularity. Coolidge was known for his hands-off governing approach and pro-business stance; biographer Claude Fuess wrote: \"He embodied the spirit and hopes of the middle class, could interpret their longings and express their opinions. That he did represent the genius of the average is the most convincing proof of his strength.\" Coolidge chose not to run again in 1928, remarking that ten years as president would be \"longer than any other man has had it\u2014too long!\"\nCoolidge is widely admired for his stalwart support of racial equality during a period of heightened racial tension, and is highly regarded by advocates of smaller government and \"laissez-faire\" economics; supporters of an active central government generally view him far less favorably. His critics argue that he failed to use the country's economic boom to help struggling farmers and workers in other flailing industries, and there is still much debate among historians about the extent to which Coolidge's economic policies contributed to the onset of the Great Depression, which began shortly after he left office. Scholars have ranked Coolidge in the lower half of U.S. presidents.\nEarly life and family history.\nJohn Calvin Coolidge Jr. was born on July 4, 1872, in Plymouth Notch, Vermont\u2014the only U.S. president to be born on Independence Day. He was the elder of the two children of John Calvin Coolidge Sr. and Victoria Josephine Moor. Although named for his father, from early childhood Coolidge was addressed by his middle name. The name Calvin was used in multiple generations of the Coolidge family, apparently selected in honor of John Calvin, the Protestant Reformer, with Coolidge describing his ancestors as \"English Puritan stock\" in his Autobiography. \nCoolidge's earliest American ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from Cottenham, Cambridgeshire, England, around 1630 and settled in Watertown, Massachusetts. Coolidge also descended from Samuel Appleton, who settled in Ipswich and led the Massachusetts Bay Colony during King Philip's War. Coolidge's great-great-grandfather, another John Coolidge, was an American military officer in the Revolutionary War and one of the first selectmen of the town of Plymouth. \nHis grandfather Calvin Galusha Coolidge served in the Vermont House of Representatives. His cousin Park Pollard was a businessman in Cavendish, Vermont, and the longtime chair of the Vermont Democratic Party. Coolidge's mother was the daughter of Hiram Dunlap Moor, a Plymouth Notch farmer, and Abigail Franklin.\nCoolidge Senior engaged in many occupations and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper, and public servant. He held various local offices, including justice of the peace and tax collector and served in both houses of the Vermont General Assembly. When Coolidge was 12 years old, his chronically ill mother died at the age of 39, perhaps from tuberculosis. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875\u20131890), died at the age of 15, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was 18. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of 80.\nEarly career and marriage.\nEducation and law practice.\nCoolidge attended the Black River Academy and then St. Johnsbury Academy before enrolling at Amherst College, where he distinguished himself in the debating class. As a senior, he joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity and graduated \"cum laude\". While at Amherst, Coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor Charles Edward Garman, a Congregational mystic who had a neo-Hegelian philosophy. Coolidge explained Garman's ethics forty years later:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]here is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right, that the end does not justify the means, and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service.\nAt his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge moved to Northampton, Massachusetts, to become a lawyer. Coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond &amp; Field, and reading law with them. John C. Hammond and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to practicing law in the county seat of Hampshire County, Massachusetts. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, becoming a country lawyer. With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.\nMarriage and family.\nIn 1903, Coolidge met Grace Goodhue, a graduate of the University of Vermont and a teacher at Northampton's Clarke School for the Deaf. They married on October 4, 1905, at 2:30\u00a0p.m. in a small ceremony which took place in the parlor of Grace's family's house, having overcome her mother's objections to the marriage. The newlyweds went on a honeymoon trip to Montreal, originally planned for two weeks but cut short by a week at Coolidge's request. After 25 years he wrote of Grace, \"for almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities and I have rejoiced in her graces\".\nThe Coolidges had two sons: John (1906\u20132000) and Calvin Jr. (1908\u20131924). On June 30, 1924, Calvin Jr. played tennis with his brother on the White House tennis courts without putting on socks and developed a blister on one of his toes. The blister subsequently degenerated into sepsis. He died a little over a week later at the age of 16. \nCoolidge never forgave himself for Calvin Jr's death. His elder son John said it \"hurt [Coolidge] terribly\", and psychiatric biographer Robert E. Gilbert, author of\" The Tormented President: Calvin Coolidge, Death, and Clinical Depression\", said that Coolidge \"ceased to function as President after the death of his sixteen-year-old son\". Gilbert writes that after Calvin Jr.'s death Coolidge displayed all ten of the symptoms the American Psychiatric Association lists as evidence of major depressive disorder. John later became a railroad executive, helped start the Coolidge Foundation, and was instrumental in creating the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site.\nCoolidge was frugal, and when it came to securing a home, he insisted upon renting. He and his wife attended Northampton's Edwards Congregational Church before and after his presidency.\nLocal political office (1898\u22121915).\nCity offices.\nThe Republican Party was dominant in New England at the time, and Coolidge followed the example of Hammond and Field by becoming active in local politics. In 1896, Coolidge campaigned for Republican presidential candidate William McKinley, and was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee the next year. In 1898, he won election to the City Council of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected. The position offered no salary but provided Coolidge with valuable political experience. \nIn 1899, the city council made Coolidge city solicitor. He was elected to a one-year term in 1900 and reelected in 1901. This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer and paid a salary of $600 (). In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to private practice. Soon thereafter, the clerk of courts for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid well, but it barred him from practicing law, so he remained at the job for only a year. \nIn 1904, Coolidge suffered his sole defeat at the ballot box, losing an election to the Northampton school board. When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern, the recently married Coolidge replied, \"Might give me time!\"\nMassachusetts state legislator and mayor.\nIn 1906, the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat, and reported to Boston for the 1907 session of the Massachusetts General Court. In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a Progressive Republican, voting in favor of such measures as women's suffrage and the direct election of Senators. \nWhile in Boston, Coolidge became an ally, and then a liegeman, of then U.S. Senator Winthrop Murray Crane, who controlled the Massachusetts Republican Party's western faction; Crane's party rival in eastern Massachusetts was U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. Coolidge forged another key strategic alliance with Guy Currier, who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction, wealth, personal charm, and broad circle of friends Coolidge lacked, and which had a lasting impact on his political career. In 1907, Coolidge was reelected. In the 1908 session he was more outspoken, though not in a leadership position.\nInstead of vying for another term in the State House, Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for mayor of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired. He was well liked in the town, and defeated his challenger by a vote of 1,597 to 1,409. During his first term from 1910 to 1911, he increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease. In 1911, he was renominated and defeated the same opponent by a slightly larger margin.\nIn 1911, the State Senator for the Hampshire County area retired and successfully encouraged Coolidge to run for his seat for the 1912 session. Coolidge defeated his Democratic opponent by a large margin. At the start of that term, he became chairman of a committee to arbitrate the \"Bread and Roses\" strike by the workers of the American Woolen Company in Lawrence, Massachusetts. After two tense months, the company agreed to the workers' demands, in a settlement proposed by the committee. \nA major issue affecting Massachusetts Republicans in 1912 was the party split between the progressive wing, which favored Theodore Roosevelt, and the conservative wing, which favored William Howard Taft. Although he favored some progressive measures, Coolidge refused to leave the Republican party. When the new Progressive Party declined to run a candidate in his state senate district, Coolidge won reelection against his Democratic opponent by an increased margin.\nIn the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned success in arduously navigating to passage the Western Trolley Act, which connected Northampton with a dozen similar industrial communities in Western Massachusetts. \nCoolidge intended to retire after his second term, as was customary, but when the president of the state senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for lieutenant governor, Coolidge decided to run for the Senate again in hopes of being elected its presiding officer. Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, and was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage. \nCoolidge was in favor of the women's vote, and was reelected. With Crane's help, Coolidge assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate. After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech, \"Have Faith in Massachusetts\", which summarized his philosophy of government.\nCoolidge's speech was well received, and he attracted some admirers on its account. Towards the end of the term, many of them were proposing Coolidge's name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to be President of the Senate. Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor. Stearns, an executive with the Boston department store R. H. Stearns, became another key ally, and began a publicity campaign on Coolidge's behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session.\nLieutenant Governor and Governor of Massachusetts (1916\u22121921).\nCoolidge entered the primary election for lieutenant governor and was nominated to run alongside gubernatorial candidate Samuel W. McCall. Coolidge was the leading vote-getter in the Republican primary, and balanced the Republican ticket by adding a western presence to McCall's eastern base of support. McCall and Coolidge won the 1915 election to their respective one-year terms, with Coolidge defeating his opponent by more than 50,000 votes.\nIn Massachusetts, the lieutenant governor does not preside over the state Senate, as is the case in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as an administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.\n1918 election.\nCoolidge was unopposed for the Republican nomination for governor of Massachusetts in 1918. He and his running mate, Channing Cox, a Boston lawyer and Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, ran on the previous administration's record: fiscal conservatism, a vague opposition to Prohibition, support for women's suffrage, and support for American involvement in World War I. The issue of the war proved divisive, especially among Irish and German Americans. Coolidge was elected by a margin of 16,773 votes over his opponent, Richard H. Long, in the smallest margin of victory of any of his statewide campaigns.\nBoston police strike.\nIn 1919, in reaction to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. \nTacitly but fully in support of Curtis's position, Coolidge closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle: that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the city. Concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, Peters called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority and relieved Curtis of duty.\nCoolidge, sensing the severity of circumstances were then in need of his intervention, conferred with Crane's operative, William Butler, and then acted. He called up more units of the National Guard, restored Curtis to office, and took personal control of the police force. Curtis proclaimed that all of the strikers were fired from their jobs, and Coolidge called for a new police force to be recruited.\nThat night Coolidge received a telegram from AFL leader Samuel Gompers. \"Whatever disorder has occurred\", Gompers wrote, \"is due to Curtis's order in which the right of the policemen has been denied\". \nCoolidge publicly answered Gompers's telegram, denying any justification whatsoever for the strike\u2014and his response launched him into the national consciousness. Newspapers nationwide picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the strike's opponents' newest hero. Amid the First Red Scare, many Americans were terrified of the spread of communist revolutions like those in Russia, Hungary, and Germany. Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor, but conservatives saw a rising star. Although he usually acted with deliberation, the Boston police strike gave Coolidge a national reputation as a decisive leader and strict enforcer of law and order.\n1919 election.\nIn 1919, Coolidge and Cox were renominated for their respective offices in 1919. By this time Coolidge's supporters, especially Stearns, had publicized his actions in the Police Strike around the state and the nation, and some of Coolidge's speeches were published in book form. He faced the same opponent as in 1918, Richard Long, but this time Coolidge defeated him by 125,101 votes, more than seven times his margin of victory from a year earlier. His actions in the police strike, combined with the massive electoral victory, led to suggestions that Coolidge run for president in 1920.\nLegislation and vetoes as governor.\nBy the time Coolidge was inaugurated on January 2, 1919, the First World War had ended, and Coolidge pushed the legislature to give a $100 bonus () to Massachusetts veterans. He signed a bill reducing the work week for women and children from 54 hours to 48, saying, \"We must humanize the industry, or the system will break down.\" He passed a budget that kept the tax rates the same, while trimming $4 million from expenditures, allowing the state to retire some of its debt.\nCoolidge wielded the veto pen as governor. His most publicized veto prevented an increase in legislators' pay by 50%. Although he was personally opposed to Prohibition, he vetoed a bill in May 1920 that would have allowed the sale of beer or wine of 2.75% alcohol or less, in Massachusetts in violation of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \"Opinions and instructions do not outmatch the Constitution,\" he said in his veto message. \"Against it, they are void.\"\nVice presidency (1921\u20131923).\n1920 election.\nAt the 1920 Republican National Convention, most of the delegates were selected by state party caucuses, not primaries. As such, the field was divided among many local favorites. Coolidge was one such candidate, and while he placed as high as sixth in the voting, the powerful party bosses running the convention, primarily the party's U.S. Senators, never considered him seriously. After ten ballots, the bosses and then the delegates settled on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio as their nominee for president. \nWhen the time came to select a vice-presidential nominee, the bosses also announced their choice, Senator Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin, and then departed after his name was put forth, relying on the rank and file to confirm their decision. A delegate from Oregon, Wallace McCamant, had read \"Have Faith in Massachusetts\" and proposed Coolidge for vice president instead. The suggestion caught on quickly, with the masses craving an act of independence from the absent bosses, and Coolidge was unexpectedly nominated.\nThe Democrats nominated another Ohioan, James M. Cox, for president and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, for vice president. The question of the United States joining the League of Nations was a major issue in the campaign, as was the unfinished legacy of Progressivism. Harding ran a \"front-porch\" campaign from his home in Marion, Ohio, but Coolidge took to the campaign trail in the Upper South, New York, and New England\u00a0\u2013 his audiences carefully limited to those familiar with Coolidge and those placing a premium upon concise and short speeches. On November 2, 1920, Harding and Coolidge were victorious in a landslide, winning more than 60 percent of the popular vote, including every state outside the South. They won in Tennessee, the first time a Republican ticket had won a Southern state since Reconstruction.\n\"Silent Cal\".\nThe vice presidency did not carry many official duties, but Harding invited Coolidge to attend cabinet meetings, making him the first vice president to do so. He gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country.\nAs vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace were invited to quite a few parties, where the legend of \"Silent Cal\" was born. It is from this time that most of the jokes and anecdotes involving Coolidge originate, such as Coolidge being \"silent in five languages\". Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private he was a man of few words and was commonly referred to as \"Silent Cal\". \nAn apocryphal story has it that a person seated next to Coolidge at a dinner told him, \"I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you\", to which Coolidge replied, \"You lose\". On April 22, 1924, Coolidge said that the \"You lose\" incident never occurred. The story was related by Frank B. Noyes, President of the Associated Press, to its membership at its annual luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, when toasting and introducing Coolidge, the invited speaker. After the introduction and before his prepared remarks, Coolidge told the membership, \"Your President [Noyes] has given you a perfect example of one of those rumors now current in Washington which is without any foundation.\"\nCoolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society. When asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, \"Got to eat somewhere.\" Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: \"When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle.\" Coolidge and his wife, Grace, who was a great baseball fan, once attended a Washington Senators game and sat through all nine innings without saying a word, except once when he asked her the time.\nAs president, Coolidge's reputation as a quiet man continued. \"The words of a President have an enormous weight,\" he later wrote, \"and ought not to be used indiscriminately.\" Coolidge was aware of his stiff reputation, and cultivated it. \"I think the American people want a solemn ass as a President,\" he once told Ethel Barrymore, \"and I think I will go along with them.\" Some historians suggest that Coolidge's image was created deliberately as a campaign tactic. Others believe his withdrawn and quiet behavior was natural, deepening after the death of his son in 1924. Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, \"How can they tell?\"\nPresidency (1923\u20131929).\nOn August 2, 1923, President Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack in San Francisco while on a speaking tour of the western United States. Vice President Coolidge was in Vermont visiting his family home, which had neither electricity nor a telephone, when he received word by messenger of Harding's death. Coolidge dressed, said a prayer, and came downstairs to greet the reporters who had assembled. His father, a notary public and justice of the peace, administered the oath of office in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp at 2:47\u00a0a.m. on August 3, 1923, whereupon the new President of the United States returned to bed.\nCoolidge returned to Washington the next day, and was sworn in again by Justice Adolph A. Hoehling Jr. of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, to forestall any questions about the authority of a state official to administer a federal oath. This second oath-taking remained a secret until it was revealed by Harry M. Daugherty in 1932, and confirmed by Hoehling. When Hoehling confirmed Daugherty's story, he indicated that Daugherty, then serving as United States Attorney General, asked him to administer the oath without fanfare at the Willard Hotel. According to Hoehling, he did not question Daugherty's reason for requesting a second oath-taking but assumed it was to resolve any doubt about whether the first swearing-in was valid.\nThe nation initially did not know what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration. Many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. \nCoolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice. The resulting resignations of those involved affirmed this. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after Daugherty refused to cooperate with the investigations. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him, and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.\nOn December 6, 1923, Coolidge addressed Congress when it reconvened, giving a speech that supported many of Harding's policies, including Harding's formal budgeting process, the enforcement of immigration restrictions, and the arbitration of coal strikes ongoing in Pennsylvania. \nThe address to Congress was the first presidential speech to be broadcast over the radio. The Washington Naval Treaty was proclaimed one month into Coolidge's term, and was generally well received nationally. In May 1924, Congress passed the World War I veterans' World War Adjusted Compensation Act (\"Bonus Bill\"), overriding Coolidge's veto. Later that year, Coolidge signed the Immigration Act, which was aimed at restricting southern and eastern European immigration, but appended a signing statement expressing his unhappiness with the bill's specific exclusion of Japanese immigrants. \nJust before the Republican Convention began, Coolidge signed into law the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced the top marginal tax rate from 58% to 46%, cut personal income tax rates across the board, increased the estate tax, and bolstered it with a new gift tax.\nOn June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the act granting citizenship to all Native Americans born in the United States. By that time, two-thirds of them were already citizens, having gained it through marriage, military service (veterans of World War I were granted citizenship in 1919), or land allotments.\n1924 election.\nThe Republican Convention was held from June 10 to 12, 1924, in Cleveland, Ohio. Coolidge was nominated on the first ballot. The convention nominated Frank Lowden of Illinois for vice president on the second ballot, but he declined. Former Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes was nominated on the third ballot and accepted.\nThe Democrats held their convention the next month in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates agreed upon a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette, a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP to form a new Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican Party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat to win the presidency.\nAfter the conventions and the death of his younger son Calvin, Coolidge became withdrawn. He later said that \"when he [the son] died, the power and glory of the Presidency went with him.\" Even as he mourned, Coolidge ran his standard campaign, not mentioning his opponents by name or maligning them, and delivering speeches on his theory of government, including several that were broadcast over the radio. \nIt was the most subdued campaign since 1896, partly because of Coolidge's grief, but also because of his naturally non-confrontational style. The other candidates campaigned in a more modern fashion, but despite the split in the Republican party, the results were similar to those of 1920. Coolidge won every state outside the South except Wisconsin, La Follette's home state. He won the election with 382 electoral votes and the popular vote by 2.5\u00a0million votes.\nIndustry and trade.\nDuring Coolidge's presidency, the United States experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the \"Roaring Twenties\". He left the administration's industrial policy in the hands of his activist Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio. \nCoolidge disdained regulation and appointed men to the Federal Trade Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission, who did little to restrict the activities of businesses under their jurisdiction. The regulatory state under Coolidge was, as one biographer called it, \"thin to the point of invisibility\".\nHistorian Robert Sobel offers some context for Coolidge's \"laissez-faire\" ideology, based on the prevailing understanding of federalism during his presidency: \"As Governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge supported wages and hours legislation, opposed child labor, imposed economic controls during World War I, favored safety measures in factories, and even worker representation on corporate boards. Did he support these measures while president? No, because in the 1920s, such matters were considered the responsibilities of state and local governments.\" \nCoolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which established the Federal Radio Commission and the equal-time rule for radio broadcasters and restricted radio broadcasting licenses to stations that demonstrated they served \"the public interest, convenience, or necessity\". \nTaxation and government spending.\nCoolidge adopted the taxation policies of his Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, who advocated \"scientific taxation\"\u2014the notion that lowering taxes will increase, rather than decrease, government receipts. Congress agreed, and tax rates were reduced in Coolidge's term. \nIn addition to federal tax cuts, Coolidge proposed reductions in federal expenditures and retiring the federal debt. His ideas were shared by the Republicans in Congress, and in 1924, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1924, which reduced income tax rates and eliminated all income taxation for two million people. It reduced taxes again by passing the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928, while keeping spending down to reduce the overall federal debt. By 1927, only the wealthiest 2% of taxpayers paid federal income tax. Federal spending remained flat during Coolidge's administration, allowing one-fourth of the federal debt to be retired. \nState and local governments saw considerable growth, surpassing the federal budget in 1927. In 1929, after Coolidge's series of tax rate reductions had cut the tax rate to 24% on those making over $100,000, the federal government collected more than $1 billion in income taxes, of which 65% was from those making over $100,000. In 1921, when the tax rate on those making over $100,000 a year was 73%, the federal government collected a little over $700 million in income taxes, of which 30% was from those making over $100,000.\nOpposition to farm subsidies.\nPerhaps the most contentious issue of Coolidge's presidency was relief for farmers. Some in Congress proposed a bill designed to fight falling agricultural prices by allowing the federal government to purchase crops to sell abroad at lower prices. Agriculture Secretary Henry C. Wallace and other administration officials favored the bill when it was introduced in 1924, but rising prices convinced many in Congress that the bill was unnecessary, and it was defeated just before the 1924 elections. \nIn 1926, with farm prices falling once more, Senator Charles L. McNary and Representative Gilbert N. Haugen\u2014both Republicans\u2014proposed the McNary\u2013Haugen Farm Relief Bill. The bill proposed a federal farm board that would purchase surplus production in high-yield years, and hold it, when feasible, for later sale or sell it abroad. \nCoolidge opposed McNary-Haugen, saying that agriculture must stand \"on an independent business basis\" and that \"government control cannot be divorced from political control\". Instead of manipulating prices, he favored Herbert Hoover's proposal to increase profitability by modernizing agriculture. Secretary Mellon wrote a letter denouncing McNary-Haugen as unsound and likely to cause inflation, and it was defeated.\nAfter McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge supported a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, which would have created a federal board to lend money to farm cooperatives in times of surplus. The bill did not pass. In February 1927, Congress took up McNary-Haugen again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it. \nIn his veto message, he expressed the belief that the bill would do nothing to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy. Congress did not override the veto. In May 1928, Congress passed the bill again by an increased majority, and Coolidge vetoed it again. \"Farmers never have made much money\" he said. \"I do not believe we can do much about it.\"\nFlood control.\nCoolidge has often been criticized for his actions during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the worst natural disaster to hit the Gulf Coast until Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Although he eventually named Hoover to a commission in charge of flood relief, scholars argue that, overall, Coolidge showed lack of interest in federal flood control. \nCoolidge believed that visiting the region after the floods would accomplish nothing and be seen as political grandstanding. He also did not want to incur the federal spending that flood control would require. He believed that property owners should bear much of the cost. Congress wanted a bill that would place the federal government completely in charge of flood mitigation. When Congress passed a compromise measure in 1928, Coolidge declined to take credit for it and signed the bill in private on May 15.\nCivil rights.\nAccording to one biographer, Coolidge was \"devoid of racial prejudice\", but he rarely took the lead on civil rights. Coolidge disliked the Ku Klux Klan and no Klansman is known to have received an appointment from him. In the 1924 presidential election, his opponents, Robert La Follette and John Davis, and his running mate, Charles Dawes, often attacked the Klan, but Coolidge avoided the subject. \nDue to Coolidge's failure to condemn the Klan, some African-American leaders such as former assistant attorney general William Henry Lewis endorsed Davis. Davis got little of the black vote outside Indiana, where Klan control of the Indiana Republican Party caused many blacks to vote Democratic. It is estimated that over 90% of non-Indiana blacks voted for Coolidge. \nSecretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover was accused of running forced labor camps for African Americans during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, which led more African Americans to vote Democratic when Hoover was the Republican presidential nominee in 1928 and 1932. During Coolidge's administration, lynchings of African-Americans decreased and millions of people left the Ku Klux Klan.\nCoolidge spoke in favor of African Americans' civil rights, saying in his first State of the Union address that their rights were \"just as sacred as those of any other citizen\" under the U.S. Constitution and that it was a \"public and a private duty to protect those rights\". \nCoolidge repeatedly called for laws to make lynching a federal crime. It was already a state crime, though not always enforced. Congress refused to pass any such legislation. On June 2, 1924, Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act, which granted U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans living on reservations. Those off reservations had long been citizens. \nOn June 6, 1924, Coolidge delivered a commencement address at historically black, non-segregated Howard University, in which he thanked and commended African Americans for their rapid advances in education and contributions to U.S. society over the years, as well as their eagerness to render their services as soldiers in the World War, all while faced with discrimination and prejudice at home.\nIn an October 1924 speech, Coolidge stressed tolerance of differences as an American value and thanked immigrants for their contributions to U.S. society, saying that they had \"contributed much to making our country what it is\". He said that although the diversity of peoples was a source of conflict and tension in Europe, it was a peculiarly \"harmonious\" benefit for the U.S. Coolidge added that the U.S. should assist and help immigrants and urged immigrants to reject \"race hatreds\" and \"prejudices\".\nForeign policy.\nCoolidge was neither well versed nor very interested in world affairs. His focus was mainly on U.S. business, especially pertaining to trade, and \"Maintaining the Status Quo\". Although not an isolationist, he was reluctant to enter into European involvements. Coolidge believed strongly in a non-interventionist foreign policy and supported American exceptionalism. He considered the 1920 Republican victory a rejection of the Wilsonian position that the U.S. should join the League of Nations. \nCoolidge did not believe the League served U.S. interests. But he spoke in favor of joining the Permanent Court of International Justice (World Court), provided that the nation would not be bound by advisory decisions. In 1926, the Senate approved joining the Court, with reservations. The League of Nations accepted the reservations, but suggested some modifications of its own. The Senate failed to act, and so the U.S. did not join the World Court.\nIn 1924, the Coolidge administration nominated Charles Dawes to head the multinational committee that produced the Dawes Plan. It set fixed annual amounts for Germany's World War I reparations payments and authorized a large loan, mostly from U.S. banks, to help stabilize and stimulate the German economy. Coolidge attempted to pursue further curbs on naval strength after the successes of Harding's Washington Naval Conference, by sponsoring the Geneva Naval Conference in 1927, which failed owing to a French and Italian boycott and the failure of Great Britain and the U.S. to agree on cruiser tonnages. As a result, the conference was a failure and Congress eventually authorized for increased American naval spending in 1928. \nThe Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact of 1928, named for U.S. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg and French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand, was a key peacekeeping initiative. Ratified in 1929, the treaty committed signatories\u2014the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan\u2014to \"renounce war, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another\". The treaty did not achieve its intended result\u2014to outlaw war\u2014but it did provide the founding principle for international law after World War II. Coolidge continued the Harding administration's policy of withholding recognition of the Soviet Union.\nEfforts were made to normalize ties with post-Revolution Mexico. Coolidge recognized Mexico's new governments under \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n and Plutarco El\u00edas Calles, and continued U.S. support for the elected Mexican government against the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty during the Cristero War, lifting the arms embargo on Mexico. He appointed Dwight Morrow as Ambassador to Mexico with the successful objective to avoid further conflict with Mexico. \nCoolidge's administration saw continuity in the occupation of Nicaragua and Haiti. In 1924, Coolidge ended the US occupation of the Dominican Republic as a result of withdrawal agreements finalized during Harding's administration. In 1925, Coolidge ordered the withdrawal of Marines stationed in Nicaragua following perceived stability after the 1924 Nicaraguan general election. In January 1927, he redeployed them there, after failed attempts to peacefully resolve the rapid deterioration of political stability and avert the ensuing Constitutionalist War. He later sent Henry L. Stimson to mediate a peace deal that ended the civil war and extended U.S. military presence in Nicaragua beyond Coolidge's presidency.\nIn January 1928, to extend an olive branch to Latin American leaders embittered over U.S. interventionist policies in Central America and the Caribbean, Coolidge led the U.S. delegation to the Sixth International Conference of American States in Havana, Cuba, the only international trip Coolidge made during his presidency. He was the last sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba until Barack Obama in 2016. For Canada, Coolidge authorized the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of locks and canals that provided large vessels passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes.\nCabinet.\nAlthough some of Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge initially retained all of them out of conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president, he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's speechwriter Judson T. Welliver. Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925. Coolidge appointed C. Bascom Slemp, a Virginia Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as Secretaries to the President, a position equivalent to the modern White House Chief of Staff.\nPerhaps the most powerful person in Coolidge's cabinet was Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon, who controlled the administration's financial policies and was regarded by many, including House Minority Leader John Nance Garner, as more powerful than Coolidge himself. Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover also held a prominent place in the cabinet, in part because Coolidge found value in Hoover's ability to win positive publicity with his pro-business proposals. \nSecretary of State Charles Evans Hughes directed Coolidge's foreign policy until he resigned in 1925 following Coolidge's reelection. He was replaced by Frank B. Kellogg, who had previously served as a senator and ambassador to Great Britain. Coolidge made two other appointments after his reelection: William M. Jardine as Secretary of Agriculture and John G. Sargent as Attorney General. Coolidge had no vice president during his first term. Charles Dawes became vice president during Coolidge's second term, and Dawes and Coolidge clashed over farm policy and other issues.\nJudicial appointments.\nIn 1925, Coolidge appointed one justice to the Supreme Court of the United States, Harlan F. Stone. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. In 1924, Stone was serving as the dean of Columbia Law School when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's attorney general, Harry M. Daugherty. \nIt does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone, although Stone urged him to appoint Benjamin N. Cardozo. Stone proved to be a firm believer in judicial restraint and was regarded as one of the court's three liberal justices who often voted to uphold New Deal legislation. President Franklin D. Roosevelt later appointed Stone chief justice.\nCoolidge nominated 17 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals and 61 to the United States district courts. He appointed judges to various specialty courts, including Genevieve R. Cline, who became the first woman named to the federal judiciary when Coolidge placed her on the United States Customs Court in 1928. Coolidge signed the Judiciary Act of 1925 into law, allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload.\n1928 election.\nIn the summer of 1927, Coolidge vacationed in the Black Hills of South Dakota. While on vacation, he issued a terse statement that he would not seek a second full term as president: \"I do not choose to run for President in 1928.\" After allowing the reporters to take that in, Coolidge elaborated. \"If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933\u00a0\u2026 Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it\u2014too long!\" \nIn his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: \"The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish.\" \nAfter leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 when Herbert Hoover was elected in a landslide. Coolidge was reluctant to endorse Hoover. On one occasion he remarked, \"for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice\u2014all of it bad.\" But Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing Hoover's nomination.\nPost-presidency (1929\u20131933).\nAfter his presidency, Coolidge retired to a spacious home in Northampton, \"The Beeches\". He kept a Hacker runabout boat on the Connecticut River, and local boating enthusiasts often observed him on the water. During this time, he chaired the Non-Partisan Railroad Commission, an entity several banks and corporations created to survey the country's long-term transportation needs and make recommendations for improvements. He was an honorary president of the American Foundation for the Blind, a director of New York Life Insurance Company, president of the American Antiquarian Society, and a trustee of Amherst College.\nCoolidge published his autobiography in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, \"Calvin Coolidge Says\", from 1930 to 1931. Faced with looming defeat in 1932, some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their party's nominee, and instead drafting Coolidge to run, but the former President made it clear that he was not interested in running again, and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him, should it come about. Hoover was renominated, and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him. Hoover lost the general election to Franklin D. Roosevelt in a landslide.\nDeath.\nCoolidge died suddenly of coronary thrombosis at The Beeches on January 5, 1933, at 12:45\u00a0p.m., aged 60. Shortly before his death, he told an old friend, \"I feel I no longer fit in with these times.\" Coolidge's funeral was held at Edwards Congregational Church in Northampton, Massachusetts. Many prominent politicians attended the service, including Coolidge's successor Herbert Hoover, Vice President Curtis, Chief Justice Charles Hughes, and Secretary of War Henry Stimson. All the New England governors were also present.\nHis death was viewed as a painful shock to the nation. President Herbert Hoover ordered flags at half-staff for 30 days and military and naval honors on the day of the funeral. Hoover sent out a special Message to Congress to inform them of the former president's passing. \nCoolidge was then taken back to Vermont, where he was buried in Plymouth Notch Cemetery in Plymouth Notch, Vermont. The nearby family home is maintained as one of the original buildings on the Calvin Coolidge Homestead District site. The President Coolidge Historic Site was started in 1947 by the state of Vermont when they purchased and rehabilitated the childhood home of his mother. This was the first of multiple restoration projects in Plymouth Notch. In 1956 Coolidge\u2019s son John donated his father\u2019s boyhood home to the state of Vermont. In 1960 his son John, former Vermont Governor Deane C. Davis, and others founded The Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation to help preserve his legacy. John F. Kennedy, along with former U.S. presidents Herbert Hoover, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower all became sponsors of the foundation. The house was added to the list of National Historic Landmarks on June 23, 1965. In July 1972, the State of Vermont dedicated a new visitors' center and museum nearby to mark Coolidge's 100th birthday. In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Calvin Coolidge Foundation, a greatly expanded facility, renamed the President Calvin Coolidge Museum and Education Center, was dedicated by Vermont's Governor Jim Douglas on August 7, 2010. \nCoolidge's house in Northampton, Massachusetts, was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1976. The Calvin Coolidge Presidential Library and Museum is also located in Northampton and was founded in 1920, when Coolidge began donating various records and memorabilia to the Forbes Library. This collection was furthered following his death in 1956 when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts established the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Room at the behest of his widow Grace Coolidge.\nLegacy.\nDespite having been popular while in office, Coolidge is generally rated a below-average president by modern historians. Historian David Greenberg wrote, \"although the public liked and admired Calvin Coolidge during his tenure, the Great Depression that began in 1929 seriously eroded his reputation and changed public opinion about his policies\". \nHistorians have criticized Coolidge for his lack of assertiveness and have called him a \"do nothing president\" who enjoyed high public approval only because he was in office when things were going well around the world. Some historians have scrutinized Coolidge for signing laws that broadened federal regulatory authority and say it paved the way for corruption in future presidential administrations. \nIn a 1982 \"Chicago Tribune\" survey of 49 historians, Coolidge was ranked the eighth-worst U.S. president. In 2006, British journalist William Shawcross said he believed Coolidge was the worst president of the 20th century. In a 2021 C-SPAN survey, historians ranked Coolidge 24th out of 44 presidents. They gave him high ratings for \"moral authority\" and \"administrative skills\" but poor ratings for \"setting an agenda\" and \"pursuing equal justice\".\nAlthough historians generally view Coolidge unfavorably, his hands-off government approach continues to resonate with modern conservatives and Republican politicians. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan publicly praised Coolidge's \"laissez-faire\" policy. Later, Reagan had a portrait of Thomas Jefferson in the White House Cabinet Room replaced by one of Coolidge.\nRadio, film, and commemorations.\nDespite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since. Coolidge's second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, his speech to Congress was broadcast on radio, the first presidential radio address. \nCoolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee de Forest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making him the first president to appear in a sound film, \"President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds\". When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and presented him with the Medal of Honor, and the event was filmed.\nSee also.\nGeneral:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nAbout Coolidge and his era.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBy Coolidge.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nBiographical information\nDigital collections\nPhysical collections\nOther\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

The Convention has three main goals: the conservation of biological diversity (or biodiversity); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources. Its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, and it is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development.\nThe Convention was opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. The United States is the only UN member state which has not ratified the Convention. It has two supplementary agreements, the Cartagena Protocol and Nagoya Protocol.\nThe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is an international treaty governing the movements of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from modern biotechnology from one country to another. It was adopted on 29 January 2000 as a supplementary agreement to the CBD and entered into force on 11 September 2003.\nThe Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) to the Convention on Biological Diversity is another supplementary agreement to the CBD. It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Nagoya Protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan, and entered into force on 12 October 2014.\n2010 was also the International Year of Biodiversity, and the Secretariat of the CBD was its focal point. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories at Nagoya, the UN declared 2011 to 2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity in December 2010. The Convention's \"Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020\", created in 2010, include the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.\nThe meetings of the Parties to the Convention are known as Conferences of the Parties (COP), with the first one (COP 1) held in Nassau, Bahamas, in 1994 and the most recent one (COP 16) in 2024 in Cali, Colombia.\nIn the area of marine and coastal biodiversity CBD's focus at present is to identify Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) in specific ocean locations based on scientific criteria. The aim is to create an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) involving area-based planning and decision-making under UNCLOS to support the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction (BBNJ treaty or High Seas Treaty).\nOrigin and scope.\nThe notion of an international convention on biodiversity was conceived at a United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities. In 1991, an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the Convention's text.\nA Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions were distilled in the Nairobi Final Act. The Convention's text was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio \"Earth Summit\"). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the Convention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December 1993.\nThe Convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biodiversity is \"a common concern of humankind\" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all ecosystems, species, and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use. It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and biosafety issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.\nThe Convention reminds decision-makers of the finite status of natural resources and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use. While past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.\nThe Convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of geoengineering.\nExecutive secretary.\nAs of April 2024, the acting executive secretary is Astrid Schomaker.\nThe previous executive secretaries were: David Cooper (2023\u20132024), Elizabeth Maruma Mrema (2020\u20132023), (2017\u20132019), Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias (2012\u20132017), Ahmed Djoghlaf (2006\u20132012), Hamdallah Zedan (1998\u20132005), Calestous Juma (1995\u20131998), and Angela Cropper (1993\u20131995).\nIssues.\nSome of the many issues dealt with under the Convention include:\nInternational bodies established.\nConference of the Parties (COP).\nThe Convention's governing body is the Conference of the Parties (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.\nThe Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, the main organs are:\nCBD Secretariat.\nThe CBD Secretariat, based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, operates under UNEP, the United Nations Environment Programme. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.\nSubsidiary Body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA).\nThe SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues. It provides assessments of the status of biological diversity and of various measures taken in accordance with Convention, and also gives recommendations to the Conference of the Parties, which may be endorsed in whole, in part or in modified form by the COPs. As of 2024[ [update]] SBSTTA had met 26 times, with a 26th meeting taking place in Nairobi, Kenya in 2024.\nSubsidiary Body on Implementation.\nIn 2014, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity established the Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI) to replace the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Review of Implementation of the Convention. The four functions and core areas of work of SBI are: (a) review of progress in implementation; (b) strategic actions to enhance implementation; (c) strengthening means of implementation; and (d) operations of the Convention and the Protocols. The first meeting of the SBI was held on 2\u20136 May 2016 and the second meeting was held on 9\u201313 July 2018, both in Montreal, Canada. The latest (fifth) meeting of the SBI was held in October 2024 in Cali, Colombia. The Bureau of the Conference of the Parties serves as the Bureau of the SBI. The current chair of the SBI is Ms. Clarissa Souza Della Nina of Brazil.\nParties.\nAs of 2016, the Convention has 196 Parties, which includes 195 states and the European Union. All UN member states\u2014with the exception of the United States\u2014have ratified the treaty. Non-UN member states that have ratified are the Cook Islands, Niue, and the State of Palestine. The Holy See and the states with limited recognition are non-Parties. The US has signed but not ratified the treaty, because ratification requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate and is blocked by Republican Party senators.\nThe European Union created the Cartagena Protocol (see below) in 2000 to enhance biosafety regulation and propagate the \"precautionary principle\" over the \"sound science principle\" defended by the United States. Whereas the impact of the Cartagena Protocol on domestic regulations has been substantial, its impact on international trade law remains uncertain. In 2006, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that the European Union had violated international trade law between 1999 and 2003 by imposing a moratorium on the approval of genetically modified organisms (GMO) imports. Disappointing the United States, the panel nevertheless \"decided not to decide\" by not invalidating the stringent European biosafety regulations.\nImplementation by the Parties to the Convention is achieved using two means:\nNational Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP).\nNational Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level. The Convention requires that countries prepare a national biodiversity strategy and to ensure that this strategy is included in planning for activities in all sectors where diversity may be impacted. As of early 2012, 173 Parties had developed NBSAPs.\nThe United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The United States of America, a signatory who had not yet ratified the treaty by 2010, produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species recovery programs and other mechanisms long in place in the US for species conservation.\nSingapore established a detailed \"National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan\". The \"National Biodiversity Centre\" of Singapore represents Singapore in the Convention for Biological Diversity.\nNational Reports.\nIn accordance with Article 26 of the Convention, Parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the Convention.\nProtocols and plans developed by CBD.\nCartagena Protocol (2000).\nThe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000, after a CBD Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on Biosafety had met six times between July 1996 and February 1999. The Working Group submitted a draft text of the Protocol for consideration by Conference of the Parties at its first extraordinary meeting, which was convened for the express purpose of adopting a protocol on biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity. After a few delays, the Cartagena Protocol was eventually adopted on 29 January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.\nThe Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will, for example, let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton.\nThe required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.\nGlobal Strategy for Plant Conservation (2002).\nIn April 2002, the Parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.\nNagoya Protocol (2010).\nThe Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture, Japan, at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. The protocol is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity, and provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. It thereby contributes to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.\nStrategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020.\nAlso, at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, held from 18 to 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, a revised and updated \"Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, 2011\u20132020\" was agreed and published. This document included the \"Aichi Biodiversity Targets\", comprising 20 targets that address each of five strategic goals defined in the plan. The strategic plan includes the following strategic goals:\nUpon the launch of Agenda 2030, CBD released a technical note mapping and identifying synergies between the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets. This helps to understand the contributions of biodiversity to achieving the SDGs.\nPost-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.\nA new plan, known as the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was developed to guide action through 2030. A first draft of this framework was released in July 2021, and its final content was discussed and negotiated as part of the COP 15 meetings. Reducing agricultural pollution and sharing the benefits of digital sequence information arose as key points of contention among Parties during development of the framework. A final version was adopted by the Convention on 19 December 2022. The framework includes a number of ambitious goals, including a commitment to designate at least 30 percent of global land and sea as protected areas (known as the \"30 by 30\" initiative).\nMarine and coastal biodiversity.\nThe CBD has a significant focus on marine and coastal biodiversity.\u00a0A series of expert workshops have been held (2018\u20132022) to identify options for modifying the description of Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) and describing new areas. These have focused on the North-East, North-West and South-Eastern Atlantic Ocean, Baltic Sea, Caspian Sea, Black Sea, Seas of East Asia, North-West Indian Ocean and Adjacent Gulf Areas, Southern and North-East Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North and South Pacific, Eastern Tropical and Temperate Pacific, Wider Caribbean and Western Mid-Atlantic. The workshop meetings have followed the EBSA process based on internationally agreed scientific criteria. This is aimed at creating an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) under UNCLOS to support the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction (BBNJ or High Seas Treaty). The central mechanism is area-based planning and decision-making. It integrates EBSAs, Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) and High Seas (Marine Protected Areas) with Blue Growth scenarios. There is also linkage with the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.\nCriticism.\nThere have been criticisms against CBD that its implementation has been weakened due to resistance of Western countries to the implementation of pro-South provisions of the Convention. CBD is also regarded as a case of a hard treaty gone soft in the implementation trajectory. The argument to enforce the treaty as a legally binding multilateral instrument with the Conference of Parties reviewing the infractions and non-compliance is also gaining strength.\nAlthough the Convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions, examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening. The fifth report of the European Union, for example, makes frequent reference to animals (particularly fish) and plants, but does not mention bacteria, fungi or protists at all. The International Society for Fungal Conservation has assessed more than 100 of these CBD documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories. No documents were assessed as good or adequate, less than 10% as nearly adequate or poor, and the rest as deficient, seriously deficient or totally deficient.\nScientists working with biodiversity and medical research are expressing fears that the Nagoya Protocol is counterproductive, and will hamper disease prevention and conservation efforts, and that the threat of imprisonment of scientists will have a chilling effect on research. Non-commercial researchers and institutions such as natural history museums fear maintaining biological reference collections and exchanging material between institutions will become difficult, and medical researchers have expressed alarm at plans to expand the protocol to make it illegal to publicly share genetic information, e.g. via GenBank.\nWilliam Yancey Brown, when with the Brookings Institution, suggested that the Convention on Biological Diversity should include the preservation of intact genomes and viable cells for every known species and for new species as they are discovered.\nMeetings of the Parties.\nA Conference of the Parties (COP) was held annually for three years after 1994, and thence biennially on even-numbered years.\n1994 COP 1.\nThe first ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in November and December 1994, in Nassau, Bahamas. The International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI) was launched at this first COP for the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n1995 COP 2.\nThe second ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in November 1995, in Jakarta, Indonesia.\n1996 COP 3.\nThe third ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in November 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n1998 COP 4.\nThe fourth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in May 1998, in Bratislava, Slovakia.\n1999 EX-COP 1 (Cartagena).\nThe First Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference of the Parties took place in February 1999, in Cartagena, Colombia. A series of meetings led to the adoption of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety in January 2000, effective from 2003.\n2000 COP 5.\nThe fifth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in May 2000, in Nairobi, Kenya.\n2002 COP 6.\nThe sixth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in April 2002, in The Hague, Netherlands.\n2004 COP 7.\nThe seventh ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in February 2004, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n2006 COP 8.\nThe eighth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in March 2006, in Curitiba, Brazil.\n2008 COP 9.\nThe ninth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in May 2008, in Bonn, Germany.\n2010 COP 10 (Nagoya).\nThe tenth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place in October 2010, in Nagoya, Japan. It was at this meeting that the Nagoya Protocol was ratified.\n2010 was the International Year of Biodiversity, which resulted in 110 reports on the loss of biodiversity in different countries, but little or no progress toward the goal of \"significant reduction\" in the problem. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories, the UN declared 2011 to 2020 as the United Nations Decade on Biodiversity.\n2012 COP 11.\nLeading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on biodiversity in Hyderabad, India, 2012, preparations for a World Wide Views on Biodiversity has begun, involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the World Wide Views on Global Warming.\n2014 COP 12.\nUnder the theme, \"Biodiversity for Sustainable Development\", thousands of representatives of governments, NGOs, indigenous peoples, scientists and the private sector gathered in Pyeongchang, Republic of Korea in October 2014 for the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 12).\nFrom 6\u201317 October 2014, Parties discussed the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which are to be achieved by the end of this decade. The results of Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, the flagship assessment report of the CBD informed the discussions.\nThe conference gave a mid-term evaluation to the UN Decade on Biodiversity (2011\u20132020) initiative, which aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of nature. The meeting achieved a total of 35 decisions, including a decision on \"Mainstreaming gender considerations\", to incorporate gender perspective to the analysis of biodiversity.\nAt the end of the meeting, the meeting adopted the \"Pyeongchang Road Map\", which addresses ways to achieve biodiversity through technology cooperation, funding and strengthening the capacity of developing countries.\n2016 COP 13.\nThe thirteenth ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place between 2 and 17 December 2016 in Canc\u00fan, Mexico.\n2018 COP 14.\nThe 14th ordinary meeting of the Parties to the Convention took place on 17\u201329 November 2018, in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The 2018 UN Biodiversity Conference closed on 29 November 2018 with broad international agreement on reversing the global destruction of nature and biodiversity loss threatening all forms of life on Earth. Parties adopted the Voluntary Guidelines for the design and effective implementation of ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Governments also agreed to accelerate action to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, agreed in 2010, until 2020. Work to achieve these targets would take place at the global, regional, national and subnational levels.\n2021/2022 COP 15.\nThe 15th meeting of the Parties was originally scheduled to take place in Kunming, China in 2020, but was postponed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After the start date was delayed for a third time, the Convention was split into two sessions. A mostly online event took place in October 2021, where over 100 nations signed the Kunming declaration on biodiversity. The theme of the declaration was \"Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth\". Twenty-one action-oriented draft targets were provisionally agreed in the October meeting, to be further discussed in the second session: an in-person event that was originally scheduled to start in April 2022, but was rescheduled to occur later in 2022. The second part of COP 15 ultimately took place in Montreal, Canada, from 5\u201317 December 2022. At the meeting, the Parties to the Convention adopted a new action plan, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\n2024 COP 16.\nThe 16th meeting of the Parties is scheduled to be held in Cali, Colombia in 2024. Originally, Turkey was going to host it but after a series of earthquakes in February 2023 they had to withdraw.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "6201", "revid": "15816876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6201", "title": "CITES", "text": "Multilateral treaty dedicated to flora and fauna\nCITES (shorter acronym for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, also known as the Washington Convention) is a multilateral treaty to protect endangered plants and animals from the threats of international trade. It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975.\nIts aim is to ensure that international trade (import/export) in specimens of animals and plants included under CITES does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild. This is achieved via a system of permits and certificates. CITES affords varying degrees of protection to more than 40,900 species.\nAs of December\u00a02024[ [update]], the Secretary-General of CITES is Ivonne Higuero.\nBackground.\nCITES is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence. There are three working languages of the convention (English, French and Spanish) in which all documents are made available. Participation is voluntary and countries that have agreed to be bound by the convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level.\nOriginally, CITES addressed depletion resulting from demand for luxury goods such as furs in Western countries, but with the rising wealth of Asia, particularly in China, the focus changed to products demanded there, particularly those used for luxury goods such as elephant ivory or rhinoceros horn. As of 2022, CITES has expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as manta rays.\nRatifications.\nThe text of the convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in Washington, D.C., United States, on 3 March 1973. It was then open for signature until 31 December 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on 1 July 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the convention. As of June\u00a02025[ [update]], the convention has 185 parties, including 184 states and the European Union.\nThe CITES Convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-Parties. All member states of the United Nations are party to the treaty, with the exception of North Korea, Federated States of Micronesia, Haiti, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, South Sudan, East Timor, and Tuvalu. UN observer the Holy See is also not a member. The Faroe Islands, an autonomous region in the Kingdom of Denmark, is also treated as a non-Party to CITES (both the Danish mainland and Greenland are part of CITES).\nAn amendment to the text of the convention, known as the Gaborone Amendment allows regional economic integration organizations (REIO), such as the European Union, to have the status of a member state and to be a Party to the convention. The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.\nIn accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment. At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.\nGoverning Structure of CITES.\nCITES operates to support the member Parties. This support consists of the input from three Committees (Standing, Animal and Plant) who are overseen by the Secretary-General. The secretariat position has been held by a variety of people from different nations.\nTimeline of CITES Secretary-General Offices.\n1978-1981: Peter H. Sand\nHe was born in Bavaria, Germany and was educated in international law in Germany, France and Canada. He became a professor and an author, focusing on environmental law, holding other positions such as the Director-General of the IUCN and legal advisor for environmental affairs to the World Bank.\n1982-1990: Eugene Lapointe\nA Canadian native, Lapointe served in the military for many years and acted as a diplomat before governing the CITES. He is currently an author and holds the position of President of the https:// World Conservation Trust, a non-profit organization that promotes wildlife conservation with an emphasis on a human-centered approach to natural-resources.\n1991 - 1998: Izgrev Topkov\nBorn and raised in Bulgaria, Topkov was a diplomat before managing CITES, and was removed from that position following the misuse of permits that violated CITES guidelines.\n1999 - 2010: Willem Wijnstekers\nA native of the Netherlands and graduate from the University of Amsterdam, Wijnsteker held the position of Secretary-General for the longest period of time and is now an author.\n2010 - 2018: John E. Scanlon\nAn Australian who studied environmental law, Scanlon was active in combating illegal animal trade and currently works in the effort to protect Elephants in Africa as CEO of the Elephant Protection Initiative Foundation (EPIF).\n2018- Current: Ivonne Higuero \nThe first woman to hold this position, Higuero was educated in environmental economics and is from Panama.\nRegulation of trade.\nCITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of listed taxa to controls as they move across international borders. CITES specimens can include a wide range of items including the whole animal/plant (whether alive or dead), or a product that contains a part or derivative of the listed taxa such as cosmetics or traditional medicines.\nFour types of trade are recognized by CITES - import, export, re-export (export of any specimen that has previously been imported) and introduction from the sea (transportation into a state of specimens of any species which were taken in the marine environment not under the jurisdiction of any state). The CITES definition of \"trade\" does not require a financial transaction to be occurring. All trade in specimens of species covered by CITES must be authorized through a system of permits and certificates prior to the trade taking place. CITES permits and certificates are issued by one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering the CITES system in each country. Management Authorities are advised by one or more Scientific Authorities on the effects of trade of the specimen on the status of CITES-listed species. CITES permits and certificates must be presented to relevant border authorities in each country in order to authorize the trade.\nEach party must enact their own domestic legislation to bring the provisions of CITES into effect in their territories. Parties may choose to take stricter domestic measures than CITES provides (for example by requiring permits/certificates in cases where they would not normally be needed or by prohibiting trade in some specimens).\nAppendices.\nOver 40,900 species, subspecies and populations are protected under CITES. Each protected taxa or population is included in one of three lists called Appendices. The Appendix that lists a taxon or population reflects the level of the threat posed by international trade and the CITES controls that apply.\nTaxa may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another. The African bush elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\") is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I. Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the pronghorn (\"Antilocapra americana\"), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under other domestic legislation, in this case the Endangered Species Act).\nTaxa are proposed for inclusion, amendment or deletion in Appendices I and II at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years. Amendments to listing in Appendix III may be made unilaterally by individual parties.\nAppendix I.\nAppendix I taxa are those that are threatened with extinction and to which the highest level of CITES protection is afforded. Commercial trade in wild-sourced specimens of these taxa is not permitted and non-commercial trade is strictly controlled by requiring an import permit and export permit to be granted by the relevant Management Authorities in each country before the trade occurs.\nNotable taxa listed in Appendix I include the red panda (\"Ailurus fulgens\"), western gorilla (\"Gorilla gorilla\"), the chimpanzee species (\"Pan spp.\"), tigers (\"Panthera tigris\" sp.), Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\"), snow leopard (\"Panthera uncia\"), red-shanked douc (\"Pygathrix nemaeus\"), some populations of African bush elephant (\"Loxodonta africana\"), and the monkey puzzle tree (\"Araucaria araucana\").\nAppendix II.\nAppendix II taxa are those that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival. Appendix II taxa may also include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices. The vast majority of taxa listed under CITES are listed in Appendix II. Any trade in Appendix II taxa standardly requires a CITES export permit or re-export certificate to be granted by the Management Authority of the exporting country before the trade occurs.\nExamples of taxa listed on Appendix II are the great white shark (\"Carcharodon carcharias\"), the American black bear (\"Ursus americanus\"), Hartmann's mountain zebra (\"Equus zebra hartmannae\"), green iguana (\"Iguana iguana\"), queen conch (\"Strombus gigas\"), emperor scorpion (\"Pandinus imperator\"), Mertens' water monitor (\"Varanus mertensi\"), bigleaf mahogany (\"Swietenia macrophylla\"), lignum vitae (\"Guaiacum officinale\"), the chambered nautilus (\"Nautilus pompilius\"), all stony corals (\"Scleractinia\" spp.), Jungle cat (\"Felis chaus\") and American ginseng (\"Panax quinquefolius\").\nAppendix III.\nAppendix III species are those that are protected in at least one country, and that country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade.\nAny trade in Appendix III species standardly requires a CITES export permit (if sourced from the country that listed the species) or a certificate of origin (from any other country) to be granted before the trade occurs.\nExamples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the Hoffmann's two-toed sloth (\"Choloepus hoffmanni\") by Costa Rica, sitatunga (\"Tragelaphus spekii\") by Ghana and African civet (\"Civettictis civetta\") by Botswana.\nExemptions and special procedures.\nUnder Article VII, the Convention allows for certain exceptions to the general trade requirements described above.\nPre-Convention specimens.\nCITES provides for a special process for specimens that were acquired before the provisions of the Convention applied to that specimen. These are known as \"pre-Convention\" specimens and must be granted a CITES pre-Convention certificate before the trade occurs. Only specimens legally acquired before the date on which the species concerned was first included in the Appendices qualify for this exemption.\nPersonal and household effects.\nCITES provides that the standard permit/certificate requirements for trade in CITES specimens do not generally apply if a specimen is a personal or household effect. However, there are a number of situations where permits/certificates for personal or household effects are required and some countries choose to take stricter domestic measures by requiring permits/certificates for some or all personal or household effects.\nCaptive bred or artificially propagated specimens.\nCITES allows trade in specimens to follow special procedures if Management Authorities are satisfied that they are sourced from captive bred animals or artificially propagated plants. \nIn the case of commercial trade of Appendix I taxa, captive bred or artificially propagated specimens may be traded as if they were Appendix II. This reduces the permit requirements from two permits (import/export) to one (export only). \nIn the case of non-commercial trade, specimens may be traded with a certificate of captive breeding/artificial propagation issued by the Management Authority of the state of export in lieu of standard permits.\nScientific exchange.\nStandard CITES permit and certificates are not required for the non-commercial loan, donation or exchange between scientific or forensic institutions that have been registered by a Management Authority of their State. Consignments containing the specimens must carry a label issued or approved by that Management Authority (in some cases Customs Declaration labels may be used). Specimens that may be included under this provision include museum, herbarium, diagnostic and forensic research specimens. Registered institutions are listed on the CITES website.\nAmendments and reservations.\nAmendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are \"present and voting\" and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting. The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty. Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.\nSpecies in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing. Species listings are made at the Conference of Parties.\nUpon acceding to the convention or within 90 days of a species listing being amended, Parties may make reservations. In these cases, the party is treated as being a state that is not a Party to CITES with respect to trade in the species concerned. Notable reservations include those by Iceland, Japan, and Norway on various baleen whale species and those on Falconiformes by Saudi Arabia.\nShortcomings and concerns.\nImplementation.\nAs of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major CITES requirements - designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade and laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.\nAlthough the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 36 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties. The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:\nBilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).\nInfractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and failing to produce annual reports (the most common).\nApproach to biodiversity conservation.\nGeneral limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, ecosystem approaches to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the Convention on Biological Diversity), although this has been changing (see Nile crocodile, African elephant, South African white rhino case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand. In fact, CITES listings have been demonstrated to increase financial speculation in certain markets for high value species. Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).\nThere has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations. For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection. Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection. \nIn another instance, the United States initially stopped exports of bobcat and lynx hides in 1977 when it first implemented CITES for lack of data to support no detriment findings.https:// However, in this Federal Register notice, issued by William Yancey Brown, the U.S. Endangered Species Scientific Authority (ESSA) established a framework of no detriment findings for each state and the Navajo nation and indicated that approval would be forthcoming if the states and Navajo nation provided evidence that their furbearer management programs assured the species would be conserved. Management programs for these species expanded rapidly, including tagging for export, and are currently recognized in program approvals under regulations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nDrafting.\nBy design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a \"negative list\" such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated \"unless\" the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained. Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review. For example, recently several bird classified as threatened with extinction appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status. If a \"positive list\" approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.\nSpecific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.\nIn order to ensure that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.\nAnimal sourced pathogens.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 CEO Ivonne Higuero noted that illegal wildlife trade not only helps to destroy habitats, but these habitats create a safety barrier for humans that can prevent pathogens from animals passing themselves on to people.\nReform suggestions.\nSuggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the Convention on Biological Diversity) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting. CITES would benefit from access to Global Environment Facility (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds. Development of a future mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.\nTRAFFIC Data.\nFrom 2005 to 2009 the legal trade corresponded with these numbers:\nIn the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually. In 2009 the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion.\nTraffic released a report in December 2024 outlining illegal trade in animal products occurring in Vietnam:\nAdditional information about the documented trade can be extracted through queries on the CITES website.\nMeetings.\nThe Conference of the Parties (CoP) is held once every three years. The location of the next CoP is chosen at the close of each CoP by a secret ballot vote.\nThe CITES Committees (Animals Committee, Plants Committee and Standing Committee) hold meetings during each year that does not have a CoP, while the Standing committee meets also in years with a CoP. The Committee meetings take place in Geneva, Switzerland (where the Secretariat of the CITES Convention is located), unless another country offers to host the meeting. The Secretariat is administered by UNEP. The Animals and Plants Committees have sometimes held joint meetings. The previous joint meeting was held in March 2012 in Dublin, Ireland, and the latest one was held in Veracruz, Mexico, in May 2014.\nA current list of upcoming meetings appears on the CITES calendar.\nAt the seventeenth Conference of the Parties (CoP 17), Namibia and Zimbabwe introduced proposals to amend their listing of elephant populations in Appendix II. Instead, they wished to establish controlled trade in all elephant specimens, including ivory. They argue that revenue from regulated trade could be used for elephant conservation and rural communities' development. However, both proposals were opposed by the US and other countries.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It opened for signature on 18 May 1977 in Geneva and entered into force on 5 October 1978.\nThe Convention bans weather warfare, which is the use of weather modification techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction. The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 would also ban some forms of weather modification or geoengineering.\nMany states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides in warfare, such as Agent Orange, but it does require case-by-case consideration.\nParties.\nThe convention was signed by 48 states; 16 of the signatories have not ratified. As of 2022 the convention has 78 state parties.\nHistory.\nThe problem of artificial modification of the environment for military or other hostile purposes was brought to the international agenda in the early 1970s. Following the US decision of July 1972 to renounce the use of climate modification techniques for hostile purposes, the 1973 resolution by the US Senate calling for an international agreement \"prohibiting the use of any environmental or geophysical modification activity as a weapon of war\", and an in-depth review by the Department of Defense of the military aspects of weather and other environmental modification techniques, US decided to seek agreement with the Soviet Union to explore the possibilities of an international agreement.\nIn July 1974, US and USSR agreed to hold bilateral discussions on measures to overcome the danger of the use of environmental modification techniques for military purposes and three subsequent rounds of discussions in 1974 and 1975. In August 1975, US and USSR tabled identical draft texts of a convention at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD), Conference on Disarmament, where intensive negotiations resulted in a modified text and understandings regarding four articles of this Convention in 1976.\nThe convention was approved by Resolution 31/72 of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1976, by 96 to 8 votes with 30 abstentions.\nEnvironmental Modification Technique.\nEnvironmental Modification Technique includes any technique for changing \u2013 through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes \u2013 the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.\nStructure of ENMOD.\nThe Convention contains ten articles and one Annex on the Consultative Committee of Experts. Integral part of the convention are also the Understandings relating to articles I, II, III and VIII. These Understandings are not incorporated into the convention but are part of the negotiating record and were included in the report transmitted by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1976 Report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, Volume I, General Assembly Official records: Thirty-first session, Supplement No. 27 (A/31/27), New York, United Nations, 1976, pp.\u00a091\u201392.\nAnthropogenic climate change.\nENMOD treaty members are responsible for 83% of carbon dioxide emissions since the treaty entered into force in 1978. The ENMOD treaty could potentially be used by ENMOD member states seeking climate-change loss and damage compensation from other ENMOD member states at the International Court of Justice. With the knowledge that carbon dioxide emissions can enhance extreme weather events, the continued unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions from some ENMOD member states could be viewed as \u2018reckless\u2019 in the context of deliberately declining emissions from other ENMOD member states. It is unclear whether the International Court of Justice will consider the ENMOD treaty when it issues a legal opinion on international climate change obligations requested by the United Nations General Assembly on 29 March 2023.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These numbers are formed from a construction due to Gregory Chaitin.\nAlthough there are infinitely many halting probabilities, one for each (universal, see below) method of encoding programs, it is common to use the letter \u03a9 to refer to them as if there were only one. Because \u03a9 depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called Chaitin's construction when not referring to any specific encoding.\nEach halting probability is a normal and transcendental real number that is not computable, which means that there is no algorithm to compute its digits. Each halting probability is Martin-L\u00f6f random, meaning there is not even any algorithm which can reliably guess its digits.\nBackground.\nThe definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of a prefix-free universal computable function. Such a function, intuitively, represents a program in a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program.\nSuppose that F is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function F is called computable if there is a Turing machine that computes it, in the sense that for any finite binary strings x and y, \"F\"(\"x\") = \"y\" if and only if the Turing machine halts with y on its tape when given the input x.\nThe function F is called universal if for every computable function f of a single variable there is a string w such that for all x, \"F\"(\"w\"\u00a0\"x\") = \"f\"(\"x\"); here \"w\"\u00a0\"x\" represents the concatenation of the two strings w and x. This means that F can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable. Informally, w represents a \"script\" for the computable function f, and F represents an \"interpreter\" that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.\nThe domain of F is the set of all inputs p on which it is defined. For F that are universal, such a p can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, and as a single program for the function F.\nThe function F is called prefix-free if there are no two elements p, p\u2032 in its domain such that p\u2032 is a proper extension of p. This can be rephrased as: the domain of F is a prefix-free code (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits, and the remaining bits are not considered part of the accepted string. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear: one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.\nThe domain of any universal computable function is a computably enumerable set but never a computable set. The domain is always Turing equivalent to the halting problem.\nDefinition.\nLet \"P\"F be the domain of a prefix-free universal computable function F. The constant \u03a9\"F\" is then defined as\nformula_1\nwhere denotes the length of a string p. This is an infinite sum which has one summand for every p in the domain of F. The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with Kraft's inequality, ensures that this sum converges to a real number between 0 and 1. If F is clear from context then \u03a9\"F\" may be denoted simply \u03a9, although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of \u03a9.\nRelationship to the halting problem.\nKnowing the first N bits of \u03a9, one could calculate the halting problem for all programs of a size up to N. Let the program p for which the halting problem is to be solved be N bits long. In dovetailing fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first N bits. If the program p has not halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first N bits. Thus, the halting problem would be solved for p.\nBecause many outstanding problems in number theory, such as Goldbach's conjecture, are equivalent to solving the halting problem for special programs (which would basically search for counter-examples and halt if one is found), knowing enough bits of Chaitin's constant would also imply knowing the answer to these problems. But as the halting problem is not generally solvable, calculating any but the first few bits of Chaitin's constant is not possible for a universal language. This reduces hard problems to impossible ones, much like trying to build an oracle machine for the halting problem would be.\nInterpretation as a probability.\nThe Cantor space is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the measure of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual probability measure on Cantor space. It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.\nThe probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string x the set of sequences that begin with x has measure 2. This implies that for each natural number n, the set of sequences f in Cantor space such that \"f\"(\"n\") = 1 has measure , and the set of sequences whose nth element is 0 also has measure .\nLet F be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain P of F consists of an infinite set of binary strings\nformula_2\nEach of these strings \"p\"\"i\" determines a subset \"S\"\"i\" of Cantor space; the set \"S\"\"i\" contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with \"p\"\"i\". These sets are disjoint because P is a prefix-free set. The sum\nformula_3\nrepresents the measure of the set \nformula_4\nIn this way, \u03a9\"F\" represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of F. It is for this reason that \u03a9\"F\" is called a halting probability.\nProperties.\nEach Chaitin constant \u03a9 has the following properties:\nNot every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability. A finer equivalence relation, Solovay equivalence, can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals. One can show that a real number in [0,1] is a Chaitin constant (i.e. the halting probability of some prefix-free universal computable function) if and only if it is left-c.e. and algorithmically random. \u03a9 is among the few definable algorithmically random numbers and is the best-known algorithmically random number, but it is not at all typical of all algorithmically random numbers.\nUncomputability.\nA real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given n, returns the first n digits of the number. This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.\nNo halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first n digits of \u03a9, solves Turing's halting problem for programs of length up to n. Since the halting problem is undecidable, \u03a9 cannot be computed.\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows. Given the first n digits of \u03a9 and a \"k\" \u2264 \"n\", the algorithm enumerates the domain of F until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within 2\u2212(\"k\"+1) of \u03a9. After this point, no additional program of length k can be in the domain, because each of these would add 2\u2212\"k\" to the measure, which is impossible. Thus the set of strings of length k in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.\nAlgorithmic randomness.\nA real number is random if the binary sequence representing the real number is an algorithmically random sequence. Calude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang showed that a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence if and only if it is a Chaitin's \u03a9 number.\nIncompleteness theorem for halting probabilities.\nFor each specific consistent effectively represented axiomatic system for the natural numbers, such as Peano arithmetic, there exists a constant N such that no bit of \u03a9 after the Nth can be proven to be 1 or 0 within that system. The constant N depends on how the formal system is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete.\nSuper Omega.\nThe first n bits of Gregory Chaitin's constant \u03a9 are random or incompressible in the sense that they cannot be computed by a halting algorithm with fewer than \"n\" \u2212 O(1) bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first n bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first n bits of \u03a9. In other words, the enumerable first n bits of \u03a9 are highly compressible in the sense that they are limit-computable by a very short algorithm; they are not random with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber constructed a limit-computable \"Super \u03a9\" which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable \u03a9, as one cannot significantly compress the Super \u03a9 by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.\nFor an alternative \"Super \u03a9\", the universality probability of a prefix-free universal Turing machine (UTM)\u00a0\u2013 namely, the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a binary string) is prefixed by a random binary string\u00a0\u2013 can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem (i.e., O(3) using Turing jump notation)."}
