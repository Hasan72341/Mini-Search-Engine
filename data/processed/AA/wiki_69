The term encompasses a broad variety of legends and narratives, especially those considered sacred narratives. Mythological themes and elements occur throughout Christian literature, including recurring myths such as ascending a mountain, the \"axis mundi\", myths of combat, descent into the Underworld, accounts of a dying-and-rising god, a flood myth, stories about the founding of a tribe or city, and myths about great heroes (or saints) of the past, paradises, and self-sacrifice.\nVarious authors have also used it to refer to other mythological and allegorical elements found in the Bible, such as the story of the Leviathan. The term has been applied to myths and legends from the Middle Ages, such as the story of Saint George and the Dragon, the stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and the legends of the \"Parsival\". Multiple commentators have classified John Milton's epic poem \"Paradise Lost\" as a work of Christian mythology. The term has also been applied to modern stories revolving around Christian themes and motifs, such as the writings of C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, and George MacDonald.\nOver the centuries, Christianity has divided into many denominations. Not all of these denominations hold the same set of sacred traditional narratives. For example, the books of the Bible accepted by the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches include a number of texts and stories (such as those narrated in the Book of Judith and Book of Tobit) that many Protestant denominations do not accept as canonical.\nAttitudes.\nChristian theologian and professor of New Testament, Rudolf Bultmann wrote that:\nThe cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character. The world is viewed as a three storied structure, with the earth in the center, the heaven above, and the underworld beneath. Heaven is the abode of God and of celestial beings \u2013 the angels. The underworld is hell, the place of torment. Even the earth is more than the scene of natural, everyday events, of the trivial round and common task. It is the scene of the supernatural activity of God and his angels on the one hand, and of Satan and his demons on the other. These supernatural forces intervene in the course of nature and in all that men think and will and do. Miracles are by no means rare. Man is not in control of his own life. Evil spirits may take possession of him. Satan may inspire him with evil thoughts. Alternatively, God may inspire his thought and guide his purposes. He may grant him heavenly visions. He may allow him to hear his word of succor or demand. He may give him the supernatural power of his Spirit. History does not follow a smooth unbroken course; it is set in motion and controlled by these supernatural powers. This \u00e6on is held in bondage by Satan, sin, and death (for \"powers\" is precisely what they are), and hastens towards its end. That end will come very soon, and will take the form of a cosmic catastrophe. It will be inaugurated by the \"woes\" of the last time. Then the Judge will come from heaven, the dead will rise, the last judgment will take place, and men will enter into eternal salvation or damnation.\nMyths as traditional or sacred stories.\nIn its broadest academic sense, the word \"myth\" simply means a traditional story. However, many scholars restrict the term \"myth\" to sacred stories. Folklorists often go further, defining myths as \"tales believed as true, usually sacred, set in the distant past or other worlds or parts of the world, and with extra-human, inhuman, or heroic characters\".\nIn classical Greek, \"muthos\", from which the English word \"myth\" derives, meant \"story, narrative.\" By the time of Christ, \"muthos\" had started to take on the connotations of \"fable, fiction,\" and early Christian writers often avoided calling a story from canonical scripture a \"myth\". Paul warned Timothy to have nothing to do with \"godless and silly myths\" (\"beb\u0113thous kai gra\u014ddeis muthous)\". This negative meaning of \"myth\" passed into popular usage. Some modern Christian scholars and writers have attempted to rehabilitate the term \"myth\" outside academia, describing stories in canonical scripture (especially the Christ story) as \"true myth\"; examples include C. S. Lewis and Andrew Greeley. Several modern Christian writers, such as C. S. Lewis, have described elements of Christianity, particularly the story of Christ, as \"myth\" which is also \"true\" (\"true myth\"). Others object to associating Christianity with \"myth\" for a variety of reasons: the association of the term \"myth\" with polytheism, the use of the term \"myth\" to indicate falsehood or non-historicity, and the lack of an agreed-upon definition of \"myth\". As examples of Biblical myths, Every cites the creation account in Genesis 1 and 2 and the story of Eve's temptation.\nChristian tradition contains many stories that do not come from canonical Christian texts yet still illustrate Christian themes. These non-canonical Christian myths include legends, folktales, and elaborations on canonical Christian mythology. Christian tradition has produced a rich body of legends that were never incorporated into the official scriptures. Legends were a staple of medieval literature. Examples include hagiographies such as the stories of Saint George or Saint Valentine. A case in point is the historical and canonized Brendan of Clonfort, a 6th-century Irish churchman and founder of abbeys. Round his authentic figure was woven a tissue that is arguably legendary rather than historical: the \"Navigatio\" or \"Journey of Brendan\". The legend discusses mythic events in the sense of supernatural encounters. In this narrative, Brendan and his shipmates encounter sea monsters, a paradisal island and a floating ice island and a rock island inhabited by a holy hermit: literal-minded devot\u00e9s still seek to identify \"Brendan's islands\" in actual geography. This voyage was recreated by Tim Severin, suggesting that whales, icebergs and Rockall were encountered.\nFolktales form a major part of non-canonical Christian tradition. Folklorists define folktales (in contrast to \"true\" myths) as stories that are considered purely fictitious by their tellers and that often lack a specific setting in space or time. Christian-themed folktales have circulated widely among peasant populations. One widespread folktale genre is that of the Penitent Sinner (classified as Type 756A, B, C, in the Aarne-Thompson index of tale types); another popular group of folktales describe a clever mortal who outwits the Devil. Not all scholars accept the folkloristic convention of applying the terms \"myth\" and \"folktale\" to different categories of traditional narrative.\nChristian tradition produced many popular stories elaborating on canonical scripture. According to an English folk belief, certain herbs gained their current healing power from having been used to heal Christ's wounds on Mount Calvary. In this case, a non-canonical story has a connection to a non-narrative form of folklore \u2014 namely, folk medicine. Arthurian legend contains many elaborations upon canonical mythology. For example, Sir Balin discovers the Lance of Longinus, which had pierced the side of Christ. According to a tradition widely attested in early Christian writings, Adam's skull lay buried at Calvary; when Christ was crucified, his blood fell over Adam's skull, symbolizing humanity's redemption from Adam's sin.\nOther examples.\nExamples of (1) Christian myths not mentioned in canon and (2) literary and traditional elaborations on canonical Christian mythology:\nConnections to other belief systems.\nZoroastrianism.\nSome scholars believe that many elements of Christian mythology, particularly its linear portrayal of time, originated with the Persian religion of Zoroastrianism. Mary Boyce, an authority on Zoroastrianism, writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Zoroaster was thus the first to teach the doctrines of an individual judgment, Heaven and Hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general Last Judgment, and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body. These doctrines were to become familiar articles of faith to much of mankind, through borrowings by Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\nMircea Eliade believes the Hebrews had a sense of linear time before Zoroastrianism influenced them. However, he argues,\n\"a number of other [Jewish] religious ideas were discovered, revalorized, or systematized in Iran\". These ideas include a dualism between good and evil, belief in a future savior and resurrection, and \"an optimistic eschatology, proclaiming the final triumph of Good\".\nThe Zoroastrian concepts of Ahriman, Amesha Spentas, Yazatas, and Daevas probably gave rise to the Christian understanding of Satan, archangels, angels, and demons.\nOther connections.\nIn Buddhist mythology, the demon Mara tries to distract the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, before he can reach enlightenment. Huston Smith, a professor of philosophy and a writer on comparative religion, notes the similarity between Mara's temptation of the Buddha before his ministry and Satan's temptation of Christ before his ministry.\nIn the Book of Revelation, the author sees a vision of a pregnant woman in the sky being pursued by a huge red dragon. The dragon tries to devour her child when she gives birth, but the child is \"caught up to God and his throne\". This appears to be an allegory for the triumph of Christianity: the child presumably represents Christ; the woman may represent God's people of the Old and New Testaments (who produced Christ); and the Dragon symbolizes Satan, who opposes Christ. According to Catholic scholars, the images used in this allegory may have been inspired by pagan mythology:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster; by miraculous intervention, she bore a son who then killed the monster.\nMythical themes and types.\nAcademic studies of mythology often define mythology as deeply valued stories that explain a society's existence and world order: those narratives of a society's creation, the society's origins and foundations, their god(s), their original heroes, mankind's connection to the \"divine\", and their narratives of eschatology (what happens in the \"after-life\"). This is a very general outline of some of the basic sacred stories with those themes.\nCosmogonic myths.\nThe Christian texts use the same creation myth as Jewish mythology as written in the Old Testament. According to the Book of Genesis, the world was created out of a darkness and water in seven days. (Unlike a Jew, a Christian might include the miracle of Jesus' birth as a sort of second cosmogonic event) Canonical Christian scripture incorporates the two Hebrew cosmogonic myths found in Genesis 1:1\u20142:2 and Genesis 2:4\u20143:24.\nGenesis 1:1\u20142:3.\nIn the first text on the creation (Genesis 1:1\u20142:3), the Creator is called \"Elohim\" (commonly translated simply as \"God\"). He creates the universe over a six-day period, creating a new feature each day: first he creates day and night; then he creates the firmament to separate the \"waters above\" from the \"waters below\"; then he separates the dry land from the water; then he creates plants on the land; then he places the Sun, Moon, and stars in the sky; then he creates swimming and flying animals; then he creates land animals; and finally he creates man and woman together, \"in his own image\". On the seventh day, God rests, providing the rationale for the custom of resting on Sabbath.\nGenesis 2:4\u20143:24.\nThe second creation myth in Genesis differs from the first in a number of important elements. Here the Creator is called \"Yahweh elohim\" (commonly translated \"Lord God\" or \"L God\" (with small caps), although Yahweh is in fact the personal name of the God of Israel and does not literally mean \"Lord\").\nThis myth begins with the words, \"When the L God made the earth and the heavens, and no shrub of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not sent rain upon the earth ...\" (Genesis 2:4\u20135 NASB). It then proceeds to describe Yahweh creating a man called Adam out of dust. Yahweh creates the Garden of Eden as a home for Adam, and tells Adam not to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the center of the Garden (next to the Tree of Life).\nYahweh also creates animals, and shows them to man, who names them. Yahweh sees that there is no suitable companion for the man among the beasts, and he subsequently puts Adam to sleep and takes out one of Adam's ribs, creating from it a woman whom Adam names Eve.\nA talking serpent tempts Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and she succumbs, offering the fruit to Adam as well. As a punishment, Yahweh banishes the couple from the Garden and \"placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden the cherubim with a fiery revolving sword to guard the way to the Tree of Life\". The Lord says he must banish humans from the Garden because they have become like him, knowing good and evil (because of eating the forbidden fruit), and now only immortality (which they could get by eating from the Tree of Life) stands between them and godhood:\n\"The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever\" (Genesis 3:22).\nAlthough the text of Genesis does not identify the tempting serpent with Satan, Christian tradition equates the two. This tradition has made its way into non-canonical Christian \"myths\" such as John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\".\nAscending the mountain.\nAccording to Lorena Laura Stookey, many myths feature sacred mountains as \"the sites of revelations\": \"In myth, the ascent of the holy mountain is a spiritual journey, promising purification, insight, wisdom, or knowledge of the sacred\". As examples of this theme, Stookey includes the revelation of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, Christ's ascent of a mountain to deliver his Sermon on the Mount, and Christ's ascension into Heaven from the Mount of Olives.\nAxis mundi.\nMany mythologies involve a \"world center\", which is often the sacred place of creation; this center often takes the form of a tree, mountain, or other upright object, which serves as an \"axis mundi\" or axle of the world. A number of scholars have connected the Christian story of the crucifixion at Golgotha with this theme of a cosmic center. In his \"Creation Myths of the World\", David Leeming argues that, in the Christian story of the crucifixion, the cross serves as \"the \"axis mundi\", the center of a new creation\".\nAccording to a tradition preserved in Eastern Christian folklore, Golgotha was the summit of the cosmic mountain at the center of the world and the location where Adam had been both created and buried. According to this tradition, when Christ is crucified, his blood falls on Adam's skull, buried at the foot of the cross, and redeems him. George Every discusses the connection between the cosmic center and Golgotha in his book \"Christian Mythology\", noting that the image of Adam's skull beneath the cross appears in many medieval representations of the crucifixion.\nIn \"Creation Myths of the World\", Leeming suggests that the Garden of Eden may also be considered a world center.\nCombat myth.\nMany Near Eastern religions include a story about a battle between a divine being and a dragon or other monster representing chaos\u2014a theme found, for example, in the \"Enuma Elish\". A number of scholars call this story the \"combat myth\". A number of scholars have argued that the ancient Israelites incorporated the combat myth into their religious imagery, such as the figures of Leviathan and Rahab, the Song of the Sea, Isaiah 51:9\u201310's description of God's deliverance of his people from Babylon, and the portrayals of enemies such as Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar. The idea of Satan as God's opponent may have developed under the influence of the combat myth. Scholars have also suggested that the Book of Revelation uses combat myth imagery in its descriptions of cosmic conflict.\nDescent to the underworld.\nAccording to David Leeming, writing in \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", the harrowing of hell is an example of the motif of the hero's descent to the underworld, which is common in many mythologies. According to Christian tradition, Christ descended to hell after his death in order to free the souls there; this event is known as the Harrowing of Hell. This story is narrated in the Gospel of Nicodemus and may be the meaning behind 1 Peter 3:18\u201322.\nDying God.\nMany myths, particularly from the Near East, feature a God who dies and is resurrected; this figure is sometimes called the \"dying god\". An important study of this figure is James George Frazer's \"The Golden Bough\", which traces the dying God theme through a large number of myths. The dying God is often associated with fertility. A number of scholars, including Frazer, have suggested that the Christ story is an example of the \"dying God\" theme. In the article \"Dying God\" in \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming notes that Christ can be seen as bringing fertility, though of a spiritual as opposed to physical kind.\nIn his 2006 homily for Corpus Christi, Pope Benedict XVI noted the similarity between the Christian story of the resurrection and pagan myths of dead and resurrected gods: \"In these myths, the soul of the human person, in a certain way, reached out toward that God made man, who, humiliated unto death on a cross, in this way opened the door of life to all of us.\"\nFlood myths.\nMany cultures have myths about a flood that cleanses the world in preparation for rebirth. Such stories appear on every inhabited continent on earth. An example is the biblical story of Noah. In \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming notes that, in the Bible story, as in other flood myths, the flood marks a new beginning and a second chance for creation and humanity.\nFounding myths.\nAccording to Sandra Frankiel, the records of \"Jesus' life and death, his acts and words\" provide the \"founding myths\" of Christianity. Frankiel claims that these founding myths are \"structurally equivalent\" to the creation myths in other religions, because they are \"the pivot around which the religion turns to and which it returns\", establishing the \"meaning\" of the religion and the \"essential Christian practices and attitudes\". Tom Cain uses the expression \"founding myths\" more broadly, to encompass such stories as those of the War in Heaven and the fall of man; according to Cain, \"the disastrous consequences of disobedience\" is a pervasive theme in Christian founding myths.\nChristian mythology of their society's founding would start with Jesus and his many teachings, and include the stories of Christian disciples starting the Christian Church and congregations in the 1st century. This might be considered the stories in the four canonical gospels and the Acts of the Apostles. The heroes of the first Christian society would start with Jesus and those chosen by Jesus, the twelve apostles including Peter, John, James, as well as Paul and Mary (mother of Jesus).\nHero myths.\nIn his influential 1909 work \"The Myth of the Birth of the Hero\", Otto Rank argued that the births of many mythical heroes follow a common pattern. Rank includes the story of Christ's birth as a representative example of this pattern.\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, one pervasive mythical theme associates heroes with the slaying of dragons, a theme which Eliade traces back to \"the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a divine hero and a dragon. He cites the Christian legend of Saint George as an example of this theme. An example from the Late Middle Ages comes from Dieudonn\u00e9 de Gozon, third Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes, famous for slaying the dragon of Malpasso. Eliade writes:\n\"Legend, as was natural, bestowed upon him the attributes of St. George, famed for his victorious fight with the monster. [...] In other words, by the simple fact that he was regarded as a hero, de Gozon was identified with a category, an archetype, which [...] equipped him with a mythical biography from which it was \"impossible\" to omit combat with a reptilian monster.\"\nIn the \"Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming lists Moses, Jesus, and King Arthur as examples of the heroic monomyth, calling the Christ story \"a particularly complete example of the heroic monomyth\". Leeming regards resurrection as a common part of the heroic monomyth, in which the resurrected heroes often become sources of \"material or spiritual food for their people\"; in this connection, Leeming notes that Christians regard Jesus as the \"bread of life\".\nIn terms of values, Leeming contrasts \"the myth of Jesus\" with the myths of other \"Christian heroes such as St. George, Roland, el Cid, and even King Arthur\"; the later hero myths, Leeming argues, reflect the survival of pre-Christian heroic values\u2014\"values of military dominance and cultural differentiation and hegemony\"\u2014more than the values expressed in the Christ story.\nParadise.\nMany religious and mythological systems contain myths about a paradise. Many of these myths involve the loss of a paradise that existed at the beginning of the world. Some scholars have seen in the story of the Garden of Eden an instance of this general motif.\nSacrifice.\nSacrifice is an element in many religious traditions and often represented in myths. In \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming lists the story of Abraham and Isaac and the story of Christ's death as examples of this theme. Wendy Doniger describes the gospel accounts as a \"meta-myth\" in which Jesus realizes that he is part of a \"new myth [...] of a man who is sacrificed in hate\" but \"sees the inner myth, the old myth of origins and acceptance, the myth of a god who sacrifices himself in love\".\nEucharist.\nRelated to the doctrine of transsubstantiation, the Christian practice of eating the flesh and blood of Jesus Christ during the Eucharist is an instance of theophagy.\nTransference of evil.\nThe theological concept of Jesus being born to atone for original sin is central to the Christian narrative. According to Christian theology, by Adam disobeying God in the Garden of Eden, humanity acquired an ingrained flaw that keeps humans in a state of moral imperfection, generally called \"original sin\". According to Paul the Apostle, Adam's sin brought sin and death to all humanity: \"Through one man, sin entered the world, and through sin, death\" (Romans 5:12).\nAccording to the orthodox Christian view, Jesus saved humanity from final death and damnation by dying for them. Most Christians believe that Christ's sacrifice supernaturally reversed death's power over humanity, proved when he was resurrected, and abolished the power of sin on humanity. According to Paul, \"if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many\" (Romans 5:15). For many Christians, atonement doctrine leads naturally into the eschatological narratives of Christian people rising from the dead and living again, or immediately entering heaven to join Jesus.\nAtonement in canonical scripture.\nPaul's theological writings lay out the basic framework of the atonement doctrine in the New Testament. However, Paul's letters contain relatively little mythology (narrative). The majority of narratives in the New Testament are in the Gospels and the Book of Revelation.\nAlthough the Gospel stories do not lay out the atonement doctrine as fully as does Paul, they do have the story of the Last Supper, crucifixion, death and resurrection. Atonement is also suggested in the parables of Jesus in his final days. According to Matthew's gospel, at the Last Supper, Jesus calls his blood \"the blood of the new covenant, which will be poured out for the forgiveness of many\" (Matthew 26:28). John's gospel is especially rich in atonement parables and promises: Jesus speaks of himself as \"the living bread that came down from heaven\"; \"and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world\" (John 6:51); \"Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit\" (John 12:24).\nAtonement in non-canonical literature.\nThe sacrifice and atonement narrative appears explicitly in many non-canonical writings as well. For instance, in Book 3 of Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", the Son of God offers to become a man and die, thereby paying mankind's debt to God the Father.\nThe Harrowing of Hell is a non-canonical myth extrapolated from the atonement doctrine. According to this story, Christ descended into the land of the dead after his crucifixion, rescuing the righteous souls that had been cut off from heaven due to the taint of original sin. The story of the harrowing was popular during the Middle Ages. An Old English poem called \"The Harrowing of Hell\" describes Christ breaking into Hell and rescuing the Old Testament patriarchs. (The Harrowing is not the only explanation that Christians have put forth for the fate of the righteous who died before Christ accomplished the atonement.)\nIn modern literature, atonement continues to be theme. In the first of C. S. Lewis's \"Narnia\" novels, \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\", a boy named Edmund is condemned to death by a White Witch, and the magical lion-king Aslan offers to die in Edmund's place, thereby saving him. Aslan's life is sacrificed on an altar, but returns to life again. Aslan's self-sacrifice for Edmund is often interpreted as an allegory for the story of Christ's sacrifice for humanity; although Lewis denied that the novel is a mere allegory.\nEschatological myths.\nChristian eschatological myths include stories of the afterlife: the narratives of Jesus Christ rising from the dead and now acting as a saviour of all generations of Christians, and stories of heaven and hell. Eschatological myths would also include the prophesies of end of the world and a new millennium in the Book of Revelation, and the story that Jesus will return to earth some day.\nThe major features of Christian eschatological mythology include afterlife beliefs, the Second Coming, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment.\nImmediate afterlife (heaven and hell).\nMost Christian denominations hold some belief in an immediate afterlife when people die. Christian scripture gives a few descriptions of an immediate afterlife and a heaven and hell; however, for the most part, both New and Old Testaments focus much more on the myth of a final bodily resurrection than any beliefs about a purely spiritual afterlife away from the body.\nMuch of the Old Testament does not express a belief in a personal afterlife of reward or punishment:\"All the dead go down to Sheol, and there they lie in sleep together\u2013whether good or evil, rich or poor, slave or free (Job 3:11\u201319). It is described as a region \"dark and deep,\" \"the Pit,\" and \"the land of forgetfulness,\" cut off from both God and human life above (Psalms 6:5; 88:3\u201312). Though in some texts Yahweh's power can reach down to Sheol (Psalms 139:8), the dominant idea is that the dead are abandoned forever. This idea of Sheol is negative in contrast to the world of life and light above, but there is no idea of judgment or of reward and punishment.\"\nLater Old Testament writings, particularly the works of the Hebrew prophets, describe a final resurrection of the dead, often accompanied by spiritual rewards and punishments:\"Many who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake. Some shall live forever; others shall be in everlasting contempt. But the wise shall shine brightly like the splendor of the firmament, and those who lead the many to justice shall be like the stars forever\" (Daniel 12:2).\nHowever, even here, the emphasis is not on an immediate afterlife in heaven or hell, but rather on a future bodily resurrection.\nThe New Testament also devotes little attention to an immediate afterlife. Its primary focus is the resurrection of the dead. Some New Testament passages seem to mention the (non-resurrected) dead experiencing some sort of afterlife (for example, the parable of rich man and Lazarus); yet the New Testament includes only a few myths about heaven and hell. Specifically, heaven is a place of peaceful residence, where Jesus goes to \"prepare a home\" or room for his disciples (John 14:2). Drawing on scriptural imagery (John 10:7, John 10:11\u201314), many Christian narratives of heaven include a nice green pasture land and a meeting with a benevolent God. Some of the earliest Christian art depicts heaven as a green pasture where people are sheep led by Jesus as \"the good shepherd\" as in interpretation of heaven.\nAs the doctrines of heaven and hell (and also Catholic purgatory) developed, non-canonical Christian literature began to develop an elaborate mythology about these locations. Dante's three-part \"Divine Comedy\" is a prime example of such afterlife mythology, describing Hell (in \"Inferno\"), Purgatory (in \"Purgatorio\"), and Heaven (in \"Paradiso\"). Nowadays, conceptualizations of hell differ quite widely across various denominations.\nSecond Coming.\nThe Second Coming of Christ holds a central place in Christian mythology. The Second Coming is the return of Christ to Earth during the period of transformation preceding the end of this world and the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. According to Matthew's gospel, when Jesus is on trial before the Roman and Jewish authorities, he claims, \"In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.\" The legend of the Wandering Jew concerns a Jew who taunted Jesus on the way to the Crucifixion and was then cursed to walk the earth until the Second Coming.\nResurrection and final judgment.\nChristian mythology incorporates the Old Testament's prophecies of a future resurrection of the dead. Like the Hebrew prophet Daniel (e.g., Daniel 12:2), the Christian Book of Revelation (among other New Testament scriptures) describes the resurrection: \"The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them; and they were judged, every one of them according to their deeds.\" The righteous and/or faithful enjoy bliss in the earthly Kingdom of Heaven, but the evil and/or non-Christian are \"cast into the lake of fire\".\nThe Kingdom of Heaven on Earth.\nChristian eschatological myths feature a total world renovation after the final judgment. According to the Book of Revelation, God \"will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or mourning, wailing or pain, for the old order has passed away\". According to Old and New Testament passages, a time of perfect peace and happiness is coming: \"They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. One nation will not raise the sword against another; nor will they train for war again.\" Certain scriptural passages even suggest that God will abolish the current natural laws in favor of immortality and total peace:\nMillennialism and amillennialism.\nWhen Christianity was a new and persecuted religion, many Christians believed the end times were imminent. Scholars debate whether Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher; however, his early followers, \"the group of Jews who accepted him as messiah in the years immediately after his death, understood him in primarily apocalyptic terms\". Prevalent in the early church and especially during periods of persecution, this Christian belief in an imminent end is called \"millennialism\". (It takes its name from the thousand-year (\"millennial\") reign of Christ that, according to the Book of Revelation, will precede the final world renovation; similar beliefs in a coming paradise are found in other religions, and these phenomena are often also called \"millennialism\")\nMillennialism comforted Christians during times of persecution, for it predicted an imminent deliverance from suffering. From the perspective of millennialism, human action has little significance: millennialism is comforting precisely because it predicts that happiness is coming no matter what humans do: \"The seeming triumph of Evil made up the apocalyptic syndrome which was to precede Christ's return and the millennium.\"\nHowever, as time went on, millennialism lost its appeal. Christ had not returned immediately, as earlier Christians had predicted. Moreover, many Christians no longer needed the comfort that millennialism provided, for they were no longer persecuted: \"With the triumph of the Church, the Kingdom of Heaven was already present on earth, and in a certain sense the old world had already been destroyed.\" (Millennialism has revived during periods of historical stress, and is currently popular among Evangelical Christians.)\nIn the Roman Church's condemnation of millennialism, Eliade sees \"the first manifestation of the doctrine of [human] progress\" in Christianity. According to the amillennial view, Christ will indeed come again, ushering in a perfect Kingdom of Heaven on earth, but \"the Kingdom of God is [already] present in the world today through the presence of the heavenly reign of Christ, the Bible, the Holy Spirit and Christianity\". Amillennialists do not feel \"the eschatological tension\" that persecution inspires; therefore, they interpret their eschatological myths either figuratively or as descriptions of far-off events rather than imminent ones. Thus, after taking the amillennial position, the Church not only waited for God to renovate the world (as millennialists had) but also believed itself to be improving the world through human action.\nWitches.\nIn the early modern period, distinguished Christian theologians developed elaborated witch mythologies which contributed to the intensification of witch hunts. Major works in Christian demonology, such as Malleus Maleficarum, were dedicated to the implementation of Exodus 22:18 of the Old Testament: \"You shall not permit a sorceress to live.\" The concept of Witches' Sabbath was well articulated by the 17th century. Theologian Martin Delrio was one of the first to provide a vivid description in his influential \"Disquisitiones magicae\":\nThere, on most occasions, once a foul, disgusting fire has been lit, an evil spirit sits on a throne as president of the assembly. His appearance is terrifying, almost always that of a male goat or a dog. The witches come forward to worship him in different ways. Sometimes they supplicate him on bended knee; sometimes they stand with their back turned to him. They offer candles made of pitch or a child's umbilical cord, and kiss him on the anal orifice as a sign of homage. Sometimes they imitate the sacrifice of the Mass (the greatest of all their crimes), as well as purifying with water and similar Catholic ceremonies. After the feast, each evil spirit takes by the hand the disciple of whom he has charge, and so that they may do everything with the most absurd kind of ritual, each person bends over backwards, joins hands in a circle, and tosses his head as frenzied fanatics do. Then they begin to dance. They sing very obscene songs in his [Satan's] honour. They behave ridiculously in every way, and in every way contrary to accepted custom. Then their demon-lovers copulate with them in the most repulsive fashion.\nLegend and folklore.\nLegendary creatures.\nNumerous legendary creatures are attested in Christian mythology. These include the Behemoth, Leviathan, Angels, Demons, Nephilim, Re'em, Ziz and dragons.\nAttitudes toward time.\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, many traditional societies have a cyclic sense of time, periodically reenacting mythical events. Through this reenactment, these societies achieve an \"eternal return\" to the mythical age. According to Eliade, Christianity retains a sense of cyclical time, through the ritual commemoration of Christ's life and the imitation of Christ's actions; Eliade calls this sense of cyclical time a \"mythical aspect\" of Christianity.\nHowever, Judeo-Christian thought also makes an \"innovation of the first importance\", Eliade says, because it embraces the notion of linear, historical time; in Christianity, \"time is no longer [only] the circular Time of the Eternal Return; it has become linear and irreversible Time\". Summarizing Eliade's statements on this subject, Eric Rust writes, \"A new religious structure became available. In the Judaeo-Christian religions \u2014 Judaism, Christianity, Islam \u2014 history is taken seriously, and linear time is accepted. [...] The Christian myth gives such time a beginning in creation, a center in the Christ-event, and an end in the final consummation.\"\nIn contrast, the myths of many traditional cultures present a cyclic or static view of time. In these cultures, all the \"[important] history is limited to a few events that took place in the mythical times\". In other words, these cultures place events into two categories, the mythical age and the present, between which there is no continuity. Everything in the present is seen as a direct result of the mythical age:\n\"Just as modern man considers himself to be constituted by [all of] History, the man of the archaic societies declares that he is the result of [only] a certain number of mythical events.\"\nBecause of this view, Eliade argues, members of many traditional societies see their lives as a constant repetition of mythical events, an \"eternal return\" to the mythical age: \"In \"imitating\" the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythical hero, or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time.\"\nAccording to Eliade, Christianity shares in this cyclic sense of time to an extent. \"By the very fact that it is a religion\", he argues, Christianity retains at least one \"mythical aspect\" \u2014 the repetition of mythical events through ritual. Eliade gives a typical church service as an example:\"Just as a church constitutes a break in plane in the profane space of a modern city, [so] the service celebrated inside [the church] marks a break in profane temporal duration. It is no longer today's historical time that is present \u2014 the time that is experienced, for example, in the adjacent streets \u2014 but the time in which the historical existence of Jesus Christ occurred, the time sanctified by his preaching, by his passion, death, and resurrection.\"\nHeinrich Zimmer also notes Christianity's emphasis on linear time; he attributes this emphasis specifically to the influence of Augustine of Hippo's theory of history. Zimmer does not explicitly describe the cyclical conception of time as itself \"mythical\" per se, although he notes that this conception \"underl[ies] Hindu mythology\".\nNeil Forsyth writes that \"what distinguishes both Jewish and Christian religious systems [...] is that they elevate to the sacred status of myth narratives that are situated in historical time\".\nLegacy.\nConcepts of progress.\nAccording to Carl Mitcham, \"the Christian mythology of progress toward transcendent salvation\" created the conditions for modern ideas of scientific and technological progress. Hayden White describes \"the myth of Progress\" as the \"secular, Enlightenment counterpart\" of \"Christian myth\". Reinhold Niebuhr described the modern idea of ethical and scientific progress as \"really a rationalized version of the Christian myth of salvation\".\nAccording to Irwin, from the perspective of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), \"history is a tale of progress\". Christianity inherited the Hebrew sense of history through the Old Testament. Thus, although most Christians believe that human nature is inherently \"fallen\" (see original sin) and cannot become perfected without divine grace, they do believe that the world can and will change for the better, either through human and divine action or through divine action alone.\nPolitical and philosophical ideas.\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the medieval \"Gioacchinian myth [...] of universal renovation in a more or less imminent future\" has influenced a number of modern theories of history, such as those of Lessing (who explicitly compares his views to those of medieval \"enthusiasts\"), Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling; and has also influenced a number of Russian writers.\nCalling Marxism \"a truly messianic Judaeo-Christian ideology\", Eliade writes that Marxism \"takes up and carries on one of the great eschatological myths of the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean world, namely: the redemptive part to be played by the Just (the 'elect', the 'anointed', the 'innocent', the 'missioners', in our own days the proletariat), whose sufferings are invoked to change the ontological status of the world\".\nIn his article \"The Christian Mythology of Socialism\", Will Herberg argues that socialism inherits the structure of its ideology from the influence of Christian mythology upon western thought.\nIn \"The Oxford Companion to World Mythology\", David Leeming claims that Judeo-Christian messianic ideas have influenced 20th-century totalitarian systems, citing the state ideology of the Soviet Union as an example.\nAccording to Hugh S. Pyper, the biblical \"founding myths of the Exodus and the exile, read as stories in which a nation is forged by maintaining its ideological and racial purity in the face of an oppressive great power\", entered \"the rhetoric of nationalism throughout European history\", especially in Protestant countries and smaller nations.\nChristmas stories in popular culture.\nChristmas stories have become prevalent in Western literature and culture.\nThe Bible.\nOld Testament.\nMythic patterns such as the primordial struggle between good and evil appear in passages throughout the Hebrew Bible, including passages that describe historical events. A distinctive characteristic of the Hebrew Bible is the reinterpretation of myth on the basis of history, as in the Book of Daniel, a record of the experience of the Jews of the Second Temple period under foreign rule, presented as a prophecy of future events and expressed in terms of \"mythic structures\" with \"the Hellenistic kingdom figured as a terrifying monster that cannot but recall [the Near Eastern pagan myth of] the dragon of chaos\".\nMircea Eliade argues that the imagery used in some parts of the Hebrew Bible reflects a \"transfiguration of history into myth\". For example, Eliade says, the portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar as a dragon in Jeremiah 51:34 is a case in which the Hebrews \"interpreted contemporary events by means of the very ancient cosmogonico-heroic myth\" of a battle between a hero and a dragon.\nAccording to scholars including Neil Forsyth and John L. McKenzie, the Old Testament incorporates stories, or fragments of stories, from extra-biblical mythology. According to the New American Bible, a Catholic Bible translation produced by the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, the story of the Nephilim in Genesis 6:1\u20134 \"is apparently a fragment of an old legend that had borrowed much from ancient mythology\", and the \"sons of God\" mentioned in that passage are \"celestial beings of mythology\". The New American Bible also says that Psalm 93 alludes to \"an ancient myth\" in which God battles a personified Sea. Some scholars have identified the biblical creature Leviathan as a monster from Canaanite mythology. According to Howard Schwartz, \"the myth of the fall of Lucifer\" existed in fragmentary form in Isaiah 14:12 and other ancient Jewish literature; Schwartz claims that the myth originated from \"the ancient Canaanite myth of Athtar, who attempted to rule the throne of Ba'al, but was forced to descend and rule the underworld instead\".\nSome scholars have argued that the calm, orderly, monotheistic creation story in Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a reaction against the creation myths of other Near Eastern cultures. In connection with this interpretation, David and Margaret Leeming describe Genesis 1 as a \"demythologized myth\", and John L. McKenzie asserts that the writer of Genesis 1 has \"excised the mythical elements\" from his creation story.\nPerhaps the most famous topic in the Bible that could possibly be connected with mythical origins is the topic of Heaven (or the sky) as the place where God (or angels, or the saints) resides, with stories such as the ascension of Elijah (who disappeared in the sky), war of man with an angel, flying angels. Even in the New Testament Paul the Apostle is said to \"have visited the third heaven\", and Jesus was portrayed in several books as going to return from Heaven on a cloud, in the same way he ascended thereto. The official text repeated by the attendees during Roman Catholic mass (the Apostles' Creed) contains the words \"He ascended into Heaven, and is Seated at the Right Hand of God, The Father. From thence He will come again to judge the living and the dead\".\nNew Testament and early Christianity.\nAccording to a number of scholars, the Christ story contains mythical themes such as descent to the underworld, the heroic monomyth, and the \"dying god\" (see section above on \"mythical themes and types\").\nSome scholars have argued that the Book of Revelation incorporates imagery from ancient mythology. According to the New American Bible, the image in Revelation 12:1\u20136 of a pregnant woman in the sky, threatened by a dragon, \"corresponds to a widespread myth throughout the ancient world that a goddess pregnant with a savior was pursued by a horrible monster; by miraculous intervention, she bore a son who then killed the monster\". Bernard McGinn suggests that the image of the two Beasts in Revelation stems from a \"mythological background\" involving the figures of Leviathan and Behemoth.\nThe Pastoral Epistles contain denunciations of \"myths\" (\"muthoi\"). This may indicate that Rabbinic or Gnostic mythology was popular among the early Christians to whom the epistles were written and that the epistles' author was attempting to resist that mythology.\nThe Sibylline oracles contain predictions that the dead Roman Emperor Nero, infamous for his persecutions, would return one day as an Antichrist-like figure. According to Bernard McGinn, these parts of the oracles were probably written by a Christian and incorporated \"mythological language\" in describing Nero's return.\nHistorical development.\nFrom Roman Empire to Europe.\nAfter Christian theology was accepted by the Roman Empire, promoted by St. Augustine in the 5th century, Christian mythology began to predominate the Roman Empire. Later the theology was carried north by Charlemagne and the Frankish people, and Christian themes began to weave into the framework of European mythologies. The pre-Christian Germanic and Celtic mythology that were native to the tribes of Northern Europe were denounced and submerged, while saint myths, Mary stories, Crusade myths, and other Christian myths took their place. However, pre-Christian myths never went entirely away, they mingled with the (Roman Catholic) Christian framework to form new stories, like myths of the mythological kings and saints and miracles, for example (Eliade 1963:162\u2013181). Stories such as that of Beowulf and Icelandic, Norse, and Germanic sagas were reinterpreted somewhat, and given Christian meanings. The legend of King Arthur and the quest for the Holy Grail is a striking example. The thrust of incorporation took on one of two directions. When Christianity was on the advance, pagan myths were Christianized; when it was in retreat, Bible stories and Christian saints lost their mythological importance to the culture.\nMiddle Ages.\nAccording to Mircea Eliade, the Middle Ages witnessed \"an upwelling of mythical thought\" in which each social group had its own \"mythological traditions\". Often a profession had its own \"origin myth\" which established models for members of the profession to imitate; for example, the knights tried to imitate Lancelot or Parsifal. The medieval trouveres developed a \"mythology of woman and Love\" which incorporated Christian elements but, in some cases, ran contrary to official church teaching.\nGeorge Every includes a discussion of medieval legends in his book \"Christian Mythology\". Some medieval legends elaborated upon the lives of Christian figures such as Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the saints. For example, a number of legends describe miraculous events surrounding Mary's birth and her marriage to Joseph.\nIn many cases, medieval mythology appears to have inherited elements from myths of pagan gods and heroes. According to Every, one example may be \"the myth of St. George\" and other stories about saints battling dragons, which were \"modelled no doubt in many cases on older representations of the creator and preserver of the world in combat with chaos\". Eliade notes that some \"mythological traditions\" of medieval knights, namely the Arthurian cycle and the Grail theme, combine a veneer of Christianity with traditions regarding the Celtic Otherworld. According to Lorena Laura Stookey, \"many scholars\" see a link between stories in \"Irish-Celtic mythology\" about journeys to the Otherworld in search of a cauldron of rejuvenation and medieval accounts of the quest for the Holy Grail.\nAccording to Eliade, \"eschatological myths\" became prominent during the Middle Ages during \"certain historical movements\". These eschatological myths appeared \"in the Crusades, in the movements of a Tanchelm and an Eudes de l'Etoile, in the elevation of Fredrick II to the rank of Messiah, and in many other collective messianic, utopian, and prerevolutionary phenomena\". One significant eschatological myth, introduced by Gioacchino da Fiore's theology of history, was the \"myth of an imminent third age that will renew and complete history\" in a \"reign of the Holy Spirit\"; this \"Gioacchinian myth\" influenced a number of messianic movements that arose in the late Middle Ages.\nRenaissance and Reformation.\nDuring the Renaissance, there arose a critical attitude that sharply distinguished between apostolic tradition and what George Every calls \"subsidiary mythology\"\u2014popular legends surrounding saints, relics, the cross, etc.\u2014suppressing the latter.\nThe works of Renaissance writers often included and expanded upon Christian and non-Christian stories such as those of creation and the Fall. Rita Oleyar describes these writers as \"on the whole, reverent and faithful to the primal myths, but filled with their own insights into the nature of God, man, and the universe\". An example is John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", an \"epic elaboration of the Judeo-Christian mythology\" and also a \"veritable encyclopedia of myths from the Greek and Roman tradition\".\nAccording to Cynthia Stewart, during the Reformation, the Protestant reformers used \"the founding myths of Christianity\" to critique the church of their time.\nEvery argues that \"the disparagement of myth in our own civilization\" stems partly from objections to perceived idolatry, objections which intensified in the Reformation, both among Protestants and among Catholics reacting against the classical mythology revived during the Renaissance.\nEnlightenment.\nThe philosophes of the Enlightenment used criticism of myth as a vehicle for veiled criticisms of the Bible and the church. According to Bruce Lincoln, the philosophes \"made irrationality the hallmark of myth and constituted philosophy\u2014rather than the Christian \"kerygma\"\u2014as the antidote for mythic discourse. By implication, Christianity could appear as a more recent, powerful, and dangerous instance of irrational myth\".\nSince the end of the 18th century, the biblical stories have lost some of their mythological basis to western society, owing to the scepticism of the Enlightenment, 19th-century freethinking, and 20th century modernism. Most westerners no longer found Christianity to be their primary imaginative and mythological framework by which they understand the world. However other scholars believe mythology is in our psyche, and that mythical influences of Christianity are in many of our ideals, for example the Judeo-Christian idea of an after-life and heaven. The book \"\" by Tom Beaudoin explores the premise that Christian mythology is present in the mythologies of pop-culture, such as Madonna's \"Like a Prayer\" or Soundgarden's \"Black Hole Sun.\" Modern myths are strong in comic book stories (as stories of culture heroes) and detective novels as myths of good versus evil.\nModern period.\nSome commentators have categorized a number of modern fantasy works as \"Christian myth\" or \"Christian mythopoeia\". Examples include the fiction of C. S. Lewis, Madeleine L'Engle, J.R.R. Tolkien, and George MacDonald.\nIn \"The Eternal Adam and the New World Garden\", written in 1968, David W. Noble argued that the Adam figure had been \"the central myth in the American novel since 1830\". As examples, he cites the works of Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Twain, Hemingway, and Faulkner.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7485", "revid": "11096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7485", "title": "Corporation", "text": "Legal entity incorporated through a legislative or registration process\nA corporation or body corporate is an individual or a group of people, such as an association or company, that has been authorized by the state to act as a single entity (a legal entity recognized by private and public law as \"born out of statute\"; a legal person in a legal context) and recognized as such in law for certain purposes. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e., by an \"ad hoc\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered based on two aspects: whether they can issue stock, or whether they are formed to make a profit. Depending on the number of owners, a corporation can be classified as \"aggregate\" (the subject of this article) or \"sole\" (a legal entity consisting of a single incorporated office occupied by a single natural person).\nRegistered corporations have a legal personality recognized by local authorities and their shares are owned by shareholders, whose liability is generally limited to their investment. One of the attractive early advantages corporations offered to their investors, compared to earlier business entities like sole proprietorships and joint partnerships, was limited liability. Limited liability separates control of a company from ownership and means that a passive shareholder in a corporation will not be personally liable either for contractually agreed obligations of the corporation, or for torts (involuntary harms) committed by the corporation against a third party (acts done by the controllers of the corporation).\nWhere local law distinguishes corporations by their ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as \"stock corporations\"; one type of investment in the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as \"stockholders\" or \"shareholders\". Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as \"non-stock corporations\"; i.e. those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a \"member\" of the corporation. Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for-profit are referred to as \"for-profit\" and \"not-for-profit\" corporations, respectively.\nShareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a board of directors to control the corporation in a fiduciary capacity. In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation. Countries with co-determination employ the practice of workers of an enterprise having the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company.\nHistory.\nThe word \"corporation\" derives from \"corpus\", the Latin word for body, or a \"body of people\". By the time of Justinian (reigned 527\u2013565), Roman law recognized a range of corporate entities under the names \"Universitas\", \"corpus\" or \"collegium\". Following the passage of the \"Lex Julia\" during the reign of Julius Caesar as Consul and Dictator of the Roman Republic (49\u201344 BC), and their reaffirmation during the reign of Caesar Augustus as \"Princeps senatus\" and Imperator of the Roman Army (27 BC\u201314 AD), \"collegia\" required the approval of the Roman Senate or the Emperor in order to be authorized as legal bodies. These included the state itself (the \"Populus Romanus\"), municipalities, and such private associations as sponsors of a religious cult, burial clubs, political groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives. Private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the emperor.\nThe concept of the corporation was revived in the Middle Ages with the recovery and annotation of Justinian's by the glossators and their successors the commentators in the 11th\u201314th centuries. Particularly important in this respect were the Italian jurists Bartolus de Saxoferrato and Baldus de Ubaldis, the latter of whom connected the corporation to the metaphor of the body politic to describe the state.\nEarly entities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal rights included the collegium of ancient Rome and the \"sreni\" of the Maurya Empire in ancient India. In medieval Europe, churches became incorporated, as did local governments, such as the City of London Corporation. The point was that the incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member, existing in perpetuity. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world, the Stora Kopparberg mining community in Falun, Sweden, obtained a charter from King Magnus Eriksson in 1347.\nIn medieval Europe, traders would do business through common law constructs, such as partnerships. Whenever people acted together with a view to profit, the law deemed that a partnership arose. Early guilds and livery companies were also often involved in the regulation of competition between traders.\nMercantilism.\nDutch and English chartered companies, such as the Dutch East India Company (also known by its Dutch initials: VOC) and the Hudson's Bay Company, were created to lead the colonial ventures of European nations in the 17th century. Acting under a charter sanctioned by the Dutch government, the Dutch East India Company defeated Portuguese forces and established itself in the Moluccan Islands in order to profit from the European demand for spices. Investors in the VOC were issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership, and were able to trade their shares on the original Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Shareholders were also explicitly granted limited liability in the company's royal charter.\nIn England, the government created corporations under a royal charter or an Act of Parliament with the grant of a monopoly over a specified territory. The best-known example, established in 1600, was the East India Company of London. Queen Elizabeth I granted it the exclusive right to trade with all countries to the east of the Cape of Good Hope. Some corporations at this time would act on the government's behalf, bringing in revenue from its exploits abroad. Subsequently, the company became increasingly integrated with English and later British military and colonial policy, just as most corporations were essentially dependent on the Royal Navy's ability to control trade routes.\nLabeled by both contemporaries and historians as \"the grandest society of merchants in the universe\", the English East India Company would come to symbolize the dazzlingly rich potential of the corporation, as well as new methods of business that could be both brutal and exploitative. On 31 December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I granted the company a 15-year monopoly on trade to and from the East Indies and Africa. By 1711, shareholders in the East India Company were earning a return on their investment of almost 150 per cent. Subsequent stock offerings demonstrated just how lucrative the company had become. Its first stock offering in 1713\u20131716 raised \u00a3418,000, and its second in 1717\u20131722 raised \u00a31.6\u00a0million.\nA similar chartered company, the South Sea Company, was established in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the Treaty of Utrecht, signed in 1713 as a settlement following the War of the Spanish Succession, which gave Great Britain an \"asiento\" to trade in the region for thirty years. In fact, the Spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter. Unaware of the problems, investors in Britain, enticed by extravagant promises of profit from company promoters, bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the public debt of the British government. This accelerated the inflation of the share price further, as did the Bubble Act 1720, which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a royal charter. The share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price, which in turn led to higher share prices. This was the first speculative bubble the country had seen, but by the end of 1720, the bubble had \"burst\", and the share price sank from \u00a31,000 to under \u00a3100. As bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society, the mood against corporations and errant directors was bitter.\nIn the late 18th century, Stewart Kyd, the author of the first treatise on corporate law in English, defined a corporation as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a collection of many individuals united into one body, under a special denomination, having perpetual succession under an artificial form, and vested, by the policy of the law, with the capacity of acting, in several respects, as an individual, particularly of taking and granting property, of contracting obligations, and of suing and being sued, of enjoying privileges and immunities in common, and of exercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive, according to the design of its institution, or the powers conferred upon it, either at the time of its creation or at any subsequent period of its existence.\u2014\u200a\nDevelopment of modern company law.\nDue to the late 18th century abandonment of mercantilist economic theory and the rise of classical liberalism and laissez-faire economic theory due to a revolution in economics led by Adam Smith and other economists, corporations transitioned from being government or guild affiliated entities to being public and private economic entities free of governmental directions. Smith wrote in his 1776 work \"The Wealth of Nations\" that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship, because people in charge of others' money would not exercise as much care as they would with their own.\nDeregulation.\nThe British Bubble Act 1720's prohibition on establishing companies remained in force until its repeal in 1825. By this point, the Industrial Revolution had gathered pace, pressing for legal change to facilitate business activity. The repeal was the beginning of a gradual lifting on restrictions, though business ventures (such as those chronicled by Charles Dickens in \"Martin Chuzzlewit\") under primitive companies legislation were often scams. Without cohesive regulation, proverbial operations like the \"Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company\" were undercapitalized ventures promising no hope of success except for richly paid promoters.\nThe process of incorporation was possible only through a royal charter or a private act and was limited, owing to Parliament's jealous protection of the privileges and advantages thereby granted. As a result, many businesses came to be operated as unincorporated associations with possibly thousands of members. Any consequent litigation had to be carried out in the joint names of all the members and was almost impossibly cumbersome. Though Parliament would sometimes grant a private act to allow an individual to represent the whole in legal proceedings, this was a narrow and necessarily costly expedient, allowed only to established companies.\nThen, in 1843, William Gladstone became the chairman of a Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies, which led to the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, regarded as the first modern piece of company law. The Act created the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies, empowered to register companies by a two-stage process. The first, provisional, stage cost \u00a35 and did not confer corporate status, which arose after completing the second stage for another \u00a35. For the first time in history, it was possible for ordinary people through a simple registration procedure to incorporate. The advantage of establishing a company as a separate legal person was mainly administrative, as a unified entity under which the rights and duties of all investors and managers could be channeled.\nLimited liability.\nHowever, there was still no limited liability and company members could still be held responsible for unlimited losses by the company. The next, crucial development, then, was the Limited Liability Act 1855, passed at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Robert Lowe. This allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company \u2013 shareholders were still liable directly to creditors, but just for the unpaid portion of their shares. (The principle that shareholders are liable to the corporation had been introduced in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844.)\nThe 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). Insurance companies were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the Companies Act 1862.\nThis prompted the English periodical \"The Economist\" to write in 1855 that \"never, perhaps, was a change so vehemently and generally demanded, of which the importance was so much overrated.\" The major error of this judgment was recognised by the same magazine more than 70 years later, when it claimed that, \"[t]he economic historian of the future... may be inclined to assign to the nameless inventor of the principle of limited liability, as applied to trade corporations, a place of honour with Watt and Stephenson, and other pioneers of the Industrial Revolution. \"\nThese two features \u2013 a simple registration procedure and limited liability \u2013 were subsequently codified into the landmark 1856 Joint Stock Companies Act. This was subsequently consolidated with a number of other statutes in the Companies Act 1862, which remained in force for the rest of the century, up to and including the time of the decision in \"Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd\".\nThe legislation quickly led to a railway boom, resulting in a surge in the formation of companies. However, in the later nineteenth century, a period of depression set in, causing many of these companies to collapse and become insolvent. Strong academic, legislative, and judicial opinions emerged, opposing the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses.\nFurther developments.\nIn 1892, Germany introduced the with a separate legal personality and limited liability even if all the shares of the company were held by only one person. This inspired other countries to introduce corporations of this kind.\nThe last significant development in the history of companies was the 1897 decision of the House of Lords in \"Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.,\" where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.\nIn the United States, forming a corporation usually required an act of legislation until the late 19th century. Many private firms, such as Carnegie's steel company and Rockefeller's Standard Oil, avoided the corporate model for this reason (as a trust). State governments began to adopt more permissive corporate laws from the early 19th century, although these were all restrictive in design, often with the intention of preventing corporations from gaining too much wealth and power.\nIn 1896, New Jersey was the first state to adopt an \"enabling\" corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state. In 1899, Delaware followed New Jersey's lead by enacting an enabling corporate statute. However, Delaware only emerged as the leading corporate state after the enabling provisions of the 1896 New Jersey corporate law were repealed in 1913.\nThe end of the 19th century saw the emergence of holding companies and corporate mergers creating larger corporations with dispersed shareholders. Countries began enacting antitrust laws to prevent anti-competitive practices and corporations were granted more legal rights and protections. The 20th century witnessed a proliferation of laws allowing for the creation of corporations through registration worldwide. These laws played a significant role in driving economic booms in many countries both before and after World War I. Another major post World War I shift was toward the development of conglomerates, in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base.\nStarting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations began moving toward privatization, which involved selling publicly owned (or 'nationalized') services and enterprises to corporations. Deregulation aimed at reducing the regulation of corporate activity, often accompanied privatization as part of a laissez-faire policy.\nOwnership and control.\nA corporation is, at least in theory, owned and controlled by its members. In a joint-stock company, the members are known as shareholders, and each of their shares in the ownership, control, and profits of the corporation is determined by the portion of shares in the company that they own. Thus, a person who owns a quarter of the shares of a joint-stock company owns a quarter of the company, is entitled to a quarter of the profit (or at least a quarter of the profit given to shareholders as dividends) and has a quarter of the votes capable of being cast at general meetings.\nIn another kind of corporation, the legal document which established the corporation or which contains its current rules will determine the requirements for membership in the corporation. What these requirements are depends on the kind of corporation involved. In a worker cooperative, the members are people who work for the cooperative. In a credit union, the members are people who have accounts with the credit union.\nThe day-to-day activities of a corporation are typically controlled by individuals appointed by the members. In some cases, this will be a single individual but more commonly corporations are controlled by a committee or by committees. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of committee structure.\nIn countries with co-determination (such as in Germany), workers elect a fixed fraction of the corporation's board.\nFormation.\nHistorically, corporations were created by a charter granted by the government. As explained above, such charters were often enacted as private bills.\nToday, a corporation is formed, or incorporated, by registering with the state, province, or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government. Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability. The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address, as well as a registered agent (a person or company designated to receive legal service of process). It may also be required to designate an agent or other legal representatives of the corporation.\nGenerally, a corporation files articles of incorporation with the government, laying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is authorized to issue, and the names and addresses of directors. Once the articles are approved, the corporation's directors meet to create bylaws that govern the internal functions of the corporation, such as meeting procedures and officer positions.\nIn theory, a corporation cannot own its own stock. An exception is treasury stock, where the company essentially buys back stock from its shareholders, which reduces its outstanding shares. This essentially becomes the equivalent of unissued capital, where it is not classified as an asset on the balance sheet (passive capital).\nUnder the internal affairs doctrine, the law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation is incorporated will govern its internal activities\u2014that is, conflicts between shareholders and managers such as the board of directors and corporate officers. If a corporation operates outside its home state, it is usually required to register with other governments as a foreign corporation and must formally appoint a registered agent to accept service of process within such other jurisdictions. A foreign corporation is almost always subject to the laws of its host state pertaining to external affairs such as employment, crimes, contracts, civil actions, and the like.\nNaming.\nCorporations generally have a distinct name. Historically, some corporations were named after the members of their boards of directors: for example, the \"President and Fellows of Harvard College\" is the name of one of the two governing boards of Harvard University, but it is also the exact name under which Harvard was legally incorporated. Nowadays, corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to the members of their boards. In Canada, this possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for example, \"12345678 Ontario Limited\"), which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates.\nIn most countries, corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example, \"Incorporated\" or \"Inc.\" in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for example, \"Limited\", \"Ltd.\", or \"LLC\"). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language. In some jurisdictions, they are mandatory, and in others, such as California, they are not. Their use puts everybody on constructive notice that they are dealing with an entity whose liability is limited: one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it.\nCorporate names are supposed to be unique to the jurisdiction in which the corporation is registered. Governments will not allow another corporation or any other kind of legal entity to register a name that is too similar to the name of an existing corporation. However, since \"different states may register entities with the same names, a corporate name is a unique identifier only when combined with the name of the state of incorporation\". This explains why lawyers in legal papers often expressly refer to a corporation's state of incorporation after the first mention of its name.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word \"company\" alone to denote corporate status, since the word \"company\" may refer to a partnership or some other form of collective ownership (in the United States it can be used by a sole proprietorship but this is not generally the case elsewhere).\nPersonhood.\nDespite not being human beings, corporations have been ruled legal persons in a few countries, and have many of the same rights as natural persons do. For example, a corporation can own property, and can sue or be sued for as long as it exists. Corporations can exercise human rights against real individuals and the state, and they can themselves be responsible for human rights violations. Corporations can be \"dissolved\" either by statutory operation, the order of the court, or voluntary action on the part of shareholders. Insolvency may result in a form of corporate failure, when creditors force the liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court order, but it most often results in a restructuring of corporate holdings. Corporations can even be convicted of special criminal offenses in the UK, such as fraud and corporate manslaughter. However, corporations are not considered living entities in the way that humans are.\nLegal scholars and others, such as Joel Bakan, have observed that a business corporation created as a \"legal person\" has a psychopathic personality because it is required to elevate its own interests above those of others even when this inflicts major risks and grave harms on the public or on other third-parties. Such critics note that the legal mandate of the corporation to focus exclusively on corporate profits and self-interest often victimizes employees, customers, the public at large, and/or the natural resources. The political theorist David Runciman notes that corporate personhood forms a fundamental part of the 21st century conception of the state, and believes the idea of the corporation as a legal person can help to clarify the role of citizens as political stakeholders, and to break down the sharp conceptual dichotomy between the state and the people or the individual, a distinction that, in his account, is \"increasingly unable to meet the demands placed on the state in the modern world\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released by Fairchild Camera and Instrument in November 1976 across North America at a retail price of US$. It was launched as the \"Video Entertainment System\", but Fairchild rebranded their console as \"Channel F\" the next year while keeping the Video Entertainment System descriptor.\nThe Fairchild Channel F sold only about 350,000 units before Fairchild sold the technology to Zircon International in 1979, trailing well behind the Atari VCS. The system was discontinued in 1983.\nHistory.\nIn 1974, Alpex Computer Corporation employees Wallace Kirschner and Lawrence Haskel developed a home video game prototype consisting of a base unit centered on an Intel 8080 microprocessor and interchangeable circuit boards containing ROM chips that could be plugged into the base unit. The duo attempted to interest several television manufacturers in the system, but were unsuccessful. Next, they contacted a buyer at Fairchild, which sent engineer Jerry Lawson to evaluate the system. Lawson was impressed by the system and suggested Fairchild license the technology, which the company did in January 1976.\nLawson worked with industrial designer Nick Talesfore and mechanical engineer Ronald A. Smith to turn the prototype into a viable project. Jerry Lawson replaced the 8080 with Fairchild's own F8 CPU; while Nick Talesfore and Ron Smith were responsible for adapting the prototype's complex keyboard controls into a single control stick, and encasing the ROM circuit boards into plastic cartridges reminiscent of 8-track tapes. Talesfore and Smith collaborated on the styling and function of the 8 degrees of freedom hand controller. They were responsible for the design of the hand controllers, console, and video game cartridges. Talesfore also worked with graphic designer Tom Kamafugi, who did the original graphic design for the early video cartridges cartons.\nJohn Donatoni, the marketing director of Fairchild's video games division, stated that the console followed the razor and blades model where they would sell the \"hardware, and then we're going to make the profit on the cartridge sales\". Their marketing campaign was conducted by Ogilvy.\nFairchild announced the console at the Consumer Electronics Show on June 14, 1976, and the Federal Communications Commission approved it for sale on October 20. It was released as the Video Entertainment System (VES) at the price of $169.95, but renamed to the Channel F the next year. Channel F was unable to compete against Atari's Video Computer System (VCS) as the console only had 22 games compared to Atari's 187. Marketing for the console included an event featuring Ken Uston playing Video Blackjack and commercials starring Milton Berle.\nThe console was licensed in Europe to television manufacturers and led to the clone consoles of Ingelen Telematch Processor in Austria, Barco Challenger in Belgium, ITT Telematch-Processor and Nordmende Color Teleplay \u03bcP in Germany, Dumont Videoplay System and Emerson Videoplay System in Italy, Luxor TV-Datorspel and Luxor Video Entertainment Computer in Sweden, and Grandstand Video Entertainment Computer in the United Kingdom. Both models of the Saba Videoplay were sold in Germany and Italy.\nChannel F System II.\nLawson moved on to form his own company, Video Soft in 1980. Talesfore continued working on the system at Fairchild, and eventually a number of these improvements resulted in the improved System II. The major changes were that the controllers were now removable, using the Atari joystick port connector (not Atari compatible), and their storage was moved to the back of the machine. The sound was now mixed into the RF modulator so the user could adjust it on their TV set instead of a fixed volume internal speaker. The internal electronics were also simplified, with two custom logic chips replacing the standard TTL logic chips. This resulted in a much smaller motherboard which allowed for a smaller, simpler and more modern-looking case design.\nFairchild left the video game market in April 1979. Zircon International acquired the rights to the system and related assets in 1979. The company redesigned the console into the Channel F System II. This featured removable controllers and audio coming from the TV rather than a speaker within the console. It was sold at the price point of $99.95 or $69.95 if the previous console was traded in. Zircon released an additional four games for a final library of 26 games on the console.\nDesign.\nThe Channel F is based on the Fairchild F8 microprocessor, which was innovative compared to other contemporary processors and integrated circuits. Because chip packaging was not initially available with enough pins, a few pins were used to communicate with other chips in the system. At least two chips were necessary to set up an F8 processor system to be able run any code. The savings from using standard pin layout enabled the inclusion of 64 bytes of internal scratchpad RAM in the CPU.\nThe VES/Channel F, as well as the System II, had one CPU and two storage chips (PSU:s). \n(A single-chip variant of the F8 was used by the VideoBrain computer system).\nThe Channel F is able to use one plane of graphics and one of four background colors per line, with three plot colors to choose from (red, green, and blue) that turns white if the background is set to black, at a resolution of 128\u00a0\u00d7\u00a064, with approximately 104 \u00d7 60 pixels visible on the TV screen. This VRAM or framebuffer was \"write only\" and not usable for anything else. 64 bytes of scratchpad RAM are available for general use - half the amount of the later Atari 2600. The Maze game (Videocart-10) and Hangman game (Videocart-18) used 1024 bits of on-cartridge static RAM connected directly to one PSU port - adding to the cost of manufacturing it. The Chess game contained considerably more on-cartridge RAM than that, 2048 Bytes accomplished by using an F8 memory interface circuit to be able to use industry standard ROM and RAM. \nThe F8 processor at the heart of the console is able to provide AI to allow for player versus computer matches, a first in console history. All previous machines required a human opponent. \"Tic-Tac-Toe\" on Videocart-1 had this feature, it was only for one player against the machine. The same is true for the chess game, which could have very long turn times for the computer as the game progressed, depending on the set difficulty.\nThe Channel F is also the first video game console to feature a pause function; There is a 'Hold' button on the main unit of the console which allows players to freeze inside the two built-in games and change several game settings in the meantime. Button is controlled through code so it was used for other things in other games.\nControllers.\nThe controllers for the system were conceived by Lawson and built by Nicholas Talesfore.\nUnlike the Atari 2600 joystick, Channel F controllers lack a base. Instead, the main body is a large handgrip with a triangular \"cap\" on top, which can move in eight directions. It could be used as both a joystick and paddle (twist), and not only could it be pushed down to operate as a fire button, it could be pulled up as well. The model 1 unit contained a small compartment for storing the controllers when moving it or when not in use. The System II featured detachable controllers with two holders at the back to wind the cable around and to store the controller in. Zircon later offered a special controller that featured an action button on the front of the joystick. It was marketed by Zircon as \"Channel F Jet-Stick\" in a letter sent out to registered owners before Christmas 1982.\nOne feature, unique to the console, is the 'hold' button, which allows the player to freeze the game, change the time or speed of the game. The hold function is however not universal (like the hardwired reset) as the four buttons are set up in code. The programmer can choose their function/purpose. The text labels explains the button functions in the built-in games (and some of the Videocarts).\nDespite the failure of the Channel F, the joystick's design was so popular\u2014\"Creative Computing\" called it \"outstanding\"\u2014 that Zircon also released an Atari joystick port-compatible version, the Video Command Joystick, first released without the extra fire button. Before that, only the downwards plunge motion was connected and acted as the fire button; the pull-up and twist actions were not connected to anything.\nGames.\nTwenty-seven cartridges, termed \"Videocarts\", were officially released to consumers in the United States during the ownership of Fairchild and Zircon, the first twenty-one of which were released by Fairchild. Several of these cartridges were capable of playing more than one game and were typically priced at ). The Videocarts were yellow and approximately the size and overall texture of an 8 track cartridge. They usually featured colorful label artwork. The earlier artwork was created by nationally known artist Tom Kamifuji and art directed by Nick Talesfore. The console contained two built-in games, Tennis and Hockey, which were both advanced \"Pong\" clones. In Hockey, the reflecting bar could be changed to different diagonals by twisting the controller knob and could move all over the playing field. Tennis was much like the original Pong.\nA sales brochure from 1978 listed \"Keyboard Videocarts\" for sale. The three shown were \"K-1 Casino Poker\", \"K-2 Space Odyssey\", and \"K-3 Pro-Football\". These were intended to use the Keyboard accessory, which is displayed on the Channel F II box. All further brochures, released after Zircon took over from Fairchild, never listed this accessory nor anything called a Keyboard Videocart.\nThere was one cartridge released outside the numbered series, listed as Videocart-51 and simply titled \"Demo 1\". This Videocart was shown in a single sales brochure released shortly after Zircon acquired the company. It has not been seen listed for sale after this single brochure which was sent out in the winter of 1979.\nUnreleased carts:\nGerman electronics manufacturer SABA also released a few compatible carts different from the original carts: translation in Videocart-1 \"Tic-Tac-Toe\" to German words, Videocart-3 released with different abbreviations (German), and Videocart-18 changed graphics and has a German word list.\nIn 2021, a number of new 'Homebrew' games were released on https:// by retro developer Arlasoft. These included ports of mobile puzzle games Tents &amp; Trees, 2048 and Threes, as well as a port of the classic arcade shooter \"Centipede\". Through a secret button combination a hidden game could also be started, the box and instruction booklet has multiple hints about the needed code. &lt;br&gt; \nThese were released on cartridge as Videocart-29.\nReception.\nThe Channel F had beaten the Atari VCS to the market, but once the VCS was released, sales of the Channel F fell, attributed to the types of games that were offered. Most of the Channel F titles were slow-paced educational and intellectual games, compared to the action-driven games that launched with the VCS. Even with the redesigned Channel F II in 1978, Fairchild was unable to meet the sales that the VCS and its games were generating. By the time Fairchild sold the technology to Zircon in 1979, around 350,000 total units had been sold.\nKen Uston reviewed 32 games in his book \"Ken Uston's Guide to Buying and Beating the Home Video Games\" in 1982, and rated some of the Channel F's titles highly; of these, \"Alien Invasion\" and \"Video Whizball\" were considered by Uston to be \"the finest adult cartridges currently available for the Fairchild Channel F System\". The games on a whole, however, rated last on his survey of over 200 games for the Atari, Intellivision, Astrocade and Odyssey consoles, and contemporary games were rated \"Average\" with future Channel F games rated \"below average\". Uston rated almost one-half of the Channel F games as \"high in interest\" and called that \"an impressive proportion\" and further noted that \"Some of the Channel F cartridges are timeless; no matter what technological developments occur, they will continue to be of interest.\" His overall conclusion was that the games \"serve a limited, but useful, purpose\" and that the \"strength of the Channel F offering is in its excellent educational line for children\".\nIn 1983, after Zircon announced its discontinuation of the Channel F, \"Video Games\" reviewed the console. Calling it \"the system nobody knows\", the magazine described its graphics and sounds as \"somewhat primitive by today's standards\". It described \"Space War\" as \"may be the most antiquated game of its type still on the market\", and rated the 25 games for the console with an average \"interest grade\" of three (\"not too good\") on a scale from one to ten and \"skill rating\" at an average 4,5 of 10. The magazine stated, however, that Fairchild \"managed to create some fascinating games, even by today's standards\", calling the poker game \"Casino Royale\" (actually Videocart-25, \"Casino Poker\") \"the best card game, from blackjack to bridge, made for \"any\" TV-game system\". It also favorably reviewed \"Dodge-It\" (\"simple but great\"), \"Robot War\" (\"Berzerk without guns\"), and \"Whizball\" (\"thoroughly original ... hockey \"with\" guns\"), but concluded that only those interested in nostalgia, video game collecting, or card games would purchase the Channel F in 1983.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many systems of collation are based on numerical order or alphabetical order, or extensions and combinations thereof. Collation is a fundamental element of most office filing systems, library catalogs, and reference books.\nCollation differs from \"classification\" in that the classes themselves are not necessarily ordered. However, even if the order of the classes is irrelevant, the identifiers of the classes may be members of an ordered set, allowing a sorting algorithm to arrange the items by class.\nFormally speaking, a collation method typically defines a total order on a set of possible identifiers, called sort keys, which consequently produces a total preorder on the set of items of information (items with the same identifier are not placed in any defined order).\nA collation algorithm such as the Unicode collation algorithm defines an order through the process of comparing two given character strings and deciding which should come before the other. When an order has been defined in this way, a sorting algorithm can be used to put a list of any number of items into that order.\nThe main advantage of collation is that it makes it fast and easy for a user to find an element in the list, or to confirm that it is absent from the list. In automatic systems this can be done using a binary search algorithm or interpolation search; manual searching may be performed using a roughly similar procedure, though this will often be done unconsciously. Other advantages are that one can easily find the first or last elements on the list (most likely to be useful in the case of numerically sorted data), or elements in a given range (useful again in the case of numerical data, and also with alphabetically ordered data when one may be sure of only the first few letters of the sought item or items).\nOrdering.\nNumerical and chronological.\nStrings representing numbers may be sorted based on the values of the numbers that they represent. For example, \"\u22124\", \"2.5\", \"10\", \"89\", \"30,000\". Pure application of this method may provide only a partial ordering on the strings, since different strings can represent the same number (as with \"2\" and \"2.0\" or, when scientific notation is used, \"2e3\" and \"2000\").\nA similar approach may be taken with strings representing dates or other items that can be ordered chronologically or in some other natural fashion.\nAlphabetical.\nAlphabetical order is the basis for many systems of collation where items of information are identified by strings consisting principally of letters from an alphabet. The ordering of the strings relies on the existence of a standard ordering for the letters of the alphabet in question. (The system is not limited to alphabets in the strict technical sense; languages that use a syllabary or abugida, for example Cherokee, can use the same ordering principle provided there is a set ordering for the symbols used.)\nTo decide which of two strings comes first in alphabetical order, initially their first letters are compared. The string whose first letter appears earlier in the alphabet comes first in alphabetical order. If the first letters are the same, then the second letters are compared, and so on, until the order is decided. (If one string runs out of letters to compare, then it is deemed to come first; for example, \"cart\" comes before \"carthorse\".) The result of arranging a set of strings in alphabetical order is that words with the same first letter are grouped together, and within such a group words with the same first two letters are grouped together, and so on.\nCapital letters are typically treated as equivalent to their corresponding lowercase letters. (For alternative treatments in computerized systems, see Automated collation, below.)\nCertain limitations, complications, and special conventions may apply when alphabetical order is used:\nIn several languages the rules have changed over time, and so older dictionaries may use a different order than modern ones. Furthermore, collation may depend on use. For example, German dictionaries and telephone directories use different approaches.\nRoot sorting.\nSome Arabic dictionaries, such as Hans Wehr's bilingual \"A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic\", group and sort Arabic words by semitic root. For example, the words \"kit\u0101ba\" ( 'writing'), \"kit\u0101b\" ( 'book'), \"k\u0101tib\" ( 'writer'), \"maktaba\" ( 'library'), \"maktab\" ( 'office'), \"makt\u016bb\" ( 'fate,' or 'written'), are agglomerated under the triliteral root k-t-b (), which denotes 'writing'.\nRadical-and-stroke sorting.\nAnother form of collation is radical-and-stroke sorting, used for non-alphabetic writing systems such as the hanzi of Chinese and the kanji of Japanese, whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by convention. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called radicals in Chinese and logographic systems derived from Chinese. Characters are then grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation. For example, the Chinese character \u5988 (meaning \"mother\") is sorted as a six-stroke character under the three-stroke primary radical \u5973 (meaning \"woman\").\nThe radical-and-stroke system is cumbersome compared to an alphabetical system in which there are a few characters, all unambiguous. The choice of which components of a logograph comprise separate radicals and which radical is primary is not clear-cut. As a result, logographic languages often supplement radical-and-stroke ordering with alphabetic sorting of a phonetic conversion of the logographs. For example, the kanji word \"T\u014dky\u014d\" (\u6771\u4eac) can be sorted as if it were spelled out in the Japanese characters of the hiragana syllabary as \"to-u-ki-yo-u\" (\u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046), using the conventional sorting order for these characters.\nIn addition, Chinese characters can also be sorted by stroke-based sorting. In Greater China, surname stroke ordering is a convention in some official documents where people's names are listed without hierarchy.\nAutomation.\nWhen information is stored in digital systems, collation may become an automated process. It is then necessary to implement an appropriate collation algorithm that allows the information to be sorted in a satisfactory manner for the application in question. Often the aim will be to achieve an alphabetical or numerical ordering that follows the standard criteria as described in the preceding sections. However, not all of these criteria are easy to automate.\nThe simplest kind of automated collation is based on the numerical codes of the symbols in a character set, such as ASCII coding (or any of its supersets such as Unicode), with the symbols being ordered in increasing numerical order of their codes, and this ordering being extended to strings in accordance with the basic principles of alphabetical ordering (mathematically speaking, lexicographical ordering). So a computer program might treat the characters \"a\", \"b\", \"C\", \"d\", and \"$\" as being ordered \"$\", \"C\", \"a\", \"b\", \"d\" (the corresponding ASCII codes are \"$\" = 36, \"a\" = 97, \"b\" = 98, \"C\" = 67, and \"d\" = 100). Therefore, strings beginning with \"C\", \"M\", or \"Z\" would be sorted before strings with lower-case \"a\", \"b\", etc. This is sometimes called \"ASCIIbetical order\". This deviates from the standard alphabetical order, particularly due to the ordering of capital letters before all lower-case ones (and possibly the treatment of spaces and other non-letter characters). It is therefore often applied with certain alterations, the most obvious being case conversion (often to uppercase, for historical reasons) before comparison of ASCII values.\nIn many collation algorithms, the comparison is based not on the numerical codes of the characters, but with reference to the collating sequence \u2013 a sequence in which the characters are assumed to come for the purpose of collation \u2013 as well as other ordering rules appropriate to the given application. This can serve to apply the correct conventions used for alphabetical ordering in the language in question, dealing properly with differently cased letters, modified letters, digraphs, particular abbreviations, and so on, as mentioned above under Alphabetical order, and in detail in the Alphabetical order article. Such algorithms are potentially quite complex, possibly requiring several passes through the text.\nProblems are nonetheless still common when the algorithm has to encompass more than one language. For example, in German dictionaries the word \"\u00f6konomisch\" comes between \"offenbar\" and \"olfaktorisch\", while Turkish dictionaries treat \"o\" and \"\u00f6\" as different letters, placing \"oyun\" before \"\u00f6b\u00fcr\".\nA standard algorithm for collating any collection of strings composed of any standard Unicode symbols is the Unicode Collation Algorithm. This can be adapted to use the appropriate collation sequence for a given language by tailoring its default collation table. Several such tailorings are collected in Common Locale Data Repository.\nSort keys.\nIn some applications, the strings by which items are collated may differ from the identifiers that are displayed. For example, \"The Shining\" might be sorted as \"Shining, The\" (see Alphabetical order above), but it may still be desired to display it as \"The Shining\". In this case two sets of strings can be stored, one for display purposes, and another for collation purposes. Strings used for collation in this way are called \"sort keys\".\nIssues with numbers.\nSometimes, it is desired to order text with embedded numbers using proper numerical order. For example, \"Figure 7b\" goes before \"Figure 11a\", even though '7' comes after '1' in Unicode. This can be extended to Roman numerals. This behavior is not particularly difficult to produce as long as only integers are to be sorted, although it can slow down sorting significantly. For example, Microsoft Windows does this when sorting file names.\nSorting decimals properly is a bit more difficult, because different locales use different symbols for a decimal point, and sometimes the same character used as a decimal point is also used as a separator, for example \"Section 3.2.5\". There is no universal answer for how to sort such strings; any rules are application dependent.\nLabeling of ordered items.\nIn some contexts, numbers and letters are used not so much as a basis for establishing an ordering, but as a means of labeling items that are already ordered. For example, pages, sections, chapters, and the like, as well as the items of lists, are frequently \"numbered\" in this way. Labeling series that may be used include ordinary Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, ...), Roman numerals (I, II, III, ... or i, ii, iii, ...), or letters (A, B, C, ... or a, b, c, ...). (An alternative method for indicating list items, without numbering them, is to use a bulleted list.)\nWhen letters of an alphabet are used for this purpose of enumeration, there are certain language-specific conventions as to which letters are used. For example, the Russian letters \u042a and \u042c (which in writing are only used for modifying the preceding consonant), and usually also \u042b, \u0419, and \u0401, are omitted. Also in many languages that use extended Latin script, the modified letters are often not used in enumeration.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7490", "revid": "50097956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7490", "title": "Civil Rights Act", "text": "United States legislation\nCivil Rights Act may refer to several civil right acts in the United States. These acts of the United States Congress are meant to protect rights to ensure individuals' freedom from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals.\nThe first wave of civil rights acts were passed during the Reconstruction era after the American Civil War. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 extends the rights of emancipated slaves by stating that any person born in the United States regardless of race is an American citizen. The Enforcement Acts of 1870\u20131871 allows the President to protect Black American men\u2019s right to vote, to hold office, to serve on juries, and for Black men and women to receive equal protection of laws, including protection from racist violence. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 prohibited discrimination in \"public accommodations\" until it was found unconstitutional in 1883 by the Supreme Court of the United States. The Jim Crow Laws were established during the 19th century and served to block African American votes, ban integration in public facilities such as schools, and forbid interracial marriage in the South. The enactment of these laws was able to vastly undermine the progress toward equality which was made during the Reconstruction era.\nCivil Rights Acts would not be passed for 82 more years until the success of the Civil rights movement which aimed to abolish legalized racial segregation, discrimination, and disenfranchisement in the country, which was most commonly employed against African Americans. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 established the Civil Rights Commission and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 established federal inspection of local voter registration polls. The landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin by federal and state governments as well as public places. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 prohibits discrimination in sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, creed, and national origin. The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 specifies that recipients of federal funds must comply with civil rights laws in all areas, not just in the particular program or activity that received federal funding. The Civil Rights Act of 1990 was a bill that would have made it easier for plaintiffs to win civil rights cases which was vetoed by President George H. W. Bush. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits discrimination based on disability. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 provides the right to trial by jury on discrimination claims and introducing the possibility of emotional distress damages, while limiting the amount that a jury could award.\nBackground.\nThe first shift towards equality for African Americans occurred when President Abraham Lincoln passed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which declared that \"all persons held as slaves... shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free...\". As initially ratified, the United States Constitution granted each state complete discretion to determine voter qualifications for its residents.\nIn American history, the Reconstruction era was the period from 1865-1877 following the end of the American Civil War. This period was marked by various attempts made to redress the inequities imposed on African Americans through slavery. Three Reconstruction Amendments were ratified and limited this discretion. The Thirteenth Amendment (1865) prohibits slavery \"except as a punishment for crime\"; the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) grants citizenship to anyone \"born or naturalized in the United States\" and guarantees every person due process and equal protection rights; and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) provides that \"[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"\nThese amendments were established to provide African Americans the same civil rights as white Americans, and also empower Congress to enforce their provisions through \"appropriate legislation\". This time period marked the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement.\nTo enforce the Reconstruction Amendments, Congress passed the Enforcement Acts in the 1870s. The acts criminalized the obstruction of a citizen's voting rights and provided for federal supervision of the electoral process, including voter registration. By 1873, Supreme Court decisions began to limit the scope of Reconstruction legislation, and many whites resorted to intimidation and violence to undermine African Americans' voting rights. In 1875 the Supreme Court struck down parts of the legislation as unconstitutional in \"United States v. Cruikshank\" and \"United States v. Reese\".\nThe Compromise of 1877, an informal agreement to resolve a political dispute, marked the end of the Reconstruction era. After the Reconstruction Era ended in 1877, enforcement of these civil rights laws ceased, and in 1894, Congress repealed most of their provisions. Southern Democrats largely stopped adhering to the provisions of Reconstruction legislation, ceasing to intervene in Southern voting practices, which prompted widespread disenfranchisement of African American voters during and after Reconstruction. From 1868 to 1888, electoral fraud and violence throughout the South suppressed the African-American vote. From 1888 to 1908, Southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting Jim Crow laws; they amended their constitutions and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions, including literacy tests, poll taxes, property-ownership requirements, moral character tests, requirements that voter registration applicants interpret particular documents, and grandfather clauses that allowed otherwise-ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted (which excluded many African Americans whose grandfathers had been slaves or otherwise ineligible). During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld efforts to discriminate against racial minorities. In \"Giles v. Harris\" (1903), the court held that regardless of the Fifteenth Amendment, the judiciary did not have the remedial power to force states to register racial minorities to vote.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 (14\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://, enacted April 9, 1866, reenacted 1870) was the first United States federal law to define citizenship and affirm that all citizens are equally protected by the law. It was mainly intended, in the wake of the American Civil War, to protect the civil rights of persons of African descent born in or brought to the United States.\nThe Act was passed by Congress in 1866 and vetoed by U.S. President Andrew Johnson. In April 1866, Congress again passed the bill to support the Thirteenth Amendment, and Johnson again vetoed it, but a two-thirds majority in each chamber overrode the veto to allow it to become law without presidential signature.\nJohn Bingham and other congressmen argued that Congress did not yet have sufficient constitutional power to enact this law. Following passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, Congress ratified the 1866 Act in 1870.\nThe act had three primary objectives for the integration of African Americans into the American society following the Civil War: 1.) a definition of American citizenship 2.) the rights which come with this citizenship and 3.) the unlawfulness to deprive any person of citizenship rights \"on the basis of race, color, or prior condition of slavery or involuntary servitude.\" The act accomplished these three primary objectives.\nThe author of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was United States Senator Lyman Trumbull. Congressman James F. Wilson summarized what he considered to be the purpose of the act as follows, when he introduced the legislation in the House of Representatives:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It provides for the equality of citizens of the United States in the enjoyment of \"civil rights and immunities.\" What do these terms mean? Do they mean that in all things civil, social, political, all citizens, without distinction of race or color, shall be equal? By no means can they be so construed. Do they mean that all citizens shall vote in the several States? No; for suffrage is a political right which has been left under the control of the several States, subject to the action of Congress only when it becomes necessary to enforce the guarantee of a republican form of government. Nor do they mean that all citizens shall sit on the juries, or that their children shall attend the same schools. The definition given to the term \"civil rights\" in Bouvier's Law Dictionary is very concise, and is supported by the best authority. It is this: \"Civil rights are those which have no relation to the establishment, support, or management of government.\"\nDuring the subsequent legislative process, the following key provision was deleted: \"there shall be no discrimination in civil rights or immunities among the inhabitants of any State or Territory of the United States on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\" John Bingham was an influential supporter of this deletion, on the ground that courts might construe the term \"civil rights\" more broadly than people like Wilson intended. Weeks later, Senator Trumbull described the bill's intended scope:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This bill in no manner interferes with the municipal regulations of any State which protects all alike in their rights of person and property. It could have no operation in Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, or most of the States of the Union.\nOn April 5, 1866, the Senate overrode President Andrew Johnson's veto. This marked the first time that the U.S. Congress ever overrode a presidential veto for a major piece of legislation.\nContent.\nWith an incipit of \"An Act to protect all Persons in the United States in their Civil Rights, and furnish the Means of their vindication\", the act declared that all people born in the United States who are not subject to any foreign power are entitled to be citizens, without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. A similar provision (called the Citizenship Clause) was written a few months later into the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 also said that any citizen has the same right that a white citizen has to make and enforce contracts, sue and be sued, give evidence in court, and inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property. Additionally, the act guaranteed to all citizens the \"full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and ... like punishment, pains, and penalties...\" Persons who denied these rights on account of race or previous enslavement were guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction faced a fine not exceeding $1,000, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.\nThe act used language very similar to that of the Equal Protection Clause in the newly proposed Fourteenth Amendment. In particular, the act discussed the need to provide \"reasonable protection to all persons in their constitutional rights of equality before the law, without distinction of race or color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted. ...\"\nThis statute was a major part of general federal policy during Reconstruction, and was closely related to the Second Freedmen's Bureau Act of 1866. According to Congressman John Bingham, \"the seventh and eighth sections of the Freedmen's Bureau bill enumerate the same rights and all the rights and privileges that are enumerated in the first section of this [the Civil Rights] bill.\"\nParts of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 are enforceable into the 21st century, according to the United States Code:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\nOne section of the United States Code (42 U.S.C. \u00a71981), is \u00a71 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 as revised and amended by subsequent Acts of Congress. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was reenacted by the Enforcement Act of 1870, ch. 114, \u00a7 18, 16 Stat. 144, codified as sections 1977 and 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, and appears now as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\u201382 (1970). Section 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as subsequently revised and amended, appears in the US Code at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7242. After the fourteenth amendment became effective, the 1866 Act was reenacted as an addendum to the Enforcement Act of 1870 in order to dispel any possible doubt as to its constitutionality. Act of May 31, 1870, ch. 114, \u00a7 18, 16 Stat. 144.\nEnactment, constitutionalization, and reenactment.\nSenator Lyman Trumbull was the Senate sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and he argued that Congress had power to enact it in order to eliminate a discriminatory \"badge of servitude\" prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment. Congressman John Bingham, principal author of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, was one of several Republicans who believed (prior to that Amendment) that Congress lacked power to pass the 1866 Act. In the 20th century, the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately adopted Trumbull's Thirteenth Amendment rationale for congressional power to ban racial discrimination by states and by private parties, as the Thirteenth Amendment does not require a state actor.\nTo the extent that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 may have been intended to go beyond preventing discrimination, by conferring particular rights on all citizens, the constitutional power of Congress to do that was more questionable. For example, Representative William Lawrence argued that Congress had power to enact the statute because of the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the original unamended Constitution, even though courts had suggested otherwise.\nIn any event, there is currently no consensus that the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 actually purports to confer any legal benefits upon white citizens. Representative Samuel Shellabarger said that it did not.\nAfter enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 by overriding a presidential veto, some members of Congress supported the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. Thus, the Citizenship Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment parallels citizenship language in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and likewise the Equal Protection Clause parallels nondiscrimination language in the 1866 Act; the extent to which other clauses in the Fourteenth Amendment may have incorporated elements of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 is a matter of continuing debate.\nRatification of the Fourteenth Amendment was completed in 1868, 2 years after, the 1866 Act was reenacted, as Section 18 of the Enforcement Act of 1870.\nAfter Johnson's veto was overridden, the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.\nThe activities of groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) undermined the act, meaning that it failed to immediately secure the civil rights of African Americans.\nWhile it has been \"de jure\" illegal in the U.S. to discriminate in employment and housing on the basis of race since 1866, federal penalties were not provided for until the second half of the 20th century (with the passage of related civil rights legislation), which meant remedies were left to the individuals involved: because those being discriminated against had limited or no access to legal assistance, this often left many victims of discrimination without recourse.\nThere have been an increasing number of remedies provided under this act since the second half of the 20th century, including the landmark \"Jones v. Mayer\" and \"Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc.\" decisions in 1968.\nEnforcement Acts of 1870-1871.\nThe Enforcement Acts were three bills that were passed by the United States Congress between 1870 and 1871. They were criminal codes that protected African Americans\u2019 right to vote, to hold office, to serve on juries, and receive equal protection of laws. Passed under the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, the laws also allowed the federal government to intervene when states did not act to protect these rights. The acts passed following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, which gave full citizenship to anyone born in the United States or freed slaves, and the Fifteenth Amendment, which banned racial discrimination in voting.\nAt the time, the lives of all newly freed slaves, as well as their political and economic rights, were being threatened. This threat led to the creation of the Enforcement Acts. The main goal in creating these acts was to improve conditions for black people and freed slaves. The main target was the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacy organization, which was targeting black people, and, later, other groups. Although this act was meant to fight the KKK and help black people and freedmen, many states were reluctant to take such relatively extreme actions, for several reasons. Some politicians at the state and federal levels were either members of the Klan, or did not have enough strength to fight the Klan. Another goal of these acts was to achieve national unity, by creating a country where all races were considered equal under the law.\nThe Enforcement Acts did many things to help freedmen. The main purpose under the act was the prohibited use of violence or any form of intimidation to prevent the freedmen from voting and denying them that right. There were many provisions placed under the act, many with serious consequences. The Enforcement Acts were created as part of the Reconstruction era following the American Civil War. To allow full national unity, all citizens must be accepted and viewed equally, with violence prohibited.\nEnforcement Act of 1870.\nThe Enforcement Act of 1870 prohibited discrimination by state officials in voter registration on the basis of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. It established penalties for interfering with a person's right to vote and gave federal courts the power to enforce the act.\nThe act also authorized the President to employ the use of the army to uphold the act and the use of federal marshals to bring charges against offenders for election fraud, the bribery or intimidation of voters, and conspiracies to prevent citizens from exercising their constitutional rights.\nThe act banned the use of terror, force or bribery to prevent people from voting because of their race. Other laws banned the KKK entirely. Hundreds of KKK members were arrested and tried as common criminals and terrorists. The first Klan was all but eradicated within a year of federal prosecution.\nEnforcement Act of 1871.\nThe Second Enforcement Act of 1871 (formally, \"an Act to enforce the rights of citizens of the United States to vote in the several states of this union\"), permitted federal oversight of local and state elections if any two citizens in a town with more than twenty-thousand inhabitants desired it.\nThe Enforcement Act of 1871 (second act) and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 are very similar to the original act as they all have the same goal, but revised the first act with the intention of being more effective. The Act of 1871 has more severe punishments with larger fines for disregarding the regulations, and the prison sentences vary in length. The final act, and the most effective, was also a revision. Although the fines lowered again, and the prison sentences remained approximately the same, this act was the best enforced by the government.\nKu Klux Klan Act.\nThe Enforcement Act of 1871, the third Enforcement Act passed by Congress and also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act (formally, \"An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes\"), made state officials liable in federal court for depriving anyone of their civil rights or the equal protection of the laws. It further made a number of the KKK's intimidation tactics into federal offenses, authorized the president to call out the militia to suppress conspiracies against the operation of the federal government, and prohibited those suspected of complicity in such conspiracies to serve on juries related to the Klan's activities. The Act also authorized the president to suspend the writ of \"habeas corpus\" if violence rendered efforts to suppress the Klan ineffective. It was passed at the request of Ulysses S. Grant.\nAftermath.\nAs a response to the act, Klansmen in South Carolina were put on trial in front of juries made up of mainly African Americans. Amos T. Akerman was largely involved with the prosecutions of the Klansmen. He worked to make America aware of Klan violence and how much of a problem it was becoming. His work led to trials and to jail sentences of a few hundred Klan members. Many others who were put on trial either fled or were only given a warning. By 1872, the Klan as an organization had been officially broken.\nThe Enforcement Acts were a series of acts, but it was not until the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, the third Enforcement Act, that their regulations to protect black Americans, and to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution were really enforced and followed. It was only after the creation of the third Enforcement Act that trials were conducted, and perpetrators were convicted for any crimes they had committed in violation of the Enforcement Acts.\nJudicial interpretations.\nAfter the Colfax massacre in Louisiana, the federal government brought a civil rights case against nine men (out of 97 indicted) who were accused of paramilitary activity intended to stop black people from voting. In \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1876), the Court ruled that the federal government did not have the authority to prosecute the men because the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments provide only for redress against state actors. However, in \"Ex Parte Yarbrough\" (1884) the Court allowed individuals who were not state actors to be prosecuted because Article I Section 4 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate federal elections.\nIn \"Hodges v. United States\" (1906) the Court addressed a possible Thirteenth Amendment rationale for the Enforcement Acts, and found that the federal government did not have the authority to punish a group of men for interfering with black workers through whitecapping. \"Hodges v. United States\" would be overruled in \"Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.\" some 50 years later, stating for the first time since Reconstruction that the federal government could criminalize racist acts by private actors.\nCivil Rights Act of 1875.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1875, sometimes called the Enforcement Act or the Force Act, was a United States federal law enacted during the Reconstruction era in response to civil rights violations against African Americans. The bill was passed by the 43rd United States Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875. The act was designed to \"protect all citizens in their civil and legal rights\", providing for equal treatment in public accommodations and public transportation and prohibiting exclusion from jury service. It was originally drafted by Senator Charles Sumner in 1870, but was not passed until shortly after Sumner's death in 1875. The law was not effectively enforced, partly because President Grant had favored different measures to help him suppress election-related violence against blacks and Republicans in the Southern United States.\nThe Reconstruction era ended with the resolution of the 1876 presidential election, and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was the last federal civil rights law enacted until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. In 1883, the Supreme Court ruled in the \"Civil Rights Cases\" that the public accommodation sections of the act were unconstitutional, saying Congress was not afforded control over private persons or corporations under the Equal Protection Clause. Parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were later re-adopted in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968, both of which cited the Commerce Clause as the source of Congress's power to regulate private actors.\nLegislative history.\nThe drafting of the bill was performed early in 1870 by United States Senator Charles Sumner, a dominant Radical Republican in the Senate, with the assistance of John Mercer Langston, a prominent African American who established the law department at Howard University. The bill was proposed by Senator Sumner and co-sponsored by Representative Benjamin F. Butler, both Republicans from Massachusetts, in the 41st Congress of the United States in 1870. Congress removed the coverage of public schools that Sumner had included. The act was passed by the 43rd Congress in February 1875 as a memorial to honor Sumner, who had just died. It was signed into law by United States President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1875.\nEnforcement.\nPresident Grant had wanted an entirely different law to help him suppress election-related violence against blacks and Republicans in the South. Congress did not give him that, but instead wrote a law for equal rights to public accommodations that was passed as a memorial to Grant's bitterest enemy, the late Senator Charles Sumner. Grant never commented on the 1875 law, and did nothing to enforce it, says historian John Hope Franklin. Grant's Justice Department ignored it and did not send copies to US attorneys, says Franklin, while many federal judges called it unconstitutional before the Supreme Court shut it down. Franklin concludes regarding Grant and Hayes administrations, \"The Civil Rights Act was never effectively enforced.\" Public opinion was opposed, with the black community in support. Historian Rayford Logan looking at newspaper editorials finds the press was overwhelmingly opposed.\nCase law.\nThe Supreme Court, in an 8\u20131 decision, declared sections of the act unconstitutional in the \"Civil Rights Cases\" on October 15, 1883, thus stripping the Civil Rights Act of 1875 of much of its ability to protect civil rights. Justice John Marshall Harlan provided the lone dissent. The Court held the Equal Protection Clause within the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination by the state and local government, but it does not give the federal government the power to prohibit discrimination by private individuals and organizations. The Court also held that the Thirteenth Amendment was meant to eliminate \"the badge of slavery,\" but not to prohibit racial discrimination in public accommodations.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1875 was the last federal civil rights bill signed into law until the Civil Rights Act of 1957, enacted during the Civil Rights Movement. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the legal justification for voiding the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was part of a larger trend by the United States Supreme Court majorities to invalidate most government regulations of the private sector, except when dealing with laws designed to protect traditional public morality. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 is notable as the last major piece of legislation related to Reconstruction that was passed by Congress during the Reconstruction era. These include the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the four Reconstruction Acts of 1867 and 1868, the three Enforcement Acts of 1870 and 1871, and the three Constitutional Amendments adopted between 1865 and 1870.\nProvisions contained in the Civil Rights Act of 1875 were later readopted by Congress during the Civil Rights Movement as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The 1964 and 1968 acts relied upon the Commerce Clause contained in of the Constitution of the United States rather than the Equal Protection Clause within the Fourteenth Amendment.\nCivil Rights Act of 1957.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1957, signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on September 9, 1957, was the first federal civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to become law. After the Supreme Court ruled school segregation unconstitutional in 1954 in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", Southern Democrats began a campaign of \"massive resistance\" against desegregation, and even the few moderate white leaders shifted to openly racist positions. Partly in an effort to defuse calls for more far-reaching reforms, Eisenhower proposed a civil rights bill that would increase the protection of African American voting rights.\nThe Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in the case of \"Brown v. Board of Education\" brought the issue of school desegregation to the fore of public attention, as Southern Democratic leaders began a campaign of \"massive resistance\" against desegregation. In the midst of this campaign, President Eisenhower proposed a civil rights bill designed to provide federal protection for African American voting rights; most African Americans in the Southern United States had been disenfranchised by state and local laws. Though the civil rights bill passed Congress, opponents of the act were able to remove or weaken several provisions via the Anderson\u2013Aiken amendment and the O'Mahoney jury trial amendment, significantly watering down its immediate impact. During the debate over the law, Senator Strom Thurmond conducted the longest one-person filibuster in Senate history. Under the direction of Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, the Senate passed a watered-down, yet also passable, version of the House bill which removed stringent voting protection clauses.\nDespite having a limited impact on African-American voter participation, at a time when black voter registration from 0% (in 11 counties) to less than 5% (in 97 counties) despite being majority-Black counties, the Civil Rights Act of 1957 did establish the United States Commission on Civil Rights and the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. By 1960, black voting had increased by only 3%, and Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which eliminated certain loopholes left by the 1957 Act. Congress would later pass far more effective civil rights laws in the form of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968.\nBackground.\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling in \"Brown\", which eventually led to the integration of public schools, Southern whites began a campaign of \"Massive Resistance\". Violence against black people rose; in Little Rock, Arkansas where President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered U.S. paratroopers of the 101st Airborne Division to protect nine black teenagers integrating into a public school, the first time federal troops were deployed in the South to settle civil rights issues since the Reconstruction Era. There had been continued physical assaults against suspected activists and bombings of schools and churches in the South. Partly in an effort to defuse calls for more far-reaching reforms, President Eisenhower proposed a civil rights bill that would increase the protection of African American voting rights.\nBy 1957, only about 20% of black people were registered to vote. Despite being the majority in numerous counties and congressional districts in the South, most black people had been effectively disfranchised by discriminatory voter registration rules and laws in those states since the late 19th and early 20th centuries that were heavily instituted and propagated by Southern Democrats. Civil rights organizations had collected evidence of discriminatory practices, such as the administration of literacy and comprehension tests and poll taxes. While the states had the right to establish rules for voter registration and elections, the federal government found an oversight role in ensuring that citizens could exercise the constitutional right to vote for federal officers: electors for president and vice president and members of the US Congress.\nLegislative history.\nThe Democratic Senate majority leader, Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas, who would play a vital role in the bill's passage in the Senate, realized that the bill and its journey through Congress could tear apart his party, as southern Democrats vehemently opposed civil rights, and its northern members were strongly in favor of them. Southern Democratic senators occupied chairs of numerous important committees because of their long seniority. As, in the near-century between the end of Reconstruction and the 1960s, white Southerners voted solidly as a bloc for the Democrats, Southern Democrats in Congress rarely lost their seats in elections, ensuring that they had more seniority than Democratic members of Congress from other parts of the country. Johnson sent the bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Democratic Senator James Eastland of Mississippi, who drastically altered the bill. Democratic Senator Richard Russell Jr., of Georgia had denounced the bill as an example of the federal government seeking to impose its laws on states. Johnson sought recognition from civil rights advocates for passing the bill as well as recognition from the anti-civil rights Democrats for weakening the bill so much as to make it toothless.\nAs well as a general if vague support for civil rights as the party of Lincoln, Republicans saw that this could be an effective way to increase the number of Black Republican voters as the blocking of the Bill by the Democrats in the Southern Caucus would become obvious. They, like Johnson, also saw the potential for dividing the Democratic party's Northern and Southern wings. This meant that the (on this issue) liberal but hardball Republican operators like the Vice President, Richard Nixon, who had a constitutional right to chair the Senate took a great interest in the Bill. Conservative Republican Senators who were sympathetic to Southern arguments on States rights were more likely to vote on a party basis. On the other hand, the Republicans were willing to quietly allow Democratic Southern obstruction if this meant that African-American and liberal voters would be more likely to see the culprits as Democrats.\nAnderson\u2013Aiken amendment.\nA bipartisan group of Senators realized that Southerners would not allow passage of the act with Title III, which authorized the US Attorney General to seek preventive relief in civil rights cases. Majority Leader Johnson convinced Senator Clinton Anderson (D-NM) to introduce an amendment to strip out the enforcement provisions of Title III. Anderson's initial hesitancy to be associated with the anti-civil rights bloc was met with Johnson's urging to introduce the amendment along with a Republican colleague. Anderson approached George Aiken (R-VT), who agreed to co-sponsor the amendment.\nA crucial cause of the weakening of support for Title III was a speech given by the unofficial leader of the Southern Caucus the Georgian Democrat, Richard Russell, who pointed out that Title III was not a new law but an amendment of Section 1985 of Title 42 of the United States Code. It seems that this had not been understood previously by either the opponents or the supporters of the Civil Rights Act, including Douglas or Brownell. In his speech Russell drew out the implications of this, including the invocation of Section 1993 of Title 42 of the United States Code, a Reconstruction era law which wasn't mentioned in the bill and which authorized the President to enforce judicial decisions - which would include \"Brown v Board\". This specter of military involvement in domestic politics became a worry not just for moderate previous supporters of the bill such as Bourke Hickenlooper (R-IA) - who after Russell's speech referred to Title III as a \"violation of the civil rights of the white race.\" - but also strong supporters such as Douglas. Later President Eisenhower in answer to a direct question on Russell's charges distanced himself from the \"exact language\" of Title III.\nPresident Eisenhower did not express enthusiasm for the provisions in Title III. In a press conference, he referred to it as going \"too far too fast in laws\", and instead placed an emphasis on the voting rights provisions in Title IV. This diminished the already-waning support for the title among Republicans, many of whom opposed its expansion of federal power on conservative grounds in spite of their sympathy towards civil rights causes.\nThe Anderson\u2013Aiken amendment passed by a 52\u201338 vote. The vote on the amendment did not split purely along partisan or ideological lines; it was opposed by conservative William Knowland (R-CA) and supported by liberal Frank Church (D-ID).\nJury trial amendment.\nMajority Leader Johnson, who was intent on passing a fully weakened act in contrast to overseeing a legislative graveyard at the hands of a Southern filibuster, moved to effectively weaken the voting rights-related provisions in Title IV. Alleged violators of civil rights injunctions are normally entitled to jury trials, with the exception of civil contempt actions. A jury trial amendment that included the guarantee of jury trials in civil contempt actions would, in the South, result in perpetrators of voter suppression being acquitted by an all-white jury, thus ensuring no resulted accomplishment to enfranchise blacks.\nThe jury trial amendment was not introduced by a Southern Democrat, instead being spearheaded by Wyoming senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney. The motivation for Western liberal Democrats to spearhead the cause of weakening the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was attributed to their traditional populist disdain for the perceived disproportionate power wielded by judges to quell labor causes in the Western United States, thus contributing to a resonance with the expansion of jury trial rights, although Lyndon Johnson's biographer Robert Caro also claims that Johnson had facilitated a bargain that Western liberal Democrats would vote with the South in important votes on Civil Rights in return for Southern support for public involvement in the building of the Hells Canyon Dam.\nThere was also support from some unions, particularly the Railroad brotherhoods and the United Mine Workers of America who agreed that this would also stop injunctions in union cases. Their support was seen as a major reason why Senators in mining states such as West Virginia and mid western Republican senators where the railroads were strong became less hostile to the amendment.\nOn August 2, 1957, the Senate passed the jury trial amendment with majority support from Democratic members, both Northern and Southern. Following the vote, many Republicans were visible in their bitterness, having failed in an opportunity to spearhead the cause of civil rights against a deceitful, partisan Democratic effort. According to Johnson biographer Robert A. Caro:\nSeveral conservative Republican senators who voted for the Anderson\u2013Aiken amendment on small-government grounds opposed the jury trial amendment for its intent of weakening civil rights efforts. Idaho senator Henry Dworshak decried that it \"practically scuttled any hope of getting an effective civil rights bill.\"\nFilibuster.\nThen-Democratic Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, an ardent segregationist, sustained the longest one-person filibuster in history in an attempt to keep the bill from becoming law. His one-man filibuster lasted 24 hours and 18 minutes; he began with readings of every US state's election laws in alphabetical order. He later read from the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and George Washington's Farewell Address.\nTo prevent a quorum call that could have relieved the filibuster by allowing the Senate to adjourn, cots were brought in from a nearby hotel for the legislators to sleep on while Thurmond discussed increasingly irrelevant and obscure topics. Other members of the Southern caucus, who had agreed as part of a compromise not to filibuster this bill, were upset with Thurmond. They believed his defiance made them look incompetent to their constituents. Other constituents were upset with their senators because they were seen as not helping Thurmond.\nThurmond pointed out that there was already a federal statute that prosecuted citizens who denied or intimidated voters at voting booths under a fine and/or imprisonment but that the bill then under consideration could legally deny trial by jury to those that continued to do so.\nDemocratic Representative Charles A. Boyle of Illinois, a\nmember of the powerful Appropriations Subcommittee of Defense, pushed the bill through the House of Representatives.\nFinal passage.\nThe bill passed 285\u2013126 in the House of Representatives with a majority of both parties' support (Republicans 167\u201319, Democrats 118\u2013107). It then passed 72\u201318 in the Senate, again with a majority of both parties (Republicans 43\u20130, Democrats 29\u201318). Despite large opposition from Southern Democrats, the Democratic U.S. Senators from Tennessee and Texas would support the law. President Eisenhower signed the bill on September 9, 1957.\nThe act established both the Commission on Civil Rights and the office of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Subsequently, on December 9, 1957, the Civil Rights Division was established within the Justice Department by order of US Attorney General William P. Rogers, giving the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights a distinct division to command. Previously, civil rights lawyers had enforced Reconstruction-era civil rights laws from within the Department's Criminal Division.\nCivil Rights Act of 1960.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1960 (Pub. L.\u00a0, 74\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://, enacted ) is a United States federal law that established federal inspection of local voter registration polls and introduced penalties for anyone who obstructed someone's attempt to register to vote. It dealt primarily with discriminatory laws and practices in the segregated South, by which African-Americans and Tejanos had been effectively disenfranchised since the late 19th and start of the 20th century. This was the fifth Civil Rights Act to be enacted in United States history. Over an 85-year period, it was preceded only by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, whose shortcomings largely influenced its creation. This law served to more effectively enforce what was set forth in the 1957 act through eliminating certain loopholes in it, and to establish additional provisions. Aside from addressing voting rights, the Civil Rights Act of 1960 also imposed criminal penalties for obstruction of court orders to limit resistance to the Supreme Court's school desegregation decisions, arranged for free education for military members' children, and banned the act of fleeing to avoid prosecution for property damage. The Civil Rights Act of 1960 was signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\nCivil Rights Act of 1964.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub. L.\u00a0, 78\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://, enacted ) is a landmark civil rights and labor law in the United States that outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. It prohibits unequal application of voter registration requirements, racial segregation in schools and public accommodations, and employment discrimination. The act \"remains one of the most significant legislative achievements in American history\".\nInitially, powers given to enforce the act were weak, but these were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the United States Constitution, principally its enumerated power to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of , its duty to guarantee all citizens equal protection of the laws under the 14th Amendment, and its duty to protect voting rights under the 15th Amendment.\nThe legislation was proposed by President John F. Kennedy in June 1963, but it was opposed by filibuster in the Senate. After Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed the bill forward. The United States House of Representatives passed the bill on February 10, 1964, and after a 72-day filibuster, it passed the United States Senate on June 19, 1964. The final vote was 290\u2013130 in the House of Representatives and 73\u201327 in the Senate. After the House agreed to a subsequent Senate amendment, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed into law by President Johnson at the White House on July 2, 1964.\nLegislative history.\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy met with Republican leaders to discuss the legislation before his television address to the nation that evening. Two days later, Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen and Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield both voiced support for the president's bill, except for provisions guaranteeing equal access to places of public accommodations. This led to several Republican Representatives drafting a compromise bill to be considered. On June 19, the president sent his bill to Congress as it was originally written, saying legislative action was \"imperative\". The president's bill went first to the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the Judiciary Committee, chaired by New York Democrat Emanuel Celler. After a series of hearings on the bill, Celler's committee strengthened the act, adding provisions to ban racial discrimination in employment, providing greater protection to black voters, eliminating segregation in all publicly owned facilities (not just schools), and strengthening the anti-segregation clauses regarding public facilities such as lunch counters. They also added authorization for the Attorney General to file lawsuits to protect individuals against the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution or U.S. law. In essence, this was the controversial \"Title III\" that had been removed from the 1957 Act and 1960 Act. Civil rights organizations pressed hard for this provision because it could be used to protect peaceful protesters and black voters from police brutality and suppression of free speech rights.\nLobbying support for the Civil Rights Act was coordinated by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 70 liberal and labor organizations. The principal lobbyists for the Leadership Conference were civil rights lawyer Joseph L. Rauh Jr. and Clarence Mitchell Jr. of the NAACP.\nAfter the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, on August 28, 1963, the organizers visited Kennedy to discuss the civil rights bill. Roy Wilkins, A. Philip Randolph, and Walter Reuther attempted to persuade him to support a provision establishing a Fair Employment Practices Commission that would ban discriminatory practices by all federal agencies, unions, and private companies.\nKennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House in late October 1963 to line up the necessary votes in the House for passage. The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963 and referred to the Rules Committee, whose chairman, Howard W. Smith, a Democrat and staunch segregationist from Virginia, indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely.\nThe assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, changed the political situation. Kennedy's successor as president, Lyndon B. Johnson, made use of his experience in legislative politics, along with the bully pulpit he wielded as president, in support of the bill. In his first address to a joint session of Congress on November 27, 1963, Johnson told the legislators, \"No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.\"\nJudiciary Committee chairman Celler filed a petition to discharge the bill from the Rules Committee which required the support of a majority of House members to move the bill to the floor. Initially, Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, with many Representatives who supported the civil rights bill itself remaining cautious about violating normal House procedure with the rare use of a discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.\nAfter the return of Congress from its winter recess, however, it was apparent that public opinion in the North favored the bill and that the petition would acquire the necessary signatures. To avert the humiliation of a successful discharge petition, Chairman Smith relented and allowed the bill to pass through the Rules Committee.\nJohnson, who wanted the bill passed as soon as possible, ensured that it would be quickly considered by the Senate.\nNormally, the bill would have been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was chaired by James O. Eastland, a Democrat from Mississippi, whose firm opposition made it seem impossible that the bill would reach the Senate floor. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield took a novel approach to prevent the Judiciary Committee from keeping the bill in limbo: initially waiving a second reading immediately after the first reading, which would have sent it to the Judiciary Committee, he took the unprecedented step of giving the bill a second reading on February 26, 1964, thereby bypassing the Judiciary Committee, and sending it to the Senate floor for immediate debate.\nWhen the bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \"Southern Bloc\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and lone Republican John Tower of Texas, led by Richard Russell (D-GA), launched a filibuster to prevent its passage. Russell proclaimed, \"We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would tend to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our [Southern] states.\"\nStrong opposition to the bill also came from Senator Strom Thurmond, who was still a Democrat at the time: \"This so-called Civil Rights Proposals [\"sic\"], which the President has sent to Capitol Hill for enactment into law, are unconstitutional, unnecessary, unwise and extend beyond the realm of reason. This is the worst civil-rights package ever presented to the Congress and is reminiscent of the Reconstruction proposals and actions of the radical Republican Congress.\"\nAfter the filibuster had gone on for 54 days, Senators Mansfield, Hubert Humphrey, Everett Dirksen, and Thomas Kuchel introduced a substitute bill that they hoped would overcome it by combining a sufficient number of Republicans as well as core liberal Democrats. The compromise bill was weaker than the House version as to the government's power in regulating the conduct of private business, but not weak enough to make the House reconsider it.\nSenator Robert Byrd ended his filibuster in opposition to the bill on the morning of June 10, 1964, after 14 hours and 13 minutes. Up to then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 60 working days, including six Saturdays. The day before, Humphrey, the bill's manager, concluded that he had the 67 votes required at that time to end the debate and the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never before in its entire history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to defeat a filibuster on a civil rights bill, and only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to cloture for any measure.\nThe most dramatic moment during the cloture vote came when Senator Clair Engle (D-CA) was wheeled into the chamber. Suffering from terminal brain cancer, unable to speak, he pointed to his left eye, signifying his affirmative \"Aye\" vote when his name was called. He died seven weeks later.\nOn June 19, the compromise bill passed the Senate by a vote of 73\u201327, quickly passed through the conference committee, which adopted the Senate version of the bill, then was passed by both houses of Congress and signed into law by Johnson on July 2, 1964.\nAspects.\nWomen's rights.\nOne year earlier, the same Congress had passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which prohibited wage differentials based on sex. The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee and strongly opposed the legislation. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. Historians debate whether Smith cynically attempted to defeat the bill because he opposed civil rights for Black people and women or attempted to support their rights by broadening the bill to include women. Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because labor unions opposed the clause. Representative Carl Elliott of Alabama later said, \"Smith didn't give a damn about women's rights\", as \"he was trying to knock off votes either then or down the line because there was always a hard core of men who didn't favor women's rights\", and according to the \"Congressional Record\", laughter greeted Smith when he introduced the amendment.\nSmith asserted that he was not joking and sincerely supported the amendment. Along with Representative Martha Griffiths, he was the amendment's chief spokesperson. For 20 years, Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment (with no linkage to racial issues) in the House because he believed in it. For decades he had been close to the National Woman's Party and its leader Alice Paul, who had been a leading figure in winning the right to vote for women in 1920, co-authored the first Equal Rights Amendment, and had been a chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category, and felt now was the moment. Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that that was unfair to white women. Black feminist lawyer Pauli Murray wrote a supportive memorandum at the behest of the National Federation of Business and Professional Women. Griffiths also argued that the laws \"protecting\" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs. The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats. The final law passed with the votes of Republicans and Northern Democrats. Thus, as Justice William Rehnquist wrote in \"Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson\", \"The prohibition against discrimination based on sex was added to Title VII at the last minute on the floor of the House of Representatives [...] the bill quickly passed as amended, and we are left with little legislative history to guide us in interpreting the Act's prohibition against discrimination based on 'sex.'\"\nDesegregation.\nOne of the bill's opponents' most damaging arguments was that once passed, the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain racial quotas in schools. The bill's proponents, such as Emanuel Celler and Jacob Javits, said it would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor Hubert Humphrey wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing. Humphrey said, \"if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race.\" Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes \"would be making a fool of himself,\" but two years later the Department of Health, Education and Welfare said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing.\nAftermath.\nThe bill divided both major American political parties and engendered a long-term change in the demographics of the support for each. President Kennedy realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Vice President Johnson had pushed for the introduction of the civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide Ted Sorensen that \"I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway.\" Senator Richard Russell, Jr. later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill \"will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election\". Johnson, however, went on to win the 1964 election by one of the biggest landslides in American history. The South, which had five states swing Republican in 1964, became a stronghold of the Republican Party by the 1990s.\nAlthough majorities in both parties voted for the bill, there were notable exceptions. Though he opposed forced segregation, Republican 1964 presidential candidate, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, voted against the bill, remarking, \"You can't legislate morality.\" Goldwater had supported previous attempts to pass civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 as well as the 24th Amendment outlawing the poll tax. He stated that the reason for his opposition to the 1964 bill was Title II, which in his opinion violated individual liberty and states' rights. Democrats and Republicans from the Southern states opposed the bill and led an unsuccessful 60 working day filibuster, including Senators Albert Gore, Sr. (D-TN) and J. William Fulbright (D-AR), as well as Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), who personally filibustered for 14 hours straight.\nThere were white business owners who claimed that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to ban segregation in public accommodations. For example, Moreton Rolleston, the owner of a motel in Atlanta, Georgia, said he should not be forced to serve black travelers, saying, \"the fundamental question [...] is whether or not Congress has the power to take away the liberty of an individual to run his business as he sees fit in the selection and choice of his customers\". Rolleston claimed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a breach of the Fourteenth Amendment and also violated the Fifth and Thirteenth Amendments by depriving him of \"liberty and property without due process\". In \"Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States\" (1964), the Supreme Court held that Congress drew its authority from the Constitution's Commerce Clause, rejecting Rolleston's claims.\nResistance to the public accommodation clause continued for years on the ground, especially in the South. When local college students in Orangeburg, South Carolina, attempted to desegregate a bowling alley in 1968, they were violently attacked, leading to rioting and what became known as the \"Orangeburg massacre.\" Resistance by school boards continued into the next decade, with the most significant declines in black-white school segregation only occurring at the end of the 1960s and the start of the 1970s in the aftermath of the \"Green v. County School Board of New Kent County\" (1968) court decision.\nIn June 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in three cases (\"Bostock v. Clayton County\", \"Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda\", and \"R.G. &amp; G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\") that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which barred employers from discriminating on the basis of sex, precluded employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Afterward, \"USA Today\" stated that in addition to LGBTQ employment discrimination, \"[t]he court's ruling is likely to have a sweeping impact on federal civil rights laws barring sex discrimination in education, health care, housing and financial credit.\"\nVoting Rights Act of 1965.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a landmark piece of federal legislation in the United States that prohibits racial discrimination in voting. It was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the height of the civil rights movement on August 6, 1965, and Congress later amended the Act five times to expand its protections. Designed to enforce the voting rights protected by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, the Act sought to secure the right to vote for racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the South. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Act is considered to be the most effective piece of federal civil rights legislation ever enacted in the country. The National Archives and Records Administration stated: \"The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was the most significant statutory change in the relationship between the federal and state governments in the area of voting since the Reconstruction period following the Civil War\".\nThe act contains numerous provisions that regulate elections. The act's \"general provisions\" provide nationwide protections for voting rights. Section 2 is a general provision that prohibits state and local government from imposing any voting rule that \"results in the denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race or color\" or membership in a language minority group. Other general provisions specifically outlaw literacy tests and similar devices that were historically used to disenfranchise racial minorities. The act also contains \"special provisions\" that apply to only certain jurisdictions. A core special provision is the Section 5 preclearance requirement, which prohibited certain jurisdictions from implementing any change affecting voting without first receiving confirmation from the U.S. attorney general or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the change does not discriminate against protected minorities. Another special provision requires jurisdictions containing significant language minority populations to provide bilingual ballots and other election materials.\nSection 5 and most other special provisions applied to jurisdictions encompassed by the \"coverage formula\" prescribed in Section 4(b). The coverage formula was originally designed to encompass jurisdictions that engaged in egregious voting discrimination in 1965, and Congress updated the formula in 1970 and 1975. In \"Shelby County v. Holder\" (2013), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the coverage formula as unconstitutional, reasoning that it was obsolete. The court did not strike down Section 5, but without a coverage formula, Section 5 is unenforceable. The jurisdictions which had previously been covered by the coverage formula massively increased the rate of voter registration purges after the \"Shelby\" decision.\nIn 2021, the \"Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee\" Supreme Court ruling reinterpreted Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, substantially weakening it. The ruling interpreted the \"totality of circumstances\" language of Section 2 to mean that it does not generally prohibit voting rules that have disparate impact on the groups that it sought to protect, including a rule blocked under Section 5 before the Court inactivated that section in \"Shelby County v. Holder\". In particular, the ruling held that fears of election fraud could justify such rules without evidence that any such fraud had occurred in the past or that the new rule would make elections safer.\nResearch shows that the Act had successfully and massively increased voter turnout and voter registrations, in particular among black people. The Act has also been linked to concrete outcomes, such as greater public goods provision (such as public education) for areas with higher black population shares, more members of Congress who vote for civil rights-related legislation, and greater Black representation in local offices.\nBackground.\nPrior to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 there were several efforts to stop the disenfranchisement of black voters by Southern states. Besides the above-mentioned literacy tests and poll taxes other bureaucratic restrictions were used to deny them the right to vote. African Americans also \"risked harassment, intimidation, economic reprisals, and physical violence when they tried to register or vote. As a result, very few African Americans were registered voters, and they had very little, if any, political power, either locally or nationally.\" In the 1950s the Civil Rights Movement increased pressure on the federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This legislation authorized the attorney general to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth Amendment rights were denied, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.\nAlthough these acts helped empower courts to remedy violations of federal voting rights, strict legal standards made it difficult for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South increased only marginally even though the department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits. Efforts to stop the disfranchisement by the Southern states had achieved only modest success overall and in some areas had proved almost entirely ineffectual, because the \"Department of Justice's efforts to eliminate discriminatory election practices by litigation on a case-by-case basis had been unsuccessful in opening up the registration process; as soon as one discriminatory practice or procedure was proven to be unconstitutional and enjoined, a new one would be substituted in its place and litigation would have to commence anew.\"\nCongress responded to rampant discrimination against racial minorities in public accommodations and government services by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The act included some voting rights protections; it required registrars to equally administer literacy tests in writing to each voter and to accept applications that contained minor errors, and it created a rebuttable presumption that persons with a sixth-grade education were sufficiently literate to vote. However, despite lobbying from civil rights leaders, the Act did not prohibit most forms of voting discrimination. President Lyndon B. Johnson recognized this, and shortly after the 1964 elections in which Democrats gained overwhelming majorities in both chambers of Congress, he privately instructed Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach to draft \"the goddamndest, toughest voting rights act that you can\". However, Johnson did not publicly push for the legislation at the time; his advisers warned him of political costs for vigorously pursuing a voting rights bill so soon after Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Johnson was concerned that championing voting rights would endanger his Great Society reforms by angering Southern Democrats in Congress.\nFollowing the 1964 elections, civil rights organizations such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) pushed for federal action to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. Their efforts culminated in protests in Alabama, particularly in the city of Selma, where County Sheriff Jim Clark's police force violently resisted African-American voter registration efforts. Speaking about the voting rights push in Selma, James Forman of SNCC said: \"Our strategy, as usual, was to force the U.S. government to intervene in case there were arrests\u2014and if they did not intervene, that inaction would once again prove the government was not on our side and thus intensify the development of a mass consciousness among blacks. Our slogan for this drive was 'One Man, One Vote.'\"\nIn January 1965, Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and other civil rights leaders organized several peaceful demonstrations in Selma, which were violently attacked by police and white counter-protesters. Throughout January and February, these protests received national media coverage and drew attention to the issue of voting rights. King and other demonstrators were arrested during a march on February 1 for violating an anti-parade ordinance; this inspired similar marches in the following days, causing hundreds more to be arrested. On February 4, civil rights leader Malcolm X gave a militant speech in Selma in which he said that many African Americans did not support King's nonviolent approach; he later privately said that he wanted to frighten whites into supporting King. The next day, King was released and a letter he wrote addressing voting rights, \"Letter From A Selma Jail\", appeared in \"The New York Times\".\nWith increasing national attention focused on Selma and voting rights, President Johnson reversed his decision to delay voting rights legislation. On February 6, he announced he would send a proposal to Congress. Johnson did not reveal the proposal's content or disclose when it would come before Congress.\nOn February 18 in Marion, Alabama, state troopers violently broke up a nighttime voting-rights march during which officer James Bonard Fowler shot and killed young African-American protester Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was unarmed and protecting his mother. Spurred by this event, and at the initiation of Bevel, on March 7 SCLC and SNCC began the first of the Selma to Montgomery marches, in which Selma residents intended to march to Alabama's capital, Montgomery, to highlight voting rights issues and present Governor George Wallace with their grievances. On the first march, demonstrators were stopped by state and county police on horseback at the Edmund Pettus Bridge near Selma. The police shot tear gas into the crowd and trampled protesters. Televised footage of the scene, which became known as \"Bloody Sunday\", generated outrage across the country. A second march was held on March 9, which became known as . That evening, three white Unitarian ministers who participated in the march were attacked on the street and beaten with clubs by four Ku Klux Klan members. The worst injured was Reverend James Reeb from Boston, who died on Thursday, March 11.\nIn the wake of the events in Selma, President Johnson, addressing a televised joint session of Congress on March 15, called on legislators to enact expansive voting rights legislation. In his speech, he used the words \"we shall overcome\", adopting the rallying cry of the civil rights movement. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was introduced in Congress two days later while civil rights leaders, now under the protection of federal troops, led a march of 25,000 people from Selma to Montgomery.\nLegislative history.\nEfforts to eliminate discriminatory election practices by litigation on a case-by-case basis by the United States Department of Justice had been unsuccessful and existing federal anti-discrimination laws were not sufficient to overcome the resistance by state officials to enforcement of the 15th Amendment. Against this backdrop Congress came to the conclusion that a new comprehensive federal bill was necessary to break the grip of state disfranchisement. The United States Supreme Court explained this in \"South Carolina v. Katzenbach\" (1966) with the following words:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In recent years, Congress has repeatedly tried to cope with the problem by facilitating case-by-case litigation against voting discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 authorized the Attorney General to seek injunctions against public and private interference with the right to vote on racial grounds. Perfecting amendments in the Civil Rights Act of 1960 permitted the joinder of States as parties defendant, gave the Attorney General access to local voting records, and authorized courts to register voters in areas of systematic discrimination. Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expedited the hearing of voting cases before three-judge courts and outlawed some of the tactics used to disqualify Negroes from voting in federal elections. Despite the earnest efforts of the Justice Department and of many federal judges, these new laws have done little to cure the problem of voting discrimination. [...] The previous legislation has proved ineffective for a number of reasons. Voting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, sometimes requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent combing through registration records in preparation for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded voting officials and others involved in the proceedings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been obtained, some of the States affected have merely switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the federal decrees, or have enacted difficult new tests designed to prolong the existing disparity between white and Negro registration. Alternatively, certain local officials have defied and evaded court orders or have simply closed their registration offices to freeze the voting rolls. The provision of the 1960 law authorizing registration by federal officers has had little impact on local maladministration, because of its procedural complexities.\nIn \"South Carolina v. Katzenbach\" (1966) the Supreme Court also held that Congress had the power to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965 under its Enforcement Powers stemming from the Fifteenth Amendment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Congress exercised its authority under the Fifteenth Amendment in an inventive manner when it enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. First: the measure prescribes remedies for voting discrimination which go into effect without any need for prior adjudication. This was clearly a legitimate response to the problem, for which there is ample precedent under other constitutional provisions. \"See Katzenbach v. McClung,\" 379 U. S. 294, 379 U. S. 302\u2013304; \"United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100,\" 312 U. S. 120\u2013121. Congress had found that case-by-case litigation was inadequate to combat widespread and persistent discrimination in voting, because of the inordinate amount of time and energy required to overcome the obstructionist tactics invariably encountered in these lawsuits. After enduring nearly a century of systematic resistance to the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress might well decide to shift the advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators of the evil to its victims. [...] Second: the Act intentionally confines these remedies to a small number of States and political subdivisions which, in most instances, were familiar to Congress by name. This, too, was a permissible method of dealing with the problem. Congress had learned that substantial voting discrimination presently occurs in certain sections of the country, and it knew no way of accurately forecasting whether the evil might spread elsewhere in the future. In acceptable legislative fashion, Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic areas where immediate action seemed necessary. \"See McGowan v. Maryland,\" 366 U. S. 420, 366 U. S. 427; \"Salsburg v. Maryland,\" 346 U. S. 545, 346 U. S. 550\u2013554. The doctrine of the equality of States, invoked by South Carolina, does not bar this approach, for that doctrine applies only to the terms upon which States are admitted to the Union, and not to the remedies for local evils which have subsequently appeared. \"See Coyle v. Smith,\" 221 U. S. 559, and cases cited therein.\nOriginal bill.\nSenate.\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 was introduced in Congress on March 17, 1965, as S. 1564, and it was jointly sponsored by Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield (D-MT) and Senate minority leader Everett Dirksen (R-IL), both of whom had worked with Attorney General Katzenbach to draft the bill's language. Although Democrats held two-thirds of the seats in both chambers of Congress after the 1964 Senate elections, Johnson worried that Southern Democrats would filibuster the legislation because they had opposed other civil rights efforts. He enlisted Dirksen to help gain Republican support. Dirksen did not originally intend to support voting rights legislation so soon after supporting the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but he expressed willingness to accept \"revolutionary\" legislation after learning about the police violence against marchers in Selma on Bloody Sunday. Given Dirksen's key role in helping Katzenbach draft the legislation, it became known informally as the \"Dirksenbach\" bill. After Mansfield and Dirksen introduced the bill, 64 additional senators agreed to cosponsor it, with a total 46 Democratic and 20 Republican cosponsors.\nThe bill contained several special provisions that targeted certain state and local governments: a \"coverage formula\" that determined which jurisdictions were subject to the Act's other special provisions (\"covered jurisdictions\"); a \"preclearance\" requirement that prohibited covered jurisdictions from implementing changes to their voting procedures without first receiving approval from the U.S. attorney general or the U.S. District Court for D.C. that the changes were not discriminatory; and the suspension of \"tests or devices\", such as literacy tests, in covered jurisdictions. The bill also authorized the assignment of federal examiners to register voters, and of federal observers to monitor elections, to covered jurisdictions that were found to have engaged in egregious discrimination. The bill set these special provisions to expire after five years.\nThe scope of the coverage formula was a matter of contentious congressional debate. The coverage formula reached a jurisdiction if (1) the jurisdiction maintained a \"test or device\" on November 1, 1964, and (2) less than 50 percent of the jurisdiction's voting-age residents either were registered to vote on November 1, 1964, or cast a ballot in the November 1964 presidential election. This formula reached few jurisdictions outside the Deep South. To appease legislators who felt that the bill unfairly targeted Southern jurisdictions, the bill included a general prohibition on racial discrimination in voting that applied nationwide. The bill also included provisions allowing a covered jurisdiction to \"bail out\" of coverage by proving in federal court that it had not used a \"test or device\" for a discriminatory purpose or with a discriminatory effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request. Additionally, the bill included a \"bail in\" provision under which federal courts could subject discriminatory non-covered jurisdictions to remedies contained in the special provisions.\nThe bill was first considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, whose chair, Senator James Eastland (D-MS), opposed the legislation with several other Southern senators on the committee. To prevent the bill from dying in committee, Mansfield proposed a motion to require the Judiciary Committee to report the bill out of committee by April 9, which the Senate overwhelmingly passed by a vote of 67 to 13. During the committee's consideration of the bill, Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA) led an effort to amend the bill to prohibit poll taxes. Although the Twenty-fourth Amendment\u2014which banned the use of poll taxes in federal elections\u2014 was ratified a year earlier, Johnson's administration and the bill's sponsors did not include a provision in the voting rights bill banning poll taxes in \"state\" elections because they feared courts would strike down the legislation as unconstitutional. Additionally, by excluding poll taxes from the definition of \"tests or devices\", the coverage formula did not reach Texas or Arkansas, mitigating opposition from those two states' influential congressional delegations. Nonetheless, with the support of liberal committee members, Kennedy's amendment to prohibit poll taxes passed by a 9\u20134 vote. In response, Dirksen offered an amendment that exempted from the coverage formula any state that had at least 60 percent of its eligible residents registered to vote or that had a voter turnout that surpassed the national average in the preceding presidential election. This amendment, which effectively exempted all states from coverage except Mississippi, passed during a committee meeting in which three liberal members were absent. Dirksen offered to drop the amendment if the poll tax ban were removed. Ultimately, the bill was reported out of committee on April 9 by a 12\u20134 vote without a recommendation.\nOn April 22, the full Senate started debating the bill. Dirksen spoke first on the bill's behalf, saying that \"legislation is needed if the unequivocal mandate of the Fifteenth Amendment\u00a0... is to be enforced and made effective, and if the Declaration of Independence is to be made truly meaningful.\" Senator Strom Thurmond (D-SC) retorted that the bill would lead to \"despotism and tyranny\", and Senator Sam Ervin (D-NC) argued that the bill was unconstitutional because it deprived states of their right under to establish voter qualifications and because the bill's special provisions targeted only certain jurisdictions. On May 6, Ervin offered an amendment to abolish the coverage formula's automatic trigger and instead allow federal judges to appoint federal examiners to administer voter registration. This amendment overwhelmingly failed, with 42 Democrats and 22 Republicans voting against it. After lengthy debate, Ted Kennedy's amendment to prohibit poll taxes also failed 49\u201345 on May 11. However, the Senate agreed to include a provision authorizing the attorney general to sue any jurisdiction, covered or non-covered, to challenge its use of poll taxes. An amendment offered by Senator Robert F. Kennedy (D-NY) to enfranchise English-illiterate citizens who had attained at least a sixth-grade education in a non-English-speaking school also passed by 48\u201319. Southern legislators offered a series of amendments to weaken the bill, all of which failed.\nOn May 25, the Senate voted for cloture by a 70\u201330 vote, thus overcoming the threat of filibuster and limiting further debate on the bill. On May 26, the Senate passed the bill by a 77\u201319 vote (Democrats 47\u201316, Republicans 30\u20132); only senators representing Southern states voted against it.\nHouse of Representatives.\nEmanuel Celler (D-NY), Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced the Voting Rights Act in the House of Representatives on March 19, 1965, as H.R. 6400. The House Judiciary Committee was the first committee to consider the bill. The committee's ranking Republican, William McCulloch (R-OH), generally supported expanding voting rights, but he opposed both the poll tax ban and the coverage formula, and he led opposition to the bill in committee. The committee eventually approved the bill on May 12, but it did not file its committee report until June 1. The bill included two amendments from subcommittee: a penalty for private persons who interfered with the right to vote and a prohibition of all poll taxes. The poll tax prohibition gained Speaker of the House John McCormack's support. The bill was next considered by the Rules Committee, whose chair, Howard W. Smith (D-VA), opposed the bill and delayed its consideration until June 24, when Celler initiated proceedings to have the bill discharged from committee. Under pressure from the bill's proponents, Smith allowed the bill to be released a week later, and the full House started debating the bill on July 6.\nTo defeat the Voting Rights Act, McCulloch introduced an alternative bill, H.R. 7896. It would have allowed the attorney general to appoint federal registrars after receiving 25 serious complaints of discrimination against a jurisdiction, and it would have imposed a nationwide ban on literacy tests for persons who could prove they attained a sixth-grade education. McCulloch's bill was co-sponsored by House minority leader Gerald Ford (R-MI) and supported by Southern Democrats as an alternative to the Voting Rights Act. The Johnson administration viewed H.R. 7896 as a serious threat to passing the Voting Rights Act. However, support for H.R. 7896 dissipated after William M. Tuck (D-VA) publicly said he preferred H.R. 7896 because the Voting Rights Act would legitimately ensure that African Americans could vote. His statement alienated most supporters of H.R. 7896, and the bill failed on the House floor by a 171\u2013248 vote on July 9. Later that night, the House passed the Voting Rights Act by a 333\u201385 vote (Democrats 221\u201361, Republicans 112\u201324).\nConference committee.\nThe chambers appointed a conference committee to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. A major contention concerned the poll tax provisions; the Senate version allowed the attorney general to sue states that used poll taxes to discriminate, while the House version outright banned all poll taxes. Initially, the committee members were stalemated. To help broker a compromise, Attorney General Katzenbach drafted legislative language explicitly asserting that poll taxes were unconstitutional and instructed the Department of Justice to sue the states that maintained poll taxes. To assuage concerns of liberal committee members that this provision was not strong enough, Katzenbach enlisted the help of Martin Luther King Jr., who gave his support to the compromise. King's endorsement ended the stalemate, and on July 29, the conference committee reported its version out of committee. The House approved this conference report version of the bill on August 3 by a 328\u201374 vote (Democrats 217\u201354, Republicans 111\u201320), and the Senate passed it on August 4 by a 79\u201318 vote (Democrats 49\u201317, Republicans 30\u20131). On August 6, President Johnson signed the Act into law with King, Rosa Parks, John Lewis, and other civil rights leaders in attendance at the signing ceremony.\nAmendments.\nCongress enacted major amendments to the Act in 1970, 1975, 1982, 1992, and 2006. Each amendment coincided with an impending expiration of some or all of the Act's special provisions. Originally set to expire by 1970, Congress repeatedly reauthorized the special provisions in recognition of continuing voting discrimination. Congress extended the coverage formula and special provisions tied to it, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, for five years in 1970, seven years in 1975, and 25 years in both 1982 and 2006. In 1970 and 1975, Congress also expanded the reach of the coverage formula by supplementing it with new 1968 and 1972 trigger dates. Coverage was further enlarged in 1975 when Congress expanded the meaning of \"tests or devices\" to encompass any jurisdiction that provided English-only election information, such as ballots, if the jurisdiction had a single language minority group that constituted more than five percent of the jurisdiction's voting-age citizens. These expansions brought numerous jurisdictions into coverage, including many outside of the South. To ease the burdens of the reauthorized special provisions, Congress liberalized the bailout procedure in 1982 by allowing jurisdictions to escape coverage by complying with the Act and affirmatively acting to expand minority political participation.\nIn addition to reauthorizing the original special provisions and expanding coverage, Congress amended and added several other provisions to the Act. For instance, Congress expanded the original ban on \"tests or devices\" to apply nationwide in 1970, and in 1975, Congress made the ban permanent. Separately, in 1975 Congress expanded the Act's scope to protect language minorities from voting discrimination. Congress defined \"language minority\" to mean \"persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage.\" Congress amended various provisions, such as the preclearance requirement and Section 2's general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws, to prohibit discrimination against language minorities. Congress also enacted a bilingual election requirement in Section 203, which requires election officials in certain jurisdictions with large numbers of English-illiterate language minorities to provide ballots and voting information in the language of the language minority group. Originally set to expire after 10 years, Congress reauthorized Section 203 in 1982 for seven years, expanded and reauthorized it in 1992 for 15 years, and reauthorized it in 2006 for 25 years. The bilingual election requirements have remained controversial, with proponents arguing that bilingual assistance is necessary to enable recently naturalized citizens to vote and opponents arguing that the bilingual election requirements constitute costly unfunded mandates.\nSeveral of the amendments responded to judicial rulings with which Congress disagreed. In 1982, Congress amended the Act to overturn the Supreme Court case \"Mobile v. Bolden\" (1980), which held that the general prohibition of voting discrimination prescribed in Section 2 prohibited only \"purposeful\" discrimination. Congress responded by expanding Section 2 to explicitly ban any voting practice that had a discriminatory \"effect\", regardless of whether the practice was enacted or operated for a discriminatory purpose. The creation of this \"results test\" shifted the majority of vote dilution litigation brought under the Act from preclearance lawsuits to Section 2 lawsuits. In 2006, Congress amended the Act to overturn two Supreme Court cases: \"Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board\" (2000), which interpreted the Section 5 preclearance requirement to prohibit only voting changes that were enacted or maintained for a \"retrogressive\" discriminatory purpose instead of any discriminatory purpose, and \"Georgia v. Ashcroft\" (2003), which established a broader test for determining whether a redistricting plan had an impermissible effect under Section 5 than assessing only whether a minority group could elect its preferred candidates. Since the Supreme Court struck down the coverage formula as unconstitutional in \"Shelby County v. Holder\" (2013), several bills have been introduced in Congress to create a new coverage formula and amend various other provisions; none of these bills have passed.\nProvisions.\nThe act contains two types of provisions: \"general provisions\", which apply nationwide, and \"special provisions\", which apply to only certain states and local governments. \"The Voting Rights Act was aimed at the subtle, as well as the obvious, state regulations which have the effect of denying citizens their right to vote because of their race. Moreover, compatible with the decisions of this Court, the Act gives a broad interpretation to the right to vote, recognizing that voting includes \"all action necessary to make a vote effective.\" 79 Stat. 445, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 19731(c)(1) (1969 ed., Supp. I). See \"Reynolds v. Sims\", 377 U. S. 533, 377 U. S. 555 (1964).\" Most provisions are designed to protect the voting rights of racial and language minorities. The term \"language minority\" means \"persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives or of Spanish heritage.\" The act's provisions have been colored by numerous judicial interpretations and congressional amendments.\nSection 2 prohibits any jurisdiction from implementing a \"voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure\u00a0... in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right\u00a0... to vote on account of race,\" color, or language minority status. Section 2 of the law contains two separate protections against voter discrimination for laws which, in contrast to Section 5 of the law, are already implemented. The first protection is a prohibition of intentional discrimination based on race or color in voting. The second protection is a prohibition of election practices that result in the denial or abridgment of the right to vote based on race or color. If the violation of the second protection is intentional, then this violation is also a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court has allowed private plaintiffs to sue to enforce these prohibitions. In \"Mobile v. Bolden\" (1980), the Supreme Court held that as originally enacted in 1965, Section 2 simply restated the Fifteenth Amendment and thus prohibited only those voting laws that were \"intentionally\" enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose. In 1982, Congress amended Section 2 to create a \"results\" test, which prohibits any voting law that has a discriminatory effect irrespective of whether the law was intentionally enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose. The 1982 amendments stipulated that the results test does not guarantee protected minorities a right to proportional representation. In \"Thornburg v. Gingles\" (1986) the United States Supreme Court explained with respect to the 1982 amendment for section 2 that the \"essence of a Section 2 claim is that a certain electoral law, practice, or structure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause an inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white voters to elect their preferred representatives.\" The United States Department of Justice declared that section 2 is not only a permanent and nationwide-applying prohibition against discrimination in voting to any voting standard, practice, or procedure that results in the denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, but also a prohibition for state and local officials to adopt or maintain voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.\nThe United States Supreme Court expressed its views regarding Section 2 and its amendment from 1982 in \"Chisom v. Roemer\" (1991). Under the amended statute, proof of intent is no longer required to prove a \u00a7 2 violation. Now plaintiffs can prevail under \u00a7 2 by demonstrating that a challenged election practice has resulted in the denial or abridgement of the right to vote based on color or race. Congress not only incorporated the results test in the paragraph that formerly constituted the entire \u00a7 2, but also designated that paragraph as subsection (a) and added a new subsection (b) to make clear that an application of the results test requires an inquiry into \"the totality of the circumstances.\" Section 2(a) adopts a results test, thus providing that proof of discriminatory intent is no longer necessary to establish any violation of the section. Section 2(b) provides guidance about how the results test is to be applied. There is a statutory framework to determine whether a jurisdiction's election law violates the general prohibition from Section 2 in its amended form:\nSection 2 prohibits voting practices that \"result[] in a denial or abridgment of the right * * * to vote on account of race or color [or language-minority status],\" and it states that such a result \"is established\" if a jurisdiction\u2019s \"political processes * * * are not equally open\" to members of such a group \"in that [they] have less opportunity * * * to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\" https://. [...] Subsection (b) states in relevant part:\nA violation of subsection (a) is established if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\nThe Office of the Arizona Attorney General stated with respect to the framework to determine whether a jurisdiction's election law violates the general prohibition from Section 2 in its amended form and the reason for the adoption of Section 2 in its amended form:\nTo establish a violation of amended Section 2, the plaintiff must prove,\"based on the totality of circumstances,\" that the State\u2019s \"political processes\" are \"not equally open to participation by members\" of a protected class, \"in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\" \u00a7 10301(b). That is the \"result\" that amended Section 2 prohibits: \"less \"opportunity\" than other members of the electorate,\" viewing the State\u2019s \"political processes\" as a whole. The new language was crafted as a compromise designed to eliminate the need for direct evidence of discriminatory intent, which is often difficult to obtain, but without embracing an unqualified \"disparate impact\" test that would invalidate many legitimate voting procedures. S. REP. NO. 97\u2013417, at 28\u201329, 31\u201332, 99 (1982)\nIn \"Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee\" (2021) the United States Supreme Court introduced the means to review Section 2 challenges. The slip opinion stated in its Syllabus section in this regard that \"The Court declines in these cases to announce a test to govern all VRA [Section 2] challenges to rules that specify the time, place, or manner for casting ballots. It is sufficient for present purposes to identify certain guideposts that lead to the Court's decision in these cases.\" The Court laid out these guideposts used to evaluate the state regulations in context of Section 2, which included: the size of the burden created by the rule, the degree which the rule deviates from past practices, the size of the racial imbalance, and the overall level of opportunity afforded voters in considering all election rules.\nWhen determining whether a jurisdiction's election law violates the general prohibition from Section 2 of the VRA, courts have relied on factors enumerated in the Senate Judiciary Committee report associated with the 1982 amendments (\"Senate Factors\"), including:\nThe report indicates not all or a majority of these factors need to exist for an electoral device to result in discrimination, and it also indicates that this list is not exhaustive, allowing courts to consider additional evidence at their discretion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n No right is more precious in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to vote is undermined. Our Constitution leaves no room for classification of people in a way that unnecessarily abridges this right.\n\u2014 Justice Black on the right to vote as the foundation of democracy in \"Wesberry v. Sanders\" (1964).\nSection 2 prohibits two types of discrimination: \"vote denial\", in which a person is denied the opportunity to cast a ballot or to have their vote properly counted, and \"vote dilution\", in which the strength or effectiveness of a person's vote is diminished. Most Section 2 litigation has concerned vote dilution, especially claims that a jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large/multimember elections prevents minority voters from casting sufficient votes to elect their preferred candidates. An at-large election can dilute the votes cast by minority voters by allowing a cohesive majority group to win every legislative seat in the jurisdiction. Redistricting plans can be gerrymandered to dilute votes cast by minorities by \"packing\" high numbers of minority voters into a small number of districts or \"cracking\" minority groups by placing small numbers of minority voters into a large number of districts.\nIn \"Thornburg v. Gingles\" (1986), the Supreme Court used the term \"vote dilution through submergence\" to describe claims that a jurisdiction's use of an at-large/multimember election system or gerrymandered redistricting plan diluted minority votes, and it established a legal framework for assessing such claims under Section 2. Under the \"Gingles\" test, plaintiffs must show the existence of three preconditions:\nThe first precondition is known as the \"compactness\" requirement and concerns whether a majority-minority district can be created. The second and third preconditions are collectively known as the \"racially polarized voting\" or \"racial bloc voting\" requirement, and they concern whether the voting patterns of the different racial groups are different from each other. If a plaintiff proves these preconditions exist, then the plaintiff must additionally show, using the remaining Senate Factors and other evidence, that under the \"totality of the circumstances\", the jurisdiction's redistricting plan or use of at-large or multimember elections diminishes the ability of the minority group to elect candidates of its choice.\nSubsequent litigation further defined the contours of these \"vote dilution through submergence\" claims. In \"Bartlett v. Strickland\" (2009), the Supreme Court held that the first \"Gingles\" precondition can be satisfied \"only\" if a district can be drawn in which the minority group comprises a majority of voting-age citizens. This means that plaintiffs cannot succeed on a submergence claim in jurisdictions where the size of the minority group, despite not being large enough to comprise a majority in a district, is large enough for its members to elect their preferred candidates with the help of \"crossover\" votes from some members of the majority group. In contrast, the Supreme Court has not addressed whether different protected minority groups can be aggregated to satisfy the \"Gingles\" preconditions as a coalition, and lower courts have split on the issue.\nThe Supreme Court provided additional guidance on the \"totality of the circumstances\" test in \"Johnson v. De Grandy\" (1994). The court emphasized that the existence of the three \"Gingles\" preconditions may be insufficient to prove liability for vote dilution through submergence if other factors weigh against such a determination, especially in lawsuits challenging redistricting plans. In particular, the court held that even where the three \"Gingles\" preconditions are satisfied, a jurisdiction is unlikely to be liable for vote dilution if its redistricting plan contains a number of majority-minority districts that is proportional to the minority group's population size. The decision thus clarified that Section 2 does not require jurisdictions to maximize the number of majority-minority districts. The opinion also distinguished the proportionality of majority-minority districts, which allows minorities to have a proportional \"opportunity\" to elect their candidates of choice, from the proportionality of election \"results\", which Section 2 explicitly does not guarantee to minorities.\nAn issue regarding the third \"Gingles\" precondition remains unresolved. In \"Gingles\", the Supreme Court split as to whether plaintiffs must prove that the majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members are motivated to vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race, such as party affiliation. A plurality of justices said that requiring such proof would violate Congress's intent to make Section 2 a \"results\" test, but Justice White maintained that the proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results in \"racial\" discrimination. Since \"Gingles\", lower courts have split on the issue.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government. And the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise. [...] Undoubtedly, the right of suffrage is a fundamental matter in a free and democratic society. Especially since the right to exercise the franchise in a free and unimpaired manner is preservative of other basic civil and political rights, any alleged infringement of the right of citizens to vote must be carefully and meticulously scrutinized.\n \u2014 Chief Justice Earl Warren on the right to vote as the foundation of democracy in \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964).\nAlthough most Section 2 litigation has involved claims of vote dilution through submergence, courts also have addressed other types of vote dilution under this provision. In \"Holder v. Hall\" (1994), the Supreme Court held that claims that minority votes are diluted by the small size of a governing body, such as a one-person county commission, may not be brought under Section 2. A plurality of the court reasoned that no uniform, non-dilutive \"benchmark\" size for a governing body exists, making relief under Section 2 impossible. Another type of vote dilution may result from a jurisdiction's requirement that a candidate be elected by a majority vote. A majority-vote requirement may cause a minority group's candidate of choice, who would have won the election with a simple plurality of votes, to lose after a majority of voters unite behind another candidate in a runoff election. The Supreme Court has not addressed whether such claims may be brought under Section 2, and lower courts have reached different conclusions on the issue.\nIn addition to claims of vote dilution, courts have considered vote denial claims brought under Section 2. The Supreme Court, in \"Richardson v. Ramirez\" (1974), held that felony disenfranchisement laws cannot violate Section 2 because, among other reasons, Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment permits such laws. A federal district court in Mississippi held that a \"dual registration\" system that requires a person to register to vote separately for state elections and local elections may violate Section 2 if the system has a racially disparate impact in light of the Senate Factors. Starting in 2013, lower federal courts began to consider various challenges to voter ID laws brought under Section 2.\nSpecific prohibitions.\nThe act contains several specific prohibitions on conduct that may interfere with a person's ability to cast an effective vote. One of these prohibitions is prescribed in Section 201, which prohibits any jurisdiction from requiring a person to comply with any \"test or device\" to register to vote or cast a ballot. The term \"test or device\" is defined as literacy tests, educational or knowledge requirements, proof of good moral character, and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting. Before the Act's enactment, these devices were the primary tools used by jurisdictions to prevent racial minorities from voting. Originally, the Act suspended tests or devices temporarily in jurisdictions covered by the Section 4(b) coverage formula, but Congress subsequently expanded the prohibition to the entire country and made it permanent. Relatedly, Section 202 prohibits jurisdictions from imposing any \"durational residency requirement\" that requires persons to have lived in the jurisdiction for more than 30 days before being eligible to vote in a presidential election.\nSeveral further protections for voters are contained in Section 11. Section 11(a) prohibits any person acting under color of law from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to vote or to count a qualified voter's ballot. Similarly, Section 11(b) prohibits any person from intimidating, harassing, or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote. Two provisions in Section 11 address voter fraud: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election, and Section 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.\nFinally, under Section 208, a jurisdiction may not prevent anyone who is English-illiterate or has a disability from being accompanied into the ballot box by an assistant of the person's choice. The only exceptions are that the assistant may not be an agent of the person's employer or union.\nBail-in.\nSection 3(c) contains a \"bail-in\" or \"pocket trigger\" process by which jurisdictions that fall outside the coverage formula of Section 4(b) may become subject to preclearance. Under this provision, if a jurisdiction has racially discriminated against voters in violation of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments, a court may order the jurisdiction to have future changes to its election laws preapproved by the federal government. Because courts have interpreted the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to prohibit only intentional discrimination, a court may bail in a jurisdiction only if the plaintiff proves that the jurisdiction enacted or operated a voting practice to purposely discriminate.\nSection 3(c) contains its own preclearance language and differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction until such time as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance for as long as the court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.\nDuring the Act's early history, Section 3(c) was little used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, including 16 local governments and the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in \"Shelby County v. Holder\" (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following \"Shelby County\", courts began to consider requests by the attorney general and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 a federal court bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.\nA more narrow bail-in process pertaining to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, a federal court may certify a non-covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers if the court determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. Jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under Section 3(a) are not subject to preclearance.\nSpecial provisions.\nCoverage formula.\nSection 4(b) contains a \"coverage formula\" that determines which states and local governments may be subjected to the Act's other special provisions (except for the Section 203(c) bilingual election requirements, which fall under a different formula). Congress intended for the coverage formula to encompass the most pervasively discriminatory jurisdictions. A jurisdiction is covered by the formula if:\nAs originally enacted, the coverage formula contained only November 1964 triggering dates; subsequent revisions to the law supplemented it with the additional triggering dates of November 1968 and November 1972, which brought more jurisdictions into coverage. For purposes of the coverage formula, the term \"test or device\" includes the same four devices prohibited nationally by Section 201\u2014literacy tests, educational or knowledge requirements, proof of good moral character, and requirements that a person be vouched for when voting\u2014and one further device defined in Section 4(f)(3): in jurisdictions where more than five percent of the citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group, any practice or requirement by which registration or election materials are provided only in English. The types of jurisdictions that the coverage formula applies to include states and \"political subdivisions\" of states. Section 14(c)(2) defines \"political subdivision\" to mean any county, parish, or \"other subdivision of a State which conducts registration for voting.\"\nAs Congress added new triggering dates to the coverage formula, new jurisdictions were brought into coverage. The 1965 coverage formula included the whole of Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia; and some subdivisions (mostly counties) in Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, and North Carolina. The 1968 coverage resulted in the partial coverage of Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Wyoming. Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, and Wyoming filed successful \"bailout\" lawsuits, as also provided by section 4. The 1972 coverage covered the whole of Alaska, Arizona, and Texas, and parts of California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Dakota.\nThe special provisions of the Act were initially due to expire in 1970, and Congress renewed them for another five years. In 1975, the Act's special provisions were extended for another seven years. In 1982, the coverage formula was extended again, this time for 25 years, but no changes were made to the coverage formula, and in 2006, the coverage formula was again extended for 25 years.\nThroughout its history, the coverage formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions for scrutiny, most of which were in the Deep South. In \"Shelby County v. Holder\" (2013), the Supreme Court declared the coverage formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism. The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are unenforceable.\nPreclearance requirement.\nSection 5 requires that covered jurisdictions receive federal approval, known as \"preclearance\", before implementing changes to their election laws. A covered jurisdiction has the burden of proving that the change does not have the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of race or language minority status; if the jurisdiction fails to meet this burden, the federal government will deny preclearance and the jurisdiction's change will not go into effect. The Supreme Court broadly interpreted Section 5's scope in \"Allen v. State Board of Election\" (1969), holding that any change in a jurisdiction's voting practices, even if minor, must be submitted for preclearance. The court also held that if a jurisdiction fails to have its voting change precleared, private plaintiffs may sue the jurisdiction in the plaintiff's local district court before a three-judge panel. In these Section 5 \"enforcement actions\", a court considers whether the jurisdiction made a covered voting change, and if so, whether the change had been precleared. If the jurisdiction improperly failed to obtain preclearance, the court will order the jurisdiction to obtain preclearance before implementing the change. However, the court may not consider the merits of whether the change should be approved.\nJurisdictions may seek preclearance through either an \"administrative preclearance\" process or a \"judicial preclearance\" process. If a jurisdiction seeks administrative preclearance, the attorney general will consider whether the proposed change has a discriminatory purpose or effect. After the jurisdiction submits the proposed change, the attorney general has 60 days to interpose an objection to it. The 60-day period may be extended an additional 60 days if the jurisdiction later submits additional information. If the attorney general interposes an objection, then the change is not precleared and may not be implemented. The attorney general's decision is not subject to judicial review, but if the attorney general interposes an objection, the jurisdiction may independently seek judicial preclearance, and the court may disregard the attorney general's objection at its discretion. If a jurisdiction seeks judicial preclearance, it must file a declaratory judgment action against the attorney general in the U.S. District Court for D.C. A three-judge panel will consider whether the voting change has a discriminatory purpose or effect, and the losing party may appeal directly to the Supreme Court. Private parties may intervene in judicial preclearance lawsuits.\nIn several cases, the Supreme Court has addressed the meaning of \"discriminatory effect\" and \"discriminatory purpose\" for Section 5 purposes. In \"Beer v. United States\" (1976), the court held that for a voting change to have a prohibited discriminatory effect, it must result in \"retrogression\" (backsliding). Under this standard, a voting change that causes discrimination, but does not result in \"more\" discrimination than before the change was made, cannot be denied preclearance for having a discriminatory effect. For example, replacing a poll tax with an equally expensive voter registration fee is not a \"retrogressive\" change because it causes equal discrimination, not more. Relying on the Senate report for the Act, the court reasoned that the retrogression standard was the correct interpretation of the term \"discriminatory effect\" because Section 5's purpose is \" 'to insure that [the gains thus far achieved in minority political participation] shall not be destroyed through new [discriminatory] procedures' \". The retrogression standard applies irrespective of whether the voting change allegedly causes vote denial or vote dilution.\nIn 2003, the Supreme Court held in \"Georgia v. Ashcroft\" that courts should not determine that a new redistricting plan has a retrogressive effect solely because the plan decreases the number of minority-majority districts. The court emphasized that judges should analyze various other factors under the \"totality of the circumstances\", such as whether the redistricting plan increases the number of \"influence districts\" in which a minority group is large enough to influence (but not decide) election outcomes. In 2006, Congress overturned this decision by amending Section 5 to explicitly state that \"diminishing the ability [of a protected minority] to elect their preferred candidates of choice denies or abridges the right to vote within the meaning of\" Section 5. Uncertainty remains as to what this language precisely means and how courts may interpret it.\nBefore 2000, the \"discriminatory purpose\" prong of Section 5 was understood to mean \"any\" discriminatory purpose, which is the same standard used to determine whether discrimination is unconstitutional. In \"Reno v. Bossier Parish\" (\"Bossier Parish II\") (2000), the Supreme Court extended the retrogression standard, holding that for a voting change to have a \"discriminatory purpose\" under Section 5, the change must have been implemented for a \"retrogressive\" purpose. Therefore, a voting change intended to discriminate against a protected minority was permissible under Section 5 so long as the change was not intended to increase existing discrimination. This change significantly reduced the number of instances in which preclearance was denied based on discriminatory purpose. In 2006, Congress overturned \"Bossier Parish II\" by amending Section 5 to explicitly define \"purpose\" to mean \"any discriminatory purpose.\"\nFederal examiners and observers.\nUntil the 2006 amendments to the Act, Section 6 allowed the appointment of \"federal examiners\" to oversee certain jurisdictions' voter registration functions. Federal examiners could be assigned to a covered jurisdiction if the attorney general certified that\nFederal examiners had the authority to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.\nUnder the Act's original framework, in any jurisdiction certified for federal examiners, the attorney general could additionally require the appointment of \"federal observers\". By 2006, the federal examiner provision was used solely as a means to appoint federal observers. When Congress repealed the federal examiner provision in 2006, Congress amended Section 8 to allow for the assignment of federal observers to jurisdictions that satisfied the same certification criteria that had been used to appoint federal examiners.\nFederal observers are tasked with observing poll worker and voter conduct at polling places during an election and observing election officials tabulate the ballots. The goal of the federal observer provision is to facilitate minority voter participation by deterring and documenting instances of discriminatory conduct in the election process, such as election officials denying qualified minority persons the right to cast a ballot, intimidation or harassment of voters on election day, or improper vote counting. Discriminatory conduct that federal observers document may also serve as evidence in subsequent enforcement lawsuits. Between 1965 and the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in \"Shelby County v. Holder\" to strike down the coverage formula, the attorney general certified 153 local governments across 11 states. Because of time and resource constraints, federal observers are not assigned to every certified jurisdiction for every election. Separate provisions allow for a certified jurisdiction to \"bail out\" of its certification.\nBailout.\nUnder Section 4(a), a covered jurisdiction may seek exemption from coverage through a process called \"bailout.\" To achieve an exemption, a covered jurisdiction must obtain a declaratory judgment from a three-judge panel of the District Court for D.C. that the jurisdiction is eligible to bail out. As originally enacted, a covered jurisdiction was eligible to bail out if it had not used a test or device with a discriminatory purpose or effect during the 5 years preceding its bailout request. Therefore, a jurisdiction that requested to bail out in 1967 would have needed to prove that it had not misused a test or device since at least 1962. Until 1970, this effectively required a covered jurisdiction to prove that it had not misused a test or device since before the Act was enacted five years earlier in 1965, making it impossible for many covered jurisdictions to bail out. However, Section 4(a) also prohibited covered jurisdictions from using tests or devices in any manner, discriminatory or otherwise; hence, under the original act, a covered jurisdiction would become eligible for bailout in 1970 by simply complying with this requirement. But in the course of amending the Act in 1970 and 1975 to extend the special provisions, Congress also extended the period of time that a covered jurisdiction must not have misused a test or device to 10 years and then to 17 years, respectively. These extensions continued the effect of requiring jurisdictions to prove that they had not misused a test or device since before the Act's enactment in 1965.\nIn 1982, Congress amended Section 4(a) to make bailout easier to achieve in two ways. First, Congress provided that if a state is covered, local governments in that state may bail out even if the state is ineligible to bail out. Second, Congress liberalized the eligibility criteria by replacing the 17-year requirement with a new standard, allowing a covered jurisdiction to bail out by proving that in the 10 years preceding its bailout request:\nAdditionally, Congress required jurisdictions seeking bailout to produce evidence of minority registration and voting rates, including how these rates have changed over time and in comparison to the registration and voting rates of the majority. If the court determines that the covered jurisdiction is eligible for bailout, it will enter a declaratory judgment in the jurisdiction's favor. The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination.\nThe 1982 amendment to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the attorney general consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out after the Supreme Court's opinion in \"Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder\" (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters have the ability to bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in \"Shelby County v. Holder\" (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.\nSeparate provisions allow a covered jurisdiction that has been certified to receive federal observers to bail out of its certification alone. Under Section 13, the attorney general may terminate the certification of a jurisdiction if 1) more than 50 percent of the jurisdiction's minority voting age population is registered to vote, and 2) there is no longer reasonable cause to believe that residents may experience voting discrimination. Alternatively, the District Court for D.C. may order the certification terminated.\nBilingual election requirements.\nTwo provisions require certain jurisdictions to provide election materials to voters in multiple languages: Section 4(f)(4) and Section 203(c). A jurisdiction covered by either provision must provide all materials related to an election\u2014such as voter registration materials, ballots, notices, and instructions\u2014in the language of any applicable language minority group residing in the jurisdiction. Language minority groups protected by these provisions include Asian Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Alaskans. Congress enacted the provisions to break down language barriers and combat pervasive language discrimination against the protected groups.\nSection 4(f)(4) applies to any jurisdiction encompassed by the Section 4(b) coverage formula where more than five percent of the citizen voting age population are members of a single language minority group. Section 203(c) contains a formula that is separate from the Section 4(b) coverage formula, and therefore jurisdictions covered solely by 203(c) are not subject to the Act's other special provisions, such as preclearance. The Section 203(c) formula encompasses jurisdictions where the following conditions exist:\nSection 203(b) defines \"limited-English proficient\" as being \"unable to speak or understand English adequately enough to participate in the electoral process\". Determinations as to which jurisdictions satisfy the Section 203(c) criteria occur once a decade following completion of the decennial census; at these times, new jurisdictions may come into coverage while others may have their coverage terminated. Additionally, under Section 203(d), a jurisdiction may \"bail out\" of Section 203(c) coverage by proving in federal court that no language minority group within the jurisdiction has an English illiteracy rate that is higher than the national illiteracy rate. After the 2010 census, 150 jurisdictions across 25 states were covered under Section 203(c), including statewide coverage of California, Texas, and Florida.\nImpact.\n\"The Voting Rights Act had an immediate impact. By the end of 1965, a quarter of a million new Black voters had been registered, one-third by federal examiners. By the end of 1966, only four out of 13 southern states had fewer than 50 percent of African Americans registered to vote.\" After its enactment in 1965, the law immediately decreased racial discrimination in voting. The suspension of literacy tests and the assignments of federal examiners and observers allowed for high numbers of racial minorities to register to vote. Nearly 250,000 African Americans registered in 1965, one-third of whom were registered by federal examiners. In covered jurisdictions, less than one-third (29.3 percent) of the African American population was registered in 1965; by 1967, this number increased to more than half (52.1 percent), and a majority of African American residents became registered to vote in 9 of the 13 Southern states. Similar increases were seen in the number of African Americans elected to office: between 1965 and 1985, African Americans elected as state legislators in the 11 former Confederate states increased from 3 to 176. Nationwide, the number of African American elected officials increased from 1,469 in 1970 to 4,912 in 1980. By 2011, the number was approximately 10,500. Similarly, registration rates for language minority groups increased after Congress enacted the bilingual election requirements in 1975 and amended them in 1992. In 1973, the percent of Hispanics registered to vote was 34.9 percent; by 2006, that amount nearly doubled. The number of Asian Americans registered to vote in 1996 increased 58 percent by 2006.\nAfter the Act's initial success in combating tactics designed to deny minorities access to the polls, the Act became predominately used as a tool to challenge racial vote dilution. Starting in the 1970s, the attorney general commonly raised Section 5 objections to voting changes that decreased the effectiveness of racial minorities' votes, including discriminatory annexations, redistricting plans, and election methods such as at-large election systems, runoff election requirements, and prohibitions on bullet voting. In total, 81 percent (2,541) of preclearance objections made between 1965 and 2006 were based on vote dilution. Claims brought under Section 2 have also predominately concerned vote dilution. Between the 1982 creation of the Section 2 results test and 2006, at least 331 Section 2 lawsuits resulted in published judicial opinions. In the 1980s, 60 percent of Section 2 lawsuits challenged at-large election systems; in the 1990s, 37.2 percent challenged at-large election systems and 38.5 percent challenged redistricting plans. Overall, plaintiffs succeeded in 37.2 percent of the 331 lawsuits, and they were more likely to succeed in lawsuits brought against covered jurisdictions.\nBy enfranchising racial minorities, the Act facilitated a political realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, Black disenfranchisement enabled the Democratic Party to dominate Southern politics. After Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised Black voters began to push the Democratic Party to the left throughout the South; this in turn pushed Southern white conservatives to switch their support from the Democratic to Republican party. This trend caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, with the Democratic Party becoming more Liberal and the Republican Party becoming more Conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.\nResearch shows that the Act successfully and massively increased voter turnout and voter registration, in particular among African Americans. The act has also been linked to concrete outcomes, such as greater public goods provision (such as public education) for areas with higher black population shares and more members of Congress who vote for civil rights-related legislation. A 2016 study in the \"American Journal of Political Science\" found \"that members of Congress who represented jurisdictions subject to the preclearance requirement were substantially more supportive of civil rights-related legislation than legislators who did not represent covered jurisdictions.\" A 2013 \"Quarterly Journal of Economics\" study found that the Act boosted voter turnout and increases in public goods transfers from state governments to localities with higher black population. A 2018 study in \"The Journal of Politics\" found that Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act \"increased black voter registration by 14\u201319 percentage points, white registration by 10\u201313 percentage points, and overall voter turnout by 10\u201319 percentage points. Additional results for Democratic vote share suggest that some of this overall increase in turnout may have come from reactionary whites.\" A 2019 study in the \"American Economic Journal\" found that preclearance substantially increased turnout among minorities, even as far as to 2012 (the year prior to the Supreme Court ruling ending preclearance). The study estimates that preclearance led to an increase in minority turnout of 17 percentage points. A 2020 study found that the jurisdictions which had previously been covered by preclearance massively increased the rate of voter registration purges after the 2013 United States Supreme Court \"Shelby County v. Holder\" decision in which the \"coverage formula\" in Section 4(b) of the VRA that determined which jurisdictions had to presubmit changes in their election policies for federal approval was struck down. Another 2020 study found that VRA coverage halved the incidence and the onset of political violence.\nIn a 5\u20134 decision in \"Shelby County v. Holder\" (2013), the Supreme Court struck down Section 4(b) as unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the coverage formula violates the constitutional principles of \"equal sovereignty of the states\" and federalism because its disparate treatment of the states is \"based on 40 year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day\", rendering the formula outdated. The court did not strike down Section 5, but without Section 4(b), no jurisdiction may be subject to Section 5 preclearance unless Congress enacts a new coverage formula. After the decision, several states that were fully or partially covered\u2014including Texas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina\u2014implemented laws that were previously denied preclearance. This prompted new legal challenges to these laws under other provisions unaffected by the court's decision, such as Section 2. Research has shown that the coverage formula and the requirement of preclearance substantially increased turnout among racial minorities, even as far as the year before \"Shelby County\". Some jurisdictions that had previously been covered by the coverage formula increased the rate of voter registration purges after \"Shelby County\". On July 1, 2021, the Act's preclearance requirements were further weakened at the state and local level following the \" Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee\" in a 6-3 Supreme Court ruling which held that Section 2 preclearance provisions could not apply to out-of-precinct voting or ballot collecting.\nCivil Rights Act of 1968.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Pub. L.\u00a0, 82\u00a0Stat.\u00a0https://, enacted ) is a landmark law in the United States signed into law by United States President Lyndon B. Johnson during the King assassination riots.\nTitles II through VII comprise the Indian Civil Rights Act, which applies to the Native American tribes of the United States and makes many but not all of the guarantees of the U.S. Bill of Rights applicable within the tribes. (That Act appears today in Title 25, sections 1301 to 1303 of the United States Code).\nTitles VIII and IX are commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, which was meant as a follow-up to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (This is different legislation than the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, which expanded housing funding programs.) While the Civil Rights Act of 1866 prohibited discrimination in housing, there were no federal enforcement provisions. The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and since 1974, sex. Since 1988, the act protects people with disabilities and families with children. Pregnant women are also protected from illegal discrimination because they have been given familial status with their unborn child being the other family member. Victims of discrimination may use both the 1968 act and the 1866 act's section 1983 to seek redress. The 1968 act provides for federal solutions while the 1866 act provides for private solutions (i.e.,\u00a0civil suits). The act also made it a federal crime to \"by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone... by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin, handicap or familial status.\"\nTitle X, commonly known as the Anti-Riot Act, makes it a felony to \"travel in interstate commerce...with the intent to incite, promote, encourage, participate in and carry on a riot.\" That provision has been criticized for \"equating organized political protest with organized violence.\"\nLegislative history and components.\nIn 1966, President Johnson proposed a new civil rights bill, but it was not passed through by the Senate. On February 17, 1967, the bill was introduced in the House by Rep. Manny Celler and in the Senate by Senator Philip A. Hart.\nThe House Judiciary Committee cleared HR 2516 (civil rights bill) and HR 10805 (extended life of Civil Rights Commission for another five years). House Judiciary Subcommittee No. 5 June 22 approved a package combining HR 2516 and HR 421 (Administration bill) in order to strengthen protections for civil rights workers.\nThe initial vote in the House of Representatives was 327\u201392 (161\u201325 in the House Republican Conference and 166\u201367 in the House Democratic Caucus) with 12 members voting present or abstaining, while in the Senate the final vote with amendments was 71\u201320 (29\u20133 in the Senate Republican Conference and 42\u201317 in the Senate Democratic Caucus) with 5 members voting present or abstaining. The House agreed to the Senate amendments by a vote of 250\u2013172 (100\u201384 in the House Republican Conference and 150\u201388 in the House Democratic Caucus) with 10 members voting present or abstaining.\nBill H.R. 2516 was passed by the 90th United States Congress and signed by the 36th President of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson on April 11, 1968.\nTitle I: Hate crimes.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1968 also enacted \u00a0https://(b)(2), which permits federal prosecution of anyone who \"willingly injures, intimidates or interferes with another person, or attempts to do so, by force because of the other person's race, color, religion or national origin\" because of the victim's attempt to engage in one of six types of federally protected activities, such as attending school, patronizing a public place/facility, applying for employment, acting as a juror in a state court or voting.\nPersons violating this law face a fine or imprisonment of up to one year or both. If bodily injury results or if such acts of intimidation involve the use of firearms, explosives or fire, individuals can receive prison terms of up to 10 years, while crimes involving kidnapping, sexual assault, or murder can be punishable by life in prison or the death penalty.\nThough sexual orientation and gender identity were also excluded from this law, they are included in a more recent Federal hate-crime law, the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\nTitle II\u2013VII: Indian Civil Rights Act.\nThe Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 granted Native Americans full access to the United States Bill of Rights. The first minor section focuses on re-establishing amendments now granted to Native Americans. The main portion of the section focuses on Native Americans in the United States legal system. The last section of this act points out other materials related to more constitutional rights of Native Americans, such as the \"Indian Affairs, Laws and Treaties\" doctrine.\nTitle VIII\u2013IX: Fair Housing Act.\nHousing discrimination.\nTitle VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 is commonly referred to as the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Since 1968 its protections have been expanded significantly by amendment. The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is charged with administering and enforcing this law.\nTypes of banned discrimination.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1968 prohibited the following forms of housing discrimination:\nTypes of allowed discrimination.\nOnly certain kinds of discrimination are covered by fair housing laws. Landlords are not required by law to rent to any tenant who applies for a property. Landlords can select tenants based on objective business criteria, such as the applicant's ability to pay the rent and take care of the property. Landlords can lawfully discriminate against tenants with bad credit histories or low incomes, and (except in some areas) do not have to rent to tenants who will be receiving Section 8 vouchers. Landlords must be consistent in the screening, treat tenants who are inside and outside the protected classes in the same manner, and should document any legitimate business reason for not renting to a prospective tenant.\nThe United States Department of Housing and Urban Development has stated that buyers and renters may discriminate and may request real estate agents representing them to limit home searches to parameters that are discriminatory. The primary purpose of the Fair Housing Act is to protect the buyer's (and renter's) right to seek a dwelling anywhere they choose. It protects the buyer's right to discriminate by prohibiting certain discriminatory acts by sellers, landlords, and real estate agents.\nPeople with disabilities.\nThe Fair Housing Act defines a person with a disability in the same manner as the Americans with Disabilities Act \u2013 \"a person with a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment.\"\nThe Fair Housing Act provides several specific protections for buyers and tenants with disabilities. Landlords and sellers cannot make a dwelling unit unavailable or deny a dwelling to a buyer or renter because of their disability or the disability of any person who intends to reside in the dwelling or because of the disability of anyone with whom they are associated. Landlords cannot deny a person with a disability all of the privileges provided in connection with the dwelling, because of the person's disability.\nThe Fair Housing Act (FHA) provides some specific protections for people with disabilities that facilitate independence and community living. First, the FHA allows tenants to make reasonable modifications to the existing premises. It makes it illegal for landlords to not allow people with disabilities to make reasonable modifications to the premises, at their own expense, if they need the modification to have full enjoyment of the premises. For example, an individual with a disability may require grab bars installed in order to have access to take a shower. The landlord must allow the tenant to install the grab bars to allow access to take a shower. However, technically, the landlord may require the tenant remove the grab bars at the end of the tenancy, at the tenant's own expense. However, the regulations specify that in rental housing, a landlord may not condition widening a bathroom doorway to provide wheelchair access, to its return to its former narrow state upon the end of the tenancy, since it will not interfere with the next tenants use and enjoyment of the premises.\nThe second protection offered by the FHA includes the requirement that no one can refuse to make reasonable accommodations to \"rules, policies, practices, or services, when the accommodation is necessary to afford\" a person with a disability \"equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit,\" including the amenities of the dwelling, which may involve common areas. For example, a building with a \"No Pets\" policy would violate the FHA if it did not allow a blind person to have their seeing eye dog live with them as a reasonable accommodation to the policy. Similarly, a wheelchair user could request an assigned, accessible parking space as a reasonable accommodation in a \"first come first serve\" parking lot attached to an apartment complex.\nTitle X: Anti-Riot Act.\nThe Act included the \"Anti-Riot Act,\" enacted at \u00a0https:// (with its key terms, \"riot\" and \"incite a riot,\" defined in \u00a0https://), which makes it a federal crime to use interstate or foreign commerce routes or facilities (such as by crossing state lines or through mail, use of the Internet, or phone calls) to incite a riot, organize, promote or participate in a riot or to extend activities of a riot, or to aid and abet any person performing such activities. The provision has been informally referred to as the \"H. Rap Brown Law\" since the arrest and trial of H. Rap Brown in 1967 for carrying a gun across state lines. Rulings by the 4th Circuit in 2020 and 9th Circuit in 2021 struck down in those circuits the portions of the law which prohibit \"urging\" a riot on the grounds of freedom of speech, leaving in place bans on inciting and participation in riots.\nCivil Rights Restoration Act of 1987.\nThe Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, or'Grove City Bill, is a United States legislative act that specifies that entities receiving federal funds must comply with civil rights legislation in all of their operations, not just in the program or activity that received the funding. The Act overturned the precedent set by the Supreme Court decision in \"Grove City College v. Bell\", 465 U.S. 555 (1984), which held that only the particular program in an educational institution receiving federal financial assistance was required to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, not the institution as a whole.\nLegislative history.\nThe Act was first passed by the House in June 1984 (375\u201332) but stalled for several years after divisions over its potential effects on Title IX regulations prohibiting discrimination relating to abortion impeded the effectiveness of a civil rights coalition. In January 1988, the Senate accepted an amendment by Senator John Danforth (R-MO). He is described as \"abortion neutral\" and clarified that the Act does not impose a requirement for entities receiving federal funding to pay or provide for abortions and that it prohibits discrimination against women who use or seek abortion services. The amendment was opposed by the National Organization for Women and other pro-choice groups but ultimately resulted in passage of the bill in both the House and the Senate.\nThe final vote in the Senate, on January 28, 1988, was 75\u201314 (48\u20130 in the Senate Democratic Caucus and 27\u201314 in the Senate Republican Conference), with 11 members voting present or abstaining. The final vote in the House of Representatives on March 2, 1988, was 315\u201398 (242\u20134 in the House Democratic Caucus and 73\u201394 in the House Republican Conference) with 20 members voting present or abstaining.\nOn March 16, 1988, President Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill by arguing that the Act represented an overexpansion of governmental power over private organizational decision-making and \"would diminish substantially the freedom and independence of religious institutions in our society.\" On March 22, 1988, the Senate overrode Reagan's veto by a vote of 73\u201324 (52\u20130 in the Senate Democratic Caucus and 21\u201324 in the Senate Republican Conference) with 3 members voting present or abstaining. On the same day, the House voted in favor of the bill with a vote of 292\u2013133 (240\u201310 in the House Democratic Caucus and 52\u2013123 in the House Republican Conference), with 7 members voting present or abstaining. Reagan's veto was the first veto of a civil rights act since Andrew Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Act of 1866.\nProvisions.\nIn addition to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (which prohibits sex discrimination in educational institutions), the Act applies to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability), Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (which prohibits racial discrimination), and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (which prohibits age discrimination in employment).\nWith the passage of the act, educational institutions receiving any federal funding were required to comply with all federal civil rights laws, including those relating to gender, race, and disability, throughout the institution (not only in the parts of the institution receiving the funding). The act also extended protection against discrimination in educational institutions to a wider range of individuals, including students, faculty, and staff.\nCivil Rights Act of 1990.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1990' was a bill that, had it been signed into law, would have made it easier for litigants in race or sex discrimination cases to win. It was introduced into the 101st United States Congress on February 7, 1990, by Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) in the United States Senate, and by Augustus Hawkins (D-CA) in the House of Representatives. While making its way through Congress, the bill was considered to be civil rights groups' number one legislative priority. Soon before the bill made it to the desk of then-President of the United States George H. W. Bush, it was criticized by the Harvard Law School professor Charles Fried. In a \"New York Times\" op-ed, Fried (a ranking member of the Federalist Society who served as Solicitor General in the Reagan Administration from 1985-1989), wrote that descriptions of the bill as the most important civil rights legislation in a quarter-century were \"a public relations flimflam perpetrated by a cabal of overzealous civil rights plaintiffs' lawyers.\" He concluded by saying that Bush should \"veto this bill in its present form.\"\nOn October 22, 1990, President Bush vetoed the bill, claiming that it \"employs a maze of highly legalistic language to introduce the destructive force of quotas into our national employment system.\" The Bush administration argued that the bill's provisions were strict enough that they would give employers \"powerful incentives\" to adopt quotas. Supporters of the bill argued that, contrary to Bush's claims, the bill would not have led employers to adopt quotas. For example, Benjamin Hooks, the then-executive director of the NAACP, said he was \"at a loss\" as to why Bush described the legislation as a quota bill. Congress attempted to override his veto on October 24, but their attempt failed in the Senate by one vote to achieve the two-thirds majority required.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 is a United States labor law, passed in response to United States Supreme Court decisions that limited the rights of employees who had sued their employers for discrimination. The Act represented the first effort since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to modify some of the basic procedural and substantive rights provided by federal law in employment discrimination cases. It provided the right to trial by jury on discrimination claims and introduced the possibility of emotional distress damages and limited the amount that a jury could award. It added provisions to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protections expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive damages for sexual discrimination or harassment. U.S. President George H. W. Bush had used his veto against the more comprehensive Civil Rights Act of 1990. He feared racial quotas would be imposed but later approved the 1991 version of the bill.\nThe 1991 Act was intended to strengthen the protections afforded by 2 different civil rights acts: the Civil Rights Act of 1866, better known by the number assigned to it in the codification of federal laws as Section 1981, and the employment-related provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, generally referred to as Title VII. The two statutes, passed nearly a century apart, approached the issue of employment discrimination very differently: Section 1981 prohibited only discrimination based on race or color, but Title VII also prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, and national origin. Section 1981, which had lain dormant and unenforced for a century after its passage, allowed plaintiffs to seek compensatory damages and trial by jury. Title VII, passed in the 1960s when it was assumed that Southern juries could not render a fair verdict, allowed only trial by the court and provided for only traditional equitable remedies: back pay, reinstatement, and injunctions against future acts of discrimination. By the time the 1991 Act was passed, both allowed for an award of attorneys' fees. The 1991 Act expanded the remedies available to victims of discrimination by amending Title VII of the 1964 Act.\nBackground.\nCongress had amended Title VII once before, in 1972, when it broadened the coverage of the Act. It was moved to overhaul Title VII in 1991 and to harmonize it with Section 1981 jurisprudence, as a result of a series of controversial Supreme Court decisions:\nChanges.\n\"Patterson\" had attracted much criticism since it appeared to leave employees victimized by racial harassment on the job with no effective remedies, as they could not prove a violation of Section 1981 and could rarely show any wage losses that they could recover under Title VII. In addition, the Court's narrow reading of the phrase \"make or enforce contracts\" eliminated any liability under Section 1981 for lost promotions and most other personnel decisions that did not constitute a refusal to hire on the basis of race or color.\nCongress addressed the issue by redefining the phrase \"make and enforce contracts\" to include \"the making, performance, modification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship.\" Congress also clarified that Section 1981 applied to both governmental and private discrimination, the issue that the Supreme Court originally announced it would decide in \"Patterson\".\nCongress also believed that the \"Wards Cove\" case made it too difficult to prove disparate impact claims under Title VII. While the amended Act still generally requires that a plaintiff identify particular employment practice(s) allegedly causing a disparate impact, Congress added that an employer's decisionmaking process may be analyzed as a whole if the plaintiff can show that \"the elements of [an employer's] decisionmaking process are not capable of separation for analysis.\" Congress also established that the employer has the burden of proof on the business necessity defense and restored the meaning of \"business necessity\" to how it was interpreted before \"Wards Cove\". Congress did not, however, alter the portion of \"Wards Cove\" describing the plaintiff's burden with respect to statistical proof, in which the court had held: \"The mere existence of a statistical imbalance in an employer's workforce on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin is not alone sufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact violation.\"\nWhile the majority in Congress supported the burden-shifting rule in \"Price Waterhouse\", it was uncomfortable with how that case gave the employer the ability to prove that it would have made the same decision in any event, as a complete defense in a case in which it had been shown that race or gender or another unlawful factor played a significant role in its decision. Congress amended the Act to provide that the employer's proof that it would have made the same decision in any case was a defense to back pay, reinstatement and other remedies but not to liability \"per se\". The practical effect of this change was to allow a party that proved that the employer discriminated but could not show that it made any practical difference to the outcome could still recover attorney's fees after showing that the employer discriminated, even if no other remedy was awarded.\nFinally, Congress limited the rights of non-parties to attack consent decrees by barring any challenges by parties who knew or should have known of the decree or who were adequately represented by the original parties. The Act also authorized jury trials on Title VII claims and allowed Title VII plaintiffs to recover emotional distress and punitive damages, while imposing caps on such relief. The 1991 Act also made technical changes affecting the length of time allowed to challenge unlawful seniority provisions, to sue the federal government for discrimination, and to bring age discrimination claims, but it allowed successful plaintiffs to recover expert witness fees as part of an award of attorney's fees and to collect interest on any judgment against the federal government.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name, however, comes from the kola nut (\"Cola acuminata\"), which imbues the beverage with caffeine (though other sources of caffeine are generally used in modern formulations). A stimulating soda using kola appeared circa 1880.\nCola became popular worldwide after the success of Coca-Cola, a trademarked brand and symbol of American capitalism which has been imitated by other manufacturers. In 1886, American pharmacist John Stith Pemberton finetuned his recipe for a soft drink; it also contained unspent coca leaf extract, and therefore cocaine. His non-alcoholic recipe was directly inspired by the coca wine of pharmacist Angelo Mariani, created in 1863. Local prohibition laws forced him to adapt his recent creation, French Wine Coca.\nMost modern colas have a dark caramel color and are sweetened with sugar, high-fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners. There are numerous different brands, with Coca-Cola and Pepsi being among the most popular. These two colas have been competitors since the 1890s, a rivalry that has intensified since the 1980s.\nFlavorings.\nThe primary modern flavorings in a cola drink are citrus oils (from orange, lime, and lemon peels), cinnamon, vanilla, and an acidic flavoring. The Coca-Cola syrup was originally manufactured at Joseph J. Jacobs's pharmacy, making it the company's second home. Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace flavorings to create distinctive tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include a wide variety of ingredients, such as spices like nutmeg or coriander. Acidity is often provided by phosphoric acid, sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated acids. Coca-Cola's recipe is maintained as a corporate trade secret.\nA variety of different sweeteners may be used in cola, often influenced by local agricultural policy. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States due to the lower cost of government-subsidized corn. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus preferentially used to sweeten sodas. In addition, stevia or an artificial sweetener may be used; \"sugar-free\" or \"diet\" colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.\nIn Japan, there is a burgeoning craft cola industry, with small-scale local production methods and highly unique cola recipes using locally sourced fruits, herbs, and spices.\nClear cola.\nIn the 1940s, Coca-Cola produced White Coke at the request of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov.\nClear colas were again produced during the clear craze of the early 1990s. Brands included Crystal Pepsi, Tab Clear, and 7 Up Ice Cola. Crystal Pepsi was repeatedly reintroduced in the 2010s.\nIn Denmark, a popular clear cola was made by the Cooperative FDB in 1976. It was especially known for being the \"Hippie Cola\" because of the focus on the harmful effects the color additive could have on children and the boycott of multinational brands. It was inspired by a campaign on harmful additives in Denmark by the Environmental-Organization NOAH, an independent Danish division of Friends of the Earth. This was followed up with a variety of sodas without artificial coloring. Today many organic colas are available in Denmark, but, for nostalgic reasons, clear cola has still maintained its popularity to a certain degree.\nIn June 2018, Coca-Cola introduced Coca-Cola Clear in Japan.\nHealth effects.\nA 2007 study claimed that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening, was associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The phosphoric acid used in colas was thought to be a possible cause. A link has been shown between long-term regular cola intake and osteoporosis in older women (but not men). This was thought to be due to the presence of phosphoric acid, though the risk for women was found to be greater for sugared and caffeinated colas than diet and decaffeinated variants, with a higher intake of cola correlating with lower bone density. Substituting soft drinks for milk may impact adolescent bone development, increasing the risk of fracture.\nA 2005 study indicated that soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in the American diet and that of those who drink more sweetened drinks, obesity rates were higher. Most nutritionists advise that Coca-Cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively, particularly to young children whose soft drink consumption competes with, rather than complements, a balanced diet. Studies have shown that regular soft drink users have a lower intake of calcium, magnesium, vitamin C, riboflavin, and vitamin A.\nThe drink has also aroused criticism for its use of caffeine, which can cause physical dependence (caffeine dependence), and can reduce sleep quality.\nMany soft drinks in North America are sweetened mostly or entirely with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), rather than white sugar. Some nutritionists caution against the consumption of corn syrup because it may aggravate obesity and type-2 diabetes more than cane sugar. As of 2022[ [update]], there is no high-quality evidence that replacing cane sugar (sucrose) with HFCS causes any difference in health effects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"maturity\" relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from \"ad hoc\" practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics, to active optimization of the processes.\nThe model's aim is to improve existing software development processes, but it can also be applied to other processes.\nIn 2006, the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University developed the Capability Maturity Model Integration, which has largely superseded the CMM and addresses some of its drawbacks.\nOverview.\nThe Capability Maturity Model was originally developed as a tool for objectively assessing the ability of government contractors' \"processes\" to implement a contracted software project. The model was based on the process maturity framework first described in \"IEEE Software\" and, later, in the 1989 book \"Managing the Software Process\" by Watts Humphrey. It was later published as an article in 1993, and as a book by the same authors in 1994.\nThough the model comes from the field of software development, it is also used as a model to aid in business processes generally, and has also been used extensively worldwide in government offices, commerce, and industry.\nHistory.\nPrior need for software processes.\nIn the 1980s, the use of computers grew more widespread, more flexible and less costly. Organizations began to adopt computerized information systems, and the demand for software development grew significantly. Many processes for software development were in their infancy, with few standard or \"best practice\" approaches defined.\nAs a result, the growth was accompanied by growing pains: project failure was common, the field of computer science was still in its early years, and the ambitions for project scale and complexity exceeded the market capability to deliver adequate products within a planned budget. Individuals such as Edward Yourdon, Larry Constantine, Gerald Weinberg, Tom DeMarco, and David Parnas began to publish articles and books with research results in an attempt to professionalize the software-development processes.\nIn the 1980s, several US military projects involving software subcontractors ran over-budget and were completed far later than planned, if at all. In an effort to determine why this was occurring, the United States Air Force funded a study at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).\nPrecursor.\nThe first application of a staged maturity model to IT was not by CMU/SEI, but rather by Richard L. Nolan, who, in 1973 published the stages of growth model for IT organizations.\nWatts Humphrey began developing his process maturity concepts during the later stages of his 27-year career at IBM.\nDevelopment at Software Engineering Institute.\nActive development of the model by the US Department of Defense Software Engineering Institute (SEI) began in 1986 when Humphrey joined the Software Engineering Institute located at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania after retiring from IBM. At the request of the U.S. Air Force he began formalizing his Process Maturity Framework to aid the U.S. Department of Defense in evaluating the capability of software contractors as part of awarding contracts.\nThe result of the Air Force study was a model for the military to use as an objective evaluation of software subcontractors' process capability maturity. Humphrey based this framework on the earlier Quality Management Maturity Grid developed by Philip B. Crosby in his book \"Quality is Free\". Humphrey's approach differed because of his unique insight that organizations mature their processes in stages based on solving process problems in a specific order. Humphrey based his approach on the staged evolution of a system of software development practices within an organization, rather than measuring the maturity of each separate development process independently. The CMMI has thus been used by different organizations as a general and powerful tool for understanding and then improving general business process performance.\nWatts Humphrey's Capability Maturity Model (CMM) was published in 1988 and as a book in 1989, in \"Managing the Software Process\".\nOrganizations were originally assessed using a process maturity questionnaire and a Software Capability Evaluation method devised by Humphrey and his colleagues at the Software Engineering Institute.\nThe full representation of the Capability Maturity Model as a set of defined process areas and practices at each of the five maturity levels was initiated in 1991, with Version 1.1 being published in July 1993.\nThe CMM was published as a book in 1994 by the same authors Mark C. Paulk, Charles V. Weber, Bill Curtis, and Mary Beth Chrissis.\nCapability Maturity Model Integration.\nThe CMMI model's application in software development has sometimes been problematic. Applying multiple models that are not integrated within and across an organization could be costly in training, appraisals, and improvement activities. The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) project was formed to sort out the problem of using multiple models for software development processes, thus the CMMI model has superseded the CMM model, though the CMM model continues to be a general theoretical process capability model used in the public domain.\nIn 2016, the responsibility for CMMI was transferred to the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). ISACA subsequently released CMMI v2.0 in 2021. It was upgraded again to CMMI v3.0 in 2023. CMMI now places a greater emphasis on the process architecture which is typically realized as a process diagram. Copies of CMMI are available now only by subscription.\nAdapted to other processes.\nThe CMMI was originally intended as a tool to evaluate the ability of government contractors to perform a contracted software project. Though it comes from the area of software development, it can be, has been, and continues to be widely applied as a general model of the maturity of \"process\" (e.g., IT service management processes) in IS/IT (and other) organizations.\nModel topics.\nMaturity models.\nA maturity model can be viewed as a set of structured levels that describe how well the behaviors, practices and processes of an organization can reliably and sustainably produce required outcomes.\nA maturity model can be used as a benchmark for comparison and as an aid to understanding - for example, for comparative assessment of different organizations where there is something in common that can be used as a basis for comparison. In the case of the CMM, for example, the basis for comparison would be the organizations' software development processes.\nStructure.\nThe model involves five aspects:\nLevels.\nThere are five levels defined along the continuum of the model and, according to the SEI: \"Predictability, effectiveness, and control of an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the empirical evidence to date supports this belief\".\nWithin each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas which characterise that level, and for each such area there are five factors: goals, commitment, ability, measurement, and verification. These are not necessarily unique to CMMI, representing \u2014 as they do \u2014 the stages that organizations must go through on the way to becoming mature.\nThe model provides a theoretical continuum along which process maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next. Skipping levels is not allowed/feasible.\nBetween 2008 and 2019, about 12% of appraisals given were at maturity levels 4 and 5.\nCritique.\nThe model was originally intended to evaluate the ability of government contractors to perform a software project. It has been used for and may be suited to that purpose, but critics pointed out that process maturity according to the CMM was not necessarily mandatory for successful software development.\nSoftware process framework.\nThe software process framework documented is intended to guide those wishing to assess an organization's or project's consistency with the Key Process Areas. For each maturity level there are five checklist types:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is white, odorless, tasteless, and widely used as an explosive. Chemically, it is classified as a nitroamine alongside HMX, which is a more energetic explosive than trinitrotoluene (TNT). It was used widely in World War II and remains common in military applications. It is lower performing and more toxic than modern replacements such as TKX-50.\nRDX is often used in mixtures with other explosives and plasticizers or phlegmatizers (desensitizers); it is the explosive agent in C-4 plastic explosive and a key ingredient in Semtex. It is stable in storage and is considered one of the most energetic and brisant of the military high explosives, with a relative effectiveness factor of 1.60.\nName.\nRDX is also less commonly known as cyclonite, hexogen (particularly in Russian, French and German-influenced languages), T4, and, chemically, as cyclotrimethylene trinitramine. In the 1930s, the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, started investigating cyclonite to use against German U-boats that were being built with thicker hulls. The goal was to develop an explosive more energetic than TNT. For security reasons, Britain termed cyclonite \"Research Department Explosive\" (R.D.X.). The term \"RDX\" appeared in the United States in 1946. The first public reference in the United Kingdom to the name \"R.D.X.\" appeared in 1948; its authors were: the Managing Chemist, ROF Bridgwater; the Chemical Research and Development Department, Woolwich; and the Director of Royal Ordnance Factories, Explosives.\nUsage.\nRDX was widely used during World War II, often in explosive mixtures with TNT such as Torpex, Composition B, Cyclotols, and H6. RDX was used in one of the first plastic explosives. The bouncing bomb depth charges used in the \"Dambusters Raid\" each contained of Torpex; The Tallboy and Grand Slam bombs designed by Barnes Wallis also used Torpex.\nRDX is believed to have been used in many bomb plots, including terrorist plots.\nRDX is the base for a number of common military explosives:\nOutside military applications, RDX is also used in controlled demolition to raze structures. The demolition of the Jamestown Bridge in the U.S. state of Rhode Island was one instance where RDX shaped charges were used to remove the span.\nSynthesis.\nRDX is classified by chemists as a hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine derivative. In laboratory settings (industrial routes are described below separately) it is obtained by treating hexamine with white fuming nitric acid.\nThis nitrolysis reaction also produces methylene dinitrate, ammonium nitrate, and water as by-products. The overall reaction is:\nC6H12N4 + 10 HNO3 \u2192 C3H6N6O6 + 3 CH2(ONO2)2 + NH4NO3 + 3 H2O\nThe conventional cheap nitration agent, called \"mixed acid\", cannot be used for RDX synthesis because concentrated sulfuric acid conventionally used to stimulate the nitronium ion formation decomposes hexamine into formaldehyde and ammonia.\nModern syntheses employ hexahydro triacyl triazine as it avoids formation of HMX.\nHistory.\nRDX was used by both sides in World War II. The US produced about per month during WWII and Germany about per month. RDX had the major advantages of possessing greater explosive force than TNT and required no additional raw materials for its manufacture. Thus, it was also extensively used in World War I\nGermany.\nRDX was reported in 1898 by Georg Friedrich Henning (1863-1945), who obtained a German patent for its manufacture by nitrolysis of hexamine (hexamethylenetetramine) with concentrated nitric acid. In this patent, only the medical properties of RDX were mentioned.\nDuring WWI, Heinrich Brunswig (1865-1946) at the private military-industrial laboratory Zentralstelle f\u00fcr wissenschaftlich-technische Untersuchungen (Center for Scientific-Technical Research) in Neubabelsberg studied the compound more closely and in June 1916 filed two patent applications, one for its use in smokeless propellants and another for its use as an explosive, noting its excellent characteristics. The German military hadn't considered its adoption during the war due to the expense of production but started investigating its use in 1920, referring to it as hexogen.\nResearch and development findings were not published further until Edmund von Herz, described as an Austrian and later a German citizen, rediscovered the explosive properties of RDX and applied for an Austrian patent in 1919, obtaining a British one in 1921 and an American one in 1922. All patents described the synthesis of the compound by nitrating hexamethylenetetramine. The British patent claims included the manufacture of RDX by nitration, its use with or without other explosives, its use as a bursting charge and as an initiator. The US patent claim was for the use of a hollow explosive device containing RDX and a detonator cap containing it. Herz was also the first to identify the cyclic nature of the molecule.\nIn the 1930s, Germany developed improved production methods.\nDuring World War II, Germany used the code names W Salt, SH Salt, K-method, the E-method, and the KA-method. These names represented the identities of the developers of the various chemical routes to RDX. The W-method was developed by Wolfram in 1934 and gave RDX the code name \"W-Salz\". It used sulfamic acid, formaldehyde, and nitric acid. SH-Salz (SH salt) was from Schnurr, who developed a batch-process in 1937\u201338 based on nitrolysis of hexamine. The K-method, from Kn\u00f6ffler, involved addition of ammonium nitrate to the hexamine/nitric acid process. The E-method, developed by Ebele, proved to be identical to the Ross and Schiessler process described below. The KA-method, also developed by Kn\u00f6ffler, turned out to be identical to the Bachmann process described below.\nThe explosive shells fired by the MK 108 cannon and the warhead of the R4M rocket, both used in Luftwaffe fighter aircraft as offensive armament, both used hexogen as their explosive base.\nUK.\nIn the United Kingdom (UK), RDX was manufactured from 1933 by the research department in a pilot plant at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, London, a larger pilot plant being built at the RGPF Waltham Abbey just outside London in 1939. In 1939 a twin-unit industrial-scale plant was designed to be installed at a new site, ROF Bridgwater, away from London and production of RDX started at Bridgwater on one unit in August 1941. The ROF Bridgwater plant brought in ammonia and methanol as raw materials: the methanol was converted to formaldehyde and some of the ammonia converted to nitric acid, which was concentrated for RDX production. The rest of the ammonia was reacted with formaldehyde to produce hexamine. The hexamine plant was supplied by Imperial Chemical Industries. It incorporated some features based on data obtained from the United States (US). RDX was produced by continually adding hexamine and concentrated nitric acid to a cooled mixture of hexamine and nitric acid in the nitrator. The RDX was purified and processed for its intended use; recovery and reuse of some methanol and nitric acid also was carried out. The hexamine-nitration and RDX purification plants were duplicated (i.e. twin-unit) to provide some insurance against loss of production due to fire, explosion, or air attack.\nThe United Kingdom and British Empire were fighting without allies against Nazi Germany until the middle of 1941 and had to be self-sufficient. At that time (1941), the UK had the capacity to produce (160,000\u00a0lb) of RDX per week; both Canada, an allied country and self-governing dominion within the British Empire, and the US were looked upon to supply ammunition and explosives, including RDX. By 1942, the Royal Air Force's annual requirement was forecast to be of RDX, much of which came from North America (Canada and the US).\nCanada.\nA different method of production to the Woolwich process was found and used in Canada, possibly at the McGill University department of chemistry. This was based on reacting paraformaldehyde and ammonium nitrate in acetic anhydride. A UK patent application was made by Robert Walter Schiessler (Pennsylvania State University) and James Hamilton Ross (McGill, Canada) in May 1942; the UK patent was issued in December 1947. Gilman states that the same method of production had been independently discovered by Ebele in Germany prior to Schiessler and Ross, but that this was not known by the Allies. Urba\u0144ski provides details of five methods of production, and he refers to this method as the (German) E-method.\nUK, US, and Canadian production and development.\nAt the beginning of the 1940s, the major US explosive manufacturers, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company and Hercules, had several decades of experience of manufacturing TNT and had no wish to experiment with new explosives. US Army Ordnance held the same viewpoint and wanted to continue using TNT. RDX had been tested by Picatinny Arsenal in 1929, and it was regarded as too expensive and too sensitive. The Navy proposed to continue using ammonium picrate. In contrast, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), who had visited The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, thought new explosives were necessary. James B. Conant, chairman of Division B, wished to involve academic research into this area. Conant therefore set up an experimental explosives research laboratory at the Bureau of Mines, Bruceton, Pennsylvania, using Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) funding.\nWoolwich method.\nIn 1941, the UK's Tizard Mission visited the US Army and Navy departments and part of the information handed over included details of the \"Woolwich\" method of manufacture of RDX and its stabilisation by mixing it with beeswax. The UK was asking that the US and Canada, combined, supply (440,000\u00a0lb) of RDX per day. A decision was taken by William H. P. Blandy, chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, to adopt RDX for use in mines and torpedoes. Given the immediate need for RDX, the US Army Ordnance, at Blandy's request, built a plant that copied the equipment and process used at Woolwich. The result was the Wabash River Ordnance Works run by E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company. At that time, this works had the largest nitric acid plant in the world. The Woolwich process was expensive: it needed of strong nitric acid for every pound of RDX produced.\nBy early 1941, the NDRC was researching new processes. The Woolwich or direct nitration process has at least two serious disadvantages: (1) it used large amounts of nitric acid and (2) at least one-half of the formaldehyde is lost. One mole of hexamethylenetetramine could produce at most one mole of RDX. At least three laboratories with no previous explosive experience were instructed to develop better production methods for RDX; they were based at Cornell, Michigan, and Pennsylvania State universities. Werner Emmanuel Bachmann, from Michigan, successfully developed the \"combination process\" by combining the Ross and Schiessler process used in Canada (aka the German E-method) with direct nitration. The combination process required large quantities of acetic anhydride instead of nitric acid in the old British \"Woolwich process\". Ideally, the combination process could produce two moles of RDX from each mole of hexamethylenetetramine.\nThe expanded production of RDX could not continue to rely on the use of natural beeswax to desensitize the explosive as in the original British composition (RDX/BWK-91/9). A substitute stabilizer based on petroleum was developed at the Bruceton Explosives Research Laboratory in Pennsylvania, with the resulting explosive designated Composition A-3.\nBachmann process.\nThe National Defence Research Committee (NDRC) instructed three companies to develop pilot plants. They were the Western Cartridge Company, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, and Tennessee Eastman Company, part of Eastman Kodak. At the Eastman Chemical Company (TEC), a leading manufacturer of acetic anhydride, Werner Emmanuel Bachmann developed a continuous-flow process for RDX utilizing an ammonium nitrate/nitric acid mixture as a nitrating agent in a medium of acetic acid and acetic anhydride. RDX was crucial to the war effort and the current batch-production process was too slow. In February 1942, TEC began producing small amounts of RDX at its Wexler Bend pilot plant, which led to the US government authorizing TEC to design and build Holston Ordnance Works (H.O.W.) in June 1942. By April 1943, RDX was being manufactured there. At the end of 1944, the Holston plant and the Wabash River Ordnance Works, which used the Woolwich process, were producing (50 million pounds) of Composition B per month.\nThe Bachmann process yields both RDX and HMX, with the major product determined by the specific reaction conditions.\nMilitary compositions.\nThe United Kingdom's intention in World War II was to use \"desensitised\" RDX. In the original Woolwich process, RDX was phlegmatized with beeswax, but later paraffin wax was used, based on the work carried out at Bruceton. In the event the UK was unable to obtain sufficient RDX to meet its needs, some of the shortfall was met by substituting amatol, a mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT.\nKarl D\u00f6nitz was reputed to have claimed that \"an aircraft can no more kill a U-boat than a crow can kill a mole\". Nonetheless, by May 1942 Wellington bombers began to deploy depth charges containing Torpex, a mixture of RDX, TNT, and aluminium, which had up to 50 percent more destructive power than TNT-filled depth charges. Considerable quantities of the RDX\u2013TNT mixture were produced at the Holston Ordnance Works, with Tennessee Eastman developing an automated mixing and cooling process based around the use of stainless steel conveyor belts.\nTerrorism.\nA Semtex bomb was used in the Pan Am Flight 103 (known also as the Lockerbie) bombing in 1988. A belt laden with of RDX explosives tucked under the dress of the assassin was used in the assassination of former Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. The 1993 Bombay bombings used RDX placed into several vehicles as bombs. RDX was the main component used for the 2006 Mumbai train bombings and the Jaipur bombings in 2008. It also is believed to be the explosive used in the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings.\nTraces of RDX were found on pieces of wreckage from 1999 Russian apartment bombings and 2004 Russian aircraft bombings. FSB reports on the bombs used in the 1999 apartment bombings indicated that while RDX was not a part of the main charge, each bomb contained plastic explosive used as a booster charge.\nAhmed Ressam, the al-Qaeda Millennium Bomber, used a small quantity of RDX as one of the components in the bomb that he prepared to detonate in Los Angeles International Airport on New Year's Eve 1999\u20132000; the bomb could have produced a blast forty times greater than that of a devastating car bomb.\nIn July 2012, the Kenyan government arrested two Iranian nationals and charged them with illegal possession of of RDX. According to the Kenyan Police, the Iranians planned to use the RDX for \"attacks on Israeli, US, UK and Saudi Arabian targets\".\nRDX was used in the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on February 14, 2005.\nIn the 2019 Pulwama attack in India, 250\u00a0kg of high-grade RDX was used by Jaish-e-Mohammed. The attack resulted in the deaths of 44 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel as well as the attacker.\nTwo letter bombs sent to journalists in Ecuador were disguised as USB flash drives which contained RDX that would detonate when plugged in.\nStability.\nRDX has a high nitrogen content and a high oxygen to carbon ratio, (O:C ratio), both of which indicate its explosive potential for formation of N2 and CO2.\nRDX undergoes a deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) in confinement and certain circumstances.\nThe velocity of detonation of RDX at a density of 1.80 g/cm3 is 8750\u00a0m/s.\nIt starts to decompose at approximately 170\u00a0\u00b0C and melts at 204\u00a0\u00b0C. At room temperature, it is very stable. It burns rather than explodes. It detonates only with a detonator, being unaffected even by small arms fire. This property makes it a useful military explosive. It is less sensitive than pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN). Under normal conditions, RDX has a Figure of Insensitivity of exactly 80 (RDX defines the reference point).\nRDX sublimes in vacuum, which restricts or prevents its use in some applications.\nRDX, when exploded in air, has about 1.5 times the explosive energy of TNT per unit weight and about 2.0 times per unit volume.\nRDX is insoluble in water, with solubility 0.05975 g/L at temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C.\nToxicity.\nThe substance's toxicity has been studied for many years. RDX has caused convulsions (seizures) in military field personnel ingesting it, and in munition workers inhaling its dust during manufacture. At least one fatality was attributed to RDX toxicity in a European munitions manufacturing plant.\nDuring the Vietnam War, at least 40 American soldiers were hospitalized with composition C-4 (which is 91% RDX) intoxication from December 1968 to December 1969. C-4 was frequently used by soldiers as a fuel to heat food, and the food was generally mixed by the same knife that was used to cut C-4 into small pieces prior to burning. Soldiers were exposed to C-4 either due to inhaling the fumes, or due to ingestion, made possible by many small particles adhering to the knife having been deposited into the cooked food. The symptom complex involved nausea, vomiting, generalized seizures, and prolonged postictal confusion and amnesia; which indicated toxic encephalopathy.\nOral toxicity of RDX depends on its physical form; in rats, the LD50 was found to be 100\u00a0mg/kg for finely powdered RDX, and 300\u00a0mg/kg for coarse, granular RDX. A case has been reported of a human child hospitalized in status epilepticus following the ingestion of 84.82\u00a0mg/kg dose of RDX (or 1.23 g for the patient's body weight of 14.5\u00a0kg) in the \"plastic explosive\" form.\nThe substance has low to moderate toxicity with a possible human carcinogen classification. Further research is ongoing, however, and this classification may be revised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Remediating RDX-contaminated water supplies has proven to be successful. It is known to be a kidney toxin in humans and highly toxic to earthworms and plants, thus army testing ranges where RDX was used heavily may need to undergo environmental remediation. Concerns have been raised by research published in late 2017 indicating that the issue has not been addressed correctly by U.S. officials.\nCivilian use.\nRDX has been used as a rodenticide because of its toxicity.\nBiodegradation.\nRDX is degraded by the organisms in sewage sludge as well as the fungus \"Phanaerocheate chrysosporium\". Both wild and transgenic plants can phytoremediate explosives from soil and water. One by-product of the environmental decomposition is R-salt.\nAlternatives.\nFOX-7 is considered to be approximately a 1-to-1 replacement for RDX in almost all applications. TKX-50 is considered to be a high-performance replacement.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7502", "revid": "50593521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7502", "title": "Christianity and Judaism", "text": "Christianity and Judaism are the largest and twelfth-largest religions in the world, with approximately 2.5 billion and 15 million adherents, respectively. Both are monotheistic Abrahamic religions that originated in the Middle East.\nChristianity began as a movement within Second Temple Judaism, and the two religions gradually diverged over the first few centuries of the Christian era. Today, both religions have denominational differences, but the main distinction is that Christianity recognizes Jesus as the Messiah foretold in the Hebrew Bible, whereas Judaism maintains that the Messiah has not yet arrived and that the era of prophecy concluded early in the Second Temple period.\nEarly Christianity distinguished itself by determining that observance of Jewish law ()\u2014at least in Pauline Christianity\u2014was unnecessary for non-Jewish converts to Christianity. Another fundamental difference is the two religions' conceptions of God. Most Christian denominations believe in a triune God\u2014its members being known as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\u2014with the doctrine of the incarnation of the Son in Jesus being of special importance. In contrast, Judaism believes in and emphasizes the oneness of God and rejects the Christian concept of God in human form, let alone a divided one.\nChristianity recognizes the Hebrew Bible (referred to as the Old Testament by Christians) as part of its scriptural canon while Judaism does not recognize the Christian New Testament as scripture. Judaism is also heavily informed by the Talmud, which, though not scripture, is still considered foundational to normative Judaism.\nThe relative importance of 'correct belief' (orthodoxy) versus 'correct practice' (orthopraxy) constitutes another important area of difference. Most forms of Christianity emphasize orthodoxy, focusing on the so-called New Covenant as mediated by Jesus, the Christ, as described in the New Testament. Judaism has traditionally\u2014perhaps unfairly\u2014been thought to emphasize orthopraxy, stressing the immutability of the covenants made between God and the Jewish people and the ongoing dialogue between Jews and God through the prophets.\nIn Christianity, good works would naturally follow from a person's correct belief, but do not contribute to a person's salvation. Some Catholic traditions, such as those of the Franciscans and liberation theology, explicitly value orthopraxy, and \"praxis\" is also of central importance in Eastern Christianity, with Maximus the Confessor going so far as to say that \"theology without action is the theology of demons.\"\nChristian conceptions of orthopraxy vary (e.g., Catholic social teaching and its preferential option for the poor; the Eastern Orthodox Church's practices of fasting, hesychasm, and asceticism; and the Protestant work ethic of Calvinists and others) but differ from Judaism in that they are not based on \"Halakha\" or interpretations of God's dialogue with the Jewish people.\nWhile more liberal Jewish movements may not mandate observance of \"Halakha\", Jewish life remains centered on individual and collective participation in an eternal dialogue with God through tradition, rituals, daily prayer, and ethical actions.\nJewish self-identification.\nJudaism's purpose is to carry out the Mosaic covenant made between God and the Jewish people and its proselytes (). The Torah ()\u2014comprising the Written Torah () and Oral Torah ()\u2014tells the story of this covenant and provides Jews with the terms of the covenant.\nThe Oral Torah contains the primary and maturing guide for Jews to live out the covenant, as expressed, for example, by Rabbi Yohanan in tractate Gittin 60b:6 in the Talmud. Thus, the Oral Torah is intended to guide Jews toward living holy and godly lives, and to bring holiness, peace and love into the world and into every part of life, so that life may be elevated to a high level of \"kedusha\", originally through study and practice of the Torah, and since the destruction of the Second Temple, through prayer as expressed in tractate \"Sotah\" 49a: \"Since the destruction of the Temple, every day is more cursed than the preceding one; and the existence of the world is assured only by the \"kedusha\"...and the words spoken after the study of Torah.\"\nSince the adoption of the \"Amidah\", the acknowledgement of God through the declaration from Isaiah 6:3: \"Kadosh [holy], kadosh, kadosh, is HaShem, Master of Legions; the whole world is filled with His glory\" as a replacement for the study of Torah, which is a daily obligation for Jews, and sanctifies God in itself. This allows the Jewish people as a community to strive and, over the course of history, fulfill the prophecy \"I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand and keep you. And I will establish you as a covenant of the people, for a light unto the nations.\" (i.e., a role model) It additionally allows them to fulfill a part of the divine intent of bringing about an age of peace and sanctity where ideally a faithful life and good deeds should be ends in themselves, not means (see also Jewish principles of faith).\nAccording to Christian theologian Alister McGrath, the Jewish Christians affirmed every aspect of then-contemporary Second Temple Judaism with the addition of the belief that Jesus was the Messiah, with Isaiah 49:6, \"an explicit parallel to 42:6\" quoted by Paul the Apostle in Acts 13:47 and reinterpreted by Justin Martyr. According to Christian writers, most notably Paul, the Bible teaches that people are, in their current state, sinful, and the New Testament reveals that Jesus is both the Son of man and the Son of God, united in the hypostatic union, God the Son, God made incarnate; that Jesus' death by crucifixion was a sacrifice to atone for all of humanity's sins, and that acceptance of Jesus as Savior and Lord saves one from Divine Judgment, giving Eternal life. Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant. His famous Sermon on the Mount is considered by some Christian scholars to be the proclamation of the New Covenant ethics, in contrast to the Mosaic Covenant of Moses from Mount Sinai.\nSome scholars, like Margaret Barker, propose that early Christianity has roots in First Temple Israelite religion, which is dubbed as the \"Temple Theology\". Baker's work has been criticized for engaging in parallelomania and failing to engage in the broader scholarly literature, but it has gained some religious and academic support.\nSacred texts.\nThe Hebrew Bible is composed of three parts: the Torah ('instruction'; the Septuagint translated the Hebrew to \"nomos\" or \"Law\"), the Nevi'im (Prophets) and the Ketuvim (Writings). Collectively, these are known as the Tanakh. According to Rabbinic Judaism the Torah was revealed by God to Moses; within it, Jews find 613 mitzvot (commandments).\nRabbinic tradition asserts that God revealed two Torahs to Moses, one that was written down, and one that was transmitted orally. Whereas the written Torah has a fixed form, the Oral Torah is a living tradition that includes not only specific supplements to the written Torah (for instance, what is the proper manner of \"shechita\" and what is meant by \"Frontlets\" in the Shema), but also procedures for understanding and talking about the written Torah (thus, the Oral Torah revealed at Sinai includes debates among rabbis who lived long after Moses). The Oral Law elaborations of narratives in the Bible and stories about the rabbis are referred to as \"aggadah\". It also includes elaboration of the 613 commandments in the form of laws referred to as \"halakha\". Elements of the Oral Torah were committed to writing and edited by Judah HaNasi in the Mishnah in 200\u00a0CE; much more of the Oral Torah were committed to writing in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, which were edited around 600\u00a0CE and 450\u00a0CE, respectively. The Talmuds are notable for the way they combine law and lore, for their explication of the midrashic method of interpreting texts, and for their accounts of debates among rabbis, which preserve divergent and conflicting interpretations of the Bible and legal rulings.\nSince the transcription of the Talmud, notable rabbis have compiled law codes that are generally held in high regard: the Mishneh Torah, the Tur, and the Shulchan Aruch. The latter, which was based on earlier codes and supplemented by the commentary by Moshe Isserles that notes other practices and customs practiced by Jews in different communities, especially among Ashkenazim, is generally held to be authoritative by Orthodox Jews. The Zohar, which was written in the 13th century, is generally held as the most important esoteric treatise of the Jews.\nAll contemporary Jewish movements consider the Tanakh, and the Oral Torah in the form of the Mishnah and Talmuds as sacred, although movements are divided as to claims concerning their divine revelation, and also their authority. For Jews, the Torah\u2014written and oral\u2014is the primary guide to the relationship between God and man, a living document that has unfolded and will continue to unfold whole new insights over the generations and millennia. A saying that captures this goes, \"Turn it [the Torah's words] over and over again, for everything is in it.\"\nChristians accept the Written Torah and other books of the Hebrew Bible (alternatively called Old Testament) as Scripture, although they generally give readings from the Koine Greek Septuagint translation instead of the Biblical Hebrew/Biblical Aramaic Masoretic Text. Two notable examples are:\nInstead of the traditional Jewish order and names for the books, Christians organize and name the books closer to that found in the Septuagint. Some Christian denominations (such as Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox), include a number of books that are not in the Hebrew Bible (the biblical apocrypha or deuterocanonical books or Anagignoskomena, see Development of the Old Testament canon) in their biblical canon that are not in today's Jewish canon, although they were included in the Septuagint. Christians reject the Jewish Oral Torah, which was still in oral, and therefore unwritten, form in the time of Jesus.\nCovenant theology.\nChristians believe that God has established a New Covenant with people through Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, Epistles, and other books collectively called the New Testament (the word \"testament\" attributed to Tertullian is commonly interchanged with the word \"covenant\"). For some Christians, such as Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians, this New Covenant includes authoritative sacred traditions and canon law. Others, especially Protestants, reject the authority of such traditions and instead hold to the principle of \"sola scriptura\", which accepts only the Bible itself as the final rule of faith and practice. Anglicans do not believe in \"sola scriptura\". For them, scripture is the longest leg of a 3-legged stool: scripture, tradition, and reason. Scripture cannot stand on its own since it must be interpreted in the light of the Church's patristic teaching and ecumenical creeds. Additionally, some denominations include the \"oral teachings of Jesus to the Apostles\", which they believe have been handed down to this day by apostolic succession.\nChristians refer to the canonized books about Jesus as the New Testament and to the canon of the Hebrew Bible as the Old Testament. Judaism does not accept the retronymic labeling of its sacred texts as the \"Old Testament\", and some Jews refer to the New Testament as the Christian Testament or Christian Bible. Judaism rejects all claims that the Christian New Covenant supersedes, abrogates, fulfills, or is the unfolding or consummation of the covenant expressed in the Written and Oral Torahs. Therefore, just as Christianity does not accept that Mosaic law has any authority over Christians, Judaism does not accept that the New Testament has any religious authority over Jews.\nLaw.\nMany Jews view Christians as having quite an ambivalent view of the Torah and the laws contained in it: on one hand, Christians speak of it as God's absolute word, but on the other, they apply its commandments with a certain selectivity. Some Jews contend that Christians cite commandments from the Hebrew Bible to support one point of view but then ignore other commandments of a similar class and equal weight. Examples of this are certain commandments that God states explicitly to be a \"lasting covenant.\" Some translate the Hebrew as a \"perpetual covenant.\"\nChristians explain that such selectivity is based on rulings made by early Jewish Christians in the Book of Acts, at the Council of Jerusalem, that, while believing gentiles did not need to convert to Judaism fully, they should follow some aspects of Torah like avoiding idolatry, fornication, and blood. This view is also reflected by modern Judaism, in that righteous gentiles need not convert to Judaism and need to observe only the Noahide laws, which also contain prohibitions against idolatry and fornication and blood.\nSome Christians agree that Jews who accept Jesus should still observe all of the Torah\u2014see, for example dual-covenant theology\u2014based on warnings by Jesus to Jews not to use him as an excuse to disregard it, and they support efforts of those such as Messianic Jews (Messianic Judaism is considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity) to do that, but some Protestant forms of Christianity oppose all observance of the Mosaic law, even by Jews, which Luther criticised as antinomianism.\nA minority view in Christianity, known as Christian Torah-submission, holds that the Mosaic law as it is written is binding on all followers of God under the New Covenant, even for gentiles, because it views God's commands as \"everlasting\" and \"good.\"\nConcepts of God.\nTraditionally, both Judaism and Christianity believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for Jews, the God of the Tanakh, and for Christians, the God of the Old Testament. Judaism and major sects of Christianity reject the view that God is entirely immanent and within the world as a physical presence (although Christians believe in the incarnation of God). Both religions reject the view that God is entirely transcendent, and thus separate from the world, as was the pre-Christian Greek Unknown God mentioned in the New Testament. Both religions reject atheism on one hand and pure polytheism on the other.\nBoth religions agree that God shares both transcendent and immanent qualities. These religions differ in how they resolve this issue. Christianity posits that God exists as a Trinity; in this view, God exists as three distinct persons who share a single divine essence or substance. In those three, there is one God; in that one, there are three. The one God is indivisible, while the three persons are distinct and unconfused (God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit). Christianity teaches that God became especially immanent in corporeal form through the incarnation of God the Son as Jesus of Nazareth, who is believed to be fully God and fully human. Some Christian denominations and movements question the Trinity and incarnation, including those holding to nontrinitarianism.\nBy contrast, Judaism teaches that God is an uncompromised and singular entity, viewing trinitarianism as both incomprehensible and a violation of the Hebrew Bible's theology of God-as-one. It rejects the notion that Jesus or any other object or living being could be 'God', that God could have a literal 'son' in physical form or be divisible in any way, and that God could or would join the material world in such fashion. Although some forms of Judaism have labels for God's transcendence (\"Ein Sof\" 'without end') and immanence (\"Shekhinah\" 'in-dwelling'), they are understood to be human experiences of God's being, not ontological realities.\nShituf.\nA minority Jewish view maintains that while Christian worship is polytheistic (due to the multiplicity of the Trinity), it is permissible for Christians to swear in God's name as they are referring to the one God. This theology is referred to in Hebrew as \"Shituf\" (literally \"partnership\" or \"association\"). Although worship of a trinity is considered to be no different from any other form of idolatry, it may be an acceptable religion for non-Jews (according to the ruling of some Rabbinic authorities).\nRight action.\nFaith versus good deeds.\nJudaism teaches that the purpose of the Torah is to teach us how to act correctly. God's existence is a given in Judaism, and not something that most authorities see as a matter of required belief. Although some authorities see the Torah as commanding Jews to believe in God, Jews see belief in God as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a Jewish life. The quintessential verbal expression of Judaism is the Shema Yisrael, the statement that the God of the Bible is their God, and that this God is unique and one. The quintessential physical expression of Judaism is behaving in accordance with the 613 Mitzvot (the commandments specified in the Torah), and thus live one's life in God's ways.\nThus fundamentally in Judaism, one is enjoined to bring holiness into life (with the guidance of God's laws), rather than removing oneself from life to be holy.\nMuch of Christianity also teaches that God wants people to perform good works, but all branches hold that good works alone will not lead to salvation, which is called Legalism, the exception being dual-covenant theology. Some Christian denominations hold that salvation depends upon transformational faith in Jesus, which expresses itself in good works as a testament (or witness) to one\u00b4s faith for others to see (primarily Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism), while others (including most Protestants) hold that faith alone is necessary for salvation. Some argue that the difference is not as great as it seems, because it really hinges on the definition of \"faith\" used. The first group generally uses the term \"faith\" to mean \"intellectual and heartfelt assent and submission\". Such a faith will not be salvific until a person has allowed it to effect a life transforming conversion (turning towards God) in their being (see Ontotheology). The Christians that hold to \"salvation by faith alone\" (also called by its Latin name \"sola fide\") define faith as being implicitly ontological\u2014mere intellectual assent is not termed \"faith\" by these groups. Faith, then, is life-transforming by definition.\nSin.\nIn both religions, offenses against the will of God are called sin. These sins can be thoughts, words, or actions.\nCatholicism categorizes sins into various groups. A wounding of the relationship with God is often called venial sin; a complete rupture of the relationship with God is often called mortal sin. Without salvation from sin (see below), a person's separation from God is permanent, causing such a person to enter Hell in the afterlife. Both the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church define sin more or less as a \"macula\", a spiritual stain or uncleanliness that constitutes damage to man's image and likeness of God.\nHebrew has several words for sin, each with its own specific meaning. The word \"pesha\", or \"trespass\", means a sin done out of rebelliousness. The word \"aveira\" means \"transgression\". And the word \"avone\", or \"iniquity\", means a sin done out of moral failing. The word most commonly translated simply as \"sin\", \"het\", literally means \"to go astray\". Just as Jewish law, \"halakha\" provides the proper \"way\" (or path) to live, sin involves straying from that path. Judaism teaches that humans are born with free will, and morally neutral, with both a \"yetzer hatov\", (literally, \"the good inclination\", in some views, a tendency towards goodness, in others, a tendency towards having a productive life and a tendency to be concerned with others) and a \"yetzer hara\", (literally \"the evil inclination\", in some views, a tendency towards evil, and in others, a tendency towards base or animal behavior and a tendency to be selfish). In Judaism all human beings are believed to have free will and can choose the path in life that they will take. It does not teach that choosing good is impossible\u2014only at times more difficult. There is almost always a \"way back\" if a person wills it. (Although texts mention certain categories for whom the way back will be exceedingly hard, such as the slanderer, the habitual gossip, and the malicious person)\nThe rabbis recognize a positive value to the \"yetzer hara\": one tradition identifies it with the observation on the last day of creation that God's accomplishment was \"very good\" (God's work on the preceding days was just described as \"good\") and explain that without the yetzer ha'ra there would be no marriage, children, commerce or other fruits of human labor; the implication is that yetzer ha'tov and yetzer ha'ra are best understood not as moral categories of good and evil but as selfless versus selfish orientations, either of which used rightly can serve God's will.\nIn contrast to the Jewish view of being morally balanced, Original Sin refers to the idea that the sin of Adam and Eve's disobedience (sin \"at the origin\") has passed on a spiritual heritage, so to speak. Christians teach that human beings inherit a corrupted or damaged human nature in which the tendency to do bad is greater than it would have been otherwise, so much so that human nature would not be capable now of participating in the afterlife with God. This is not a matter of being \"guilty\" of anything; each person is only personally guilty of their own actual sins. However, this understanding of original sin is what lies behind the Christian emphasis on the need for spiritual salvation from a spiritual Savior, who can forgive and set aside sin even though humans are not inherently pure and worthy of such salvation. Paul the Apostle in Romans and I Corinthians placed special emphasis on this doctrine, and stressed that belief in Jesus would allow Christians to overcome death and attain salvation in the hereafter.\nRoman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and some Protestants teach the Sacrament of Baptism is the means by which each person's damaged human nature is healed and sanctifying grace (capacity to enjoy and participate in the spiritual life of God) is restored. This is referred to as \"being born of water and the Spirit\", following the terminology in the Gospel of St. John. Most Protestants believe this salvific grace comes about at the moment of personal decision to follow Jesus, and that baptism is a symbol of the grace already received.\nLove.\nThe Hebrew word for \"love\", (), is used to describe intimate or romantic feelings or relationships, such as the love between parent and child in Genesis 22:2; 25: 28; 37:3; the love between close friends in I Samuel 18:2, 20:17; or the love between a young man and young woman in Song of Songs. Christians will often use the Greek of the Septuagint to make distinctions between the types of love: \"philia\" for brotherly, \"eros\" for romantic and \"agape\" for self-sacrificing love.\nLike many Jewish scholars and theologians, literary critic Harold Bloom understands Judaism as fundamentally a religion of love. But he argues that one can understand the Hebrew conception of love only by looking at one of the core commandments of Judaism, Leviticus 19:18, \"Love your neighbor as yourself\", also called the second Great Commandment. Talmudic sages Hillel and Rabbi Akiva commented that this is a major element of the Jewish religion. Also, this commandment is arguably at the center of the Jewish faith. As the third book of the Torah, Leviticus is literally the central book. Historically, Jews have considered it of central importance: traditionally, children began their study of the Torah with Leviticus, and the midrashic literature on Leviticus is among the longest and most detailed of midrashic literature. Bernard Jacob Bamberger considers Leviticus 19, beginning with God's commandment in verse 3\u2014\"You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God, am holy\"\u2014to be \"the climactic chapter of the book, the one most often read and quoted\" (1981:889). Leviticus 19:18 is itself the climax of this chapter.\nAbortion.\nThe only statements in the Tanakh about the status of a fetus state that killing an unborn infant does not have the same status as killing a born human being, and mandates a much lesser penalty. (Although this interpretation is disputed, the passage could refer to an injury to a woman that causes a premature, live birth).\nThe Talmud states that the fetus is not yet a full human being until it has been born (either the head or the body is mostly outside of the woman), therefore killing a fetus is not murder, and abortion\u2014in restricted circumstances\u2014has always been legal under Jewish law. Rashi, the great 12th century commentator on the Bible and Talmud, states clearly of the fetus \"lav nefesh hu\": \"it is not a person\". The Talmud contains the expression \"ubar yerech imo\"\u2014the fetus is as the thigh of its mother,' i.e., the fetus is deemed to be part and parcel of the pregnant woman's body. The Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 69b states that: \"the embryo is considered to be mere water until the fortieth day.\" Afterwards, it is considered subhuman until it is born. Christians who agree with these views may refer to this idea as abortion before the quickening of the fetus.\nJudaism unilaterally supports, in fact mandates, abortion if doctors believe that it is necessary to save the life of the woman. Many rabbinic authorities allow abortions on the grounds of gross genetic imperfections of the fetus. They also allow abortion if the woman were suicidal because of such defects. However, Judaism holds that abortion is impermissible for family planning or convenience reasons. Each case must be decided individually, however, and the decision should lie with the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her, and their Rabbi.\nWar, violence and pacifism.\nJews and Christians accept as valid and binding many of the same moral principles taught in the Torah. There is a great deal of overlap between the ethical systems of these two faiths. Nonetheless, there are some highly significant doctrinal differences.\nJudaism has many teachings about peace and compromise, and its teachings make physical violence the last possible option. Nonetheless, the Talmud teaches that \"If someone comes with the intention to murder you, then one is obligated to kill in self-defense [rather than be killed]\". The clear implication is that to bare one's throat would be tantamount to suicide (which Jewish law forbids) and it would also be considered helping a murderer kill someone and thus would \"place an obstacle in front of a blind man\" (i.e., makes it easier for another person to falter in their ways). The tension between the laws dealing with peace, and the obligation to self-defense, has led to a set of Jewish teachings that have been described as tactical-pacifism. This is the avoidance of force and violence whenever possible, but the use of force when necessary to save the lives of one's self and one's people.\nAlthough killing oneself is forbidden under normal Jewish law as being a denial of God's goodness in the world, under extreme circumstances when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed suicide or mass suicide (see Masada, First French persecution of the Jews, and York Castle for examples). As a grim reminder of those times, there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for \"when the knife is at the throat\", for those dying \"to sanctify God's Name\". These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities. Where some Jews regard them as examples of heroic martyrdom, but others saying that while Jews should always be willing to face martyrdom if necessary, it was wrong for them to take their own lives.\nBecause Judaism focuses on this life, many questions to do with survival and conflict (such as the classic moral dilemma of two people in a desert with only enough water for one to survive) were analyzed in great depth by the rabbis within the Talmud, in the attempt to understand the principles a godly person should draw upon in such a circumstance.\nThe Sermon on the Mount records that Jesus taught that if someone comes to harm you, then one must turn the other cheek. This has led four Protestant Christian denominations to develop a theology of pacifism, the avoidance of force and violence at all times. They are known historically as the \"peace churches\", and have incorporated Christ's teachings on nonviolence into their theology so as to apply it to participation in the use of violent force; those denominations are the Quakers, Mennonites, Amish, and the Church of the Brethren. Many other churches have people who hold to the doctrine without making it a part of their doctrines, or who apply it to individuals but not to governments, see also Evangelical counsels. The vast majority of Christian nations and groups have not adopted this theology, nor have they followed it in practice. See also But to bring a sword.\nCapital punishment.\nAlthough the Hebrew Bible has many references to capital punishment, the Jewish sages used their authority to make it nearly impossible for a Jewish court to impose a death sentence. Even when such a sentence might have been imposed, the Cities of Refuge and other sanctuaries, were at hand for those unintentionally guilty of capital offences. It was said in the Talmud about the death penalty in Judaism, that if a court killed more than one person in seventy years, it was a barbarous (or \"bloody\") court and should be condemned as such.\nChristianity usually reserved the death penalty for heresy, the denial of the orthodox view of God's view, and witchcraft or similar non-Christian practices. For example, in Spain, unrepentant Jews were exiled, and it was only those crypto-Jews who had accepted baptism under pressure but retained Jewish customs in private, who were punished in this way. It is presently acknowledged by most of Christianity that these uses of capital punishment were deeply immoral.\nTaboo food and drink.\nOrthodox Jews, unlike most Christians, still practice a restrictive diet that has many rules. Most Christians believe that the kosher food laws have been superseded. For example, they cite what Jesus taught in Mark 7: what you eat doesn't make you unclean but what comes out of a man's heart makes him unclean\u2014although Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy have their own set of dietary observances. Eastern Orthodoxy, in particular has very elaborate and strict rules of fasting, and continues to observe the Council of Jerusalem's apostolic decree of Act 15.\nSome Christian denominations observe some biblical food laws, for example, the practice of Ital in Rastafari. Jehovah's Witnesses do not eat blood products and are known for their refusal to accept blood transfusions based on not \"eating blood\".\nSalvation.\nJudaism does not see human beings as inherently flawed or sinful and needful of being saved from it, but rather capable with a free will of being righteous, and unlike Christianity does not closely associate ideas of \"salvation\" with a New Covenant delivered by a Jewish messiah, although in Judaism Jewish people will have a renewed national commitment of observing God's commandments under the New Covenant, and the Jewish Messiah will also be ruling at a time of global peace and acceptance of God by all people.\nJudaism holds instead that proper living is accomplished through good works and heartfelt prayer, as well as a strong faith in God. Judaism also teaches that gentiles can receive a share in \"the world to come\". This is codified in the Mishna Avot 4:29, the Babylonian Talmud in tractates Avodah Zarah 10b, and Ketubot 111b, and in Maimonides's 12th century law code, the \"Mishneh Torah\", in \"Hilkhot Melachim\" (Laws of Kings) 8.11.\nThe Protestant view is that every human is a sinner, and being saved by God's grace, not simply by the merit of one's own actions, pardons a damnatory sentence to Hell.\nForgiveness.\nIn Judaism, one must go \"to those he has harmed\" to be entitled to forgiveness. This means that in Judaism a person cannot obtain forgiveness from God for wrongs the person has done to other people. This also means that, unless the victim forgave the perpetrator before he died, murder is unforgivable in Judaism, and they will answer to God for it, though the victims' family and friends can forgive the murderer for the grief they caused them.\nThus the \"reward\" for forgiving others is not God's forgiveness for wrongs done to others, but rather help \"in obtaining forgiveness from the other person\".\nSir Jonathan Sacks, Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, summarized: \"it is not that God forgives, while human beings do not. To the contrary, we believe that just as only God can forgive sins against God, so only human beings can forgive sins against human beings.\"\nJudgment.\nBoth Christianity and Judaism believe in some form of judgment. Most Christians (the exception is Full Preterism) believe in the future Second Coming of Jesus, which includes the Resurrection of the Dead and the Last Judgment. Those who have accepted Jesus as their personal saviour will be saved and live in God's presence in the Kingdom of Heaven, those who have not accepted Jesus as their saviour, will be cast into the Lake of fire (eternal torment, finite torment, or simply annihilated), see for example The Sheep and the Goats.\nIn Jewish liturgy there is significant prayer and talk of a \"book of life\" that one is written into, indicating that God judges each person each year even after death. This annual judgment process begins on Rosh Hashanah and ends with Yom Kippur. Additionally, God sits daily in judgment concerning a person's daily activities. Upon the anticipated arrival of the Messiah, God will judge the nations for their persecution of Israel during the exile. Later, God will also judge the Jews over their observance of the Torah.\nHeaven and Hell.\nThere is little Jewish literature on heaven or hell as actual places, and there are few references to the afterlife in the Hebrew Bible. One is the ghostly apparition of Samuel, called up by the Witch of Endor at King Saul's command. Another is a mention by the Prophet Daniel of those who sleep in the earth rising to either everlasting life or everlasting abhorrence.\nEarly Hebrew views were more concerned with the fate of the nation of Israel as a whole, rather than with individual immortality. A stronger belief in an afterlife for each person developed during the Second Temple period but was contested by various Jewish sects. Pharisees believed that in death, people rest in their graves until they are physically resurrected with the coming of the Messiah, and within that resurrected body the soul would exist eternally. Maimonides also included the concept of resurrection in his Thirteen Principles of Faith.\nJudaism's view is summed up by a biblical observation about the Torah: in the beginning God clothes the naked (Adam), and at the end God buries the dead (Moses). The Children of Israel mourned for 40\u00a0days, then got on with their lives.\nIn Judaism, Heaven is sometimes described as a place where God debates Talmudic law with the angels, and where Jews spend eternity studying the Written and Oral Torah. Jews do not believe in \"Hell\" as a place of eternal torment. Gehenna is a place or condition of purgatory where Jews spend up to twelve months purifying to get into heaven, depending on how sinful they have been, although some suggest that certain types of sinners can never be purified enough to go to heaven and rather than facing eternal torment, simply cease to exist. Therefore, some violations like suicide would be punished by separation from the community, such as not being buried in a Jewish cemetery (in practice, rabbis often rule suicides to be mentally incompetent and thus not responsible for their actions). Judaism also does not have a notion of hell as a place ruled by Satan since God's dominion is total and Satan is only one of God's angels.\nCatholics also believe in a purgatory for those who are going to heaven, but Christians in general believe that Hell is a fiery place of torment that never ceases, called the Lake of Fire. A small minority believe this is not permanent, and that those who go there will eventually either be saved or cease to exist. Heaven for Christians is depicted in various ways. As the Kingdom of God described in the New Testament and particularly the Book of Revelation, Heaven is a new or restored earth, a World to Come, free of sin and death, with a New Jerusalem led by God, Jesus, and the most righteous of believers starting with 144,000 Israelites from every tribe, and all others who received salvation living peacefully and making pilgrimages to give glory to the city.\nIn Christianity, promises of Heaven and Hell as rewards and punishments are often used to motivate good and bad behavior, as threats of disaster were used by prophets like Jeremiah to motivate the Israelites. Modern Judaism generally rejects this form of motivation, instead teaching to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. As Maimonides wrote:\n\"A man should not say: I shall carry out the precepts of the Torah and study her wisdom in order to receive all the blessings written therein or in order to merit the life of the World to Come and I shall keep away from the sins forbidden by the Torah in order to be spared the curses mentioned in the Torah or in order not to be cut off from the life of the World to Come. It is not proper to serve God in this fashion. For one who serves thus serves out of fear. Such a way is not that of the prophets and sages. Only the ignorant, and the women and children serve God in this way. These are trained to serve out of fear until they obtain sufficient knowledge to serve out of love. One who serves God out of love studies the Torah and practices the precepts and walks in the way of wisdom for no ulterior motive at all, neither out of fear of evil nor in order to acquire the good, but follows the truth because it is true and the good will follow the merit of attaining to it. It is the stage of Abraham our father whom the Holy One, blessed be God, called \"My friend\" (Isaiah 41:8 \u2013 \"ohavi\" = the one who loves me) because he served out of love alone. It is regarding this stage that the Holy One, Blessed be God, commanded us through Moses, as it is said: \"You shall love the Lord your God\" (Deuteronomy 6:5). When man loves God with a love that is fitting he automatically carries out all the precepts of love.\nThe Messiah.\nJews believe that a descendant of King David will one day appear to restore the Kingdom of Israel and usher in an era of peace, prosperity, and spiritual understanding for Israel and all the nations of the world. Jews refer to this person as Moshiach or \"anointed one\", translated as messiah in English. The traditional Jewish understanding of the messiah is that he is fully human and born of human parents without any supernatural element. The messiah is expected to have a relationship with God similar to that of the prophets of the Tanakh. In his commentary on the Talmud, Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon) wrote:\nAll of the people Israel will come back to Torah; The people of Israel will be gathered back to the land of Israel; The Temple in Jerusalem will be rebuilt; Israel will live among the nations as an equal, and will be strong enough to defend herself; Eventually, war, hatred and famine will end, and an era of peace and prosperity will come upon the Earth.\nHe adds:\n\"And if a king shall stand up from among the House of David, studying Torah and indulging in commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will coerce all Israel to follow it and to strengthen its weak points, and will fight The Lord's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded [and won all nations surrounding him. Old prints and mss.] and built a Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the strayed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together ... But if he did not succeed until now, or if he was killed, it becomes known that he is not this one of whom the Torah had promised us, and he is indeed like all [other] proper and wholesome kings of the House of David who died.\"\nHe also clarified the nature of the Messiah:\n\"Do not imagine that the anointed King must perform miracles and signs and create new things in the world or resurrect the dead and so on. The matter is not so: For Rabbi Akiba was a great scholar of the sages of the Mishnah, and he was the assistant-warrior of the king Ben Coziba Simon bar Kokhba... He and all the Sages of his generation deemed him the anointed king, until he was killed by sins; only since he was killed, they knew that he was not. The Sages asked him neither a miracle nor a sign...\"\nThe Christian view of Jesus as Messiah goes beyond such claims and is the fulfillment and union of three anointed offices; a prophet like Moses who delivers God's commands and covenant and frees people from bondage, a High Priest in the order of Melchizedek overshadowing the Levite priesthood and a king like King David ruling over Jews, and like God ruling over the whole world and coming from the line of David.\nFor Christians, Jesus is also fully human and fully divine as the Word of God who sacrifices himself so that humans can receive salvation. Jesus sits in Heaven at the Right Hand of God and will judge humanity in the end times when he returns to earth.\nChristian readings of the Hebrew Bible find many references to Jesus. This can take the form of specific prophesy, and in other cases of foreshadowing by types or forerunners. Traditionally, most Christian readings of the Bible maintained that almost every prophecy was actually about the coming of Jesus, and that the entire Old Testament of the Bible is a prophecy about the coming of Jesus.\nCatholic views.\nCatholicism teaches \"Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus\" (\"Outside the Church there is no salvation\"), which some, like Fr. Leonard Feeney, interpreted as limiting salvation to Catholics only. At the same time, it does not deny the possibility that those not visibly members of the Church may attain salvation as well. In recent times, its teaching has been most notably expressed in the Vatican II council documents \"Unitatis Redintegratio\" (1964), \"Lumen gentium\" (1964), \"Nostra aetate\" (1965), an encyclical issued by Pope John Paul II: \"Ut unum sint\" (1995), and in a document issued by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, \"Dominus Iesus\" in 2000. The latter document has been criticised for claiming that non-Christians are in a \"gravely deficient situation\" as compared to Catholics, but also adds that \"for those who are not formally and visibly members of the Church, salvation in Christ is accessible by virtue of a grace which, while having a mysterious relationship to the Church, does not make them formally part of the Church, but enlightens them in a way which is accommodated to their spiritual and material situation.\"\nPope John Paul II on 2 October 2000 emphasized that this document did not say that non-Christians were actively denied salvation: \"...this confession does not deny salvation to non-Christians, but points to its ultimate source in Christ, in whom man and God are united\". On 6 December the Pope issued a statement to further emphasize that the Church continued to support its traditional stance that salvation was available to believers of other faiths: \"The gospel teaches us that those who live in accordance with the Beatitudes\u2014the poor in spirit, the pure of heart, those who bear lovingly the sufferings of life\u2014will enter God's kingdom.\" He further added, \"All who seek God with a sincere heart, including those who do not know Christ and his church, contribute under the influence of Grace to the building of this Kingdom.\" On 13 August 2002 American Catholic bishops issued a joint statement with leaders of Reform and Conservative Judaism, called \"Reflections on Covenant and Mission\", which affirmed that Christians should not target Jews for conversion. The document stated: \"Jews already dwell in a saving covenant with God\" and \"Jews are also called by God to prepare the world for God's Kingdom.\" However, many Christian denominations still believe it is their duty to reach out to \"unbelieving\" Jews.\nIn December 2015, the Vatican released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Jews do not need to be converted to find salvation, and that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.\nEastern Orthodox views.\nEastern Orthodox Christianity emphasizes a continuing life of repentance or \"metanoia\", which includes an increasing improvement in thought, belief and action. Regarding the salvation of Jews, Muslims, and other non-Christians, the Orthodox have traditionally taught that there is no salvation outside the church. Orthodoxy recognizes that other religions may contain truth, to the extent that they are in agreement with Christianity.\nGod is thought to be good, just, and merciful; it would not seem just to condemn someone because they never heard the Gospel message, or were taught a distorted version of the Gospel by heretics. Therefore, the reasoning goes, they must at some point have an opportunity to make a genuine informed decision. Ultimately, those who persist in rejecting God condemn themselves, by cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of all Life, and from the God who is Love embodied. Jews, Muslims, and members of other faiths, then, are expected to convert to Christianity in the afterlife.\nProselytizing.\nJudaism is not a proselytizing religion. Orthodox Judaism deliberately makes it very difficult to convert and become a Jew, and requires a significant and full-time effort in living, study, righteousness, and conduct over several years. The final decision is by no means a foregone conclusion. A person cannot become Jewish by marrying a Jew, or by joining a synagogue, nor by any degree of involvement in the community or religion, but only by explicitly undertaking intense, formal, and supervised work over years aimed towards that goal. Some less strict versions of Judaism have made this process somewhat easier but it is still far from common.\nIn the past, scholars understood Judaism to have an evangelistic drive, but today's scholars are inclined to the view that it was often more akin just to \"greater openness to converts\" rather than active soliciting of conversions. Since Jews believe that one need not be a Jew to approach God, there is no religious pressure to convert non-Jews to their faith. Indeed, Scholars have revisited the traditional claims about Jewish proselytizing and have brought forward a variety of new insights. McKnight and Goodman have argued persuasively that a distinction ought to be made between the passive reception of converts or interested Pagans, and an active desire or intent to convert the non-Jewish world to Judaism.\nThe Chabad-Lubavitch branch of Hasidic Judaism has been an exception to this non-proselytizing standard, since in recent decades it has been actively promoting Noahide Laws for gentiles as an alternative to Christianity.\nBy contrast, Christianity is an explicitly evangelistic religion. Christians are commanded by Jesus to \"Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations\". Historically, evangelism has on rare occasions led to forced conversion under threat of death or mass expulsion.\nMutual views.\nCommon Jewish views of Christianity.\nMany Jews view Jesus as one in a long list of failed Jewish claimants to be the Messiah, none of whom fulfilled the tests of a prophet specified in the Law of Moses. Others see Jesus as a teacher who worked with the gentiles and ascribe the messianic claims that Jews find objectionable to his later followers. Because much physical and spiritual violence was done to Jews in the name of Jesus and his followers, and because evangelism is still an active aspect of many churches' activities, many Jews are uncomfortable with discussing Jesus and treat him as a non-person. In answering the question \"What do Jews think of Jesus\", philosopher Milton Steinberg claims, for Jews, Jesus cannot be accepted as anything more than a teacher. \"In only a few respects did Jesus deviate from the Tradition,\" Steinberg concludes, \"and in all of them, Jews believe, he blundered.\"\nJudaism does not believe that God requires the sacrifice of any human. This is emphasized in Jewish traditions concerning the story of the Akedah, the binding of Isaac. In the Jewish explanation, this is a story in the Torah whereby God wanted to test Abraham's faith and willingness, and Isaac was never going to be actually sacrificed. Thus, Judaism rejects the notion that anyone can or should die for anyone else's sin. Judaism is more focused on the practicalities of understanding how one may live a sacred life in the world according to God's will, rather than a hope of a future one. Judaism does not believe in the Christian concept of hell but does have a punishment stage in the afterlife (i.e. Gehenna, a term that also appears in the New Testament and translated as hell) as well as a Heaven (Gan Eden), but the religion does not intend it as a focus.\nJudaism views the worship of Jesus as inherently polytheistic, and rejects the Christian attempts to explain the Trinity as a complex monotheism. Christian festivals have no religious significance in Judaism and are not celebrated, but some secular Jews in the West treat Christmas as a secular holiday.\nCommon Christian views of Judaism.\nChristians believe that Christianity is the fulfillment and successor of Judaism, retaining much of its doctrine and many of its practices including monotheism, the belief in a Messiah, and certain forms of worship like prayer and reading from religious texts. Christians believe that Judaism requires blood sacrifice to atone for sins, and believe that Judaism has abandoned this since the destruction of the Second Temple. Most Christians consider the Mosaic Law to have been a necessary intermediate stage, but that once the crucifixion of Jesus occurred, adherence to civil and ceremonial Law was superseded by the New Covenant.\nSome Christians adhere to New Covenant theology, which states that with the arrival of his New Covenant, Jews have ceased being blessed under his Mosaic covenant. This position has been softened or disputed by other Christians, where Jews are recognized to have a special status under the Abrahamic covenant. New Covenant theology is thus in contrast to dual-covenant theology.\nSome Christians who view the Jewish people as close to God seek to understand and incorporate elements of Jewish understanding or perspective into their beliefs as a means to respect their \"parent\" religion of Judaism, or to more fully seek out and return to their Christian roots. Christians embracing aspects of Judaism are sometimes criticized as Biblical Judaizers by Christians when they pressure gentile Christians to observe Mosaic teachings rejected by most modern Christians.\nCommonwealth Theology (CT) asserts that Judeo-Christian tensions were exacerbated in the fall of Jerusalem and by the subsequent Jewish Revolt. As a result, early Christian theologies formulated in the Roman capitals of Rome and Constantinople began to include antisemitic attitudes, which have been carried forward and embraced by the Protestant Reformers. Dispensation Theology, formalized in the 1830s by John Darby, holds that \"God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew.\" Dispensationalism, however, maintains that God's special dealings with Israel have been interrupted by the Church Age. Commonwealth Theology, on the other hand, recognizes the continuity of God's \"congregation in the wilderness\" as presently consisting of the Jews (house of Judah) and the Nations (Gentiles), among whom are abiding the historically scattered Northern Kingdom (house of Israel). Commonwealth Theology views the Jews as already included in Commonwealth of Israel even while in unbelief, but nevertheless unsaved in their unbelieving state. CT recognizes that both the reconciliation of the Jewish house and the reconciliation of the estranged house of Israel (among the Gentiles) was accomplished by the cross; and that the salvation of \"All Israel\" is a process that began on the Day of Pentecost. The full realization of the \"one new man\" created through the peace (between the Jews and \"you Gentiles\") made by his cross will take place in Ezekiel's two sticks made one, when both houses of Israel will be united under the Kingdom of David.\nJewish Christians.\nSome scholars have found evidence of continuous interactions between Jewish-Christian and rabbinic movements from the mid- to late second century CE to the fourth century CE. Of particular importance is the figure of James the brother of Jesus, the leader of the Christian Church in Jerusalem until he was killed in the year 62, who was known for his righteous behavior as a Jew, and set the terms of the relationship between Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians in dialogue with Paul. To him is attributed a letter which emphasizes the view that faith must be expressed in works. The neglect of this mediating figure has often damaged Christian-Jewish relations. Modern scholarship is engaged in an ongoing debate over which term should be used as the proper designation for Jesus' first followers. Many scholars believe that the term Jewish Christians is anachronistic given the fact that there is no consensus on the date of the birth of Christianity. The very concepts of Christianity and Judaism can be seen as essentializing, since these are changing and plural traditions. Clearly, the first Christians would not have believed that they were exchanging one religion for another, because they believed that the resurrection of Jesus was the fulfillment of Jewish prophecies, and they believed that the mission to the gentiles which was initiated by Saul (Paul of Tarsus) was a secondary activity. Some modern scholars have suggested that the designations \"Jewish believers in Jesus\" and \"Jewish followers of Jesus\" better reflect the original context.\nInter-faith relationship.\nIn addition to Christianity and Judaism's varying views on each other as religions, there has also been a long and often painful history of conflict, persecution and at times, tolerance, reconciliation, between the two religions, which have influenced their mutual views of their relationship with each other over time. Since the end of the Second World War and The Holocaust, Christianity has embarked on a process of introspection with regard to its Jewish roots and its attitudes toward Judaism. The eradication of the anti-Jewish tendencies is but one dimension of this ongoing Christian introspection, that attempts to engage a variety of legacies that disturb modern believers (Antisemitism, slavery, racial and ethnic prejudice, colonialism, sexism, homophobia and religious persecution).\nSince the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church upheld (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPersecution, forcible conversion, and forcible displacement of Jews (i.e. hate crimes) occurred for many centuries, along with occasional gestures at reconciliation which also occurred from time to time. Pogroms were a common occurrence throughout Christian Europe, including organized violence, restrictions on land ownership and professional lives, forcible relocation and ghettoization, mandatory dress codes, and at times, humiliating actions and torture. All of these actions and restrictions had major effects on Jewish cultures. From the fifth century onward, Church councils imposed ever-increasing burdens and limitations on the Jews. Among the decrees:\nBy the end of the first millennium, the Jewish population in the Christian lands had been decimated, expelled, forced into conversion or worse. Only a few small and scattered communities survived.\nThere have also been non-coercive outreach and missionary efforts such as the Church of England's Ministry Among Jewish People, founded in 1809.\nFor Martin Buber, Judaism and Christianity were variations on the same theme of messianism. Buber made this theme the basis of a famous definition of the tension between Judaism and Christianity:\nPre-messianically, our destinies are divided. Now to the Christian, the Jew is the incomprehensibly obdurate man who declines to see what has happened; and to the Jew, the Christian is the incomprehensibly daring man who affirms in an unredeemed world that its redemption has been accomplished. This is a gulf which no human power can bridge.\nThe Nazi Party was known for its persecution of Christian Churches; many of them, such as the Protestant Confessing Church and the Catholic Church, as well as Quakers and Jehovah's Witnesses, aided and rescued Jews who were being targeted by the r\u00e9gime.\nFollowing the Holocaust, attempts have been made to construct a new Jewish-Christian relationship of mutual respect for differences, through the inauguration of the interfaith body the Council of Christians and Jews in 1942 and International Council of Christians and Jews. The Seelisberg Conference in 1947 established 10 points relating to the sources of Christian antisemitism. The ICCJ's \"Twelve points of Berlin\" sixty years later aim to reflect a recommitment to interreligious dialogue between the two communities.\nPope Paul VI wrote that \"the Jewish people, who still retain the religion of the Old Testament, ... are indeed worthy of our respect and love\". Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church have \"upheld the Church's acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people\" as well as a reaffirmation of the covenant between God and the Jews. In December 2015, the Vatican released a 10,000-word document which, among other things, stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.\nOrthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity.\nIn 2012, the book \"Kosher Jesus\" by Orthodox Rabbi Shmuley Boteach was published. In it, he takes the position that Jesus was a wise and learned Torah-observant Jewish rabbi. Boteach says he was a beloved member of the Jewish community. At the same time, Jesus is said to have despised the Romans for their cruelty, and fought them courageously. The book states that the Jews had nothing whatsoever to do with the murder of Jesus, but rather that blame for his trial and killing lies with the Romans and Pontius Pilate. Boteach states clearly that he does not believe in Jesus as the Jewish Messiah. At the same time, Boteach argues that \"Jews have much to learn from Jesus\u2014and from Christianity as a whole\u2014without accepting Jesus' divinity. There are many reasons for accepting Jesus as a man of great wisdom, beautiful ethical teachings, and profound Jewish patriotism.\" He concludes by writing, as to Judeo-Christian values, that \"the hyphen between Jewish and Christian values is Jesus himself.\"\nOn 3 December 2015, the Center for Jewish\u2013Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC) spearheaded a petition of Orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians.\nThe unprecedented Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity, entitled \"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians\", was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, the United States, and Europe, and as of 2016 had over 60 signatories.\nBetween Jerusalem and Rome.\nOn 31 August 2017, representatives of the Conference of European Rabbis, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Commission of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel issued and presented the Holy See with a statement entitled \"Between Jerusalem and Rome\". The document pays particular tribute to the Second Vatican Council's Declaration \"Nostra Aetate\", whose fourth chapter represents the \"Magna Carta\" of the Holy See's dialogue with the Jewish world. The Statement \"Between Jerusalem and Rome\" does not hide the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same it expresses a firm resolve to collaborate more closely, now and in the future.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the illegitimate son of Pope Alexander VI and sibling to Lucrezia Borgia.\nAfter initially entering the Church and becoming a cardinal on his father's election to the papacy, he resigned his diaconal profession after the death of his brother in 1498. He was employed as a \"condottiero\" for King Louis XII of France around 1500, and occupied both Milan and Naples during the Italian Wars. At the same time, he carved out a state for himself in Central Italy, but he was unable to retain power for long after his father's death. His quest for political power was a major inspiration for \"The Prince\" by the renowned Florentine historian, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli.\nEarly life.\nLike many aspects of Cesare Borgia's life, the date of his birth is a subject of dispute. He was born in Subiaco, Papal States (now in Lazio, Italy). in either 1475 or 1476, the illegitimate son of Cardinal Roderic Llan\u00e7ol i de Borja, usually known as \"Rodrigo Borgia\", later Pope Alexander VI, and his Italian mistress Vannozza dei Cattanei, about whom information is sparse. He had three full siblings: Giovanni Borgia, Lucrezia Borgia and Gioffre Borgia, although Gioffre's paternity was later contested.\nThe Borgia family originally came from the Kingdom of Valencia, and rose to prominence during the mid-15th century. Cesare's great-uncle Alphonso Borgia (1378\u20131458), Bishop of Valencia, was elected Pope Callixtus III in 1455. Cesare's father, Pope Alexander VI, was the first pope who openly recognized his children born out of wedlock.\nThe Italian historian Stefano Infessura writes that Cardinal Borgia falsely claimed Cesare to be the legitimate son of another man\u2014Domenico d'Arignano, the nominal husband of Vannozza dei Cattanei. More likely, Pope Sixtus IV granted Cesare a release from the necessity of proving his birth in a papal bull of 1 October 1480.\nCareer.\nDiaconate.\nCesare was initially groomed for a career in the Roman Catholic Church. Following school in Perugia and Pisa, Cesare studied law at the \"Studium Urbis\" (today as the Sapienza University of Rome). He was made Bishop of Archdiocese of Pamplona and Tudela (aged 15) and Archbishop of Valencia (aged 17). In 1493, he had also been appointed bishop of both Castres and Elne. In 1494, he also received the title of abbot of the abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa. Along with his father's elevation to Pope, Cesare was made Cardinal at the age of 18.\nAlexander VI staked the hopes of the Borgia family on Cesare's brother Giovanni, who was made captain-general of the military forces of the papacy. Giovanni was assassinated in 1497 under mysterious circumstances. Several contemporaries suggested that Cesare might have been his killer, as Giovanni's disappearance could finally open to him a long-awaited military career and also solve the jealousy over Sancha of Aragon, wife of Cesare's younger brother, Gioffre, and mistress of both Cesare and Giovanni. Cesare's role in the act has never been clear. However, he had no definitive motive, as he was likely to be given a powerful secular position, whether or not his brother lived. It is possible that Giovanni was killed as a result of a sexual liaison.\nOn 17 August 1498, Cesare resigned from the cardinalate, in order to pursue a military career. On the same day, Louis XII of France named Cesare Duke of Valentinois. This random title was selected as being homophonous with his nickname \"Il Valentino\" (\"The Valencian\"), derived from his father's papal epithet in Latin \"Valentinus\" (\"The Valencian\") indicating his birth in X\u00e0tiva in the Kingdom of Valencia under the Crown of Aragon, and along with Cesare's former position as Cardinal of Valencia. On 6 September 1499, he was released from all ecclesiastical duties and laicised from his diaconal orders (because he only was ordained deacon on 26 March 1494 and never received other major orders as priesthood and bishop consecration).\nMilitary.\nCesare's career was founded upon his father's ability to distribute patronage, along with his alliance with France (reinforced by his marriage with Charlotte d'Albret, sister of John III of Navarre), in the course of the Italian Wars. Louis XII invaded Italy in 1499; after Gian Giacomo Trivulzio had ousted its duke Ludovico Sforza, Cesare accompanied the king in his entrance into Milan.\nAt this point, Alexander decided to profit from the favourable situation and carve out for Cesare a state of his own in northern Italy. To this end, he declared that all his vicars in Romagna and Marche were deposed. Though in theory subject directly to the pope, these rulers had been practically independent or dependent on other states for generations. In the view of the citizens, these vicars were cruel and petty. When Cesare eventually took power, he was viewed by the citizens as a great improvement.\nCesare was appointed commander of the papal armies with a number of Italian mercenaries, supported by 300 cavalry and 4,000 Swiss infantry sent by the king of France. Alexander sent him to capture Imola and Forl\u00ec, ruled by Caterina Sforza (mother of the Medici \"condottiero\" Giovanni dalle Bande Nere). Despite being deprived of his French troops after the conquest of those two cities, Borgia returned to Rome to celebrate a triumph and to receive the title of Papal Gonfalonier from his father. In 1500, the creation of twelve new cardinals granted Alexander enough money for Cesare to hire the \"condottieri,\" Vitellozzo Vitelli, Gian Paolo Baglioni, Giulio and Paolo Orsini, and Oliverotto Euffreducci, who resumed his campaign in Romagna.\nGiovanni Sforza, first husband of Cesare's sister Lucrezia, was soon ousted from Pesaro; Pandolfo Malatesta lost Rimini; Faenza surrendered, its young lord Astorre III Manfredi being later drowned in the Tiber by Cesare's order. In May 1501 the latter was created duke of Romagna. Hired by Florence, Cesare subsequently added the lordship of Piombino to his new lands.\nWhile his \"condottieri\" took over the siege of Piombino which ended in 1502, Cesare commanded the French troops in the sieges of Naples and Capua, defended by Prospero and Fabrizio Colonna. On 24 June 1501, Borgia's troops stormed the latter to end the siege of Capua.\nIn June 1502, he set out for Marche, where he was able to capture Urbino and Camerino by treason. He planned to conquer Bologna next. However, his \"condottieri\", most notably Vitellozzo Vitelli and the Orsini brothers (Giulio, Paolo, and Francesco), feared Cesare's cruelty and set up a plot against him. Guidobaldo da Montefeltro and Giovanni Maria da Varano returned to Urbino and Camerino, and Fossombrone revolted. The fact that his subjects had enjoyed his rule thus far meant that his opponents had to work much harder than they would have liked. He eventually recalled his loyal generals to Imola, where he waited for his opponents' loose alliance to collapse. Cesare called for a reconciliation, but imprisoned his \"condottieri\" in Senigallia, then called Sinigaglia, a feat described as a \"wonderful deceiving\" by historian Paolo Giovio, and had them strangled. In 1503, he conquered the Republic of San Marino.\nLater years and death.\nAlthough he was an immensely capable general and statesman, Cesare had trouble maintaining his domain without continued papal patronage. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli cites Cesare's dependence on the goodwill of the papacy, under the control of his father, as being the principal disadvantage of his rule. Machiavelli argued that, had Cesare been able to win the favour of the new Pope, he would have been a very successful ruler. The news of his father's death in 1503 arrived when Cesare was planning the conquest of Tuscany. While he was convalescing in Castel Sant'Angelo from an attack of malarial fever (likely contracted on the same occasion when Alexander contracted his fatal illness), his troops controlled the September 1503 papal conclave.\nThe new pope, Pope Pius III, supported Cesare Borgia and reconfirmed him as Gonfaloniere, but after a brief pontificate of twenty-six days, he died. Borgia's deadly enemy, Giuliano Della Rovere, then succeeded by dexterous diplomacy in tricking the weakened Cesare Borgia into supporting him by offering him money and continued papal backing for Borgia policies in the Romagna; promises which he disregarded upon his election as Pope Julius II by the near-unanimous vote of the cardinals in the October 1503 papal conclave. Realizing his mistake by then, Cesare tried to correct the situation in his favour, but Pope Julius II made sure of its failure at every turn. Cesare was for example forced by Julius to give up San Marino, after occupying the republic for six months.\nCesare Borgia, who was facing the hostility of Ferdinand II of Aragon, was captured while in Naples by Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, a man he had considered his ally, and imprisoned there, while his lands were retaken by the papacy. In 1504 he was transferred to Spain and imprisoned first in the Castle of Chinchilla de Montearag\u00f3n in La Mancha, but after an attempted escape he was moved north to the Castle of La Mota, Medina del Campo, near Segovia. He did manage to escape from the Castle of La Mota with assistance, and after running across Santander, Durango, and Gipuzkoa, he arrived in Pamplona on 3 December 1506, and was much welcomed by King John III of Navarre, who was missing an experienced military commander, ahead of the feared Castilian invasion.\nBorgia recaptured Viana, Navarre, which had been in the hands of forces loyal to Louis de Beaumont, the count of Ler\u00edn and Ferdinand II of Aragon's conspiratorial ally in Navarre, but not the castle, which he then besieged. In the early morning of 11 March 1507, an enemy party of knights fled from the castle during a heavy storm. Outraged at the ineffectiveness of the siege, Borgia chased them, only to find himself on his own. The party of knights, discovering that he was alone, trapped him in an ambush, where he received a fatal injury from a spear. He was then stripped of all his luxurious garments, valuables, and a leather mask covering half his face (disfigured, possibly by syphilis, during his late years). Borgia was left lying naked, with just a red tile covering his genitals.\nMortal remains.\nBorgia was originally buried in a marbled mausoleum King John III had ordered built at the altar of the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda in Viana in Navarre in northern Spain, set on one of the stops on the Camino de Santiago. In the 16th century, the Bishop of Mondo\u00f1edo, Antonio de Guevara, published from memory what he had seen written on the tomb when he had paid a visit to the church. This epitaph underwent several changes in wording and meter throughout the years and the version most commonly cited today is that published by the priest and historian Francisco de Ales\u00f3n in the 18th century. It reads:\nBorgia was an old enemy of Ferdinand of Aragon, and he was fighting the count who paved the way for Ferdinand's 1512 invasion against John III and Catherine of Navarre. While the circumstances are not well known, the tomb was destroyed sometime between 1523 and 1608, during which time Santa Mar\u00eda was undergoing renovation and expansion. Tradition goes that a Bishop of Calahorra considered it inappropriate to have the remains of \"that degenerate\" lying in the church, so the opportunity was taken to tear down the monument and expel Borgia's bones to where they were reburied under the street in front of the church to be trodden on by all who walked through the town.\nVicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, in \"A los pies de Venus\", writes that the then Bishop of Santa Mar\u00eda had Borgia expelled from the church because his own father had died after being imprisoned under Alexander VI. It was held for many years that the bones were lost, although in fact local tradition continued to mark their place quite accurately and folklore sprung up around Borgia's death and ghost. The bones were in fact dug up twice and reburied once by historians (both local and international\u2014the first dig in 1886 involved the French historian Charles Yriarte, who also published works on the Borgias) seeking the resting place of the infamous Cesare Borgia. After Borgia was unearthed for the second time in 1945 his bones were taken for a rather lengthy forensic examination by Victoriano Juaristi, a surgeon by trade and Borgia aficionado, and the tests concurred with the preliminary ones carried out in the 19th century. There was evidence that the bones belonged to Borgia.\nCesare Borgia's remains then were sent to Viana's town hall, directly across from Santa Mar\u00eda, where they remained until 1953. They were then reburied immediately outside of the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda, no longer under the street and in direct danger of being stepped on. A memorial stone was placed over it which, translated into English, declared Borgia the \"Generalissimo\" of the papal as well as the Navarrese forces. A movement was made in the late 1980s to have Borgia dug up once more and put back into Santa Mar\u00eda, but this proposal was ultimately rejected by church officials due to a recent ruling against the interment of anyone who did not hold the title of pope or cardinal.\nSince Borgia had renounced the cardinalate it was decided that it would be inappropriate for his bones to be moved into the church. It was reported that Fernando Sebasti\u00e1n Aguilar, the Archbishop of Pamplona, would acquiesce after more than 50 years of petitions and Borgia would finally be moved back inside the church on 11 March 2007, the day before the 500th anniversary of his death, but an Archbishopric spokesman declared that the church does not authorize any such practice. The local church said that \"we have nothing against the transfer of his remains. Whatever he may have done in life, he deserves to be forgiven now.\"\nAccording to Niccolo Machiavelli.\nNiccol\u00f2 Machiavelli met the Duke on a diplomatic mission in his function as Secretary of the Florentine Chancellery. Machiavelli was at Borgia's court from 7 October 1502 through 18 January 1503. During this time he wrote regular dispatches to his superiors in Florence, many of which have survived and are published in \"Machiavelli's Collected Works\". In \"The Prince\", Machiavelli uses Borgia as an example to elucidate the dangers of acquiring a principality by virtue of another. Although Cesare Borgia's father gave him the power to set up, Cesare ruled the Romagna with skill and tact for the most part. However, when his father died, and a rival to the Borgia family entered the Papal seat, Cesare was overthrown in a matter of months.\nMachiavelli attributes two episodes to Cesare Borgia: the method by which the Romagna was pacified, which Machiavelli describes in chapter VII of \"The Prince\", and the assassination of his captains on New Year's Eve of 1502 in Senigallia.\nMachiavelli's use of Borgia is subject to controversy. Some scholars see Machiavelli's Borgia as the precursor of state crimes in the 20th century. Others, including Macaulay and Lord Acton, have historicized Machiavelli's Borgia, explaining the admiration for such violence as an effect of the general criminality and corruption of the time.\nLeonardo da Vinci.\nCesare Borgia briefly employed the artist Leonardo da Vinci as a military architect and engineer between 1502 and 1503. Cesare provided Leonardo with an unlimited pass to inspect and direct all ongoing and planned construction in his domain. While in Romagna, Leonardo built the canal from Cesena to the Porto Cesenatico.\nBefore meeting Cesare, Leonardo had worked at the Milanese court of Ludovico Sforza for many years, until Louis XII of France drove Sforza out of Italy. After Cesare, Leonardo was unsuccessful in finding another patron in Italy. King Francis I of France was able to convince Leonardo to enter his service, and the last three years of Leonardo's life were spent working in France.\nPersonal life.\nOn 10 May 1499, Cesare married Charlotte of Albret (1480 \u2013 11 March 1514), a sister of King John III of Navarre. The arrangement was part of a plan by the Navarrese monarchs to ease tensions with the newly proclaimed French King Louis XII by offering a royal blood bride in his dealings with the Holy See. They were parents to a daughter, Louise Borgia (1500\u20131553).\nCesare was also the father to at least 11 illegitimate children. Among them are Girolamo Borgia who married Isabella Contessa di Carpi and Camilla Lucrezia Borgia (the younger) who, after Cesare's death, was moved to Ferrara to the court of her aunt Lucrezia Borgia (the elder).\nThere are accounts recorded by Machiavelli during his time spent with Cesare Borgia during his diplomatic trips. Machiavelli found that he could be at times secretive and taciturn, at other times loquacious and boastful. He alternated bursts of demonic activity when he stayed up all night receiving and dispatching messengers, with moments of unaccountable sloth when he remained in bed refusing to see anyone. He was quick to take offence and rather remote from his immediate entourage, yet he was very open with his subjects, loving to join local sports and cutting a dashing figure. However, at other times, Machiavelli observed Cesare as having \"inexhaustible\" energy and an unrelenting genius in military matters, and also diplomatic affairs, and he would go days and nights on end without seemingly requiring sleep.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. A chronicle which traces world history is a universal chronicle. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, in which an author chooses events to interpret and analyze and excludes those the author does not consider important or relevant.\nThe information sources for chronicles vary. Some are written from the chronicler's direct knowledge, others from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed down from generation to generation by oral tradition. Some used written material, such as charters, letters, and earlier chronicles. Still others are tales of unknown origin that have mythical status. Copyists also changed chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original chronicler. Determining the reliability of particular chronicles is important to historians.\nMany newspapers and other periodical literature have adopted \"chronicle\" as part of their name. \nSubgroups.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"It is well known that history, in the form of Chronicles, was a favourite portion of the literature of the middle ages. The annals of a country were usually kept according to the years of the sovereign's power, and not those of the Christian \u00e6ra. The Chronicles compiled in large cities were arranged in like manner, with the years reckoned according to the annual succession of chief magistrates.\"\n \u2013 John Gough Nichols, critical edition foreword to \"Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London\" (1852)\nScholars categorize the genre of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A \"dead\" chronicle is one where the author assembles a list of events up to the time of their writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A \"live\" chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, historians tend to value live chronicles, such as annals, over dead ones.\nThe term often refers to a book written by a chronicler in the Middle Ages describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also applied to a record of public events. The earliest medieval chronicle to combine both retrospective (\"dead\") and contemporary (\"live\") entries, is the Chronicle of Ireland, which spans the years 431 to 911.\nChronicles are the predecessors of modern \"time lines\" rather than analytical histories. They represent accounts, in prose or verse, of local or distant events over a considerable period of time, both the lifetime of the individual chronicler and often those of several subsequent continuators. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called annals. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their information as they found it, and made little attempt to separate fact from legend. The point of view of most chroniclers is highly localised, to the extent that many anonymous chroniclers can be sited in individual abbeys.\nIt is impossible to say how many chronicles exist, as the many ambiguities in the definition of the genre make it impossible to draw clear distinctions of what should or should not be included. However, the \"Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle\" lists some 2,500 items written between 300 and 1500 AD.\nCitation of entries.\nEntries in chronicles are often cited using the abbreviation \"s.a.\", meaning \"sub anno\" (under the year), according to the year under which they are listed. For example, \"\"ASC\" MS A, s.a. 855\" means the entry for the year 855 in manuscript A of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\". The same event may be recorded under a different year in another manuscript of the chronicle, and may be cited for example as \"\"ASC\" MS D, s.a. 857\".\nEnglish chronicles.\nThe most important English chronicles are the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", started under the patronage of King Alfred in the 9th century and continued until the 12th century, and the \"Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland\" (1577\u201387) by Raphael Holinshed and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for Elizabethan drama. Later 16th-century Scottish chronicles, written after the Reformation, shape history according to Catholic or Protestant viewpoints.\nCronista.\nA cronista is a term for a historical chronicler, a role that held historical significance in the European Middle Ages. Until the European Enlightenment, the occupation was largely equivalent to that of a historian, describing events chronologically that were of note in a given country or region. As such, it was often an official governmental position rather than an independent practice. The appointment of the official chronicler often favored individuals who had distinguished themselves by their efforts to study, investigate and disseminate population-related issues. The position was granted on a local level based on the mutual agreements of a city council in plenary meetings. Often, the occupation was honorary, unpaid, and stationed for life. In modern usage, the term usually refers to a type of journalist who writes chronicles as a form of journalism or non-professional historical documentation.\nCronista in the Middle Ages.\nBefore the development of modern journalism and the systematization of chronicles as a journalistic genre, cronista were tasked with narrating chronological events considered worthy of remembrance that were recorded year by year. Unlike writers who created epic poems regarding living figures, cronista recorded historical events in the lives of individuals in an ostensibly truthful and reality-oriented way.\nEven from the time of early Christian historiography, cronistas were clearly expected to place human history in the context of a linear progression, starting with the creation of man until the second coming of Christ, as prophesied in biblical texts.\nLists of chronicles.\nRhymed chronicles.\nRhymed or poetic chronicles, as opposed to prosaic chronicles, include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Several types of mathematical description can be distinguished: \"mass concentration\", \"molar concentration\", \"number concentration\", and \"volume concentration\". The concentration can refer to any kind of chemical mixture, but most frequently refers to solutes and solvents in solutions. The molar (amount) concentration has variants, such as normal concentration and osmotic concentration. Dilution is reduction of concentration, e.g., by adding solvent to a solution. The verb means to increase concentration, the opposite of dilute.\nEtymology.\n\"Concentration-\", \"concentratio\", action or an act of coming together at a house on a farm in a single place, bringing black people as slaves to a common center, was used in post-classical Latin in 1550 or earlier, similar terms attested in Italian (1589), Spanish (1589), English (1606), French (1632).\nQualitative description.\nOften in informal, non-technical language, concentration is described in a qualitative way, through the use of adjectives such as \"dilute\" for solutions of relatively low concentration and \"concentrated\" for solutions of relatively high concentration. To concentrate a solution, one must add more solute (for example, alcohol), or reduce the amount of solvent (for example, water). By contrast, to dilute a solution, one must add more solvent, or reduce the amount of solute. Unless two substances are miscible, there exists a concentration at which no further solute will dissolve in a solution. At this point, the solution is said to be saturated. If additional solute is added to a saturated solution, it will not dissolve, except in certain circumstances, when supersaturation may occur. Instead, phase separation will occur, leading to coexisting phases, either completely separated or mixed as a suspension. The point of saturation depends on many variables, such as ambient temperature and the precise chemical nature of the solvent and solute.\nConcentrations are often called levels, reflecting the mental schema of levels on the vertical axis of a graph, which can be high or low (for example, \"high serum levels of bilirubin\" are concentrations of bilirubin in the blood serum that are greater than normal).\nQuantitative notation.\nThere are four quantities that describe concentration:\nMass concentration.\nThe mass concentration formula_1 is defined as the mass of a constituent formula_2 divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3:\nformula_4\nThe SI unit is kg/m3 (equal to g/L).\nMolar concentration.\nThe molar concentration formula_5 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_6 (in moles) divided by the volume of the mixture formula_3:\nformula_8\nThe SI unit is mol/m3.

The letter formula_13 used here is normative in German literature (see ).\nRelated quantities.\nSeveral other quantities can be used to describe the composition of a mixture. These should not be called concentrations.\nNormality.\nNormality is defined as the molar concentration formula_5 divided by an equivalence factor formula_19. Since the definition of the equivalence factor depends on context (which reaction is being studied), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and National Institute of Standards and Technology discourage the use of normality.\nMolality.\nThe molality of a solution formula_20 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_6 (in moles) divided by the mass of the solvent formula_22 (not the mass of the solution):\nformula_23\nThe SI unit for molality is mol/kg.\nMole fraction.\nThe mole fraction formula_24 is defined as the amount of a constituent formula_6 (in moles) divided by the total amount of all constituents in a mixture formula_26:\nformula_27\nThe SI unit is mol/mol.

The system was the basis for the top categories of the Library of Congress Classification.226\nHistory.\nCharles Ammi Cutter, inspired by the decimal classification of his contemporary Melvil Dewey, and with Dewey's initial encouragement, developed his own classification scheme for the Winchester, Massachusetts town library and then the Boston Athen\u00e6um,208 at which he served as librarian for twenty-four years. He began work on it around the year 1880, publishing an overview of the new system in 1882. The same classification would later be used, but with a different notation, also devised by Cutter, at the Cary Library in Lexington, Massachusetts.1\nMany libraries found this system too detailed and complex for their needs, and Cutter received many requests from librarians at small libraries who wanted the classification adapted for their collections. While numbers and letters are required in large library classifications, small libraries did not need their classification system to be too specific. He devised the Expansive Classification in response, to meet the needs of growing libraries, and to address some of the complaints of his critics.\nCutter completed and published an introduction and schedules for the first six classifications of his new system (\"Expansive Classification: Part I: The First Six Classifications\"), but his work on the seventh was interrupted by his death in 1903.210\nThe Cutter Expansive Classification, although adopted by comparatively few libraries, has been called one of the most logical and scholarly of American classifications.123\nLibrary historian Leo E. LaMontagne wrote:\nCutter produced the best classification of the nineteenth century. While his system was less \"scientific\" than that of J. P. Lesley, its other key features \u2013 notation, specificity, and versatility \u2013 make it deserving of the praise it has received.215\nIts top level divisions served as a basis for the Library of Congress Classification, which also took over some of its features.226 It did not catch on as did Dewey's system because Cutter died before it was completely finished, making no provision for the kind of development necessary as the bounds of knowledge expanded and scholarly emphases changed throughout the twentieth century.\nStructure.\nThe Expansive Classification uses seven separate schedules, each designed to be used by libraries of different sizes. After the first, each schedule was an expansion of the previous one,58\nand Cutter provided instructions for how a library might change from one expansion to another as it grows.\nSummary of schedules.\nFirst classification.\nThe first classification is meant for very small libraries. The first classification has only seven top-level classes, and only eight classes in total:\nFurther classifications.\nFurther expansions add more top-level classes and subdivisions. Many subclasses arranged systematically, with common divisions, such as those by geography and language, following a consistent system throughout.\nBy the fifth classification all the letters of the alphabet are in use for top-level classes. These are:\nThese schedules were not meant to be fixed, but were to be adapted to meet the needs of each library. For example, books on the English language may be put in X, and books on language in general in a subclass of X, or this can be reversed. The first option is less logical, but results in shorter marks for most English language libraries.27\nConstruction of call numbers.\nMost call numbers in the Expansive Classification follow conventions offering clues to the book's subject. The first line represents the subject, the second the author (and perhaps title), the third and fourth dates of editions, indications of translations, and critical works on particular books or authors. All numbers in the Expansive Classification are (or should be) shelved as if in decimal order.\nSize of volumes is indicated by points (.), pluses (+), or slashes (/ or //).\nFor some subjects a numerical geographical subdivision follows the classification letters on the first line. The number 83 stands for the United States\u2014hence, F83 is U.S. history, G83 U.S. travel, JU83 U.S. politics, WP83 U.S. painting. Geographical numbers are often further expanded decimally to represent more specific areas, sometimes followed by a capital letter indicating a particular city.\nThe second line usually represents the author's name by a capital letter plus one or more numbers arranged decimally. This may be followed by the first letter or letters of the title in lower-case, and/or sometimes the letters a, b, c indicating other printings of the same title. When appropriate, the second line may begin with a 'form' number\u2014e.g., 1 stands for history and criticism of a subject, 2 for a bibliography, 5 for a dictionary, 6 for an atlas or maps, 7 for a periodical, 8 for a society or university publication, 9 for a collection of works by different authors.\nOn the third line a capital Y indicates a work about the author or book represented by the first two lines, and a capital E (for English\u2014other letters are used for other languages) indicates a translation into English. If both criticism and translation apply to a single title, the number expands into four lines.\nCutter numbers.\nOne of the features adopted by other systems, including Library of Congress, is the Cutter number or Cutter code. It is an alphanumeric device to code text so that it can be arranged in alphabetical order using the fewest characters. It contains one or two initial letters and Arabic numbers, treated as a decimal. To construct a Cutter number, a cataloguer consults a Cutter table as required by the classification rules. Although Cutter numbers are mostly used for coding the names of authors, the system can be used for titles, subjects, geographic areas, and more.\nInitial letters Qa\u2013Qt are assigned Q2\u2013Q29, while entries beginning with numerals have a Cutter number A12\u2013A19, therefore sorting before the first A entry.\nSo to make the three-digit Cutter number for \"Cutter\", one would start with \"C\", then looking under \"other consonants\", find that \"u\" gives the number 8, and under \"additional letters\", \"t\" is 8, giving a Cutter number of \"C88\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was a graduate of Robert College. He worked with various Turkish rock bands such as Apa\u015flar, Karda\u015flar, Mo\u011follar and Dervi\u015fan. With these bands, he brought a new understanding and interpretation to Turkish rock.\nBiography.\nHe was the only child of Mehmet \u0130brahim Karaca, a theatre actor of Azerbaijani origin, and \u0130rma Felekyan, a popular opera, theatre, and movie actress of Armenian origin. His first group was called \"Dynamites\" and was a classic rock cover band. Later he joined \"Jaguars\", an Elvis Presley cover band. In 1967, he started to write his own music, joining the band \"Apa\u015flar\" (The Rowdies), his first Turkish language group. The same year, he participated in the Golden Microphone () contest, a popular music contest in which he won second place with his song \"Emrah\". In 1969, Karaca and bass-player Serhan Karabay left Apa\u015flar and started an original Anatolian group called \"Karda\u015flar\" (The Brothers).\nIn 1972, Karaca joined the group \"Mo\u011follar\" (The Mongols) and wrote one of his best-known songs, \"Namus Belas\u0131\". However, Cahit Berkay, the leader of Mo\u011follar, wanted an international reputation for his band, and he left for France to take the group to the next level. Karaca, who wanted to continue his Anatolian beat sound, left Mo\u011follar and started his own band \"Dervi\u015fan\" (Dervishes) in 1974. Karaca and Dervi\u015fan sang poetic and progressive songs.\nIn the 1970s, Turkey was dealing with political violence between supporters of the left and the right, separatist movements and the rise of Islamism. As the country fell into chaos, the government suspected Cem Karaca of involvement in rebel organisations. He was accused of treason for being a separatist thinker and a Marxist-Leninist. The Turkish government tried to portray Karaca as a man who was unknowingly writing songs to start a revolution. One politician was quoted as saying, \"Karaca is simply calling citizens to a bloody war against the state.\" \"Dervi\u015fan\" was ultimately dissolved at the end of 1977. In 1978, he founded \"Edirdahan\", an acronym for \"from Edirne to Ardahan\"; the westernmost and the easternmost provinces of Turkey. He recorded one LP with \"Edirdahan\" called \"\"Safinaz\".\nIn early 1979, Karaca left for Cologne, West Germany for business reasons. In 1980 he began singing in German with the song Nazim Hikmet - \"K\u0131z \u00c7ocu\u011fu\" (\"Little girl\"): Cem performed the German verses alternating with his best friend, manager, producer, arranger and bandleader/bass player/keyboarder/drummer, guitar player \"Ralf M\u00e4hnh\u00f6fer\" accompanying him on grand piano, solo or with the band \"Anatology\", singing the song in the Turkish language.\nTurkey continued to spin out of control with military curfews and the 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat on September 12, 1980. General Kenan Evren took over the government and temporarily banned all the nation's political parties. After the coup, many intellectuals, including writers, artists and journalists, were arrested. A warrant was issued for the arrest of Karaca by the government of Turkey.\nThe state invited Karaca back several times, but Karaca, not knowing what would happen upon his return, decided not to come back.\nWhile Karaca was in Germany his father died, but he could not return to attend the funeral. After some time, the Turkish government decided to strip Cem Karaca of his Turkish citizenship, keeping the arrest warrant active.\nSeveral years later, in 1987, the prime minister and leader of the Turkish Motherland Party, Turgut \u00d6zal, issued an amnesty for Karaca. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Turkey. His return also brought a new album with it, which released in September 12 of that year, \"Merhaba Gen\u00e7ler ve Her Zaman Gen\u00e7 Kalanlar\" (\"Hello, The Young and The Young at Heart\"\"), one of his most influential works. His return home was received cheerfully by his fans, but during his absence Karaca had lost the young audience and acquired only a few new listeners. He died of a heart attack on February 8, 2004, and was interred at Karacaahmet Cemetery in the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar district of Istanbul.\nMusical style.\nThe appreciation towards Cem Karaca won't be easy while at the same time he is also one of the most powerful voices of the Turkish rock scene. But the music styles audience will find him singing however will range very much, from severe mellowness chanson until powerful progressive song-based rock music. His first records were surely progressive, in a rock-sense, and Safinaz is symphonic piece comparable to a more western progressive rock albums. It remains rock music. Especially the period with Mogollar should appeal to collectors.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is also known for portraying Kitty Walker on \"Brothers &amp; Sisters\" (2006\u20132011), and Cat Grant on \"Supergirl\" (2015\u20132021). In film, she is known for her performances in \"The Birdcage\" (1996), \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1999), and \"Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her\" (2000). Flockhart has been married to actor Harrison Ford since 2010.\nEarly life and education.\nFlockhart was born in Freeport, Illinois, on November 11, 1964, the daughter of Kay Calista, an English teacher, and Ronald Flockhart, a Kraft Foods executive. Her parents retired to Morristown, Tennessee, where her father lived until his death and her mother continues to reside. She has one older brother, Gary. Her mother reversed her own first and middle names in naming her Calista Kay.\nFlockhart attended Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University\u2013New Brunswick. People began recognizing Flockhart's acting ability when William Esper (Mason Gross theater director and Flockhart's acting teacher) made an exception to policy by allowing Flockhart to perform on the main stage. Though this venue usually is reserved for juniors and seniors, Harold Scott insisted that Flockhart perform there in his production of William Inge's \"Picnic\". Flockhart graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in theater in 1988 from Rutgers as one of the few students who successfully completed the acting course. Rutgers inducted her into the Hall of Distinguished Alumni on May 3, 2003.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nIn spring 1989, Flockhart made her first television appearance in a minor role in an episode of \"Guiding Light\" as a babysitter. She also appeared in a one-hour afternoon special for \"\", playing a teenager battling an eating disorder. Flockhart made her professional debut on the New York stage, appearing in \"Beside Herself\" alongside Melissa Joan Hart, at the Circle Repertory Theatre. Two years later, Flockhart appeared in the television movie \"Darrow\". Though she later appeared in films \"Naked in New York\" (1993) and \"Getting In\" (1994), her first substantial speaking part in a film was in \"Quiz Show\", directed by Robert Redford.\nFlockhart debuted on Broadway in 1994, as Laura in \"The Glass Menagerie\". Flockhart received a Clarence Derwent Award for her performance. In 1995, Flockhart became acquainted with actors such as Dianne Wiest and Faye Dunaway when she appeared in the movie \"Drunks\". In 1996, Flockhart appeared as the daughter of Dianne Wiest and Gene Hackman's characters in \"The Birdcage\". Later that year, Flockhart starred in \"Jane Doe\" as a drug addict, though it was not released until 1999, over three years after filming ended. Throughout that year, she continued to work on Broadway, playing the role of Natasha in Anton Chekhov's \"Three Sisters\".\n\"Ally McBeal\".\nIn 1997, Flockhart was asked to audition for the starring role in David E. Kelley's Fox television series \"Ally McBeal\". Kelley, having heard of Flockhart, wanted her to audition for the contract part. Though she hesitated due to the necessary commitment to the show in a negotiable contract, she was swayed by the script and traveled to Los Angeles to audition for the part, which she won. She earned a Golden Globe Award for the role in 1998. Flockhart also appeared on the June 29, 1998, cover of \"Time\" magazine, placed as the newest iteration in the evolution of feminism, relating to the ongoing debate about the role depicted by her character. Flockhart starred on the show until it was canceled in 2002.\n\"Brothers &amp; Sisters\".\nFlockhart performed in a starring role as Kitty Walker, opposite Sally Field, Rachel Griffiths and Matthew Rhys, in the critically acclaimed ABC prime time series \"Brothers &amp; Sisters\", which premiered in September 2006 in the time slot after \"Desperate Housewives\". The show was cancelled in May 2011 after running for five years. Flockhart's character was significant throughout the series' first four years, but her appearances were reduced for the 2010\u20132011 season, coinciding with the departure of TV husband Rob Lowe.\nOther work.\nFlockhart played the role of Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", a 1999 film version of Shakespeare's play. In 2000, she appeared in \"Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her\" and \"\", later accompanying Eve Ensler to Kenya in order to protest violence against women, particularly female genital mutilation. Flockhart also starred in the off-Broadway production of Ensler's \"The Vagina Monologues\".\nIn 2004, Flockhart appeared as Matthew Broderick's deranged girlfriend in \"The Last Shot\". In the same year, Flockhart traveled to Spain for the filming of \"Fragile\", which premiered in September 2005 at the Venice Film Festival. She was offered the role of Susan Mayer on \"Desperate Housewives\" but declined, and the role later went to Teri Hatcher.\nIn 2014, Flockhart landed a role in \"Full Circle\"'s second season, as mob boss Ellen. It was expected to air in 2015. This had been Flockhart's first acting role in three years, after her hiatus when \"Brothers &amp; Sisters\" ended.\nIn 2015, Flockhart was cast in the television series \"Supergirl\" as Cat Grant, a \"self-made media magnate and founder of CatCo\" and boss to Kara (Supergirl's alter ego). The series premiered on October 26, 2015, on CBS. Due to the network's wish to reduce the show's budget, it was moved to sister network The CW after its first season, along with a move to filming in Vancouver. Flockhart remained with the show (albeit as a recurring character), despite her previous aversion to working outside Los Angeles.\nIn 2022, she played the role of Martha opposite Zachary Quinto in Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. The production was directed by Gordon Greenberg and also starred Aimee Carrero and Graham Phillips.\nIn 2024, Flockhart appeared as Lee Radziwill in \"\", the second season of the anthology series \"Feud\". Regarding playing Radziwill in an interview with \"The New York Times\", Flockhart said, \"Truman Capote recognized that she was living in her sister's shadow... and he would say things: 'You're so much prettier. You're so much smarter. You're more interesting. You have better style.' She really needed to hear that. I think it made her really love Truman. He was fun, and she confided in him, like they all did.\"\nPersonal life.\nIn January 2001, Flockhart announced that she had adopted a baby boy.\nFlockhart is married to actor Harrison Ford, whom she first met at the Golden Globe Awards on January 20, 2002. They became engaged on Valentine's Day in 2009, and were married on June 15, 2010, in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The ceremony was presided over by New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and New Mexico Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles W.

{"id": "7519", "revid": "38892066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7519", "title": "Convolution", "text": "Integral expressing the amount of overlap of one function as it is shifted over another\nIn mathematics (in particular, functional analysis), convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions formula_1 and formula_2 that produces a third function formula_3, as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reflected about the y-axis and shifted. The term \"convolution\" refers to both the resulting function and to the process of computing it. The integral is evaluated for all values of shift, producing the convolution function. The choice of which function is reflected and shifted before the integral does not change the integral result (see commutativity). Graphically, it expresses how the 'shape' of one function is modified by the other.\nSome features of convolution are similar to cross-correlation: for real-valued functions, of a continuous or discrete variable, convolution formula_3 differs from cross-correlation formula_5 only in that either formula_6 or formula_7 is reflected about the y-axis in convolution; thus it is a cross-correlation of formula_8 and formula_6, or formula_10 and formula_7.\u00a0For complex-valued functions, the cross-correlation operator is the adjoint of the convolution operator.\nConvolution has applications that include probability, statistics, acoustics, spectroscopy, signal processing and image processing, computer vision and human vision, geophysics, engineering, physics, and differential equations.\nThe convolution can be defined for functions on Euclidean space and other groups (as algebraic structures). For example, periodic functions, such as the discrete-time Fourier transform, can be defined on a circle and convolved by periodic convolution. (See row 18 at .) A \"discrete convolution\" can be defined for functions on the set of integers.\nGeneralizations of convolution have applications in the field of numerical analysis and numerical linear algebra, and in the design and implementation of finite impulse response filters in signal processing.\nComputing the inverse of the convolution operation is known as deconvolution.\nDefinition.\nThe convolution of formula_1 and formula_2 is written formula_14, denoting the operator with the symbol formula_15. It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reflected about the y-axis and shifted. As such, it is a particular kind of integral transform:\nformula_16\nAn equivalent definition is (see commutativity):\nformula_17\nWhile the symbol formula_18 is used above, it need not represent the time domain. At each formula_18, the convolution formula can be described as the area under the function formula_20 weighted by the function formula_21 shifted by the amount formula_18. As formula_18 changes, the weighting function formula_24 emphasizes different parts of the input function formula_20; If formula_18 is a positive value, then formula_24 is equal to formula_21 that slides or is shifted along the formula_29-axis toward the right (toward formula_30) by the amount of formula_18, while if formula_18 is a negative value, then formula_24 is equal to formula_21 that slides or is shifted toward the left (toward formula_35) by the amount of formula_36.\nFor functions formula_1, formula_2 supported on only formula_39 (i.e., zero for negative arguments), the integration limits can be truncated, resulting in:\nformula_40\nFor the multi-dimensional formulation of convolution, see \"domain of definition\" (below).\nNotation.\nA common engineering notational convention is:\nformula_41\nwhich has to be interpreted carefully to avoid confusion. For instance, formula_42 is equivalent to formula_43, but formula_44 is in fact equivalent to formula_45.\nRelations with other transforms.\nGiven two functions formula_46 and formula_47 with bilateral Laplace transforms (two-sided Laplace transform)\nformula_48\nand\nformula_49\nrespectively, the convolution operation formula_50 can be defined as the inverse Laplace transform of the product of formula_51 and formula_52. More precisely,\nformula_53\nLet formula_54, then\nformula_55\nNote that formula_56 is the bilateral Laplace transform of formula_50. A similar derivation can be done using the unilateral Laplace transform (one-sided Laplace transform).\nThe convolution operation also describes the output (in terms of the input) of an important class of operations known as \"linear time-invariant\" (LTI). See LTI system theory for a derivation of convolution as the result of LTI constraints. In terms of the Fourier transforms of the input and output of an LTI operation, no new frequency components are created. The existing ones are only modified (amplitude and/or phase). In other words, the output transform is the pointwise product of the input transform with a third transform (known as a transfer function). See Convolution theorem for a derivation of that property of convolution. Conversely, convolution can be derived as the inverse Fourier transform of the pointwise product of two Fourier transforms.\nHistorical developments.\nOne of the earliest uses of the convolution integral appeared in D'Alembert's derivation of Taylor's theorem in \"Recherches sur diff\u00e9rents points importants du syst\u00e8me du monde,\" published in 1754.\nAlso, an expression of the type:\nformula_58\nis used by Sylvestre Fran\u00e7ois Lacroix on page 505 of his book entitled \"Treatise on differences and series\", which is the last of 3 volumes of the encyclopedic series: , Chez Courcier, Paris, 1797\u20131800. Soon thereafter, convolution operations appear in the works of Pierre Simon Laplace, Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson, and others. The term itself did not come into wide use until the 1950s or 1960s. Prior to that it was sometimes known as \"Faltung\" (which means \"folding\" in German), \"composition product\", \"superposition integral\", and \"Carson's integral\". Yet it appears as early as 1903, though the definition is rather unfamiliar in older uses.\nThe operation:\nformula_59\nis a particular case of composition products considered by the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra in 1913.\nCircular convolution.\nWhen a function formula_60 is periodic, with period formula_61, then for functions, formula_1, such that formula_63 exists, the convolution is also periodic and identical to:\nformula_64\nwhere formula_65 is an arbitrary choice. The summation is called a periodic summation of the function formula_1.\nWhen formula_60 is a periodic summation of another function, formula_2, then formula_69 is known as a \"circular\" or \"cyclic\" convolution of formula_1 and formula_2.\nAnd if the periodic summation above is replaced by formula_72, the operation is called a \"periodic\" convolution of formula_72 and formula_60.\nDiscrete convolution.\nFor complex-valued functions formula_1 and formula_2 defined on the set formula_77 of integers, the \"discrete convolution\" of formula_1 and formula_2 is given by:\nformula_80\nor equivalently (see commutativity) by:\nformula_81\nThe convolution of two finite sequences is defined by extending the sequences to finitely supported functions on the set of integers. When the sequences are the coefficients of two polynomials, then the coefficients of the ordinary product of the two polynomials are the convolution of the original two sequences. This is known as the Cauchy product of the coefficients of the sequences.\nThus, when g is non-zero over a finite interval [-M,+M] (representing, for instance, a finite impulse response), a finite summation may be used:\nformula_82\nCircular discrete convolution.\nWhen a function formula_83 is periodic, with period formula_84 then for functions, formula_85 such that formula_86 exists, the convolution is also periodic and identical to:\nformula_87\nThe summation on formula_88 is called a periodic summation of the function formula_89\nIf formula_83 is a periodic summation of another function, formula_91 then formula_86 is known as a circular convolution of formula_1 and formula_94\nWhen the non-zero durations of both formula_1 and formula_2 are limited to the interval formula_97\u00a0 formula_86 reduces to these common forms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe notation formula_99 for \"cyclic convolution\" denotes convolution over the cyclic group of integers modulo \"N\".\nCircular convolution arises most often in the context of fast convolution with a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm.\nFast convolution algorithms.\nIn many situations, discrete convolutions can be converted to circular convolutions so that fast transforms with a convolution property can be used to implement the computation. For example, convolution of digit sequences is the kernel operation in multiplication of multi-digit numbers, which can therefore be efficiently implemented with transform techniques (; ).\nEq.1 requires N arithmetic operations per output value and \"N\"2 operations for N outputs. That can be significantly reduced with any of several fast algorithms. Digital signal processing and other applications typically use fast convolution algorithms to reduce the cost of the convolution to O(N log N) complexity.\nThe most common fast convolution algorithms use fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms via the circular convolution theorem. Specifically, the circular convolution of two finite-length sequences is found by taking an FFT of each sequence, multiplying pointwise, and then performing an inverse FFT. Convolutions of the type defined above are then efficiently implemented using that technique in conjunction with zero-extension and/or discarding portions of the output. Other fast convolution algorithms, such as the Sch\u00f6nhage\u2013Strassen algorithm or the Mersenne transform, use fast Fourier transforms in other rings. The Winograd method is used as an alternative to the FFT. It significantly speeds up 1D, 2D, and 3D convolution.\nIf one sequence is much longer than the other, zero-extension of the shorter sequence and fast circular convolution is not the most computationally efficient method available. Instead, decomposing the longer sequence into blocks and convolving each block allows for faster algorithms such as the overlap\u2013save method and overlap\u2013add method. A hybrid convolution method that combines block and FIR algorithms allows for a zero input-output latency that is useful for real-time convolution computations.\nDomain of definition.\nThe convolution of two complex-valued functions on R\"d\" is itself a complex-valued function on R\"d\", defined by:\nformula_100\nand is well-defined only if f and g decay sufficiently rapidly at infinity in order for the integral to exist. Conditions for the existence of the convolution may be tricky, since a blow-up in g at infinity can be easily offset by sufficiently rapid decay in f. The question of existence thus may involve different conditions on f and g:\nCompactly supported functions.\nIf f and g are compactly supported continuous functions, then their convolution exists, and is also compactly supported and continuous . More generally, if either function (say f) is compactly supported and the other is locally integrable, then the convolution \"f\"\u2217\"g\" is well-defined and continuous.\nConvolution of f and g is also well defined when both functions are locally square integrable on R and supported on an interval of the form [\"a\", +\u221e) (or both supported on [\u2212\u221e, \"a\"]).\nIntegrable functions.\nThe convolution of f and g exists if f and g are both Lebesgue integrable functions in \"L\"1(R\"d\"), and in this case \"f\"\u2217\"g\" is also integrable . This is a consequence of Tonelli's theorem. This is also true for functions in \"L\"1, under the discrete convolution, or more generally for the convolution on any group.\nLikewise, if \"f\" \u2208 \"L\"1(R\"d\")\u00a0 and \u00a0\"g\" \u2208 \"L\"\"p\"(R\"d\")\u00a0 where 1 \u2264 \"p\" \u2264 \u221e,\u00a0 then \u00a0\"f\"*\"g\" \u2208 \"L\"\"p\"(R\"d\"),\u00a0 and\nformula_101\nIn the particular case \"p\" \n 1, this shows that \"L\"1 is a Banach algebra under the convolution (and equality of the two sides holds if f and g are non-negative almost everywhere).\nMore generally, Young's inequality implies that the convolution is a continuous bilinear map between suitable \"L\"\"p\" spaces. Specifically, if 1 \u2264 \"p\", \"q\", \"r\" \u2264 \u221e satisfy:\nformula_102\nthen\nformula_103\nso that the convolution is a continuous bilinear mapping from \"L\"\"p\"\u00d7\"L\"\"q\" to \"L\"\"r\".\nThe Young inequality for convolution is also true in other contexts (circle group, convolution on Z). The preceding inequality is not sharp on the real line: when 1 &lt; \"p\", \"q\", \"r\" &lt; \u221e, there exists a constant \"B\"\"p\",\"q\" &lt; 1 such that:\nformula_104\nThe optimal value of \"B\"\"p\",\"q\" was discovered in 1975 and independently in 1976, see Brascamp\u2013Lieb inequality.\nA stronger estimate is true provided 1 &lt; \"p\", \"q\", \"r\" &lt; \u221e:\nformula_105\nwhere formula_106 is the weak \"L\"\"q\" norm. Convolution also defines a bilinear continuous map formula_107 for formula_108, owing to the weak Young inequality:\nformula_109\nFunctions of rapid decay.\nIn addition to compactly supported functions and integrable functions, functions that have sufficiently rapid decay at infinity can also be convolved. An important feature of the convolution is that if \"f\" and \"g\" both decay rapidly, then \"f\"\u2217\"g\" also decays rapidly. In particular, if \"f\" and \"g\" are rapidly decreasing functions, then so is the convolution \"f\"\u2217\"g\". Combined with the fact that convolution commutes with differentiation (see #Properties), it follows that the class of Schwartz functions is closed under convolution .\nDistributions.\nIf \"f\" is a smooth function that is compactly supported and \"g\" is a distribution, then \"f\"\u2217\"g\" is a smooth function defined by\nformula_110\nMore generally, it is possible to extend the definition of the convolution in a unique way with formula_111 the same as \"f\" above, so that the associative law\nformula_112\nremains valid in the case where \"f\" is a distribution, and \"g\" a compactly supported distribution .\nMeasures.\nThe convolution of any two Borel measures \"\u03bc\" and \"\u03bd\" of bounded variation is the measure formula_113 defined by \nformula_114\nIn particular,\n formula_115\nwhere formula_116 is a measurable set and formula_117 is the indicator function of formula_118.\nThis agrees with the convolution defined above when \u03bc and \u03bd are regarded as distributions, as well as the convolution of L1 functions when \u03bc and \u03bd are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.\nThe convolution of measures also satisfies the following version of Young's inequality\nformula_119\nwhere the norm is the total variation of a measure. Because the space of measures of bounded variation is a Banach space, convolution of measures can be treated with standard methods of functional analysis that may not apply for the convolution of distributions.\nProperties.\nAlgebraic properties.\nThe convolution defines a product on the linear space of integrable functions. This product satisfies the following algebraic properties, which formally mean that the space of integrable functions with the product given by convolution is a commutative associative algebra without identity . Other linear spaces of functions, such as the space of continuous functions of compact support, are closed under the convolution, and so also form commutative associative algebras.\nProof (using convolution theorem):\nformula_132\nformula_133\nformula_134\nformula_136\nIntegration.\nIf \"f\" and \"g\" are integrable functions, then the integral of their convolution on the whole space is simply obtained as the product of their integrals:\n formula_140\nThis follows from Fubini's theorem. The same result holds if \"f\" and \"g\" are only assumed to be nonnegative measurable functions, by Tonelli's theorem.\nDifferentiation.\nIn the one-variable case,\n formula_141\nwhere formula_142 is the derivative. More generally, in the case of functions of several variables, an analogous formula holds with the partial derivative:\n formula_143\nA particular consequence of this is that the convolution can be viewed as a \"smoothing\" operation: the convolution of \"f\" and \"g\" is differentiable as many times as \"f\" and \"g\" are in total.\nThese identities hold for example under the condition that \"f\" and \"g\" are absolutely integrable and at least one of them has an absolutely integrable (L1) weak derivative, as a consequence of Young's convolution inequality. For instance, when \"f\" is continuously differentiable with compact support, and \"g\" is an arbitrary locally integrable function,\n formula_144\nThese identities also hold much more broadly in the sense of tempered distributions if one of \"f\" or \"g\" is a \nrapidly decreasing tempered distribution, a \ncompactly supported tempered distribution or a Schwartz function and the other is a tempered distribution. On the other hand, two positive integrable and infinitely differentiable functions may have a nowhere continuous convolution.\nIn the discrete case, the difference operator \"D\" \"f\"(\"n\") = \"f\"(\"n\" + 1) \u2212 \"f\"(\"n\") satisfies an analogous relationship:\n formula_145\nConvolution theorem.\nThe convolution theorem states that\n formula_146\nwhere formula_147 denotes the Fourier transform of formula_1.\nConvolution in other types of transformations.\nVersions of this theorem also hold for the Laplace transform, two-sided Laplace transform, Z-transform and Mellin transform.\nConvolution on matrices.\nIf formula_149 is the Fourier transform matrix, then\n formula_150,\nwhere formula_151 is face-splitting product, formula_152 denotes Kronecker product, formula_153 denotes Hadamard product (this result is an evolving of count sketch properties).\nThis can be generalized for appropriate matrices formula_154:\n formula_155\nfrom the properties of the face-splitting product.\nTranslational equivariance.\nThe convolution commutes with translations, meaning that\n formula_156\nwhere \u03c4\"x\"f is the translation of the function \"f\" by \"x\" defined by\n formula_157\nIf \"f\" is a Schwartz function, then \"\u03c4xf\" is the convolution with a translated Dirac delta function \"\u03c4\"\"x\"\"f\" = \"f\" \u2217 \"\u03c4\"\"x\" \"\u03b4\". So translation invariance of the convolution of Schwartz functions is a consequence of the associativity of convolution.\nFurthermore, under certain conditions, convolution is the most general translation invariant operation. Informally speaking, the following holds\n Suppose that \"S\" is a bounded linear operator acting on functions which commutes with translations: \"S\"(\"\u03c4xf\") = \"\u03c4x\"(\"Sf\") for all \"x\". Then \"S\" is given as convolution with a function (or distribution) \"g\"\"S\"; that is \"Sf\" = \"g\"\"S\" \u2217 \"f\".\nThus some translation invariant operations can be represented as convolution. Convolutions play an important role in the study of time-invariant systems, and especially LTI system theory. The representing function \"g\"\"S\" is the impulse response of the transformation \"S\".\nA more precise version of the theorem quoted above requires specifying the class of functions on which the convolution is defined, and also requires assuming in addition that \"S\" must be a continuous linear operator with respect to the appropriate topology. It is known, for instance, that every continuous translation invariant continuous linear operator on \"L\"1 is the convolution with a finite Borel measure. More generally, every continuous translation invariant continuous linear operator on \"L\"\"p\" for 1 \u2264 \"p\" &lt; \u221e is the convolution with a tempered distribution whose Fourier transform is bounded. To wit, they are all given by bounded Fourier multipliers.\nConvolutions on groups.\nIf \"G\" is a suitable group endowed with a measure \u03bb, and if \"f\" and \"g\" are real or complex valued integrable functions on \"G\", then we can define their convolution by\nformula_158\nIt is not commutative in general. In typical cases of interest \"G\" is a locally compact Hausdorff topological group and \u03bb is a (left-) Haar measure. In that case, unless \"G\" is unimodular, the convolution defined in this way is not the same as formula_159. The preference of one over the other is made so that convolution with a fixed function \"g\" commutes with left translation in the group:\nformula_160\nFurthermore, the convention is also required for consistency with the definition of the convolution of measures given below. However, with a right instead of a left Haar measure, the latter integral is preferred over the former.\nOn locally compact abelian groups, a version of the convolution theorem holds: the Fourier transform of a convolution is the pointwise product of the Fourier transforms. The circle group T with the Lebesgue measure is an immediate example. For a fixed \"g\" in \"L\"1(T), we have the following familiar operator acting on the Hilbert space \"L\"2(T):\nformula_161\nThe operator \"T\" is compact. A direct calculation shows that its adjoint \"T* \" is convolution with\nformula_162\nBy the commutativity property cited above, \"T\" is normal: \"T\"* \"T\" = \"TT\"* . Also, \"T\" commutes with the translation operators. Consider the family \"S\" of operators consisting of all such convolutions and the translation operators. Then \"S\" is a commuting family of normal operators. According to spectral theory, there exists an orthonormal basis {\"hk\"} that simultaneously diagonalizes \"S\". This characterizes convolutions on the circle. Specifically, we have\nformula_163\nwhich are precisely the characters of T. Each convolution is a compact multiplication operator in this basis. This can be viewed as a version of the convolution theorem discussed above.\nA discrete example is a finite cyclic group of order \"n\". Convolution operators are here represented by circulant matrices, and can be diagonalized by the discrete Fourier transform.\nA similar result holds for compact groups (not necessarily abelian): the matrix coefficients of finite-dimensional unitary representations form an orthonormal basis in \"L\"2 by the Peter\u2013Weyl theorem, and an analog of the convolution theorem continues to hold, along with many other aspects of harmonic analysis that depend on the Fourier transform.\nConvolution of measures.\nLet \"G\" be a (multiplicatively written) topological group.\nIf \u03bc and \u03bd are Radon measures on \"G\", then their convolution \"\u03bc\"\u2217\"\u03bd\" is defined as the pushforward measure of the group action and can be written as\nformula_164\nfor each measurable subset \"E\" of \"G\". The convolution is also a Radon measure, whose total variation satisfies\nformula_165\nIn the case when \"G\" is locally compact with (left-)Haar measure \u03bb, and \u03bc and \u03bd are absolutely continuous with respect to a \u03bb, so that each has a density function, then the convolution \u03bc\u2217\u03bd is also absolutely continuous, and its density function is just the convolution of the two separate density functions. In fact, if \"either\" measure is absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure, then so is their convolution.\nIf \u03bc and \u03bd are probability measures on the topological group (R,+), then the convolution \"\u03bc\"\u2217\"\u03bd\" is the probability distribution of the sum \"X\" + \"Y\" of two independent random variables \"X\" and \"Y\" whose respective distributions are \u03bc and \u03bd.\nInfimal convolution.\nIn convex analysis, the infimal convolution of proper (not identically formula_30) convex functions formula_167 on formula_168 is defined by:\nformula_169\nIt can be shown that the infimal convolution of convex functions is convex. Furthermore, it satisfies an identity analogous to that of the Fourier transform of a traditional convolution, with the role of the Fourier transform is played instead by the Legendre transform:\nformula_170\nWe have:\nformula_171\nBialgebras.\nLet (\"X\", \u0394, \u2207, \"\u03b5\", \"\u03b7\") be a bialgebra with comultiplication \u0394, multiplication \u2207, unit \u03b7, and counit \"\u03b5\". The convolution is a product defined on the endomorphism algebra End(\"X\") as follows. Let \"\u03c6\", \"\u03c8\" \u2208 End(\"X\"), that is, \"\u03c6\", \"\u03c8\": \"X\" \u2192 \"X\" are functions that respect all algebraic structure of \"X\", then the convolution \"\u03c6\"\u2217\"\u03c8\" is defined as the composition\nformula_172\nThe convolution appears notably in the definition of Hopf algebras . A bialgebra is a Hopf algebra if and only if it has an antipode: an endomorphism \"S\" such that\nformula_173\nApplications.\nConvolution and related operations are found in many applications in science, engineering and mathematics.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It may also contain unseparated husk parts. The fabric is coarser than muslin, but less coarse and thick than canvas or denim. It is still very cheap owing to its unfinished and undyed appearance.\nThe fabric was originally from the city of Calicut in southwestern India. It was made by the traditional weavers called c\u0101liyans. The raw fabric was dyed and printed in bright hues, and calico prints became popular in Europe.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nCalico originated in Calicut, from which the name of the textile came, in India, now Kerala, during the 11th century, where the cloth was known as \"chaliyan\". It was mentioned in Indian literature by the 12th century when the polymath and writer Hemachandra described calico fabric prints with a lotus design. Calico was woven using Gujarati cotton from Surat for both the warp and weft. By the 15th century, calico from Gujarat made its appearance in Cairo, then capital of the Egypt Eyalet under the Ottoman Empire. Trade with Europe followed from the 17th century onwards.\nPolitics of cotton in the British Empire.\nIn the 18th century, England was famous for its woollen and worsted cloth. That industry, centered in the east and south in towns such as Norwich, jealously protected their product. Cotton processing was tiny: in 1701, only of cottonwool was imported into England, and by 1730 this had fallen to . This was due to commercial legislation to protect the woollen industry. Cheap calico prints, imported by the East India Company from Hindust\u0101n (India), had become popular. In 1700 the first of the Calico Acts was passed to prevent the import of dyed or printed calicoes from India, China or Persia. This caused demand to switch to imported grey cloth instead \u2014 calico that had not been finished-dyed or printed. These were printed with popular patterns in southern England. Also, Lancashire businessmen produced grey cloth with linen warp and cotton weft, known as fustian, which they sent to London for finishing. Cottonwool imports recovered though, and by 1720 were almost back to their 1701 levels. Coventry woollen manufacturers claimed that the imports were taking jobs away from their workers. The Woollen, etc., Manufactures Act 1720 was passed, enacting fines against anyone caught wearing printed or stained calico muslins, but neckcloths and fustians were exempted. The Lancashire manufacturers exploited this exemption; coloured cotton weft with linen warp were specifically permitted by the 1736 Manchester Act.\nIn 1764, of cottonwool was imported.\nIn North America, the Sons of Liberty disguised themselves in calico as Indians during the Boston Tea Party. Participants in the Anti-Rent War of the early nineteenth century used this disguise to associate land monopoly in the Hudson Valley with the trade monopoly of the East India Company.\nCalico printing.\nEarly Indian chintz, that is, glazed calico with a large floral pattern, was primarily produced using painting techniques. Later, the hues were applied by wooden blocks, and the cloth manufacturers in Britain printed calico using wooden block printing. Calico printers at work are depicted in one of the stained glass windows made by Stephen Adam for the Maryhill Burgh Halls, Glasgow. Confusingly, linen and silk printed this way were known as \"linen calicoes\" and \"silk calicoes\". Early European calicoes (1680) were cheap plain weave white cotton fabric, or cream or unbleached cotton, with a design block-printed using a single alizarin dye fixed with two mordants, giving a red and black pattern. Polychromatic prints were possible, using two sets of blocks and an additional blue dye. The Indian taste was for dark printed backgrounds, while the European market preferred a pattern on a cream base. As the century progressed the European preference moved from the large chintz patterns to smaller, tighter patterns.\nThomas Bell patented a printing technique in 1783 that used copper rollers. In 1785, Livesey, Hargreaves and Company put the first machine that used this technique into operation in Walton-le-Dale, Lancashire. The production volume for printed cloth in Lancashire in 1750 was estimated at 50,000 pieces of ; in 1850, it was 20,000,000 pieces. The commercial method of calico printing using engraved rollers was invented in 1821 in New Mills, Derbyshire, in the United Kingdom. John Potts of Potts, Oliver and Potts used a copper-engraved master to produce rollers to transfer the inks. After 1888, block printing was only used for short-run specialized jobs. After 1880, profits from printing fell due to overcapacity and the firms started to form combines. In the first, three Scottish firms formed the United Turkey Red Co. Ltd in 1897, and the second, in 1899, was the much larger Calico Printers' Association 46 printing concerns and 13 merchants combined, representing 85% of the British printing capacity. Some of this capacity was removed and in 1901 Calico had 48% of the printing trade. In 1916, they and the other printers formed and joined a trade association, which then set minimum prices for each 'price section' of the industry.\nThe trade association remained in operation until 1954, when the arrangement was challenged by the government Monopolies Commission. Over the intervening period much trade had been lost overseas.\nTerminology.\nPrinted calico was imported into the United States from Lancashire in the 1780s, and led to a linguistic separation: while Europe maintained the word calico for the fabric, in the US it was used to refer to the printed design, where these colourful, small-patterned printed fabrics also gave rise to the use of the word calico to describe a cat coat colour: calico cat. The patterned fabric also gave its name to common names for two North American crab species, \"Ovalipes ocellatus\" and \"Hepatus epheliticus\".\nIn the UK, Australia and New Zealand:\nIn the US:"}

Calorimetry is performed with a calorimeter. Scottish physician and scientist Joseph Black, who was the first to recognize the distinction between heat and temperature, is said to be the founder of the science of calorimetry.\nIndirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce by measuring either their production of carbon dioxide and nitrogen waste (frequently ammonia in aquatic organisms, or urea in terrestrial ones), or from their consumption of oxygen. Lavoisier noted in 1780 that heat production can be predicted from oxygen consumption this way, using multiple regression. The dynamic energy budget theory explains why this procedure is correct. Heat generated by living organisms may also be measured by \"direct calorimetry\", in which the entire organism is placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement.\nA widely used modern instrument is the differential scanning calorimeter, a device which allows thermal data to be obtained on small amounts of material. It involves heating the sample at a controlled rate and recording the heat flow either into or from the specimen.\nHistory.\nThe concept of heat has intrigued scientists for more than 2500 years. In the Graeco-Roman era, Plato and Aristotle regarded heat as a manifestation of fire. Newton proposed that it was transmitted by vibrations of the particles of aether, while Descartes described it as an accelerated motion of air particles induced by light. Robert Hooke viewed heat as a property of matter arising from the motion of its parts. For centuries, the prevailing theory imagined heat as a self-repelling, weightless fluid called \"caloric\".\nThe measurement of heat began to take shape about three centuries ago. In 1750, Georg Wilhelm Richmann formulated the first general calorimetric equation, later known as Richmann's law, allowing calculation of the equilibrium temperature of mixed substances of the same kind. A decade later, Joseph Black made a decisive contribution: in 1761, he discovered that adding heat to ice at its melting point or to boiling water did not change their temperature. His identification of latent and specific heat marked the birth of thermodynamics and introduced the distinction between heat and temperature.\nIn 1789, Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace constructed the first calorimeter, launching quantitative calorimetry. The next major advance came from Sir Benjamin Thompson in the 1790s. Observing heat generated during cannon boring under water, he concluded that heat must be a form of energy, not a material substance.\nThis idea was quantified by James Prescott Joule, who in the 1840s determined the mechanical equivalent of heat. Using falling weights to drive a paddle in an insulated liquid, Joule demonstrated that 4.184 joules of work produce the same heating effect as one calorie, establishing a numerical link between mechanical work and thermal energy.\nAround the same time, in 1840, the chemist Germain Henri Hess formulated Hess's law, showing that the total enthalpy change of a chemical reaction is independent of the reaction path. This principle remains fundamental to modern thermochemistry and calorimetry.\nFinally, in the 1870s, Pierre Eug\u00e8ne Berthelot developed the first modern bomb calorimeter and introduced the concepts of endothermic and exothermic reactions.\nClassical calorimetric calculation of heat.\nCases with differentiable equation of state for a one-component body.\nBasic classical calculation with respect to volume.\nCalorimetry requires that a reference material that changes temperature have known definite thermal constitutive properties. The classical rule, recognized by Clausius and Kelvin, is that the pressure exerted by the calorimetric material is fully and rapidly determined solely by its temperature and volume; this rule is for changes that do not involve phase change, such as melting of ice. There are many materials that do not comply with this rule, and for them, the present formula of classical calorimetry does not provide an adequate account. Here the classical rule is assumed to hold for the calorimetric material being used, and the propositions are mathematically written:\nThe thermal response of the calorimetric material is fully described by its pressure formula_1 as the value of its constitutive function formula_2 of just the volume formula_3 and the temperature formula_4. All increments are here required to be very small. This calculation refers to a domain of volume and temperature of the body in which no phase change occurs, and there is only one phase present. An important assumption here is continuity of property relations. A different analysis is needed for phase change\nWhen a small increment of heat is gained by a calorimetric body, with small increments, formula_5 of its volume, and formula_6 of its temperature, the increment of heat, formula_7, gained by the body of calorimetric material, is given by\nformula_8\nwhere\nformula_9 denotes the latent heat with respect to volume, of the calorimetric material at constant controlled temperature formula_10. The surroundings' pressure on the material is instrumentally adjusted to impose a chosen volume change, with initial volume formula_3. To determine this latent heat, the volume change is effectively the independently instrumentally varied quantity. This latent heat is not one of the widely used ones, but is of theoretical or conceptual interest.\nformula_12 denotes the heat capacity, of the calorimetric material at fixed constant volume formula_3, while the pressure of the material is allowed to vary freely, with initial temperature formula_4. The temperature is forced to change by exposure to a suitable heat bath. It is customary to write formula_12 simply as formula_16, or even more briefly as formula_17. This latent heat is one of the two widely used ones.\nThe latent heat with respect to volume is the heat required for unit increment in volume at constant temperature. It can be said to be 'measured along an isotherm', and the pressure the material exerts is allowed to vary freely, according to its constitutive law formula_18. For a given material, it can have a positive or negative sign or exceptionally it can be zero, and this can depend on the temperature, as it does for water about 4 C. The concept of latent heat with respect to volume was perhaps first recognized by Joseph Black in 1762. The term 'latent heat of expansion' is also used. The latent heat with respect to volume can also be called the 'latent energy with respect to volume'. For all of these usages of 'latent heat', a more systematic terminology uses 'latent heat capacity'.\nThe heat capacity at constant volume is the heat required for unit increment in temperature at constant volume. It can be said to be 'measured along an isochor', and again, the pressure the material exerts is allowed to vary freely. It always has a positive sign. This means that for an increase in the temperature of a body without change of its volume, heat must be supplied to it. This is consistent with common experience.\nQuantities like formula_7 are sometimes called 'curve differentials', because they are measured along curves in the formula_20 surface.\nClassical theory for constant-volume (isochoric) calorimetry.\nConstant-volume calorimetry is calorimetry performed at a constant volume. This involves the use of a constant-volume calorimeter. Heat is still measured by the above-stated principle of calorimetry.\nThis means that in a suitably constructed calorimeter, called a bomb calorimeter, the increment of volume formula_5 can be made to vanish, formula_22. For constant-volume calorimetry:\nformula_23\nwhere\nformula_6 denotes the increment in temperature and\nformula_17 denotes the heat capacity at constant volume.\nClassical heat calculation with respect to pressure.\nFrom the above rule of calculation of heat with respect to volume, there follows one with respect to pressure.\nIn a process of small increments, formula_26 of its pressure, and formula_6 of its temperature, the increment of heat, formula_7, gained by the body of calorimetric material, is given by\nformula_29\nwhere\nformula_30 denotes the latent heat with respect to pressure, of the calorimetric material at constant temperature, while the volume and pressure of the body are allowed to vary freely, at pressure formula_1 and temperature formula_4;\nformula_33 denotes the heat capacity, of the calorimetric material at constant pressure, while the temperature and volume of the body are allowed to vary freely, at pressure formula_1 and temperature formula_4. It is customary to write formula_33 simply as formula_37, or even more briefly as formula_38.\nThe new quantities here are related to the previous ones:\nformula_39\nformula_40\nwhere\nformula_41 denotes the partial derivative of formula_2 with respect to formula_3 evaluated for formula_20\nand\nformula_45 denotes the partial derivative of formula_2 with respect to formula_4 evaluated for formula_20.\nThe latent heats formula_9 and formula_30 are always of opposite sign.\nIt is common to refer to the ratio of specific heats as\nformula_51 often just written as formula_52.\nCalorimetry through phase change, equation of state shows one jump discontinuity.\nAn early calorimeter was that used by Laplace and Lavoisier, as shown in the figure above. It worked at constant temperature, and at atmospheric pressure. The latent heat involved was then not a latent heat with respect to volume or with respect to pressure, as in the above account for calorimetry without phase change. The latent heat involved in this calorimeter was with respect to phase change, naturally occurring at constant temperature. This kind of calorimeter worked by measurement of mass of water produced by the melting of ice, which is a phase change.\nCumulation of heating.\nFor a time-dependent process of heating of the calorimetric material, defined by a continuous joint progression formula_53 of formula_54 and formula_55, starting at time formula_56 and ending at time formula_57, there can be calculated an accumulated quantity of heat delivered, formula_58 . This calculation is done by mathematical integration along the progression with respect to time. This is because increments of heat are 'additive'; but this does not mean that heat is a conservative quantity. The idea that heat was a conservative quantity was invented by Lavoisier, and is called the 'caloric theory'; by the middle of the nineteenth century it was recognized as mistaken. Written with the symbol formula_59, the quantity formula_58 is not at all restricted to be an increment with very small values; this is in contrast with formula_7.\nOne can write\nformula_62\nformula_63\nformula_64.\nThis expression uses quantities such as formula_65 which are defined in the section below headed 'Mathematical aspects of the above rules'.\nMathematical aspects of the above rules.\nThe use of 'very small' quantities such as formula_7 is related to the physical requirement for the quantity formula_2 to be 'rapidly determined' by formula_3 and formula_4; such 'rapid determination' refers to a physical process. These 'very small' quantities are used in the Leibniz approach to the infinitesimal calculus. The Newton approach uses instead 'fluxions' such as formula_70, which makes it more obvious that formula_2 must be 'rapidly determined'.\nIn terms of fluxions, the above first rule of calculation can be written\nformula_72\nwhere\nformula_73 denotes the time\nformula_65 denotes the time rate of heating of the calorimetric material at time formula_73\nformula_76 denotes the time rate of change of volume of the calorimetric material at time formula_73\nformula_78 denotes the time rate of change of temperature of the calorimetric material.\nThe increment formula_7 and the fluxion formula_65 are obtained for a particular time formula_73 that determines the values of the quantities on the righthand sides of the above rules. But this is not a reason to expect that there should exist a mathematical function formula_82. For this reason, the increment formula_7 is said to be an 'imperfect differential' or an 'inexact differential'. Some books indicate this by writing formula_84 instead of formula_7. Also, the notation \"\u0111Q\" is used in some books. Carelessness about this can lead to error.&lt;ref name=\"Planck 1923/1926 57\"&gt;Planck, M. (1923/1926), page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe quantity formula_62 is properly said to be a functional of the continuous joint progression formula_53 of formula_54 and formula_55, but, in the mathematical definition of a function, formula_62 is not a function of formula_20. Although the fluxion formula_65 is defined here as a function of time formula_73, the symbols formula_94 and formula_82 respectively standing alone are not defined here.\nPhysical scope of the above rules of calorimetry.\nThe above rules refer only to suitable calorimetric materials. The terms 'rapidly' and 'very small' call for empirical physical checking of the domain of validity of the above rules.\nThe above rules for the calculation of heat belong to pure calorimetry. They make no reference to thermodynamics, and were mostly understood before the advent of thermodynamics. They are the basis of the 'thermo' contribution to thermodynamics. The 'dynamics' contribution is based on the idea of work, which is not used in the above rules of calculation.\nExperimentally conveniently measured coefficients.\nEmpirically, it is convenient to measure properties of calorimetric materials under experimentally controlled conditions.\nPressure increase at constant volume.\nFor measurements at experimentally controlled volume, one can use the assumption, stated above, that the pressure of the body of calorimetric material is can be expressed as a function of its volume and temperature.\nFor measurement at constant experimentally controlled volume, the isochoric coefficient of pressure rise with temperature, is defined by \nformula_96\nExpansion at constant pressure.\nFor measurements at experimentally controlled pressure, it is assumed that the volume formula_3 of the body of calorimetric material can be expressed as a function formula_98 of its temperature formula_4 and pressure formula_1. This assumption is related to, but is not the same as, the above used assumption that the pressure of the body of calorimetric material is known as a function of its volume and temperature; anomalous behaviour of materials can affect this relation.\nThe quantity that is conveniently measured at constant experimentally controlled pressure, the isobar volume expansion coefficient, is defined by \nformula_101\nCompressibility at constant temperature.\nFor measurements at experimentally controlled temperature, it is again assumed that the volume formula_3 of the body of calorimetric material can be expressed as a function formula_98 of its temperature formula_4 and pressure formula_1, with the same provisos as mentioned just above.\nThe quantity that is conveniently measured at constant experimentally controlled temperature, the isothermal compressibility, is defined by \nformula_106\nRelation between classical calorimetric quantities.\nAssuming that the rule formula_18 is known, one can derive the function of formula_108 that is used above in the classical heat calculation with respect to pressure. This function can be found experimentally from the coefficients formula_109 and formula_110 through the mathematically deducible relation\nformula_111.\nConnection between calorimetry and thermodynamics.\nThermodynamics developed gradually over the first half of the nineteenth century, building on the above theory of calorimetry which had been worked out before it, and on other discoveries. According to Gislason and Craig (2005): \"Most thermodynamic data come from calorimetry...\" According to Kondepudi (2008): \"Calorimetry is widely used in present day laboratories.\"\nIn terms of thermodynamics, the internal energy formula_112 of the calorimetric material can be considered as the value of a function formula_113 of formula_20, with partial derivatives formula_115 and formula_116.\nThen it can be shown that one can write a thermodynamic version of the above calorimetric rules:\nformula_117\nwith\nformula_118\nand\nformula_119 .\nAgain, further in terms of thermodynamics, the internal energy formula_112 of the calorimetric material can sometimes, depending on the calorimetric material, be considered as the value of a function formula_121 of formula_122, with partial derivatives formula_123 and formula_116, and with formula_3 being expressible as the value of a function formula_126 of formula_122, with partial derivatives formula_128 and formula_129 .\nThen, according to Adkins (1975), it can be shown that one can write a further thermodynamic version of the above calorimetric rules:\nformula_130\nwith\nformula_131\nand\nformula_132 .\nBeyond the calorimetric fact noted above that the latent heats formula_9 and formula_30 are always of opposite sign, it may be shown, using the thermodynamic concept of work, that also\nformula_135\nSpecial interest of thermodynamics in calorimetry: the isothermal segments of a Carnot cycle.\nCalorimetry has a special benefit for thermodynamics. It tells about the heat absorbed or emitted in the isothermal segment of a Carnot cycle.\nA Carnot cycle is a special kind of cyclic process affecting a body composed of material suitable for use in a heat engine. Such a material is of the kind considered in calorimetry, as noted above, that exerts a pressure that is very rapidly determined just by temperature and volume. Such a body is said to change reversibly. A Carnot cycle consists of four successive stages or segments:\n(3) another isothermal change in volume from formula_140 to a volume formula_142 at constant temperature formula_143 such as to incur a flow or heat out of the body and just such as to precisely prepare for the following change\n(4) another adiabatic change of volume from formula_142 back to formula_136 just such as to return the body to its starting temperature formula_138.\nIn isothermal segment (1), the heat that flows into the body is given by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0formula_147\nand in isothermal segment (3) the heat that flows out of the body is given by\nformula_148.\nBecause the segments (2) and (4) are adiabats, no heat flows into or out of the body during them, and consequently the net heat supplied to the body during the cycle is given by\nformula_149.\nThis quantity is used by thermodynamics and is related in a special way to the net work done by the body during the Carnot cycle. The net change of the body's internal energy during the Carnot cycle, formula_150, is equal to zero, because the material of the working body has the special properties noted above.\nSpecial interest of calorimetry in thermodynamics: relations between classical calorimetric quantities.\nRelation of latent heat with respect to volume, and the equation of state.\nThe quantity formula_9, the latent heat with respect to volume, belongs to classical calorimetry. It accounts for the occurrence of energy transfer by work in a process in which heat is also transferred; the quantity, however, was considered before the relation between heat and work transfers was clarified by the invention of thermodynamics. In the light of thermodynamics, the classical calorimetric quantity is revealed as being tightly linked to the calorimetric material's equation of state formula_18. Provided that the temperature formula_153 is measured in the thermodynamic absolute scale, the relation is expressed in the formula\nformula_154.\nDifference of specific heats.\nAdvanced thermodynamics provides the relation\nformula_155.\nFrom this, further mathematical and thermodynamic reasoning leads to another relation between classical calorimetric quantities. The difference of specific heats is given by\nformula_156.\nPractical constant-volume calorimetry (bomb calorimetry) for thermodynamic studies.\nConstant-volume calorimetry is calorimetry performed at a constant volume. This involves the use of a constant-volume calorimeter.\nNo work is performed in constant-volume calorimetry, so the heat measured equals the change in internal energy of the system. The heat capacity at constant volume is assumed to be independent of temperature.\nHeat is measured by the principle of calorimetry.\nformula_157\nwhere\n\u0394\"U\" is change in internal energy,\n\u0394\"T\" is change in temperature and\n\"CV\" is the heat capacity at constant volume.\nIn \"constant-volume calorimetry\" the pressure is not held constant. If there is a pressure difference between initial and final states, the heat measured needs adjustment to provide the \"enthalpy change\". One then has\nformula_158\nwhere\n\u0394\"H\" is change in enthalpy and\n\"V\" is the unchanging volume of the sample chamber.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7525", "revid": "47023628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7525", "title": "Charles Evans Hughes", "text": "Chief Justice of the United States from 1930 to 1941\nCharles Evans Hughes (April 11, 1862 \u2013 August 27, 1948) was an American politician, academic, and jurist who served as the 11th chief justice of the United States from 1930 to 1941. A member of the Republican Party, he previously was the 36th governor of New York (1907\u20131910), an associate justice of the Supreme Court (1910\u20131916), and 44th U.S. secretary of state (1921\u20131925). He was the Republican nominee in the 1916 presidential election, narrowly losing to incumbent president Woodrow Wilson.\nBorn to a Welsh immigrant preacher and his wife in Glens Falls, New York, Hughes graduated from Brown University and Columbia Law School and practiced law in New York City. After working in private practice for several years, in 1905 he led successful state investigations into public utilities and the life insurance industry. He won election as the governor of New York in 1906, and implemented several progressive reforms. In 1910, President William Howard Taft appointed Hughes as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. During his tenure on the Supreme Court, Hughes often joined Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in voting to uphold state and federal regulations.\nHughes served as an associate justice until 1916, when he resigned from the bench to accept the Republican presidential nomination. Though Hughes was widely viewed as the favorite in the race against incumbent Democratic president Woodrow Wilson, Wilson won a narrow victory. After Warren G. Harding won the 1920 presidential election, Hughes accepted Harding's invitation to serve as secretary of state. Serving under Harding and Calvin Coolidge, he negotiated the Washington Naval Treaty, which was designed to prevent a naval arms race among the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. Hughes left office in 1925 and returned to private practice, becoming one of the most prominent attorneys in the country.\nIn 1930, President Herbert Hoover appointed him to succeed Chief Justice Taft. Along with Associate Justice Owen Roberts, Hughes emerged as a key swing vote on the bench, positioned between the liberal Three Musketeers and the conservative Four Horsemen. The Hughes Court struck down several New Deal programs in the early and the mid-1930s; 1937 marked a turning point for the Supreme Court and the New Deal as Hughes and Roberts joined with the Three Musketeers to uphold the Wagner Act and a state minimum wage law. That same year saw the defeat of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have expanded the size of the Supreme Court. Hughes served until 1941, when he retired and was succeeded by Associate Justice Harlan F. Stone.\nEarly life and family.\nHughes's father, David Charles Hughes, immigrated to the United States from Wales in 1855 after he was inspired by \"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\". David became a Baptist preacher in Glens Falls, New York, and married Mary Catherine Connelly, whose family had been in the United States for several generations. Charles Evans Hughes, the only child of David and Mary, was born in Glens Falls on April 11, 1862. The Hughes family moved to Oswego, New York, in 1866, but relocated soon after to Newark, New Jersey, and then to Brooklyn. With the exception of a brief period of attendance at Newark High School, Hughes received no formal education until 1874, instead being educated by his parents. In September 1874, he enrolled in New York City's prestigious Public School 35, graduating the following year.\nAt the age of 14, Hughes entered Madison University (now Colgate University), where he studied for two years. He then transferred to Brown University. He graduated from Brown third in his class at the age of 19, having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year. He was also a member of Delta Upsilon fraternity; he later served as its first international President. While at Brown, Hughes volunteered for the successful 1880 presidential campaign of Republican nominee and fraternity brother James A. Garfield. After graduating from Brown, Hughes spent a year working as a teacher in Delhi, New York. He then enrolled in Columbia Law School, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1884 and ranked first in his class. That same year, he passed the New York bar exam with the highest score ever awarded.\nIn 1888, Hughes married Antoinette Carter, the daughter of the senior partner of the law firm where he worked. Their first child, Charles Evans Hughes Jr., was born the following year, and Hughes purchased a house in Manhattan's Upper West Side neighborhood. Hughes and his wife had one son and three daughters. Their youngest child, Elizabeth Hughes, was one of the first humans injected with insulin, and later served as president of the Supreme Court Historical Society.\nLegal and academic career.\nHughes took a position with the Wall Street law firm of Chamberlain, Carter &amp; Hornblower in 1883, focusing primarily on matters related to contracts and bankruptcies. He was made a partner in the firm in 1888, and the firm changed its name to Carter, Hughes &amp; Cravath (it later became known as Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed). Hughes left the firm and became a professor at Cornell Law School from 1891 to 1893. He returned to Carter, Hughes &amp; Cravath in 1893. He also joined the board of Brown University and served on a special committee that recommended revisions to New York's Code of Civil Procedure.\nExposing corrupt utilities.\nResponding to newspaper stories run by the \"New York World\", Governor Frank W. Higgins appointed a legislative committee to investigate the state's public utilities in 1905. On the recommendation of a former state judge who had been impressed by Hughes's performance in court, the legislative committee appointed Hughes to lead the investigation. Hughes was reluctant to take on the powerful utility companies, but Senator Frederick C. Stevens, the leader of the committee, convinced Hughes to accept the position. Hughes decided to center his investigation on Consolidated Gas, which controlled the production and sale of gas in New York City. Though few expected the committee to have any impact on public corruption, Hughes was able to show that Consolidated Gas had engaged in a pattern of tax evasion and fraudulent bookkeeping. To eliminate or mitigate those abuses, Hughes drafted and convinced the state legislature to pass bills that established a commission to regulate public utilities and lowered gas prices.\nExposing corrupt insurance companies.\nHughes's success made him a popular public figure in New York, and he was appointed counsel to the Armstrong Insurance Commission, which investigated the major life insurance companies headquartered in New York. His examination of the insurance industry uncovered payments made to journalists and lobbyists as well as payments and other forms of compensation directed to legislators serving throughout the country. His investigation also showed that many top insurance executives had various conflicts of interest and had received huge raises at the same time that dividends to policyholders had fallen. Seeking to remove Hughes from the investigation, Republican leaders nominated him as the party's candidate for Mayor of New York City, but Hughes refused the nomination. His efforts ultimately resulted in the resignation or firing of most of the top-ranking officials in the three major life insurance companies in the United States. Following the investigation, Hughes convinced the state legislature to bar insurance companies from owning corporate stock, underwriting securities, or engaging in other banking practices.\nGovernor of New York.\nSeeking a strong candidate to defeat newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst in the 1906 New York gubernatorial election, President Theodore Roosevelt nominated Hughes for governor. Described as a progressive conservative, Roosevelt described Hughes as \"a sane and sincere reformer, who really has fought against the very evils which Hearst denounces,\u00a0... [but is] free from any taint of demagogy.\" In his campaign for governor, Hughes attacked the corruption of specific companies but defended corporations as a necessary part of the economy. He also called for an eight-hour workday on public works projects and favored prohibitions on child labor. Hughes was not a charismatic speaker, but he campaigned vigorously throughout the state and won the endorsements of most newspapers. Ultimately, Hughes defeated Hearst in a close election, taking 52 percent of the vote.\nReforming state government.\nHughes's governorship focused largely on reforming the government and addressing political corruption. He expanded the number of civil service positions, increased the power of the public utility regulatory commissions, and won passage of laws that placed limits on political donations by corporations and required political candidates to track campaign receipts and expenditures. He also signed laws that barred younger workers from several dangerous occupations and established a maximum 48-hour workweek for manufacturing workers under the age of 16. To enforce those laws, Hughes reorganized the New York State Department of Labor. Hughes's labor policies were influenced by economist Richard T. Ely, who sought to improve working conditions for laborers, but rejected the more far-reaching reforms favored by union leaders like Samuel Gompers.\nOrganizing the Baptists.\nThe busy governor found time to get involved in religious matters. A lifelong Northern Baptist, Hughes participated in the creation of the Northern Baptist Convention in May 1907. Hughes served the convention as its first president, beginning the task of unifying the thousands of independent Baptist churches across the North into one denomination. Previously, northern Baptists had only connected between local churches through mission societies and benevolent causes. The Northern Baptist Convention went on to become the historically important American Baptist Churches USA, which made this aspect of Hughes's life during his governorship a key part of his historical influence.\nDisappointing second term as governor.\nHowever, Hughes's political role was changing. He had previously been close with Roosevelt, but relations between Hughes and the president cooled after a dispute over a minor federal appointment. Roosevelt chose not to seek re-election in 1908, instead endorsing Secretary of War William Howard Taft as his preferred successor. Taft won the Republican presidential nomination and asked Hughes to serve as his running mate, but Hughes declined the offer. Hughes also considered retiring from the governorship, but Taft and Roosevelt convinced him to seek a second term. Despite having little support among some of the more conservative leaders of the state party, Hughes won re-election in the 1908 election. Hughes's second term proved to be less successful than his first. His highest priority was a direct primary law, and it repeatedly failed to pass. He did obtain increased regulation over telephone and telegraph companies and won passage of the first workers' compensation bill in U.S. history.\nAccording to historian and journalist Henry F. Pringle, Hughes's sense of civic duty was a poor fit in a party-machine age, leaving \"many faithful Republicans\" with bitter memories of Hughes's \"horrid notions of efficiency in government\" that \"ruthlessly disregarded necessary rewards for party workers.\"\nAssociate Justice.\nBy early 1910, Hughes was anxious to retire from his position as governor. A vacancy on the Supreme Court arose following the death of Associate Justice David J. Brewer, and Taft offered the position to Hughes, who quickly accepted the offer. His nomination was formally received by the Senate on April 25, 1910. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported favorably on his nomination on May 2, 1910, and the Senate unanimously confirmed him the same day. Two months after Hughes's confirmation, but prior to his taking the judicial oath, Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller died. Taft elevated Associate Justice Edward Douglass White to the position of Chief Justice despite having previously indicated to Hughes that he might select Hughes as Chief Justice. White's candidacy for the position was bolstered by his long experience on the bench and popularity among his fellow justices, as well as Theodore Roosevelt's coolness towards Hughes.\nHughes was sworn in to the Supreme Court on October 10, 1910, and quickly struck up friendships with other members of the Court, including Chief Justice White, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan, and Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. In the disposition of cases, however, Hughes tended to align with Holmes. He voted to uphold state laws providing for minimum wages, workmen's compensation, and maximum work hours for women and children. He also wrote several opinions upholding the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. His majority opinion in \"Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad vs. Interstate Commerce Commission\" upheld the right of the federal government to regulate the hours of railroad workers. His majority opinion in the 1914 Shreveport Rate Case upheld the Interstate Commerce Commission's decision to void discriminatory railroad rates imposed by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The decision established that the federal government could regulate intrastate commerce when it affected interstate commerce, though Hughes avoided directly overruling the 1895 case of \"United States v. E. C. Knight Co.\"\nHe also wrote a series of opinions that upheld civil liberties; in one such case, \"McCabe v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co.\", Hughes's majority opinion required railroad carriers to give African-Americans \"equal treatment.\" Hughes's majority opinion in \"Bailey v. Alabama\" invalidated a state law that had made it a crime for a laborer to fail to complete obligations agreed to in a labor contract. Hughes held that this law violated the Thirteenth Amendment and discriminated against African-American workers. He also joined the majority decision in the 1915 case of \"Guinn v. United States\", which outlawed the use of grandfather clauses to determine voter enfranchisement. Hughes and Holmes were the only dissenters from the court's ruling that affirmed a lower court's decision to withhold a writ of habeas corpus from Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager convicted of murder in the state of Georgia.\nPresidential candidate.\nTaft and Roosevelt endured a bitter split during Taft's presidency, and Roosevelt challenged Taft for the 1912 Republican presidential nomination. Taft won re-nomination, but Roosevelt ran on the ticket of a third party, the Progressive Party. With the split in the Republican Party, Democratic Governor Woodrow Wilson defeated Taft and Roosevelt in the 1912 presidential election and enacted his progressive New Freedom agenda. Seeking to bridge the divide in the Republican Party and limit Wilson to a single term, several Republican leaders asked Hughes to consider running in the 1916 presidential election. Hughes at first rebuffed those entreaties, but his potential candidacy became the subject of widespread speculation and polls showed that he was the preferred candidate of many Republican voters.\nBy the time of the June 1916 Republican National Convention, Hughes had won two presidential primaries, and his backers had lined up the support of numerous delegates. Hughes led on the first presidential ballot of the convention and clinched the nomination on the third ballot. Hughes accepted the nomination, becoming the first and only sitting Supreme Court Justice to serve as a major party's presidential nominee, and submitted his resignation to President Wilson. Roosevelt, meanwhile, declined to run again on a third party ticket, leaving Hughes and Wilson as the only major candidates in the race.\nBecause of the Republican Party's dominance in presidential elections held since the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Hughes was widely regarded as the favorite even though Wilson was the incumbent. His candidacy was further boosted by his own reputation for intelligence, personal integrity, and moderation. Hughes also won the public support of both Taft and Roosevelt, though Roosevelt remained uneasy with Hughes, who he feared would be a \"Wilson with whiskers.\" However, the 1912 split in Republican ranks remained a lingering issue, and Hughes damaged his campaign by deciding to base his California campaign with the conservative Republican regulars. Hiram Johnson, the Governor of California who had been Roosevelt's running mate in the 1912 election, endorsed Hughes but the Progressive forces ignored Hughes. Nationally, because of Hughes's opposition to the Adamson Act and the Sixteenth Amendment, most former Progressive Party leaders endorsed Wilson. By election day, Hughes was still generally considered to be the favorite. He performed strongly in the Northeast and early election returns looked good. Nevertheless, Woodrow Wilson, as expected, swept the Solid South while also winning several states in the Midwest and Great Plains, where his candidacy was boosted by a strong antiwar sentiment. Wilson ultimately prevailed after winning the decisive state of California by fewer than 4,000 votes.\nReturn to law practice and political advising.\nAfter the election, Hughes turned down offers from larger organizations and returned to his small law firm, now known as Hughes, Rounds, Schurman &amp; Dwight. In March 1917, Hughes joined with many other Republican leaders in demanding that Wilson declare war on the Central Powers after Germany sank several American merchant ships. The next month, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war, and the United States entered World War I. Hughes supported Wilson's military policies, including the imposition of the draft, and he served as chairman of New York City's draft appeals board. He also investigated the aircraft industry on behalf of the Wilson administration, exposing numerous inefficiencies. He once again returned to private practice after the war, serving a wide array of clients, including five Socialists who had been expelled from the New York legislature for their political beliefs. He sought to broker a compromise between President Wilson and Senate Republicans regarding US entrance into Wilson's proposed League of Nations, but the Senate rejected the League and the Treaty of Versailles.\nWith Wilson's popularity declining, many Republican leaders believed that their party would win the 1920 presidential election. Hughes remained popular in the party, and many influential Republicans favored him as the party's candidate in 1920. Hughes was struck by personal tragedy when his daughter, Helen, died in 1920 of tuberculosis, and he refused to allow his name to be considered for the presidential nomination at the 1920 Republican National Convention. The party instead nominated a ticket consisting of Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio and Governor Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts. The Republican ticket won in a landslide, taking 61 percent of the popular vote.\nSecretary of State.\nShortly after Harding's victory in the 1920 election, Hughes accepted the position of Secretary of State. After the death of Chief Justice White in May 1921, Hughes was mentioned as a potential successor. Hughes told Harding he was uninterested in leaving the State Department, and Harding instead appointed former President Taft as the Chief Justice.\nHarding granted Hughes a great deal of discretion in his leadership of the State Department and US foreign policy. Harding and Hughes frequently communicated, Hughes worked within some broad outlines, and the president remained well-informed. However, the President rarely overrode any of Hughes's decisions, with the big and obvious exception of the League of Nations.\nAfter taking office, President Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations to deciding the US would not join even a scaled-down version. Another view is that Harding favored joining with reservations when he assumed office on March 4, 1921, but senators staunchly opposed (the \"Irreconcilables\"), per Ronald E. Powaski's 1991 book, \"threatened to wreck the new administration.\"\nHughes favored membership in the League. Early in his tenure as Secretary of State, he asked the Senate to vote on the Treaty of Versailles, but he yielded to either Harding's changing views and/or the political reality within the Senate. Instead, he convinced Harding of the necessity of a separate treaty with Germany, resulting in the signing and eventual ratification of the U.S.\u2013German Peace Treaty. Hughes also favored US entrance into the Permanent Court of International Justice but was unable to convince the Senate to provide support.\nWashington Naval Treaty.\nHughes's major initiative in office was preventing an arms race among the three great naval powers of Britain, Japan, and the United States. After Senator William Borah led passage of a resolution calling on the Harding administration to negotiate an arms reduction treaty with Japan and Britain, Hughes convinced those countries as well as Italy and France to attend a naval conference in Washington. Hughes selected an American delegation consisting of himself, former Secretary of State Elihu Root, Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and Democratic Senator Oscar Underwood. Hughes hoped that the selection of Underwood would ensure bipartisan support for any treaty arising from the conference.\nPrior to the conference, Hughes had carefully considered possible treaty terms since each side would seek terms that would provide its respective navy with subtle advantages. He decided to propose an arms reduction formula based on the immediate halting of all naval construction, with future construction limits based on the ship tonnage of each country. The formula would be based on the ship tonnage ratio of 1920, which stood at roughly 5:5:3 for the United States, Britain, and Japan, respectively. Knowing that US and foreign naval leaders would resist his proposal, he anxiously guarded it from the press, but he won the support of Root, Lodge, and Underwood.\nThe Washington Naval Conference opened in November 1921, attended by five national delegations, and in the gallery by hundreds of reporters and dignitaries such as Chief Justice Taft and William Jennings Bryan. On the first day of the conference, Hughes unveiled his proposal to limit naval armaments. Hughes's ambitious proposal to scrap all US capital ships under construction stunned the delegates, as did his proposals for the Japanese and British Navies. The British delegation, led by Arthur Balfour, supported the proposal, but the Japanese delegation, under the leadership of Kat\u014d Tomosabur\u014d, asked for several modifications. Kat\u014d asked for the ratio to be adjusted to 10:10:7 and refused to destroy the \"Mutsu\", a dreadnought that many Japanese saw as a symbol of national pride. Kat\u014d eventually relented on the naval ratios, but Hughes acquiesced to the retention of the \"Mutsu\", leading to protests from British leaders. Hughes clinched an agreement after convincing Balfour to agree to limit the size of the Admiral-class battlecruisers despite objections from the British Navy. Hughes also won agreement on the Four-Power Treaty, which called for a peaceful resolution of territorial claims in the Pacific Ocean, as well as the Nine-Power Treaty, which guaranteed the territorial integrity of China. News of the success of the conference was warmly received around the world. Franklin D. Roosevelt later wrote that the conference \"brought to the world the first important voluntary agreement for limitation and reduction of armament.\"\nOther issues.\nIn the aftermath of World War I, the German economy struggled from the strain of postwar rebuilding and war reparations owed to the Entente, and the Entente powers in turn owed large war debts to the United States. Though many economists favored cancellation of all European war debts, French leaders were unwilling to cancel the reparations, and Congress refused to consider forgiving the war debts. Hughes helped organize the creation of an international committee of economists to study the possibility of lowering Germany's reparations, and Hughes selected Charles G. Dawes to lead that committee. The resulting Dawes Plan, which provided for annual payments by Germany, was accepted at a 1924 conference held in London.\nHughes favored a closer relationship with the United Kingdom, and sought to coordinate US foreign policy with Great Britain concerning matters in Europe and Asia. Hughes sought better relations with the countries of Latin America, and he favored removing US troops when he believed that doing so was practicable. He formulated plans for the withdrawal of US soldiers from the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua but decided that instability in Haiti required the continued presence of US soldiers. He also settled a border dispute between Panama and Costa Rica by threatening to send soldiers into Panama.\nHughes was the keynote speaker at the 1919 National Conference on Lynching.\nReturn to private practice.\nHughes stayed on as Secretary of State in the Coolidge administration after the death of Harding in 1923, but he left office in early 1925. He once again returned to his law firm, becoming one of the highest-earning lawyers in the country. He also served as a special master in a case concerning Chicago's sewage system, was elected president of the American Bar Association, and co-founded the National Conference on Christians and Jews.\nState party leaders asked him to run against Al Smith in New York's 1926 gubernatorial election, and some national party leaders suggested that he run for president in 1928, but Hughes declined to seek public office. After the 1928 Republican National Convention nominated Herbert Hoover, Hughes gave Hoover his full support and campaigned for him across the United States. Hoover won the election in a landslide and asked Hughes to serve as his Secretary of State, but Hughes declined the offer to keep his commitment to serve as a judge on the Permanent Court of International Justice.\nJudge of the Permanent Court of International Justice.\nHughes served on the Permanent Court of International Justice from 1928 until 1930.\nChief Justice.\nRejoining the Supreme Court.\nOn February 3, 1930, President Hoover nominated Hughes to succeed Chief Justice Taft, who was gravely ill. Though many had expected Hoover to elevate his close friend, Associate Justice Harlan Stone, Hughes was the top choice of Taft and Attorney General William D. Mitchell. Though Hughes had compiled a progressive record during his tenure as an Associate Justice, by 1930 Taft believed that Hughes would be a consistent conservative on the court. The nomination faced resistance from progressive Republicans such as senators George W. Norris and William E. Borah, who were concerned that Hughes would be overly friendly to big business after working as a corporate lawyer. Many of those progressives, as well some Southern states' rights advocates, were outraged by the Taft Court's tendency to strike down state and federal legislation on the basis of the doctrine of substantive due process and feared that a Hughes Court would emulate the Taft Court. Adherents of the substantive due process doctrine held that economic regulations such as restrictions on child labor and minimum wages violated freedom of contract, which, they argued, could not be abridged by federal and state laws because of the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee held no hearings, and voted to favorably report on Hughes's nomination by a 10\u20132 vote on February 10, 1930. On February 13, 1930, the Senate voted 31\u201349 against sending his nomination back to committee. After a brief but bitter confirmation battle, Hughes was confirmed by the Senate on February 13, 1930, in a 52\u201326 vote, and he took his judicial oath of office on February 24, 1930. Hughes's son, Charles Jr., was subsequently forced to resign as Solicitor General after his father took office as Chief Justice. Hughes quickly emerged as a leader of the Court, earning the admiration of his fellow justices for his intelligence, energy, and strong understanding of the law. Shortly after Hughes was confirmed, Hoover nominated federal judge John J. Parker to succeed deceased Associate Justice Edward Terry Sanford. The Senate rejected Parker, whose earlier rulings had alienated labor unions and the NAACP, but confirmed Hoover's second nominee, Owen Roberts. In early 1932, the other justices asked Hughes to request the resignation of Oliver Wendell Holmes, whose health had declined as he entered his nineties. Hughes privately asked his old friend to retire, and Holmes immediately sent a letter of resignation to President Hoover. To replace Holmes, Hoover nominated Benjamin N. Cardozo, who quickly won confirmation.\nFor much of its duration, the Hughes Court was divided between the conservative \"Four Horsemen\" and the liberal \"Three Musketeers\". The primary difference between these two blocs was that the Four Horsemen embraced the substantive due process doctrine, but the liberals, including Louis Brandeis, Stone, and Cardozo, advocated for judicial restraint, or deference to legislative bodies. Hughes and Roberts were the swing justices between the two blocs for much of the 1930s, garnering the nickname \"The Roving Justices\".In one of the first major cases of his tenure, Hughes joined with Roberts and the Three Musketeers to strike down a piece of state legislation in the 1931 landmark case of \"Near v. Minnesota\". In his majority opinion, Hughes held that the First Amendment barred states from violating freedom of the press. Hughes also wrote the majority opinion in \"Stromberg v. California\", which represented the first time the Supreme Court struck down a state law on the basis of the incorporation of the Bill of Rights. In another early case, \"O'Gorman &amp; Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co.\", Hughes and Roberts joined with the liberal bloc in upholding a state regulation that limited commissions for the sale of fire insurance.\nRoosevelt takes office.\nDuring Hoover's presidency, the country plunged into the Great Depression. As the country faced an ongoing economic calamity, Franklin D. Roosevelt decisively defeated Hoover in the 1932 presidential election. Responding to the Great Depression, Roosevelt passed a bevy of domestic legislation as part of his New Deal domestic program, and the response to the New Deal became one of the key issues facing the Hughes Court. In the Gold Clause Cases, a series of cases that presented some of the first major tests of New Deal laws, the Hughes Court upheld the voiding of the \"gold clauses\" in private and public contracts that was favored by the Roosevelt administration. Roosevelt, who had expected the Supreme Court to rule adversely to his administration's position, was elated by the outcome, writing that \"as a lawyer it seems to me that the Supreme Court has at last definitely put human values ahead of the 'pound of flesh' called for by a contract.\" The Hughes Court also continued to adjudicate major cases concerning the states. In the 1934 case of \"Home Building &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell\", Hughes and Roberts joined the Three Musketeers in upholding a Minnesota law that established a moratorium on mortgage payments. Hughes's majority opinion in that case stated that \"while an emergency does not create power, an emergency may furnish the occasion for the exercise of power.\"Beginning with the 1935 case of \"Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co.\", Roberts started siding with the Four Horsemen, creating a majority bloc that struck down New Deal laws. The court held that Congress had, in passing an act that provided a mandatory retirement and pension system for railroad industry workers, violated due process and exceeded the regulatory powers granted to it by the Commerce Clause. Hughes strongly criticized Roberts's majority opinion in his dissent, writing that \"the power committed to Congress to govern interstate commerce does not require that its government should be wise, much less that it be perfect. The power implies a broad discretion.\" Nonetheless, in May 1935, the Supreme Court unanimously struck down three New Deal laws. Writing the majority opinion in \"A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States\", Hughes held that Roosevelt's National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 was doubly unconstitutional, falling afoul of both the Commerce Clause and the nondelegation doctrine.\nIn the 1936 case of \"United States v. Butler\", Hughes surprised many observers by joining with Roberts and the Four Horsemen in striking down the Agricultural Adjustment Act. In doing so, the court dismantled the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the major New Deal agricultural program. In another 1936 case, \"Carter v. Carter Coal Co.\", the Supreme Court struck down the Guffey Coal Act, which regulated the bituminous coal industry. Hughes wrote a concurring opinion in \"Carter\" in which he agreed with the majority's holding that Congress could not use its Commerce Clause powers to \"regulate activities and relations within the states which affect interstate commerce only indirectly.\" In the final case of the 1936 term, \"Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo\", Roberts joined with the Four Horsemen in striking down New York's minimum wage law. President Roosevelt had held up the New York minimum wage law as a model for other states to follow, and many Republicans as well as Democrats attacked the decision for interfering with the states. In December 1936, the court handed down its near-unanimous opinion in \"United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.\", upholding a law that granted the president the power to place an arms embargo on Bolivia and Paraguay. Justice Sutherland's majority opinion, which Hughes joined, explained that the Constitution had granted the president broad powers to conduct foreign policy.\nJudicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937.\nRoosevelt won re-election in a landslide in the 1936 presidential election, and congressional Democrats grew their majorities in both houses of Congress. As the Supreme Court had already struck down both the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the president feared that the court would next strike down other key New Deal laws, including the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (also known as the Wagner Act) and the Social Security Act. In early 1937, Roosevelt proposed to increase the number of Supreme Court seats through the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (also known as the \"court-packing plan\"). Roosevelt argued that the bill was necessary because Supreme Court justices were unable to meet their case load. With large Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, Roosevelt's bill had a strong chance of passage in early 1937. However, the bill was poorly received by the public, as many saw the bill as power grab or as an attack on a sacrosanct institution. Hughes worked behind the scenes to defeat the effort, rushing important New Deal legislation through the Supreme Court in an effort to quickly uphold the constitutionality of the laws. He also sent a letter to Senator Burton K. Wheeler, asserting that the Supreme Court was fully capable of handling its case load. Hughes's letter had a powerful impact in discrediting Roosevelt's argument about the practical need for more Supreme Court justices.\nWhile the debate over the court-packing plan continued, the Supreme Court upheld, in a 5\u20134 vote, the state of Washington's minimum wage law in the case of \"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish\". Joined by the Three Musketeers and Roberts, Hughes wrote the majority opinion, which overturned the 1923 case of \"Adkins v. Children's Hospital\". In his majority opinion, Hughes wrote that the \"Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract\", and further held that the Washington legislature \"was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the 'sweating system,' the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living.\" Because Roberts had previously sided with the four conservative justices in \"Tipaldo\", a similar case, it was widely perceived that Roberts agreed to uphold the constitutionality of minimum wage as a result of the pressure that was put on the Supreme Court by the court-packing plan (a theory referred to as \"the switch in time that saved nine\"). However, Hughes and Roberts both later indicated that Roberts had committed to changing his judicial stance on state minimum wage law months before Roosevelt announced his court-packing plan. Roberts had voted to grant \"certiorari\" to hear the \"Parrish\" case even before the 1936 presidential election, and oral arguments for the case had taken place in late 1936. In an initial conference vote held on December 19, 1936, Roberts had voted to uphold the law. Scholars continue to debate why Roberts essentially switched his vote with regards to state minimum wage laws, but Hughes may have played an important role in influencing Roberts to uphold the law.\nWeeks after the court handed down its decision in \"Parrish\", Hughes wrote for the majority again in \"NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp.\" Joined by Roberts and the Three Musketeers, Hughes upheld the constitutionality of the Wagner Act. The Wagner Act case marked a turning point for the Supreme Court, as the court began a pattern of upholding New Deal laws. Later in 1937, the court upheld both the old age benefits and the taxation system established by the Social Security Act. Meanwhile, conservative Associate Justice Willis Van Devanter announced his retirement, undercutting Roosevelt's arguments for the necessity of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937. By the end of the year, the court-packing plan had died in the Senate, and Roosevelt had been dealt a serious political wound that emboldened the conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Republicans. However, throughout 1937, Hughes had presided over a massive shift in jurisprudence that marked the end of the Lochner era, a period during which the Supreme Court had frequently struck down state and federal economic regulations. Hugo Black, Roosevelt's nominee to succeed Van Devanter, was confirmed by the Senate in August 1937. He was joined by Stanley Forman Reed, who succeeded Sutherland, the following year, leaving pro-New Deal liberals with a majority on the Supreme Court.\nLater tenure.\nAfter 1937, the Hughes Court continued to uphold economic regulations, with McReynolds and Butler often being the lone dissenters. The liberal bloc was strengthened even further in 1940, when Butler was succeeded by another Roosevelt appointee, Frank Murphy. In the case of \"United States v. Carolene Products Co.\", Justice Stone's majority opinion articulated a broad theory of deference to economic regulations. \"Carolene Products\" established that the Supreme Court would conduct a \"rational basis review\" of economic regulations, meaning that the Court would only strike down a regulation if legislators lacked a \"rational basis\" for passing the regulation. The Supreme Court showed that it would defer to state legislators in the cases of \"Madden v. Kentucky\" and \"Olsen v. Nebraska\". Hughes joined the majority in another case, \"United States v. Darby Lumber Co.\", which upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\nThe Hughes Court also faced several civil rights cases. Hughes wrote the majority opinion in \"Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada\", which required the state of Missouri to either integrate its law school or establish a separate law school for African-Americans. He joined and helped arrange unanimous support for Black's majority opinion in \"Chambers v. Florida\", which overturned the conviction of a defendant who had been coerced into confessing a crime. In the 1940 case \"Minersville School District v. Gobitis\", Hughes joined the majority decision, which held that public schools could require students to salute the American flag despite the students' religious objections to these practices.\nHughes began to consider retiring in 1940, partly due to the declining health of his wife. In June 1941, he informed Roosevelt of his impending retirement. Hughes suggested that Roosevelt elevate Stone to the position of Chief Justice, a suggestion that Roosevelt accepted. Hughes retired in 1941, and Stone was confirmed as the new Chief Justice, beginning the Stone Court.\nRetirement and death.\nDuring his retirement, Hughes generally refrained from re-entering public life or giving advice on public policy, but he agreed to review the United Nations Charter for Secretary of State Cordell Hull, and recommended that President Harry S. Truman appoint Fred M. Vinson as Chief Justice after the death of Stone. He lived in New York City with his wife, Antoinette, until she died in December 1945. On August 27, 1948, at the age of 86, Hughes died in what is now the Tiffany Cottage of the Wianno Club in Osterville, Massachusetts. When he died, Hughes was the last living Justice to have served on the White Court.\nHe is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.\nLegacy.\nIn the evaluation of historian Dexter Perkins, in domestic politics:\nHughes was a happy mixture of the liberal and the conservative. He was wise enough to know that you cannot preserve a social order unless you eradicate its abuses, and so he was never a stand-patter. On the other side he could see that change carried perils as well as promises. Sometimes he stood out against these perils. He was not always wise, it is true. We do not have to agree with him in everything. But he stands a noble and constructive figure in American life.\nIn the consensus view of scholars, Hughes as a diplomat was:\n an outstanding Secretary of State. He possessed a clear vision of America's position in the new international system. The United States would be a world leader, not only in terms of its ability to provide material progress, but also by its advocacy of diplomacy and arbitration over military force. Hughes was fully committed to the supremacy of negotiation and the maintenance of American foreign policy. This quality was combined with an ability to maintain a clear sense of the larger goals of American diplomacy\u00a0... He was able to maintain control over US foreign policy and take the country into a new role as a world power.\nHughes has been honored in a variety of ways, including in the names of several schools, rooms, and events. Other things named for Hughes include the Hughes Range in Antarctica. The Hughes Room at the Union League Club of New York features a portrait of Hughes as chief justice. On April 11, 1962, the 100th anniversary of Hughes's birth, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative stamp in his honor. The Charles Evans Hughes House, now the Burmese ambassador's residence, in Washington, D.C., was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972.\nJudge Learned Hand once observed that Hughes was the greatest lawyer he had ever known, \"except that his son (Charles Evans Hughes Jr.) was even greater.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7527", "revid": "14650386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7527", "title": "Concept album", "text": "Album that uses its tracks to tell a self-contained story\nA concept album is a musical album whose tracks hold a larger purpose or meaning collectively than they do individually. This is typically achieved through a single central narrative or theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, or lyrical. Alternatively, the term may signify an album that lacks any explicit musical or lyrical motif, but is considered to be of \"uniform excellence\". Music critics remain divided on the precise definition of a concept album.\nThe format originates with folk singer Woody Guthrie's \"Dust Bowl Ballads\" (1940) and was subsequently popularized by traditional pop singer Frank Sinatra's 1940s\u201350s string of albums, though the term is most closely associated with rock music. In the 1960s, various rock bands released several well-regarded concept albums, eventually leading to the birth of the rock opera.\nDefinitions.\nThere is no clear definition of a \"concept album\". Fiona Sturges of \"The Independent\" stated that the concept album \"was originally defined as a long-player where the songs were based on one dramatic idea \u2013 but the term is subjective.\" A precursor to this type of album can be found in the 19th-century song cycle, which ran into similar difficulties in classification. The extremely broad definitions of a \"concept album\" could potentially encompass all soundtracks, compilations, cast recordings, greatest hits albums, tribute albums, Christmas albums, and live albums.\nThe most common definitions refer to an expanded approach to a rock album (as a story, play, or opus), or a project that either revolves around a specific theme or a collection of related materials. AllMusic writes, \"A concept album could be a collection of songs by an individual songwriter or a particular theme \u2013 these are the concept LPs that reigned in the '50s ... the phrase 'concept album' is inextricably tied to the late 1960s, when rock &amp; rollers began stretching the limits of their art form.\"&lt;ref name=\"AllMusic/Concept albums\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Author Jim Cullen describes it as \"a collection of discrete but thematically unified songs whose whole is greater than the sum of its parts ... sometimes [erroneously] assumed to be a product of the rock era.\" Author Roy Shuker defines concept albums and rock operas as albums that are \"unified by a theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, narrative, or lyrical. ... In this form, the album changed from a collection of heterogeneous songs into a narrative work with a single theme, in which individual songs segue into one another.\"\nSpeaking of concepts in albums during the 1970s, Robert Christgau wrote in \"\" (1981), because \"overall impression\" of an album matters, \"concept intensifies the impact\" of certain albums \"in more or less the way \"Sgt. Pepper\" intended\", as well as \"a species of concept that pushes a rhythmically unrelenting album like \"The Wild Magnolias\" or a vocally irresistible one like Shirley Brown's \"Woman to Woman\", to a deeper level of significance.\"\nHistory.\n1940s\u201350s: Origins.\nIn the 2016 BBC documentary \"When Pop Went Epic: The Crazy World of the Concept Album\", it is suggested that the first concept album is Woody Guthrie's 1940 album \"Dust Bowl Ballads\". \"The Independent\" regards it as \"perhaps\" one of the first concept albums, consisting exclusively of semi-autobiographical songs about the hardships of American migrant labourers during the 1930s. In the late 1940s, the LP record was introduced, with space age pop composers producing concept albums soon after. Themes included exploring wild life and dealing with emotions, with some albums meant to be played while dining or relaxing. This was accompanied in the mid-1950s with the invention of the gatefold, which allowed room for liner notes to explain the concept.\nSinger Frank Sinatra recorded several concept albums prior to the 1960s rock era, including \"In the Wee Small Hours\" (1955) and \"Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely\" (1958). Sinatra is occasionally credited as the inventor of the concept album, beginning with \"The Voice of Frank Sinatra\" (1946), which led to similar work by Bing Crosby. According to biographer Will Friedwald, Sinatra \"sequenced the songs so that the lyrics created a flow from track to track, affording an impression of a narrative, as in musical comedy or opera. ... [He was the] first pop singer to bring a consciously artistic attitude to recording.\"\nSinger/pianist Nat \"King\" Cole (who, along with Sinatra, often collaborated with arranger Nelson Riddle during this era) was also an early pioneer of concept albums, as with his \"Wild Is Love\" (1960), a suite of original songs about a man's search for love.\n1960s: Rock and country music.\nIn the early 1960s, concept albums became highly featured in American country music, but the fact went largely unacknowledged by rock/pop fans and critics, who would only begin noting \"concept albums\" as a phenomenon later in the decade, when albums became closely aligned with countercultural ideology, resulting in a recognised \"album era\" and the introduction of the rock concept album. The author Carys Wyn Jones writes that the Beach Boys' \"Pet Sounds\" (1966), the Beatles' \"Revolver\" (1966) and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967), and the Who's \"Tommy\" (1969) are variously cited as \"the first concept album\", usually for their \"uniform excellence rather than some lyrical theme or underlying musical motif\".\nOther records have been claimed as \"early\" or \"first\" concept albums. The Beach Boys' first six albums, released over 1962\u201364, featured collections of songs unified respectively by a central concept, such as cars, surfing, and teenage lifestyles. Writing in \"101 Albums That Changed Popular Music\", Chris Smith commented: \"Though albums such as Frank Sinatra's 1955 \"In the Wee Small Hours\" and Marty Robbins' 1959 \"Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs\" had already introduced concept albums, [the Beach Boys' 1963 album] \"Little Deuce Coupe\" was the first to comprise almost all original material rather than standard covers.\" Music historian Larry Starr, who identifies the Beach Boys' 1964 releases \"Shut Down Volume 2\" and \"All Summer Long\" as heralding the album era, cites \"Pet Sounds\" as the first rock concept album on the basis that it had been \"conceived as an integrated whole, with interrelated songs arranged in a deliberate sequence.\"\n\"The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time\" (2015) states that the Ventures \"pioneered the idea of the rock concept album years before the genre is generally acknowledged to have been born\". Writing in his \"Concise Dictionary of Popular Culture\", Marcel Danesi identifies the Beatles' \"Rubber Soul\" (1965) and the Who's \"The Who Sell Out\" (1967) as other examples of early concept albums. Brian Boyd of \"The Irish Times\" names the Kinks' \"Face to Face\" (1966) as the first concept album: \"Written entirely by Ray Davies, the songs were supposed to be linked by pieces of music, so that the album would play without gaps, but the record company baulked at such radicalism. It's not one of the band's finest works, but it did have an impact.\"\n\"Popular consensus\" for the first rock concept album, according to AllMusic, favours \"Sgt. Pepper\". According to music critic Tim Riley, \"Strictly speaking, the Mothers of Invention's \"Freak Out!\" [1966] has claims as the first 'concept album', but \"Sgt. Pepper\" was the record that made that idea convincing to most ears.\" Musicologist Allan Moore says that \"Even though previous albums had set a unified mood (notably Sinatra's \"Songs for Swingin' Lovers!\"), it was on the basis of the influence of \"Sgt. Pepper\" that the penchant for the concept album was born.\" Adding to \"Sgt. Pepper\"'s claim, the artwork reinforced its central theme by depicting the four Beatles in uniform as members of the Sgt. Pepper band, while the record omitted the gaps that usually separated album tracks. Music critic and journalist Neil Slaven stated that Frank Zappa's \"Absolutely Free\", released the same day as \"Sgt. Pepper\", was \"very much a concept album, but The Beatles effortlessly stole his thunder\", and subsequently \"Sgt. Pepper\" was hailed as \"perhaps the first 'concept album' even though the songs were unrelated.\"\n1960s\u201370s: Rock operas, progressive rock, soul, and disco.\nAuthor Bill Martin relates the assumed concept albums of the 1960s to progressive rock:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In discussions of progressive rock, the idea of the \"concept album\" is mentioned frequently. If this term refers to albums that have thematic unity and development throughout, then in reality there are probably fewer concept albums than one might first think. \"Pet Sounds\" and \"Sergeant Pepper's\" do not qualify according to this criterion ... However, if we instead stretch the definition a bit, to where the album \"is\" the concept, then it is clear that progressive rock is entirely a music of concept albums\u2014and this flows rather directly of \"Rubber Soul\" (December 1965) and then \"Revolver\" (1966), \"Pet Sounds\", and \"Sergeant Pepper's\". ... in the wake of these albums, many rock musicians took up \"the complete album approach.\"\n\"Popmatters\"' Sarah Zupko notes that while the Who's \"Tommy\" is \"popularly thought of as the first rock opera, an extra-long concept album with characters, a consistent storyline, and a slight bit of pomposity\", it is preceded by the shorter concept albums \"Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake\" (Small Faces, 1968) and \"S.F. Sorrow\" (The Pretty Things, 1968). Author Jim Cullen states: \"The concept album reached its apogee in the 1970s in ambitious records like Pink Floyd's \"Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973) and the Eagles' \"Hotel California\" (1976).\" In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Dark Side of the Moon\" at number one among the 50 greatest progressive rock albums of all time, also noting the LP's stature as the second-best-selling album of all time. Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" (1979), a semi-autobiographical story modeled after the band's Roger Waters and former member Syd Barrett, is one of the most famous concept albums by any artist. In addition to \"The Wall\", Danesi highlights Genesis' \"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\" (1974) and Frank Zappa's \"Joe's Garage\" (1979) as other culturally significant concept albums.\nAccording to author Edward Macan, concept albums as a recurrent theme in progressive rock was directly inspired by the counterculture associated with \"the proto-progressive bands of the 1960s\", observing: \"the consistent use of lengthy forms such as the programmatic song cycle of the concept album and the multimovement suite underscores the hippies' new, drug-induced conception of time.\" \nProgressive soul musicians inspired by this approach conceived concept albums during this era reflecting themes and concerns of the African-American experience, including Marvin Gaye (1971's \"What's Going On\"), George Clinton (the 1975 Parliament album \"Mothership Connection\"), and Stevie Wonder's \"Innervisions\" (1973) and \"Songs in the Key of Life\" (1976).\nBy the mid-1970s, concept albums extended to disco music artists. Examples include Phylicia Rashad's 1978 album \"Josephine Superstar\", which details the life of film star and activist Josephine Baker; Parliament's \"Mothership Connection\" (1975) featuring space disco elements such as sci-fi, UFOs, galactic exploration, and spaceflight;\"\" The Undisputed Truth's \"Method to the Madness\" (1976) which is framed by the group's abduction by aliens and performance for \"the Space Gods\"; and Dee D. Jackson's space disco album \"Cosmic Curves\" (1978).\nIn the country realm, Willie Nelson recorded the most prominent concept albums, releasing \"Phases and Stages\" in 1974 and \"Red Headed Stranger\" in 1975. The latter went double platinum in the United States, launching him from being merely a noted songwriter and regional success to worldwide superstardom.\n1980s\u2013present: Decline and return to popularity.\nWith the emergence of MTV as a music video network which valued singles over albums, concept albums became less dominant in the 1980s. Some artists, however, still released concept albums and experienced success in the 1990s and 2000s. \"NME\"'s Emily Barker cites Green Day's \"American Idiot\" (2004) as one of the \"more notable\" examples, having brought the concept album back to high-charting positions. My Chemical Romance\u2019s \"The Black Parade\" (2006) is another example of a modern concept album. Dorian Lynskey, writing for \"GQ\", noted a resurgence of concept albums in the 2010s due to streaming: \"This is happening not in spite of the rise of streaming and playlists, but because of it. Threatened with redundancy in the digital era, albums have fought back by becoming more album-like.\" Cucchiara argues that concept albums should also describe \"this new generation of concept albums, for one key reason. This is because the unison between the songs on a particular album has now been expanded into a broader field of visual and artistic design and marketing strategies that play into the themes and stories that form the album.\" Albums like Twenty One Pilots' \"Blurryface\" (2015) and \"Trench\" (2018) are a very unique example of concept albums from the 2010's. As well as presenting individual themes and stories, they follow eachother in a progressing storyline, as part of a universe that spans over the course of multiple albums including \"Clancy\" (2024) and \"Breach\" (2025), which is the final installation of the story. \nTowards the end of the 80s, however, as heavy metal suited a fairly niche crowd, a few heavy metal artists began producing concept albums, particularly among the more progressive groups. King Diamond's \"Abigail\" and Savatage's \"Hall of the Mountain King\", both released in 1987, stand some of the earliest examples of concept albums produced by a heavy metal artist. A year later, Iron Maiden's, \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\", released in 1988, would become one of the most notable examples of a heavy metal concept album at the time. Around this time, progressive metal began taking form with artists such as Queensr\u00ffche, Fates Warning, and Savatage. Shortly later in 1988, Queensr\u00ffche would release ', which would be considered one of the first progressive metal albums, and was also a concept album. Thus it could be argued that from the genre's inception, progressive metal has been a hotspot for concept albums, like its rock counterpart. Other notable progressive metal concept albums are Dream Theater's ', Opeth's \"Still Life\", and Orphaned Land's \"Mabool\".\nIn the 21st century, the field of classical music has adopted the idea of the concept album, citing such historical examples as Schubert's \"Winterreise\" and Schumann's \"Liederkreis\" as prototypes for contemporary composers and musicians. Classical composers and performers increasingly adopt production and marketing strategies that unify otherwise disparate works into concept albums or concerts. Since 2019, the classical music magazine \"Gramophone\" has included a special category for \"concept album\" in its annual recordings of the year awards, to celebrate \"albums where a creative mind has curated something visionary, a programme whose whole speaks more powerfully than its parts. A thought-through journey, which compels to be heard in one sitting.\"\nIn a year-ending essay on the album in 2019, Ann Powers wrote for \"Slate\" that the year found the medium in a state of flux. In her observation, many recording artists revitalized the concept album around autobiographical narratives and personal themes, such as intimacy, intersectionality, African-American life, boundaries among women, and grief associated with death. She cited such albums as Brittany Howard's \"Jaime\", Raphael Saadiq's \"Jimmy Lee\", Jamila Woods' \"Legacy! Legacy!\", Rapsody's \"Eve\", Jenny Lewis' \"On the Line\", Julia Jacklin's \"Crushing\", Joe Henry's \"The Gospel According to Water\", and Nick Cave's \"Ghosteen\". \"\", a series of concept albums retelling \"The Odyssey\", arose to massive popularity, with its first release in January 2023 surpassing three million streams within its first week of release and the musical remaining popular as subsequent \"saga\" albums were released, the last one being released in December 2024.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7531", "revid": "30109260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7531", "title": "Clavichord", "text": "Musical instrument\nThe clavichord is a stringed rectangular keyboard instrument that was used largely in the Late Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical eras.\nHistorically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances. The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard.\nEtymology.\nThe name is derived from the Latin word \"clavis\", meaning \"key\" (associated with more common \"clavus\", meaning \"nail, rod, etc.\") and \"chorda\" (from Greek \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03ae) meaning \"string, especially of a musical instrument\". An analogous name is used in other European languages (It. \"clavicordio\", \"clavicordo\"; Fr. \"clavicorde\"; Germ. \"Klavichord\"; Lat. \"clavicordium\"; Port. \"clavic\u00f3rdio\"; Sp. \"clavicordio\"). Many languages also have another name derived from Latin \"manus\", meaning \"hand\" (It. \"manicordo\"; Fr. \"manicorde\", \"manicordion\"; Sp. \"manicordio\", \"manucordio\"). Other names refer to the monochord-like nature of a fully fretted clavichord (It. \"monacordo\" or \"monocordo\"; Sp. \"monacordio\"). Italian also used \"sordino\", a reference to its quiet sound (sordino usually designates a mute).\nHistory and use.\nThe clavichord was invented in the early fourteenth century. In 1404, the German poem \"\" mentions the terms \"clavicimbalum\" (a term used mainly for the harpsichord) and \"clavichordium\", designating them as the best instruments to accompany melodies.\nOne of the earliest references to the clavichord in England occurs in the privy-purse expenses of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, in an entry dated August 1502:\nItem. The same day, Hugh Denys for money by him delivered to a stranger that gave the queen a payre of clavycordes. In crowns form his reward iiii libres.\nThe clavichord was very popular from the 16th century to the 18th century, but mainly flourished in German-speaking lands, Scandinavia, and the Iberian Peninsula in the latter part of this period. It had fallen out of use by 1850. In the late 1890s, Arnold Dolmetsch revived clavichord construction and Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, among others, helped to popularize the instrument. Although most of the instruments built before the 1730s were small (four octaves, four feet long), the latest instruments were built up to seven feet long with a six octave range. \nIt was a preferred instrument in the 18th century due to its unique expressive features, size, elegance, and affordability.\nDue to its lower cost compared to other instruments, the clavichord was accessible, making it the first choice for individuals who wanted to learn the keyboard. Composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756\u20131791), used to bring the clavichord with them on their travels to practice.\nDuring the Mozart family's visit to Augsburg, they had the chance to visit the outstanding German keyboard instruments maker, Johann Andreas Stein (1728\u20131792), and purchased a clavichord from him. In a letter to his friend, Leopold Mozart (1719\u20131787) described it as \n\"A pretty little keyboard instrument, which does us good service for practicing on during our travels.\"\nUntil electronic amplification in the twentieth century, it was impossible to use the quiet clavichord in anything but a small room. However, during the clavichord's heyday, evenings of music-making in the home formed the largest part of people's musical experiences. In the home the clavichord was the ideal instrument for solo keyboard music and instrumental accompaniment.Organists also were known to practice in their homes on pedal clavichords.\nToday clavichords are played primarily by Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical music enthusiasts. They attract many interested buyers, and are manufactured worldwide. There are now numerous clavichord societies around the world, and some 400 recordings of the instrument have been made in the past 70 years. Leading modern exponents of the instrument have included Christopher Hogwood and Thurston Dart.\nModern music.\nThe clavichord has also gained attention in other genres of music, in the form of the Clavinet, which is a solid body electric clavichord with magnetic pickups that plug into an amp. Stevie Wonder uses a Clavinet in many of his songs, such as \"Superstition\" and \"Higher Ground\". A Clavinet played through an instrument amplifier with guitar effect pedals is often associated with funky, disco-infused 1970s rock.\nGuy Sigsworth has played clavichord in a modern setting with Bj\u00f6rk, notably on the studio recording of \"All Is Full of Love\". Bj\u00f6rk also made extensive use of and even played the instrument herself on the song \"My Juvenile\" of her 2007 album \"Volta\".\nTori Amos uses the instrument on \"Little Amsterdam\" from the album \"Boys for Pele\" and on the song \"Smokey Joe\" from her 2007 album \"American Doll Posse\". Amos also featured her use of the Clavinet on her 2004 recording \"Not David Bowie\", released as part of her 2006 box set, \"\".\nIn 1976 Oscar Peterson played (with Joe Pass on acoustic guitar) songs from \"Porgy And Bess\" on the clavichord. Keith Jarrett also recorded an album titled \"Book of Ways\" (1986) in which he plays a series of clavichord improvisations. The Beatles' \"For No One\" (1966) features Paul McCartney playing the clavichord. Rick Wakeman plays the Clavinet in the track \"The Battle\" from the album \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\".\nStructure and action.\nIn the clavichord, strings run transversely from the hitchpin rail at the left-hand end to tuning pegs on the right. Towards the right end they pass over a curved wooden bridge. The action is simple, with the keys being levers with a small brass tangent, a small piece of metal similar in shape and size to the head of a flat-bladed screwdriver, at the far end. The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin. When the key is pressed, the tangent strikes the strings above, causing them to sound in a similar fashion to the \"hammering\" technique on a guitar. Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the nut and as the initiator of sound. The volume of the note can be changed by striking harder or softer, and the pitch can also be affected by varying the force of the tangent against the string (known as \"Bebung\"). When the key is released, the tangent loses contact with the string and the vibration of the string is silenced by strips of damping cloth.\nThe action of the clavichord is unique among all keyboard instruments in that one part of the action simultaneously initiates the sound vibration while at the same time defining the endpoint of the vibrating string, and thus its pitch. Because of this intimate contact between the player's hand and the production of sound, the clavichord has been referred to as the most intimate of keyboard instruments. Despite its many (serious) limitations, including extremely low volume, it has considerable expressive power, the player being able to control attack, duration, and volume, and even provide certain subtle effects of swelling of tone and a type of vibrato unique to the clavichord.\nFretting.\nSince the string vibrates from the bridge only as far as the tangent, multiple keys with multiple tangents can be assigned to the same string. This is called \"fretting\". Early clavichords frequently had many notes played on each string, even going so far as the keyed monochord\u2014an instrument with only one string\u2014though most clavichords were triple- or double-fretted. Since only one note can be played at a time on each string, the fretting pattern is generally chosen so that notes rarely heard together (such as C and C\u266f) share a string pair. The advantages of this system compared with unfretted instruments (see below) include relative ease of tuning (with around half as many strings to keep in tune), greater volume (though still not really enough for use in chamber music), and a clearer, more direct sound. Among the disadvantages: temperament could not be re-set without bending the tangents; and playing required a further refinement of touch, since notes sharing a single string played in quick succession had to be slightly separated to avoid a disagreeable deadening of the sound, potentially disturbing a legato line.\nSome clavichords have been built with a single pair of strings for each note. The first known reference to one was by Johann Speth in 1693 and the earliest such extant signed and dated clavichord was built in 1716 by Johann Michael Heinitz. Such instruments are referred to as \"unfretted\" whereas instruments using the same strings for several notes are called \"fretted\". Among the advantages to unfretted instruments are flexibility in tuning (the temperament can be easily altered) and the ability to play any music exactly as written without concern for \"bad\" notes. Disadvantages include a smaller volume, even though many or most unfretted instruments tend to be significantly larger than fretted instruments; and \"many\" more strings to keep in tune. Unfretted instruments tend to have a sweeter, less incisive tone due to the greater load on the bridge resulting from the greater number of strings, though the large, late (early 19th century) Swedish clavichords tend to be the loudest of any of the historic clavichords.\nPedal clavichord.\nWhile clavichords were typically single manual instruments, they could be stacked, one clavichord on top of another, to provide multiple keyboards. With the addition of a pedal clavichord, which included a pedal keyboard for the lower notes, a clavichord could be used to practice organ repertoire. Most often, the addition of a pedal keyboard only involved connecting the keys of the pedalboard to the lower notes on the manual clavichord using string so the lower notes on the manual instrument could be operated by the feet. In the era of pipe organs, which used man-powered bellows that required several people to operate, and of churches only heated during church services if at all, organists used pedal harpsichords and pedal clavichords as practice instruments (see also: pedal piano). There is speculation that some works written for organ may have been intended for pedal clavichord. An interesting case is made by that Bach's \"Eight Little Preludes and Fugues\", now thought spurious, may actually be authentic. The keyboard writing seems unsuited to organ, but Speerstra argues that they are idiomatic on the pedal clavichord. As Speerstra and also note, the compass of the keyboard parts of Bach's six trio sonatas for organ (BWV 525\u2013530) rarely go below the tenor C, so they could have been played on a single manual pedal clavichord, by moving the left hand down an octave, a customary practice in the 18th century.\nRepertoire.\nMuch of the musical repertoire written for harpsichord and organ from the period circa 1400\u20131800 can be played on the clavichord; however, it does not have enough (unamplified) volume to participate in chamber music, with the possible exception of providing accompaniment to a soft baroque flute, recorder, or single singer. J. S. Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach was a great proponent of the instrument, and most of his German contemporaries regarded it as a central keyboard instrument, for performing, teaching, composing and practicing. The fretting of a clavichord provides new problems for some repertoire, but scholarship suggests that these problems are not insurmountable in Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier.\nC. P. E. Bach, one of the leading representatives of the 'Empfindsamer stil' or 'Sensitive Style,' emphasized emotional depth and expressiveness in his compositions. The clavichord was very successful in conveying these characteristics. With its unique sound, touch sensitivity, and ability to convey the most delicate nuances, the clavichord became C. P. E. Bach's most preferred instrument. C. P. E. Bach also used the fortepiano in his compositions, but he was much more interested in the technical features provided by the clavichord. He mentioned this in his book (Versuch \u00fcber die wahre, Art das Clavier zu spielen, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, Berlin, 1759.):\n\"Of the many keyboard instruments, many of which are little known because of defects, or because they have not yet been introduced everywhere, there are two which have been most widely acclaimed, the harpsichord and the clavichord. The former is used mainly in louder music, the latter alone. The more recent pianofortes, when they are durable and well built, have many advantages, although their touch must be carefully worked out, a task which is not without difficulties. They sound well by themselves and in small ensembles. Yet, I hold that a good clavichord, except for its weaker tone, shares equally in the attractiveness of the pianoforte and in addition features the vibrato (Bebung) and portato (Tragen der T\u00f6ne) which I produce by means of added pressure after each stroke. It is at the clavichord that a keyboard player may be most exactly evaluated.\"\nAmong recent clavichord recordings, those by Christopher Hogwood (\"The Secret Bach\", \"The Secret Handel\", and \"The Secret Mozart\"), break new ground. In his liner notes, Hogwood pointed out that these composers would typically have played the clavichord in the privacy of their homes. In England, the composer Herbert Howells (1892\u20131983) wrote two significant collections of pieces for clavichord (\"Lambert's Clavichord\" and \"Howells' Clavichord\"), and Stephen Dodgson (1924\u20132013) wrote two clavichord suites. A comprehensive catalogue of modern clavichord works and discography was published in 2024.\nIn a note written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's wife, Constanze Mozart (1761\u20131842), found inside Mozart's clavichord, it is mentioned that Mozart composed his works, including The Magic Flute, La Clemenza di Tito, The Requiem, and a Masonic Cantata, on this clavichord.\nHaydn composed the greater part of \"The Creation\", one of his masterpieces, on the clavichord. He used the clavichord to accompany the voice.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The direction of the centripetal force is always orthogonal to the motion of the body and towards the fixed point of the instantaneous center of curvature of the path. Isaac Newton coined the term, describing it as \"a force by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or in any way tend, towards a point as to a centre\". In Newtonian mechanics, gravity provides the centripetal force causing astronomical orbits.\nOne common example involving centripetal force is the case in which a body moves with uniform speed along a circular path. The centripetal force is directed at right angles to the motion and also along the radius towards the centre of the circular path. The mathematical description was derived in 1659 by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens.\nFormula.\nFrom the kinematics of curved motion it is known that an object moving at tangential speed \"v\" along a path with radius of curvature \"r\" accelerates toward the center of curvature at a rate \nformula_1\nHere, formula_2 is the centripetal acceleration and formula_3 is the difference between the velocity vectors at formula_4 and formula_5.\nBy Newton's second law, the cause of acceleration is a net force acting on the object, which is proportional to its mass \"m\" and its acceleration. The force, usually referred to as a \"centripetal force\", has a magnitude\nformula_6\nand is, like centripetal acceleration, directed toward the center of curvature of the object's trajectory.\nDerivation.\nThe centripetal acceleration can be inferred from the diagram of the velocity vectors at two instances. In the case of uniform circular motion the velocities have constant magnitude. Because each one is perpendicular to its respective position vector, simple vector subtraction implies two similar isosceles triangles with congruent angles \u2013 one comprising a base of formula_3 and a leg length of formula_8, and the other a base of formula_9 (position vector difference) and a leg length of formula_10:\nformula_11\nformula_12\nTherefore, formula_13 can be substituted with formula_14:\nformula_15\nThe direction of the force is toward the center of the circle in which the object is moving, or the osculating circle (the circle that best fits the local path of the object, if the path is not circular).\nThe speed in the formula is squared, so twice the speed needs four times the force, at a given radius.\nThis force is also sometimes written in terms of the angular velocity \"\u03c9\" of the object about the center of the circle, related to the tangential velocity by the formula\nformula_16\nso that\nformula_17\nExpressed using the orbital period \"T\" for one revolution of the circle,\nformula_18\nthe equation becomes\nformula_19\nIn particle accelerators, velocity can be very high (close to the speed of light in vacuum) so the same rest mass now exerts greater inertia (relativistic mass) thereby requiring greater force for the same centripetal acceleration, so the equation becomes:\nformula_20\nwhere\nformula_21\nis the Lorentz factor.\nThus the centripetal force is given by:\nformula_22\nwhich is the rate of change of relativistic momentum formula_23.\nSources.\nIn the case of an object that is swinging around on the end of a rope in a horizontal plane, the centripetal force on the object is supplied by the tension of the rope. The rope example is an example involving a 'pull' force. The centripetal force can also be supplied as a 'push' force, such as in the case where the normal reaction of a wall supplies the centripetal force for a wall of death or a Rotor rider.\nNewton's idea of a centripetal force corresponds to what is nowadays referred to as a central force. When a satellite is in orbit around a planet, gravity is considered to be a centripetal force even though in the case of eccentric orbits, the gravitational force is directed towards the focus, and not towards the instantaneous center of curvature.\nAnother example of centripetal force arises in the helix that is traced out when a charged particle moves in a uniform magnetic field in the absence of other external forces. In this case, the magnetic force is the centripetal force that acts towards the helix axis.\nAnalysis of several cases.\nBelow are three examples of increasing complexity, with derivations of the formulas governing velocity and acceleration.\nUniform circular motion.\nUniform circular motion refers to the case of constant rate of rotation. Here are two approaches to describing this case.\nCalculus derivation.\nIn two dimensions, the position vector formula_24, which has magnitude (length) formula_10 and directed at an angle formula_26 above the x-axis, can be expressed in Cartesian coordinates using the unit vectors formula_27 and formula_28:\nformula_29\nThe assumption of uniform circular motion requires three things:\nThe velocity formula_34 and acceleration formula_35 of the motion are the first and second derivatives of position with respect to time:\nformula_36\nformula_37\nformula_38\nThe term in parentheses is the original expression of formula_24 in Cartesian coordinates. Consequently,\nformula_40\nThe negative sign shows that the acceleration is pointed towards the center of the circle (opposite the radius), hence it is called \"centripetal\" (i.e. \"center-seeking\"). While objects naturally follow a straight path (due to inertia), this centripetal acceleration describes the circular motion path caused by a centripetal force.\nDerivation using vectors.\nThe image at right shows the vector relationships for uniform circular motion. The rotation itself is represented by the angular velocity vector \u03a9, which is normal to the plane of the orbit (using the right-hand rule) and has magnitude given by:\n formula_41\nwith \"\u03b8\" the angular position at time \"t\". In this subsection, d\"\u03b8\"/d\"t\" is assumed constant, independent of time. The distance traveled d\u2113 of the particle in time d\"t\" along the circular path is\n formula_42\nwhich, by properties of the vector cross product, has magnitude \"r\"d\"\u03b8\" and is in the direction tangent to the circular path.\nConsequently,\n formula_43\nDifferentiating with respect to time,\nformula_44\nLagrange's formula states:\nformula_45\nApplying Lagrange's formula with the observation that \u03a9 \u2022 r(\"t\") = 0 at all times,\nformula_46\nIn words, the acceleration is pointing directly opposite to the radial displacement r at all times, and has a magnitude:\nformula_47\nwhere vertical bars |...| denote the vector magnitude, which in the case of r(\"t\") is simply the radius \"r\" of the path. This result agrees with the previous section, though the notation is slightly different.\nWhen the rate of rotation is made constant in the analysis of nonuniform circular motion, that analysis agrees with this one.\nA merit of the vector approach is that it is manifestly independent of any coordinate system.\nExample: The banked turn.\nThe upper panel in the image at right shows a ball in circular motion on a banked curve. The curve is banked at an angle \"\u03b8\" from the horizontal, and the surface of the road is considered to be slippery. The objective is to find what angle the bank must have so the ball does not slide off the road. Intuition tells us that, on a flat curve with no banking at all, the ball will simply slide off the road; while with a very steep banking, the ball will slide to the center unless it travels the curve rapidly.\nApart from any acceleration that might occur in the direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are \"two\" forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball \"mg, where \"m\" is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward normal force exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface \"man. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the net force on the ball resulting from vector addition of the normal force and the force of gravity. The resultant or net force on the ball found by vector addition of the normal force exerted by the road and vertical force due to gravity must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.\nThe horizontal net force on the ball is the horizontal component of the force from the road, which has magnitude |Fh| = \"m\"|an| sin \"\u03b8\". The vertical component of the force from the road must counteract the gravitational force: |Fv| = \"m\"|an| cos \"\u03b8\" = \"m\"|g|, which implies |an| = |g| / cos \"\u03b8\". Substituting into the above formula for |Fh| yields a horizontal force to be:\nformula_48\nOn the other hand, at velocity |v| on a circular path of radius \"r\", kinematics says that the force needed to turn the ball continuously into the turn is the radially inward centripetal force Fc of magnitude:\nformula_49\nConsequently, the ball is in a stable path when the angle of the road is set to satisfy the condition:\nformula_50\nor,\nformula_51\nAs the angle of bank \"\u03b8\" approaches 90\u00b0, the tangent function approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |v|2/\"r\". In words, this equation states that for greater speeds (bigger |v|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for \"\u03b8\"), and for sharper turns (smaller \"r\") the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle \"\u03b8\" does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If friction cannot do this (that is, the coefficient of friction is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.\nThese ideas apply to air flight as well. See the FAA pilot's manual.\nNonuniform circular motion.\nAs a generalization of the uniform circular motion case, suppose the angular rate of rotation is not constant. The acceleration now has a tangential component, as shown the image at right. This case is used to demonstrate a derivation strategy based on a polar coordinate system.\nLet r(\"t\") be a vector that describes the position of a point mass as a function of time. Since we are assuming circular motion, let r(\"t\") = \"R\"\u00b7u\"r\", where \"R\" is a constant (the radius of the circle) and ur is the unit vector pointing from the origin to the point mass. The direction of u\"r\" is described by \"\u03b8\", the angle between the x-axis and the unit vector, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis. The other unit vector for polar coordinates, u\u03b8 is perpendicular to u\"r\" and points in the direction of increasing \"\u03b8\". These polar unit vectors can be expressed in terms of Cartesian unit vectors in the \"x\" and \"y\" directions, denoted formula_52 and formula_53 respectively:\nformula_54 and formula_55\nOne can differentiate to find velocity:\nformula_56\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular velocity \"d\u03b8\"/\"dt\".\nThis result for the velocity matches expectations that the velocity should be directed tangentially to the circle, and that the magnitude of the velocity should be \"r\u03c9\". Differentiating again, and noting that\nformula_57\nwe find that the acceleration, a is:\nformula_58\nThus, the radial and tangential components of the acceleration are:\nformula_59 and formula_60\nwhere |v| = \"r\" \"\u03c9\" is the magnitude of the velocity (the speed).\nThese equations express mathematically that, in the case of an object that moves along a circular path with a changing speed, the acceleration of the body may be decomposed into a perpendicular component that changes the direction of motion (the centripetal acceleration), and a parallel, or tangential component, that changes the speed.\nGeneral planar motion.\nPolar coordinates.\nThe above results can be derived perhaps more simply in polar coordinates, and at the same time extended to general motion within a plane, as shown next. Polar coordinates in the plane employ a radial unit vector u\u03c1 and an angular unit vector u\u03b8, as shown above. A particle at position r is described by:\nformula_61\nwhere the notation \"\u03c1\" is used to describe the distance of the path from the origin instead of \"R\" to emphasize that this distance is not fixed, but varies with time. The unit vector u\u03c1 travels with the particle and always points in the same direction as r(\"t\"). Unit vector u\u03b8 also travels with the particle and stays orthogonal to u\u03c1. Thus, u\u03c1 and u\u03b8 form a local Cartesian coordinate system attached to the particle, and tied to the path travelled by the particle. By moving the unit vectors so their tails coincide, as seen in the circle at the left of the image above, it is seen that u\u03c1 and u\u03b8 form a right-angled pair with tips on the unit circle that trace back and forth on the perimeter of this circle with the same angle \"\u03b8\"(\"t\") as r(\"t\").\nWhen the particle moves, its velocity is\n formula_62\nTo evaluate the velocity, the derivative of the unit vector u\u03c1 is needed. Because u\u03c1 is a unit vector, its magnitude is fixed, and it can change only in direction, that is, its change du\u03c1 has a component only perpendicular to u\u03c1. When the trajectory r(\"t\") rotates an amount d\"\u03b8\", u\u03c1, which points in the same direction as r(\"t\"), also rotates by d\"\u03b8\". See image above. Therefore, the change in u\u03c1 is\n formula_63\nor\n formula_64\nIn a similar fashion, the rate of change of u\u03b8 is found. As with u\u03c1, u\u03b8 is a unit vector and can only rotate without changing size. To remain orthogonal to u\u03c1 while the trajectory r(\"t\") rotates an amount d\"\u03b8\", u\u03b8, which is orthogonal to r(\"t\"), also rotates by d\"\u03b8\". See image above. Therefore, the change du\u03b8 is orthogonal to u\u03b8 and proportional to d\"\u03b8\" (see image above):\n formula_65\nThe equation above shows the sign to be negative: to maintain orthogonality, if du\u03c1 is positive with d\"\u03b8\", then du\u03b8 must decrease.\nSubstituting the derivative of u\u03c1 into the expression for velocity:\n formula_66\nTo obtain the acceleration, another time differentiation is done:\n formula_67\nSubstituting the derivatives of u\u03c1 and u\u03b8, the acceleration of the particle is:\n formula_68\nAs a particular example, if the particle moves in a circle of constant radius \"R\", then d\"\u03c1\"/d\"t\" = 0, v = v\u03b8, and:\nformula_69\nwhere formula_70\nThese results agree with those above for nonuniform circular motion. See also the article on non-uniform circular motion. If this acceleration is multiplied by the particle mass, the leading term is the centripetal force and the negative of the second term related to angular acceleration is sometimes called the Euler force.\nFor trajectories other than circular motion, for example, the more general trajectory envisioned in the image above, the instantaneous center of rotation and radius of curvature of the trajectory are related only indirectly to the coordinate system defined by u\u03c1 and u\u03b8 and to the length |r(\"t\")| = \"\u03c1\". Consequently, in the general case, it is not straightforward to disentangle the centripetal and Euler terms from the above general acceleration equation. To deal directly with this issue, local coordinates are preferable, as discussed next.\nLocal coordinates.\nLocal coordinates mean a set of coordinates that travel with the particle, and have orientation determined by the path of the particle. Unit vectors are formed as shown in the image at right, both tangential and normal to the path. This coordinate system sometimes is referred to as \"intrinsic\" or \"path coordinates\" or \"nt-coordinates\", for \"normal-tangential\", referring to these unit vectors. These coordinates are a very special example of a more general concept of local coordinates from the theory of differential forms.\nDistance along the path of the particle is the arc length \"s\", considered to be a known function of time.\n formula_71\nA center of curvature is defined at each position \"s\" located a distance \"\u03c1\" (the radius of curvature) from the curve on a line along the normal un (\"s\"). The required distance \"\u03c1\"(\"s\") at arc length \"s\" is defined in terms of the rate of rotation of the tangent to the curve, which in turn is determined by the path itself. If the orientation of the tangent relative to some starting position is \"\u03b8\"(\"s\"), then \"\u03c1\"(\"s\") is defined by the derivative d\"\u03b8\"/d\"s\":\n formula_72\nThe radius of curvature usually is taken as positive (that is, as an absolute value), while the \"curvature\" \"\u03ba\" is a signed quantity.\nA geometric approach to finding the center of curvature and the radius of curvature uses a limiting process leading to the osculating circle. See image above.\nUsing these coordinates, the motion along the path is viewed as a succession of circular paths of ever-changing center, and at each position \"s\" constitutes non-uniform circular motion at that position with radius \"\u03c1\". The local value of the angular rate of rotation then is given by:\n formula_73\nwith the local speed \"v\" given by:\n formula_74\nAs for the other examples above, because unit vectors cannot change magnitude, their rate of change is always perpendicular to their direction (see the left-hand insert in the image above):\n formula_75 formula_76\nConsequently, the velocity and acceleration are:\n formula_77\nand using the chain-rule of differentiation:\n formula_78 with the tangential acceleration formula_79\nIn this local coordinate system, the acceleration resembles the expression for nonuniform circular motion with the local radius \"\u03c1\"(\"s\"), and the centripetal acceleration is identified as the second term.\nExtending this approach to three dimensional space curves leads to the Frenet\u2013Serret formulas.\nAlternative approach.\nLooking at the image above, one might wonder whether adequate account has been taken of the difference in curvature between \"\u03c1\"(\"s\") and \"\u03c1\"(\"s\" + d\"s\") in computing the arc length as d\"s\" = \"\u03c1\"(\"s\")d\"\u03b8\". Reassurance on this point can be found using a more formal approach outlined below. This approach also makes connection with the article on curvature.\nTo introduce the unit vectors of the local coordinate system, one approach is to begin in Cartesian coordinates and describe the local coordinates in terms of these Cartesian coordinates. In terms of arc length \"s\", let the path be described as:\nformula_80\nThen an incremental displacement along the path d\"s\" is described by:\nformula_81\nwhere primes are introduced to denote derivatives with respect to \"s\". The magnitude of this displacement is d\"s\", showing that:\n formula_82 (Eq. 1)\nThis displacement is necessarily a tangent to the curve at \"s\", showing that the unit vector tangent to the curve is:\nformula_83\nwhile the outward unit vector normal to the curve is\nformula_84\nOrthogonality can be verified by showing that the vector dot product is zero. The unit magnitude of these vectors is a consequence of Eq. 1. Using the tangent vector, the angle \"\u03b8\" of the tangent to the curve is given by:\nformula_85 and formula_86\nThe radius of curvature is introduced completely formally (without need for geometric interpretation) as:\nformula_87\nThe derivative of \"\u03b8\" can be found from that for sin\"\u03b8\":\nformula_88\nNow:\nformula_89\nin which the denominator is unity. With this formula for the derivative of the sine, the radius of curvature becomes:\nformula_90\nwhere the equivalence of the forms stems from differentiation of Eq. 1:\nformula_91\nWith these results, the acceleration can be found:\nformula_92\nas can be verified by taking the dot product with the unit vectors ut(\"s\") and un(\"s\"). This result for acceleration is the same as that for circular motion based on the radius \"\u03c1\". Using this coordinate system in the inertial frame, it is easy to identify the force normal to the trajectory as the centripetal force and that parallel to the trajectory as the tangential force. From a qualitative standpoint, the path can be approximated by an arc of a circle for a limited time, and for the limited time a particular radius of curvature applies, the centrifugal and Euler forces can be analyzed on the basis of circular motion with that radius.\nThis result for acceleration agrees with that found earlier. However, in this approach, the question of the change in radius of curvature with \"s\" is handled completely formally, consistent with a geometric interpretation, but not relying upon it, thereby avoiding any questions the image above might suggest about neglecting the variation in \"\u03c1\".\nExample: circular motion.\nTo illustrate the above formulas, let \"x\", \"y\" be given as:\n formula_93\nThen:\n formula_94\nwhich can be recognized as a circular path around the origin with radius \"\u03b1\". The position \"s\" = 0 corresponds to [\"\u03b1\", 0], or 3 o'clock. To use the above formalism, the derivatives are needed:\n formula_95\n formula_96\nWith these results, one can verify that:\n formula_97\nThe unit vectors can also be found:\n formula_98\nwhich serve to show that \"s\" = 0 is located at position [\"\u03c1\", 0] and \"s\" = \"\u03c1\"\u03c0/2 at [0, \"\u03c1\"], which agrees with the original expressions for \"x\" and \"y\". In other words, \"s\" is measured counterclockwise around the circle from 3 o'clock. Also, the derivatives of these vectors can be found:\n formula_99\n formula_100\nTo obtain velocity and acceleration, a time-dependence for \"s\" is necessary. For counterclockwise motion at variable speed \"v\"(\"t\"):\n formula_101\nwhere \"v\"(\"t\") is the speed and \"t\" is time, and \"s\"(\"t\" = 0) = 0. Then:\n formula_102\n formula_103\n formula_104\nwhere it already is established that \u03b1 = \u03c1. This acceleration is the standard result for non-uniform circular motion.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7538", "revid": "50675176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7538", "title": "Checksum", "text": "Data used to detect errors in other data\nA checksum is a small-sized block of data derived from another block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage. By themselves, checksums are often used to verify data integrity but are not relied upon to verify data authenticity.\nThe procedure which generates this checksum is called a checksum function or checksum algorithm. Depending on its design goals, a good checksum algorithm usually outputs a significantly different value, even for small changes made to the input. This is especially true of cryptographic hash functions, which may be used to detect many data corruption errors and verify overall data integrity; if the computed checksum for the current data input matches the stored value of a previously computed checksum, there is a very high probability the data has not been accidentally altered or corrupted.\nChecksum functions are related to hash functions, fingerprints, randomization functions, and cryptographic hash functions. However, each of those concepts has different applications and therefore different design goals. For instance, a function returning the start of a string can provide a hash appropriate for some applications but will never be a suitable checksum. Checksums are used as cryptographic primitives in larger authentication algorithms. For cryptographic systems with these two specific design goals, see HMAC.\nCheck digits and parity bits are special cases of checksums, appropriate for small blocks of data (such as Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, computer words, single bytes, etc.). Some error-correcting codes are based on special checksums which not only detect common errors but also allow the original data to be recovered in certain cases.\nAlgorithms.\nParity byte or parity word.\nThe simplest checksum algorithm is the so-called longitudinal parity check, which breaks the data into \"words\" with a fixed number \"n\" of bits, and then computes the bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of all those words. The result is appended to the message as an extra word. In simpler terms, for \"n\"=1 this means adding a bit to the end of the data bits to guarantee that there is an even number of '1's. To check the integrity of a message, the receiver computes the bitwise exclusive or of all its words, including the checksum; if the result is not a word consisting of \"n\" zeros, the receiver knows a transmission error occurred.\nWith this checksum, any transmission error which flips a single bit of the message, or an odd number of bits, will be detected as an incorrect checksum. However, an error that affects two bits will not be detected if those bits lie at the same position in two distinct words. Also swapping of two or more words will not be detected. If the affected bits are independently chosen at random, the probability of a two-bit error being undetected is 1/\"n\".\nSum complement.\nA variant of the previous algorithm is to add all the \"words\" as unsigned binary numbers, discarding any overflow bits, and append the two's complement of the total as the checksum. To validate a message, the receiver adds all the words in the same manner, including the checksum; if the result is not a word full of zeros, an error must have occurred. This variant, too, detects any single-bit error, but the pro modular sum is used in SAE J1708.\nPosition-dependent.\nThe simple checksums described above fail to detect some common errors which affect many bits at once, such as changing the order of data words, or inserting or deleting words with all bits set to zero. The checksum algorithms most used in practice, such as Fletcher's checksum, Adler-32, and cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs), address these weaknesses by considering not only the value of each word but also its position in the sequence. This feature generally increases the cost of computing the checksum.\nFuzzy checksum.\nThe idea of fuzzy checksum was developed for detection of email spam by building up cooperative databases from multiple ISPs of email suspected to be spam. The content of such spam may often vary in its details, which would render normal checksumming ineffective. By contrast, a \"fuzzy checksum\" reduces the body text to its characteristic minimum, then generates a checksum in the usual manner. This greatly increases the chances of slightly different spam emails producing the same checksum. The ISP spam detection software, such as SpamAssassin, of co-operating ISPs, submits checksums of all emails to the centralised service such as DCC. If the count of a submitted fuzzy checksum exceeds a certain threshold, the database notes that this probably indicates spam. ISP service users similarly generate a fuzzy checksum on each of their emails and request the service for a spam likelihood.\nGeneral considerations.\nA message that is \"m\" bits long can be viewed as a corner of the \"m\"-dimensional hypercube. The effect of a checksum algorithm that yields an \"n\"-bit checksum is to map each \"m\"-bit message to a corner of a larger hypercube, with dimension \"m\" + \"n\". The 2\"m\" + \"n\" corners of this hypercube represent all possible received messages. The valid received messages (those that have the correct checksum) comprise a smaller set, with only 2\"m\" corners.\nA single-bit transmission error then corresponds to a displacement from a valid corner (the correct message and checksum) to one of the \"m\" adjacent corners. An error which affects \"k\" bits moves the message to a corner which is \"k\" steps removed from its correct corner. The goal of a good checksum algorithm is to spread the valid corners as far from each other as possible, to increase the likelihood \"typical\" transmission errors will end up in an invalid corner.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGeneral topic\nError correction\nHash functions\nFile systems\nRelated concepts\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7541", "revid": "19376353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7541", "title": "City University of New York", "text": "Public university system in New York City, New York, United States\nThe City University of New York (CUNY, pronounced , ) is the public university system of New York City, United States. It is the largest urban university system in the United States, comprising 26 campuses: eleven senior colleges, seven community colleges, and eight professional institutions. The university enrolls more than 275,000 students. CUNY alumni include thirteen Nobel Prize winners and twenty-four MacArthur Fellows.\nThe oldest constituent college of CUNY, City College of New York, was originally founded in 1847 and became the first free public institution of higher learning in the United States. In 1960, John R. Everett became the first chancellor of the Municipal College System of New York City, later known as the City University of New York (CUNY). CUNY, established by New York state legislation in 1961 and signed into law by Governor Nelson Rockefeller, was an amalgamation of existing institutions and a new graduate school.\nThe system was governed by the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, created in 1926, and later renamed the Board of Trustees of CUNY in 1979. The institutions merged into CUNY included the Free Academy (later City College of New York), the Female Normal and High School (later Hunter College), Brooklyn College, and Queens College. CUNY has historically provided accessible education, especially to those excluded or unable to afford private universities. The first community college in New York City was established in 1955 with shared funding between the state and the city, but unlike the senior colleges, community college students had to pay tuition.\nThe integration of CUNY's colleges into a single university system took place in 1961, under a chancellor and with state funding. The Graduate Center, serving as the principal doctorate-granting institution, was also established that year. In 1964, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. extended the senior colleges' free tuition policy to community colleges. The 1960s saw student protests demanding more racial diversity and academic representation in CUNY, leading to the establishment of Medgar Evers College and the implementation of the Open Admissions policy in 1970. This policy dramatically increased student diversity but also introduced challenges like low retention rates. The 1976 fiscal crisis ended the free tuition policy, leading to the introduction of tuition fees for all CUNY colleges.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nSocial context.\nHistorians Willis Rudy and Harry Noble Wright identify \"the growing democratization of American life,\" rapid urban development and increased immigration as the socio-cultural trends leading to the founding of the Free Academy. They note that \"the birth of the Free Academy in the metropolis of the New World came at the very time that European revolutionists were struggling for freedom and democracy in the Old.\" In the mid-19th century, free elementary and high schools sprouted up all across the country in an educational renaissance borne of organized labor, the expansion of suffrage, and industrialization. New York City, a booming metropolis and predominant seaport in the Western hemisphere, was uniquely situated to forge ambitious educational initiatives. The first free denominational schools were established on Manhattan Island in 1633; a system of secular schools was established in 1805. From 1825 to 1860, New York City's population rose from 166,000 residents to 814,000, making it the third largest city in the Western world. A number of newcomers were mercantilists from New England drawn to the advantages of New York's harbor, while \"in the decades prior to the Civil War the farms of Ireland and the villages of Germany were the chief sources of New York's newcomers.\" The shifting demographics of the city spurred new debates over the creation of public higher education.\nDebates on the Free Academy.\nOn March 15, 1847, Townsend Harris, then president of the city's Board of Education, published a letter in \"The Morning Courier\" and \"New York Enquirer\" that proposed a free public school where the children of the poor would have the possibility of advancement:No, Sirs, the system now pursued by that excellent society and by our ward schools is the true one, and may be advantageously applied to higher seminaries of learning. Make them the property of the people - open the doors to all - let the children of the rich and the poor take their seats together and know of no distinction save that of industry, good conduct, and intellect. A large number of the children of the rich now attend our public schools, and the ratio is rapidly increasing.\nThis establishment of the Free Academy hailed \"first municipal institution for free higher education to appear on this globe.\" This was not without debate, discussed in the newspapers of the day. Two of Harris's supporters, James Gordon Bennett of the New York Herald, and William Cullen Bryant of the Evening Post, supported the idea in their editorial pages. Horace Greeley, founder and editor of the publication the New-York Tribune and later a member of the Board of Education opposed the use of public funds for the school, although he supported its overall mission. Well into its existence, Greeley would continue to call for the closing of the Free Academy and that it \"should be sloughed off in the interests of retrenchment.\" The argument made by Harris and his supporters in response was that money drawn from what was called The Literature Fund, a state budget for public education, \"ought to be apportioned on the principle of the greatest good to [the] greatest number.\" They believed this would be best accomplished by the Free Academy. \nThe Free Academy received its charter from the New York State Legislature on May 7, 1847. Construction of The Free Academy began in November 1847. Harris was succeeded as President of the Board of Education by Robert Kelley in 1848. Dr. Horace Webster, a graduate of the United States Military Academy and professor of mathematics was chosen by Kelly and his committee as the school's first principal. At the formal opening on January 21, 1849, Webster outlined the intention of the academy:The experiment is to be tried, whether the children of the people, the children of the whole people, can be educated; and whether an institution of the highest grade, can be successfully controlled by the popular will, not by the privileged few.The Free Academy was renamed the College of the City of New York in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, at the behest of students who felt that the name \"Academy\" did not carry the same prestige in the real world as the word \"College.\" There was an acceleration of campus activity in the years following the war, especially in the realm of student organizing and government. Richard Rodgers Bowker published the first issue of \"The City College Collegian\" in November 1866. The paper only ran for one year, but in that time played an instrumental role in calling for the formation of the first student-led academic senate in the nation. \nFounding of Hunter College.\nThe next school to be established was the Normal College, later Hunter College. Normal schools, or institutions for teacher education, were first established in New York in 1834, with schools for white men, white women, and women of color. There were inequities; the women's schools were only open on Saturdays and there was a lack of attention to teaching skills with the female curriculum limited to mathematics. The first state normal school for teacher instruction was established in Albany, New York on May 7, 1844, now the University of Albany. This was followed by the establishment of a number of other normal schools. In 1851, the state legislature sought to \"amend, consolidate, and reduce to one act, the various acts relative to the Common Schools of the city of New York,\" and formalized a board of education for the city with the mission of continuing to \"furnish through the free academy, the benefit of education, gratuitously, to persons who have been pupils in the common schools of the said city and county, for a period of time to be regulated by the board of education not less than one year.\" This included a mandate for the formation of new schools, including evening schools. The call for the establishment of a normal school for women in New York City was reiterated in 1854, and once more tied directly to the founding of the Free Academy just five years prior. In 1854 the state legislature amended the act of 1851 to grant the Board of Education power\nto continue the existing Free Academy, and organize a similar institution for females, and if any similar institution is organized by the board of education, all the provisions of this act, relative to the Free Academy, shall apply to each and every one of the said institutions, as fully, completely, and distinctly as they could or would if it was the only institution of the kind. In 1868 the Board of Education once more called for the establishment of a female institution of higher education, and on November 13, 1869, the Committee on Normal, Evening and Colored Schools adopted a resolution establishing a daily Female Normal and High School. The Female Normal and High School was opened on February 14, 1870, on the third floor of a building at the southeast corner of Broadway and Fourth Street. The school was established by Irish schoolmaster and exiled republican Thomas Hunter as a normal school, who \"insisted on admitting students of all racial and ethnic backgrounds and teaching a combined curriculum of liberal arts, science, and education.\" The school's name was soon changed to Normal College and in September 1873 it moved into a Gothic revivalist building designed by Hunter himself, between 68th and 69th Street on Park Avenue. A broad curriculum encompassing both the humanities and the sciences was implemented, and in the following decades the school expanded its focus on teacher education, to include more academic departments and disciplines/fields.\n20th century.\nThe College of the City of New York and the Normal College.\nIn 1903, John Huston Finley became President of City College, succeeding Alexander Stewart Webb. In 1906, President of the Normal College Thomas Hunter retired, and the first stirrings of the merger of the colleges began. A highly debated coeducational proposal suggested a merger of the Normal College with the College of the City of New York. The Normal College opposed this measure. President Finley resigned from City College to pursue the position of commissioner of education for New York State; he later served as an associate editor of \"The New York Times\". Finley was succeeded as City College President by American philosopher Sidney E. Mezes of the University of Texas. Prior to his departure from the college, former President Finley collaborated with philanthropist Adolph Lewisohn and architect Arnold Brunner to construct an outdoor amphitheater for City College student use. Situated on New York City Parks Department land between Convent and Amsterdam Avenues, the reinforced concrete stadium held its inaugural event on May 29, 1915, showing a performance of the play, \"The Trojan Women\". For the next five decades, the field at Lewisohn Stadium hosted college events such as baseball, track, football, and ROTC exercises. Additionally, Lewisohn Stadium hosted a longstanding summer concert series produced by Stadium Concerts Inc., under the direction of Minnie Guggenheimer. \nIn 1908, George Samler Davis became the official second president of the Normal College; under his administration the college curriculum was liberalized to include electives, following the model Harvard was then introducing. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company was also persuaded by President Davis to complete the first section of the Lexington Avenue station at 68th Street, making the Normal College more accessible for students commuting from distant parts of the city. Late in his career, he also laid the groundwork for a new site in the Bronx. Under the leadership of George Samler Davis, the Normal College would be renamed Hunter College to honor its founder. It also served to clarify the nature of its mission; formerly, its name implied that it was a technical or professional school, but as early as 1888 it had granted degrees and diplomas in the arts. The school was constantly expanding, and the increased number of students and issues of overcrowding led to the creation of a Board of Trustees in 1915, a major act in the history of education in New York. \nFormation of the Board of Higher Education and the founding of Brooklyn College\nThere had been intimations of a free university in Brooklyn since the dawn of the 20th century. As early as 1905, Brooklyn Controller Edward M. Grout proposed the formation of a free public university in Brooklyn. The suggestion was to merge all of the various private institutions, and to follow the model provided by the success of City College and the Normal College. A large factor in the push for a Brooklyn school was the distance of the schools, rendering attendance \"practically prohibitive\" to residents of Brooklyn and Queens. Grout was quoted in the \"New York Times\":What I propose is that we unite in asking of the Legislature an act to authorize a public university in Brooklyn, the Trustees to be appointed by the Mayor, with authority to the city by its Board of Estimate and Apportionment to locate its site in these east side lands or to provide another site, if the city so chooses, and also to make such appropriation as the Board of Estimate may see fit for buildings and maintenance, and with authority to make agreements of consolidation with such other educational institutions as may be willing and as the Board of Estimate may approve.In 1909, City College opened a teacher extension program in Brooklyn, and by 1917 they had created an evening program in Brooklyn. A 1923 bill introduced by Assemblyman Joseph Reich called for the establishment of a free public college in Brooklyn, but this did not pass the legislature. One year later, President George Samler Davis of Hunter College was quoted in \"The New York Times\" announcing that the Board of Trustees had \"authorized the establishment of a Brooklyn Branch of the evening sessions of the college in the Girls' Commercial High School Building, Classon Avenue and Union Street.\" These developments stirred resentment among Brooklyn's political leaders, leading Borough President Joseph A. Guider to request funds from the New York State Assembly for the establishment of a university in Prospect Park. Through debates over governance structure between proposals by the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and proposals coming from Manhattan, a Board of Higher Education governing New York public colleges was formed in the passage of the Nicoll-Hearn Bill signed into law by Governor Al Smith in April 1926. Moses J. Stroock was named the board's first chairman. This bill also charged the board with the formation of a public college in the most populous district in Brooklyn. Following the passage of the Nicoll-Hearn Bill in 1926, the board approved the opening of new City College and Hunter College branches in downtown Brooklyn. Four years later, Brooklyn College emerged from the merger of these Brooklyn annexes. The school operated out of a rented office space in downtown Brooklyn before the school's first president, William Boylan, at the proposal of architect Randolph Evans, settled on an undeveloped track of land in Midwood. On October 2, 1935, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia broke ground on the new campus. Franklin D. Roosevelt would lay the last stone.\nRapp-Coudert Committee and the anti-war movement.\nBeginning at the end of and into the 20th-century, a wave of Jewish refugees would transform the social and political life of City College. As historian Conor Tom\u00e1s Reed writes, \"Jewish students from some of the most impoverished refugee families in the US flocked to City College to obtain a free college education. Over time, they turned the college into a hotbed of antifascism.\" During the post-World War I era as some Ivy League universities such as Yale and Columbia placed harsh quotas on the number of Jewish students admitted, City College stood out for its working-class intellectual life. The City College of New York developed a reputation of being \"the Harvard of the proletariat\" and a \"Citadel on a Hill,\" a home for radical argumentation among those shut out of elite universities. Early forms of student activism targeted compulsory military training on campus, and succeeded in having it eliminated in 1926. There are a number of accounts documenting the alcoves in the cafeteria as sites of political debate. However, Frederick B. Robinson, president of City College from 1927 to 1939, was a harsh disciplinarian who participated in the intense repression of these forms of student activism. This would develop over the course of the 1930s in the suspension of students, the dismissal of professors, and willful compliance with the anti-Communist Rapp-Coudert Committee. Responding to the 1935 Teachers Union election that brought Communists into greater control as a part of the rank-and-file, the Committee sought to purge professors with alleged Communist affiliations from the universities. This culminated in the firing of over fifty professors, the largest political purge of faculty in America. This committee was based upon the House Un-American Activities Committee, and would itself serve as a model for future anti-communist investigations. \nThere are many examples of student protest at the different municipal universities through the 1930s. On April 13, 1934, City and Hunter Colleges were sites of the first National Student Strike Against War, organized by the Student League for Industrial Democracy and the National Student League. At City College, approximately 600 students gathered at the flagpole on campus to protest the war, as well as demand the reinstatement of twenty-one students who had been expelled for refusing to answer Dean Morton Gottschall's questions regarding their actions in a prior protest against a visiting delegation of soldiers from fascist Italy on October 9. In April 1934, students at Hunter College demonstrated against then-president Dr. Eugene A. Colligan for his refusal to cooperate with the nationwide anti-war strike \"and especially his attempt to call a halt to an anti-war convention at Hunter College on mere technicalities.\" On November 20, 1934, nearly 1,500 gathered at the CCNY Quad to protest the expulsion, culminating in the burning of a two-headed effigy of CCNY President Robinson and Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini. After the rally, more than 2,000 City College students voted to reinstate the twenty-one students, this time advocating for \"a 'legal method' of struggle...as opposed to the holding of unauthorized demonstrations.\" \nBrooklyn College was also referred to as a \"hotbed of Communism\" in the era of the Red Scare. Republican representative J. Parnell Thomas, a member of the Dies Committee, stated that he believed \"25 per cent of the pupils in Brooklyn College, which is part of the City College of New York, are either affiliated with or sympathetic to the Communist party and that 33 per cent of the professors of Brooklyn College are just as sympathetic as the students.\" In the words of Brooklyn College archivist Marianna Labatto, President Harry Gideonse, who served from 1939 to 1966, believed that if academia did not provide moral, social, as well as intellectual guidance, \"the void would be filled by popular culture and totalitarian regimes.\" This led to the creation of committees to oversee student activities and thus deter from Communist influence. The work of the Faculty-Student Committee on Student Groups and Organizations led to the prevention of leader of the Communist Party USA, Earl Browder, from speaking to the Karl Marx Society of Brooklyn College in 1939. It also suppressed student publications through suspensions and the revocation of charters. \nFounding of Queens College.\nWith an 111,360-citizen alliance, County Judge Charles S. Colden appointed the Committee for a Queens Free College to study the possibility of establishing a free college in Queens on the site of the former New York Parental School for Boys. On December 25, 1936, Mayor LaGuardia agreed to establish the school. In 1937, the Queens branches of City College and Hunter College merged, creating Queens College. Dr. Paul Klapper, at the time the Dean of the School of Education at City College, was elected the school's first president. Klapper was thrilled by the potentials of the college, and would refer to the school as \"the people's college on the hill.\" In an interview with the \"New York Times\" that was published upon his election, May 26, 1937, he stated:\u2018Many have been called to the leadership of institutions of higher learning in America, but to me there has come an opportunity unique in its richness: to help in the building of a great institution, to assemble its staff of teachers and scholars, to formulate its sphere of influence. We must build not another college but a new college, an institution whose identity stems from its distinctive aim and its distinctive staff. We must build more than a college for young people; we must develop a great cultural center for the Borough of Queens.\u2019\nCommunity college expansion and the founding of CUNY.\nDemand in the United States for higher education rapidly grew after World War II, and during the mid-1940s a movement began to create community colleges to provide accessible education and training. The State of New York began to study postwar educational needs as early as 1940, with a plan by the State's Board of Regents to establish twenty-two new two year colleges, with eleven poised to be in New York City. In 1944, a report by the New York Adult Education Council and another by the Rapp-Coudert committee's survey staff, called for increased attention to adult education in New York. 270,000 full-time students were newly enrolled in New York State schools in wave of veterans returning from World War II hoping to take advantage of the GI Bill. Beginning in 1946, pressure was applied to Governor Thomas E. Dewey to establish a state university. As historian writes: \nThe principal arguments advanced in support of a public university were three: the general shortage of college facilities in the State; the special need to provide spaces for large numbers of returning war veterans; and growing evidence of discriminatory admission policies among the private institutions, especially the medical schools.\nThe American Jewish Congress and American Jewish Committee had advocated for the Board of Regents to study admissions discrimination in institutions of higher education. In response, a Temporary Commission on the Need for a State University was forged, bringing together Jewish, Black, labor and legislative interests. The Commission published a report in 1948 entitled \"Inequality of Opportunity in Higher Education: A Study of Minority Group and Related Barriers to College Admission\" which was to guide the development of New York City community colleges. However, the community college movement was constrained by many factors including \"financial problems, narrow perceptions of responsibility, organizational weaknesses, adverse political factors, and other competing priorities.\" Community colleges would have drawn from the same city coffers that were funding the senior colleges, and city higher education officials believed that the state should finance them. A 1948 state law required student tuition to be implemented at community colleges. Additionally, the municipal public colleges offered two-year and certificate programs in some subjects, thus rendering the need for the development of community colleges less urgent. The State of New York had also already opened technical institutes in the city; the New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences had been established in 1946 in downtown Brooklyn, and it was not until the end of the 1950s that the Board of Education authorized the establishment of three of its own community colleges. These were to become the Staten Island Community College (later College of Staten Island) in 1956, Bronx Community College in 1957, and Queensborough Community College in 1960. \nThe State University of New York (SUNY) was significantly expanded under Governor Nelson Rockefeller. In 1959, Rockefeller formed the Heald Commission, chaired by President of the Ford Foundation, Henry T. Heald, toreview the higher education needs and facilities in New York State and to make recommendations on the steps that the State could take to: \n\"(1)\" assure educational opportunities to those qualified for college study;\n\"(2)\" provide the undergraduate, graduate and professional training and research facilities necessary for the continued development of the State as a leading business, industrial, scientific and cultural center; and\n\"(3)\" contribute its proper share of trained personnel to meet the nation's needs for education, health and welfare servicesThe report recommended the \"expansion of the SUNY system as well as public aid to private colleges, increased student scholarships, and an end to the tuition-free policy in New York City's municipal colleges.\" In April 1961, Rockefeller signed an amendment to the New York State Education Law formally establishing the City University of New York. This legislation followed some of the Heald Committee's recommendations, ending the state's free tuition mandate. The legislation integrated the four senior colleges and three community colleges, as well as a new Division of Graduate Studies, into a coordinated system of higher education for the city under the control of the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York. \nIn 1962, the Board of Higher Education commissioned \"A Long-Range Plan for the City University of New York, 1961-1975,\" a study of the University and a set of recommendations for its future. This report called for the Board to \"reaffirm its support of the policy of free tuition for resident matriculated baccalaureate students which has been maintained for 115 years,\" and recommended that this policy be extended to the community colleges. It called for the crafting of more generous admissions requirements to expand enrollment, as well as the expansion of the University's facilities to accommodate this expansion. In the following years, a number of new community and senior colleges were founded. In 1964, both the Borough of Manhattan Community College and Kingsborough Community College were established. The school also integrated the New York City Community College (later the NYC College of Technology), and the College of Police Science (COPS), later renamed John Jay College of Criminal Justice, was founded with the idea that \"police should be educated to better deal with the social and political issues of the time period.\" \nCollege Discovery and SEEK.\nAlbert H. Bowker was named CUNY Chancellor in 1963. He was \"struck by CUNY's unresponsiveness to the burgeoning college-age population and to the changed ethnic composition of the city,\" and argued for a major expansion of the public university system. He was a major advocate for the policy of \"open admissions,\" which would guarantee every NYC high-school graduate a spot at the University. In the coming years, two remedial programs were created to assist students underprepared for college level work. The College Discovery admissions program was established for the community colleges in 1964, and SEEK (Search for Education, Elevation, and Knowledge) in 1966. These programs were instrumental in the struggle for an accessible and diverse university system, and \"within a few years, SEEK would become a nucleus for experimental study that challenged the institutional inequalities entrenched in City College's admissions, curriculum, and relationship to Harlem.\" \nCivil rights and the struggle for open admissions.\nCalls for greater access to public higher education from the Black and Puerto Rican communities in New York, especially in Brooklyn, led to the founding of \"Community College Number 7 (later Medgar Evers College) in 1966\u20131967. Hostos Community College was also forged through this same form of activism in 1968. At Baruch College in 1967, over a thousand students protested the plan to make the college an upper-division school limited to junior, senior, and graduate students. Also in 1967, the Bronx campus of Hunter College was changed to Lehman College and entered as one of CUNY's senior undergraduate colleges. The first senior college founded under the CUNY system was York College, established in 1967 in Jamaica, Queens. At Brooklyn College in 1968, students attempted a sit-in to demand the admission of more black and Puerto Rican students and additional Black Studies curriculum. Students at Hunter College also demanded a Black Studies program. Members of the SEEK program, which provided academic support for underprepared and underprivileged students, staged a building takeover at Queens College in 1969 to protest the decisions of the program's director, who would later be replaced by a Black professor. \nIn 1969, a group of black and Puerto Rican students occupied City College and demanded the racial integration of CUNY, which at the time had an overwhelmingly white student body. The desires of minority students were succinctly detailed in a list of five demands issued by the Committee of Ten, a coalition of black and Puerto Rican students at City College:\nIn 1969, students and faculty across CUNY participated in rallies, student strikes, and class boycotts demanding an end to CUNY's restrictive admissions policies. Puerto Rican students at Bronx Community College filed a report with the New York State Division of Human Rights in 1970, contending that the intellectual level of the college was inferior and discriminatory. Hunter College was crippled for several days by a protest of 2,000 students who had a list of demands focusing on more student representation in college administration. Across CUNY, students boycotted their campuses in 1970 to protest a rise in student fees and other issues, including the proposed (and later implemented) open admissions plan. CUNY administrators and Mayor John Lindsay expressed support for these demands, and the Board of Higher Education (BHE) voted to implement the plan immediately in the fall of 1970. All high school graduates were guaranteed entrance to the university without having to fulfill traditional requirements such as exams or grades. The policy nearly doubled the number of students enrolled in the CUNY system to 35,000 (compared to 20,000 the year before). Black and Hispanic student enrollment increased threefold. Remedial education, to supplement the training of under-prepared students, became a significant part of CUNY's offerings. Additionally, ethnic and Black Studies programs and centers were instituted on many CUNY campuses, contributing to the growth of similar programs nationwide. Retention of students in CUNY during this period was low; two-thirds of students enrolled in the early 1970s left within four years without graduating. \nIn 1970, LaGuardia Community College was founded in Long Island City, Queens with a focus on cooperative education.\nFear city: CUNY in the 1970s.\nLike many college campuses in 1970, CUNY faced a number of protests and demonstrations after the Kent State massacre and Cambodian Campaign. The Administrative Council of the City University of New York sent President Richard Nixon a telegram in 1970 stating, \"No nation can long endure the alienation of the best of its young people.\" Some colleges, including John Jay College of Criminal Justice, historically the \"college for cops,\" held teach-ins in addition to student and faculty protests.\nIn fall 1976, during New York City's fiscal crisis, the free tuition policy was discontinued under pressure from the federal government, the financial community that had a role in rescuing the city from bankruptcy, and New York State, which would take over the funding of CUNY's senior colleges. Tuition, which had been in place in the State University of New York system since 1963, was instituted at all CUNY colleges.\nMeanwhile, CUNY students were added to the state's need-based Tuition Assistance Program (TAP), which had been created to help private colleges. Full-time students who met the income eligibility criteria were permitted to receive TAP funding, ensuring for the first time that financial hardship would deprive no CUNY student of a college education. Within a few years, the federal government would create its own need-based program, known as Pell Grants, providing the neediest students with a tuition-free college education.\nFounding of CUNY School of Law.\nIn 1981 Charles Halpern, a founder of one of the nation's first public interest law firms, was hired by CUNY as the founding dean of a planned law school. CUNY School of Law opened in 1983 as The CUNY Law School at Queens College. The goal of CUNY Law was to provide a \"new direction for teaching law\" with a focus on public interest law, and on the education of students who may not traditionally have had access to law school. \nCUNY Law moved from their original location in Flushing to 2 Court Square in Long Island City at the end of May 2012. It remains the only publicly funded law school in New York City. \nAusterity and the end of open admissions.\nJoseph S. Murphy was Chancellor of the City University of New York from 1982 to 1990. CUNY at the time was the third-largest university in the United States, with over 180,000 students. CUNY's enrollment dipped after tuition was re-established, and there were further enrollment declines through the 1980s and into the 1990s.\nIn 1995, CUNY suffered another fiscal crisis when Governor George Pataki proposed a drastic cut in state financing. He also called for a $500 tuition increase and an end to SEEK and College Discovery. In response, faculty cancelled classes and students staged protests. On March 23, 1995, between 10,000 and 20,000 students participated in a march on City Hall, organized by the CUNY Coalition Against the Cuts. The organizers claimed that this was the \"largest student demonstration since Vietnam.\" As detailed in College of Staten Island student newspaper \"The Banner\", \"scores of students were arrested and issued summonses,\" with Governor Pataki and Mayor Guiliani \"[denying] any responsibility for the violence that occurred at the rally.\" The \"New York Times\" covered the protest: \"sixty people, mostly students, were arrested, and 16, including 11 police offices were injured. All of the injuries were minor, the police said.\" Despite student efforts, by May, CUNY was forced to adopt deep cuts to college budgets and class offerings. By June, to save money spent on remedial programs, CUNY adopted a stricter admissions policy for its senior colleges: students deemed unprepared for college would not be admitted, this being a major departure from the 1970 Open Admissions program. That year's final state budget cut funding by $102 million, which CUNY absorbed by increasing tuition by $750 and offering a retirement incentive plan for faculty. The Student Liberation Action Movement (SLAM!) was an organization that branched out from the CUNY Coalition. \nIn 1999, a task force appointed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issued a report that described CUNY as \"an institution adrift\" and called for an improved, more cohesive university structure and management, as well as more consistent academic standards. Following the report, Matthew Goldstein, a mathematician and City College graduate who had led CUNY's Baruch College and briefly, Adelphi University, was appointed chancellor. CUNY ended its policy of open admissions to its four-year colleges, raised its admissions standards at its most selective four-year colleges (Baruch, Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens), and required new enrollees who needed remediation to begin their studies at a CUNY open-admissions community college.\n21st century.\n2000-2010: The rapid expansion and centralization of CUNY.\nIn response to the sweeping administrative actions called for in the \u201cAn Institution Adrift\u201d report, the first decade of the 21st century was defined by rising institutional tensions created by exponential growth in CUNY's student enrollment, private fundraising campaigns, and program options under Chancellor Goldstein's direction. CUNY's enrollment of degree-credit students reached 220,727 in 2005 and 262,321 in 2010 as the university broadened its academic offerings. The university added more than 2,000 full-time faculty positions, opened new schools and programs, and expanded the university's fundraising efforts to help pay for them. \nDiscord mounted between CUNY administrators, faculty and staff, and students as this unchecked growth and consolidation of decision-making authority gave way to \"a system that increasingly became stratified by race and class\" as well as the disproportionate increase of CUNY's adjunct teaching workforce. In response to this burgeoning labor crisis, PSC CUNY elected a \u201cNew Caucus\u201d of progressive officers in 2000, replacing leadership that many rank-and-file organizers believed had not done enough to challenge austerity measures ushered in during the previous decade.\nDespite faculty and staff resistance to the rapid expansion of the university system and the high costs that came with it, the strain on CUNY's financial and personnel resources was only exacerbated by the Great Recession of 2008. \nBy 2011, nearly six of ten full-time undergraduates qualified for a tuition-free education at CUNY due in large measure to state, federal and CUNY financial aid programs. Fundraising increased from $35 million in 2000 to more than $200 million in 2012.\nBy autumn 2013, all CUNY undergraduates were required to take an administration-dictated common core of courses that have been claimed to meet specific \"learning outcomes\" or standards. Since the courses are accepted university-wide, the administration claims it will be easier for students to transfer course credits between CUNY colleges. It also reduced the number of core courses some CUNY colleges had required, to a level below national norms, particularly in the sciences. The program is the target of several lawsuits by students and faculty, and was the subject of a \"no confidence\" vote by the faculty, who rejected it by an overwhelming 92% margin.\nChancellor Goldstein retired on July 1, 2013, and was replaced on June 1, 2014, by James Milliken, president of the University of Nebraska, and a graduate of the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln and New York University School of Law. Milliken left at the end of the 2018 academic year and moved on to become the chancellor for the University of Texas system.\nOn February 13, 2019, the Board of Trustees voted to appoint Queens College president Felix V. Matos Rodriguez as the chancellor of the City University of New York. Matos became both the first Latino and minority educator to head the university. He assumed the post May 1.\nIn April 2024, CUNY students joined other campuses across the United States in protests against the Israel\u2013Hamas war. The student protestors demanded that CUNY divest from companies with ties to Israel and that CUNY officials cancel any upcoming trips to Israel and protect students involved in the demonstrations. In 2025, CUNY terminated four professors and one student leader for their opposition to the Gaza war.\nSchools founded in the 21st century.\nConceptualized during Chancellor Goldstein's incumbency and approved by CUNY's Board of Trustees in 1999, the first CUNY Honors College was established in 2001. This senior honors college was renamed the William E. Macaulay Honors College in 2006 after a $30 million donation made by the late William E. Macaulay (Baruch School of Business at City College, class of 1966) and his wife Linda. The Macaulay endowment permitted CUNY's honors program to provide each of its students with four-year full-tuition merit scholarships, funded research projects and study abroad programs, and purchased a new building located at 35 W. 67th Street which opened its doors in April of 2008. Eight senior CUNY colleges serve as \"home campuses\" for Macaulay Honors students, including \nBaruch College, Brooklyn College, City College, Hunter College, John Jay College, Lehman College, Queens College, and College of Staten Island.\nIn June 2003, Neil Kleiman, then-director of the Center for an Urban Future, addressed the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York detailing the need for creating the CUNY School of Professional Studies (CUNY SPS). CUNY SPS is a senior college that seeks to meet the educational needs of working adults. In 2013, CUNY SPS opened its principal campus in midtown Manhattan, at the former site of the Gimbels department store. In 2022 CUNY SPS was the forerunner of a CUNY initiative to provide excellence in online education. \nThe Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York opened in 2006 as the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. The school opened with the mission of expanding diversity in newsrooms across the nation and providing an affordable, publicly supported graduate journalism school in the New York region. It is the only public graduate school of journalism in the northeastern United States.\nGuttman Community College was founded September 11, 2011, opening in 2012 as the New Community College. \nIn 2016 the Graduate School of Public Health &amp; Health Policy was opened with the goal of centralizing CUNY's existing Public Health Programs. Students and faculty transferred to this new school from CUNY's existing Public Health programs at Brooklyn College, Lehman College, Hunter College and the CUNY Graduate Center.\nIn 2018, CUNY opened its 25th campus, the CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies, named after former president Joseph S. Murphy and combining some forms and functions of the Murphy Institute that were housed at the CUNY School of Professional Studies. \nOn November 19, 2024, the School of Medicine was established as the 26th CUNY campus, separating it from the scope of City College of New York.\nOn July 1, 2025, Governor Kathy Hochul signed into effect a free community college program for SUNY and CUNY students. The program is an expansion of the CUNY Reconnect initiative, a program allowing for \"New York residents ages 25-55 with no prior degree\" to earn \"a tuition-free associate degree in high-demand fields.\"\nEnrollment and demographics.\nCUNY is the fourth-largest university system in the United States by enrollment, behind the California State University, State University of New York (SUNY), and University of California systems. More than 271,000-degree-credit students, continuing, and professional education students are enrolled at campuses located in all five New York City boroughs.\nThe university has one of the most diverse student bodies in the United States, with students hailing from around the world, although most students live in New York City. The black, white and Hispanic undergraduate populations each comprise more than a quarter of the student body, and Asian undergraduates make up 18 percent. Fifty-eight percent are female, and 28 percent are 25 or older. In the 2017\u20132018 award year, 144,380 CUNY students received the Federal Pell Grant.\nCUNY Citizenship Now!\nFounded in 1997 by immigration lawyer Allan Wernick, CUNY Citizenship Now! is an immigration assistance organization that provides free and confidential immigration law services to help individuals and families on their path to U.S. citizenship. In 2021, CUNY launched a College Immigrant Ambassador Program in partnership with the New York City Department of Education.\nManagement structure.\nToday, the City University is governed by the board of trustees composed of 17 members, ten of whom are appointed by the governor of New York \"with the advice and consent of the senate,\" and five by the mayor of New York City \"with the advice and consent of the senate.\" The final two trustees are \"ex officio\" members. One is the chair of the university's student senate, and the other is non-voting and is the chair of the university's faculty senate. Both the mayoral and gubernatorial appointments to the CUNY Board are required to include at least one resident of each of New York City's five boroughs. Trustees serve seven-year terms, which are renewable for another seven years. The chancellor is elected by the board of trustees, and is the \"chief educational and administrative officer\" of the City University.\nThe administrative offices are in Midtown Manhattan.\nFaculty.\nCUNY employs 6,700 full-time faculty members and over 10,000 adjunct faculty members. Faculty and staff are represented by the Professional Staff Congress (PSC), a labor union and chapter of the American Federation of Teachers.\nPublic Safety Department.\nCUNY has a unified public safety department, the City University of New York Public Safety Department, with branches at each of the 26 CUNY campuses.\nThe New York City Police Department is the primary policing and investigation agency within the New York City as per the NYC Charter, which includes all CUNY campuses and facilities.\nThe Public Safety Department came under heavy criticism from student groups, after several students protesting tuition increases tried to occupy the lobby of the Baruch College. The occupiers were forcibly removed from the area and several were arrested on November 21, 2011.\nAntisemitism at CUNY.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of antisemitic incidents on CUNY campuses, including:\nCUNY has taken steps to address antisemitism on its campuses. In 2020, the university created a task force to combat antisemitism. The task force has developed a number of initiatives, including training for faculty and staff on how to identify and address antisemitism.\nIn June 2024, the United States Department of Education concluded that CUNY has failed to protect Jewish students from discrimination following the October 7 attacks. CUNY's Hunter College also faced scrutiny for incidents dating back to 2021. In response, Chancellor F\u00e9lix V. Matos Rodr\u00edguez stated that CUNY is dedicated to maintaining a discrimination-free and hate-free environment, and that new measures will ensure consistent and transparent investigation and resolution of complaints.\nCity University Television (CUNY TV).\nCUNY also has a broadcast TV service, CUNY TV (channel 75 on Spectrum, digital HD broadcast channel 25.3), which airs telecourses, classic and foreign films, magazine shows, and panel discussions in foreign languages.\nCity University Film Festival (CUNYFF).\nThe City University Film Festival is CUNY's official film festival. The festival was founded in 2009.\nNotable alumni.\nCUNY graduates include 13 Nobel laureates, 2 Fields Medalists, 2 U.S. Secretaries of State, a Supreme Court Justice, several New York City mayors, members of Congress, state legislators, scientists, artists, and Olympians.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7543", "revid": "381953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7543", "title": "Computational complexity theory", "text": "Inherent difficulty of computational problems\nIn theoretical computer science and mathematics, computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and explores the relationships between these classifications. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.\nA problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in communication complexity), the number of gates in a circuit (used in circuit complexity) and the number of processors (used in parallel computing). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The P versus NP problem, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, is part of the field of computational complexity.\nClosely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kinds of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.\nComputational problems.\nProblem instances.\nA computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of \"instances\" together with a set (possibly empty) of \"solutions\" for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is \"yes\" if the number is prime and \"no\" otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is \"no\"). Stated another way, the \"instance\" is a particular input to the problem, and the \"solution\" is the output corresponding to the given input.\nTo further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the travelling salesman problem: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 14 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through 14 sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.\nRepresenting problem instances.\nWhen considering computational problems, a problem instance is a string over an alphabet. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are bitstrings. As in a real-world computer, mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, integers can be represented in binary notation, and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices, or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.\nEven though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.\nDecision problems as formal languages.\nDecision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a type of computational problem where the answer is either \"yes\" or \"no\" (alternatively, 1 or 0). A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an algorithm, whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer \"yes\", the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.\nAn example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary graph. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs\u2014to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.\nFunction problems.\nA function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem\u2014that is, the output is not just yes or no. Notable examples include the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem.\nIt is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples formula_1 such that the relation formula_2 holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.\nMeasuring the size of an instance.\nTo measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. The input size is typically measured in bits. Complexity theory studies how algorithms scale as input size increases. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with formula_3 vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with formula_4 vertices?\nIf the input size is formula_4, the time taken can be expressed as a function of formula_4. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity formula_7 is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size formula_4. If formula_7 is a polynomial in formula_4, then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm. Cobham's thesis argues that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial-time algorithm.\nMachine models and complexity measures.\nTuring machine.\nA Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a general model of a computing machine\u2014anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church\u2013Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata, lambda calculus or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.\nMany types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as deterministic Turing machines, probabilistic Turing machines, non-deterministic Turing machines, quantum Turing machines, symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.\nA deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see non-deterministic algorithm.\nOther machine models.\nMany machine models different from the standard multi-tape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature, for example random-access machines. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary. What all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically.\nHowever, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.\nComplexity measures.\nFor a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used. The time required by a deterministic Turing machine formula_11 on input formula_12 is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer (\"yes\" or \"no\"). A Turing machine formula_11 is said to operate within time formula_14 if the time required by formula_11 on each input of length formula_4 is at most formula_14. A decision problem formula_18 can be solved in time formula_14 if there exists a Turing machine operating in time formula_14 that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time formula_14 on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(formula_14).\nAnalogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity, circuit complexity, and decision tree complexity.\nThe complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using big O notation.\nBest, worst and average case complexity.\nThe best, worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size formula_4 may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:\nThe order from cheap to costly is: Best, average (of discrete uniform distribution), amortized, worst.\nFor example, the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort addresses the problem of sorting a list of integers. The worst-case is when the pivot is always the largest or smallest value in the list (so the list is never divided). In this case, the algorithm takes time O(formula_27). If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is formula_28. The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing formula_28 time.\nUpper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems.\nTo classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), it is helpful to demonstrate upper and lower bounds on the maximum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm to solve a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms. To show an upper bound formula_7 on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most formula_7. However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase \"all possible algorithms\" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of formula_7 for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than formula_7.\nUpper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big O notation, which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used. For instance, if formula_34, in big O notation one would write formula_35.\nComplexity classes.\nDefining complexity classes.\nA complexity class is a set of problems of related complexity. Simpler complexity classes are defined by the following factors:\nSome complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:\nThe set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within time formula_14. (This complexity class is known as DTIME(formula_14).)\nBut bounding the computation time above by some concrete function formula_14 often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language formula_39 can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, Cobham-Edmonds thesis states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" . This forms the basis for the complexity class P, which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is FP.\nImportant complexity classes.\nMany important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\nLogarithmic-space classes do not account for the space required to represent the problem.\nIt turns out that PSPACE = NPSPACE and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE by Savitch's theorem.\nOther important complexity classes include BPP, ZPP and RP, which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines; AC and NC, which are defined using Boolean circuits; and BQP and QMA, which are defined using quantum Turing machines. #P is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems. ALL is the class of all decision problems.\nHierarchy theorems.\nFor the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(formula_4) is contained in DTIME(formula_27), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\nMore precisely, the time hierarchy theorem states that\nformula_42.\nThe space hierarchy theorem states that\nformula_43.\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.\nReduction.\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at most as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem formula_44 can be solved using an algorithm for formula_45, formula_44 is no more difficult than formula_45, and we say that formula_44 \"reduces\" to formula_45. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions.\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem formula_44 is \"hard\" for a class of problems formula_51 if every problem in formula_51 can be reduced to formula_44. Thus no problem in formula_51 is harder than formula_44, since an algorithm for formula_44 allows us to solve any problem in formula_51. The notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.\nIf a problem formula_44 is in formula_51 and hard for formula_51, then formula_44 is said to be \"complete\" for formula_51. This means that formula_44 is the hardest problem in formula_51. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that formula_44 is one of the hardest problems in formula_51.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P = NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, formula_67, to another problem, formula_68, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for formula_68. This is because a polynomial-time solution to formula_68 would yield a polynomial-time solution to formula_67. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P = NP.\nImportant open problems.\nP versus NP problem.\nThe complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis. The complexity class NP, on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the Boolean satisfiability problem, the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem. Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.\nThe question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution. If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research, many problems in logistics, protein structure prediction in biology, and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems. The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute. There is a US$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.\nProblems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete.\nIt was shown by Ladner that if formula_72 then there exist problems in formula_73 that are neither in formula_74 nor formula_73-complete. Such problems are called NP-intermediate problems. The graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in formula_74 or to be formula_73-complete.\nThe graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in formula_74, formula_73-complete, or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai and Eugene Luks has run time formula_80 for graphs with formula_4 vertices, although some recent work by Babai offers some potentially new perspectives on this.\nThe integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a prime factor less than formula_82. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the RSA algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in formula_73 and in formula_84 (and even in UP and co-UP). If the problem is formula_73-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., formula_73 will equal formula_84). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve, which takes time formula_88 to factor an odd integer formula_4. However, the best known quantum algorithm for this problem, Shor's algorithm, does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.\nSeparations between other complexity classes.\nMany known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance formula_90, but it is possible that formula_91. If formula_74 is not equal to formula_73, then formula_74 is not equal to formula_95 either. Since there are many known complexity classes between formula_74 and formula_95, such as formula_98, formula_99, formula_100, formula_101, formula_102, formula_103, etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.\nAlong the same lines, formula_84 is the class containing the complement problems (i.e. problems with the \"yes\"/\"no\" answers reversed) of formula_73 problems. It is believed that formula_73 is not equal to formula_84; however, it has not yet been proven. It is clear that if these two complexity classes are not equal then formula_74 is not equal to formula_73, since formula_110. Thus if formula_111 we would have formula_112 whence formula_113.\nSimilarly, it is not known if formula_114 (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in formula_74 or equal to formula_74. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as formula_117 and formula_118, and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.\nIt is suspected that formula_74 and formula_99 are equal. However, it is currently open if formula_121.\nIntractability.\nA problem that can theoretically be solved, but requires impractical and infinite resources (e.g., time) to do so, is known as an &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;intractable problem. Conversely, a problem that can be solved in practice is called a &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;tractable problem, literally \"a problem that can be handled\". The term \"infeasible\" (literally \"cannot be done\") is sometimes used interchangeably with \"intractable\", though this risks confusion with a feasible solution in mathematical optimization.\nTractable problems are frequently identified with problems that have polynomial-time solutions (formula_74, formula_123); this is known as the Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If formula_73 is not the same as formula_74, then NP-hard problems are also intractable in this sense.\nHowever, this identification is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large degree or large leading coefficient grows quickly, and may be impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes a long time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in formula_74 does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in formula_74, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem.\nTo see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes formula_128 operations before halting. For small formula_4, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does formula_130 operations each second, the program would run for about formula_131 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes formula_132 operations is practical until formula_4 gets relatively large.\nSimilarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, formula_134, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances. Indeed, in practice even formula_135 or formula_27 algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.\nContinuous complexity theory.\nContinuous complexity theory can refer to complexity theory of problems that involve continuous functions that are approximated by discretizations, as studied in numerical analysis. One approach to complexity theory of numerical analysis is information based complexity.\nContinuous complexity theory can also refer to complexity theory of the use of analog computation, which uses continuous dynamical systems and differential equations. Control theory can be considered a form of computation and differential equations are used in the modelling of continuous-time and hybrid discrete-continuous-time systems.\nHistory.\nAn early example of algorithm complexity analysis is the running time analysis of the Euclidean algorithm done by Gabriel Lam\u00e9 in 1844.\nBefore the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers. Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by Alan Turing in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.\nThe beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal 1965 paper \"On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms\" by Juris Hartmanis and Richard E. Stearns, which laid out the definitions of time complexity and space complexity, and proved the hierarchy theorems. In addition, in 1965 Edmonds suggested to consider a \"good\" algorithm to be one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size.\nEarlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include John Myhill's definition of linear bounded automata (Myhill 1960), Raymond Smullyan's study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as Hisao Yamada's paper on real-time computations (1962). Somewhat earlier, Boris Trakhtenbrot (1956), a pioneer in the field from the USSR, studied another specific complexity measure. As he remembers:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn 1967, Manuel Blum formulated a set of axioms (now known as Blum axioms) specifying desirable properties of complexity measures on the set of computable functions and proved an important result, the so-called speed-up theorem. The field began to flourish in 1971 when Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin proved the existence of practically relevant problems that are NP-complete. In 1972, Richard Karp took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, \"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\", in which he showed that 21 diverse combinatorial and graph theoretical problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7546", "revid": "25112844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7546", "title": "Camelot", "text": "Castle and court associated with King Arthur\nCamelot is a legendary castle and court associated with King Arthur. Absent in the early Arthurian material, Camelot first appeared in 12th-century French romances and, since the Lancelot-Grail cycle, eventually came to be described as the fantastic capital of Arthur's realm and a symbol of the Arthurian world.\nMedieval texts locate it somewhere in Great Britain and sometimes associate it with real cities, though more usually its precise location is not revealed. Most scholars regard it as being entirely fictional, its unspecified geography being perfect for chivalric romance writers. Nevertheless, arguments about the location of the \"real Camelot\" have occurred since the 15th century and continue today in popular works and for tourism purposes.\nEtymology.\nThe name's derivation is uncertain. It has numerous different spellings in medieval French Arthurian romances, including \"Camaalot\", \"Camalot\", \"Chamalot\", \"Camehelot\" (sometimes read as \"Camchilot\"), \"Camaaloth\", \"Caamalot\", \"Camahaloth\", \"Camaelot\", \"Kamaalot\", \"Kamaaloth\", \"Kaamalot\", \"Kamahaloth\", \"Kameloth\", \"Kamaelot\", \"Kamelot\", \"Kaamelot\", \"Cameloth\", and \"Gamalaot\". Arthurian scholar Ernst Brugger suggested that it was a corruption of the site of Arthur's final battle, the Battle of Camlann, in Welsh tradition. Roger Sherman Loomis believed it was derived from \"Cavalon\", a place name that he suggested was a corruption of Avalon (under the influence of the Breton place name \"Cavallon\"). He further suggested that Cavalon became Arthur's capital due to confusion with Arthur's other traditional court at Caerleon (\"Caer Lleon\" in Welsh).\nOthers have suggested a derivation from the British Iron Age and Romano-British place name Camulodunum, one of the first capitals of Roman Britain and which would have significance in Romano-British culture. Indeed, John Morris, the English historian who specialized in the study of the institutions of the Roman Empire and the history of Sub-Roman Britain, suggested in his book \"The Age of Arthur\" that as the descendants of Romanized Britons looked back to a golden age of peace and prosperity under Rome, the name \"Camelot\" of Arthurian legend may have referred to the capital of Britannia (Camulodunum) in Roman times. It is unclear, however, where Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes would have encountered the name Camulodunum, or why he would render it as \"Camaalot\", though Urban T. Holmes argued Chr\u00e9tien could have had access to Book 2 of Pliny's \"Natural History\", where it is rendered as \"Camaloduno\".\nMedieval literature.\nArthur's court at Camelot is mentioned for the first time in Chr\u00e9tien's poem \"Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart\", dating to the 1170s, though it does not appear in all the manuscripts. In the C manuscript (Paris, Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, fonds fran\u00e7ais 794, folio 27r), which might in fact contain the proper reading of Chretien's original text, instead of the place name there is the Old French phrase \"con lui plot\", meaning \"as he pleased\". The other manuscripts spell the name variously as \"Chamalot\" (MS A, f. f. 196r), \"Camehelot\" (MS E, f. 1r), \"Chamaalot\" (MS G, f. 34f), and \"Camalot\" (MS T, f. 41v); the name is missing, along with the rest of the passage containing it, in MS V (Vatican, Biblioteca Vaticana, Regina 1725). Camelot is mentioned only in passing and is not described:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"A un jor d'une Acenssion / Fu venuz de vers Carlion / Li rois Artus et tenu ot / Cort molt riche a Camaalot, / Si riche com au jor estut.\"&lt;br&gt;King Arthur, one Ascension Day, had left Caerleon and held a most magnificent court at Camelot with all the splendour appropriate to the day.\nNothing in Chr\u00e9tien's poem suggests the level of importance Camelot would have in later romances. For Chr\u00e9tien, Arthur's chief court was in Caerleon in Wales; this was the king's primary base in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \"Historia Regum Britanniae\" and subsequent literature. Chr\u00e9tien depicts Arthur, like a typical medieval monarch, holding court at a number of cities and castles.\nIt is not until the 13th-century French prose romances, including the Vulgate and Post-Vulgate cycles, that Camelot began to supersede Caerleon, and even then, many descriptive details applied to Camelot derive from Geoffrey's earlier grand depiction of the Welsh town. Most Arthurian romances of this period produced in English or Welsh did not follow this trend; Camelot was referred to infrequently, and usually in translations from French. However, in Britain, Arthur's court was generally located at Caerleon, or at Carlisle, which is usually identified with the \"Carduel\" of the French romances. One exception is \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", which locates Arthur's court at Camelot.\nFrom Geoffrey's grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the chivalry and courtesy of its inhabitants. Geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral tradition of the grandeur of Arthur's court. The tale \"Culhwch and Olwen\", associated with the \"Mabinogion\" and perhaps first written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures, placing it in Celliwig, an uncertain locale in Cornwall.\nThe \"Lancelot-Grail\" cycle and the texts it influenced depict the city of Camelot as standing along a river, downstream from Astolat. It is surrounded by plains and forests, and its magnificent cathedral, St. Stephen's, originally established by Josephus, the son of Joseph of Arimathea, is the religious centre for Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. There, Arthur and Guinevere are married and there are the tombs of many kings and knights. In a mighty castle stands the Round Table, created by Merlin and Uther Pendragon; it is here that Galahad conquers the Siege Perilous, and where the knights see a vision of the Holy Grail and swear to find it. Jousts are often held in a meadow outside the city.\nIts imprecise geography serves the romances well, as Camelot becomes less a literal place than a powerful symbol of Arthur's court and universe. There is also a Kamaalot featured as the home of Percival's mother in the romance \"Perlesvaus\". In \"Palamedes\" and some other works, including the Post-Vulgate cycle, King Arthur's Camelot is eventually razed to the ground by the treacherous King Mark of Cornwall (who had besieged it earlier) in his invasion of Logres after the Battle of Camlann. In the \"Tavola Ritonda\", Camelot is abandoned and falls to ruin after the death of Arthur.\nAlthough the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various versions of the Welsh Triads agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one in each of the areas inhabited by the Celtic Britons: Cornwall, Wales and the Hen Ogledd. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by the 9th century which are recorded in various place names and features such as Arthur's Seat, indicating Arthur was a hero known and associated with many locations across Brittonic areas of Britain as well as Brittany. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location. Many other places are listed as a location where Arthur holds court in the later romances, Carlisle and London perhaps being the most prominent.\nIn the 15th century, the English writer Thomas Malory created the image of Camelot most familiar today in his \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", a summary compilation work based mostly on the French romances. He firmly identifies Camelot with Winchester in England, an identification that remained popular over the centuries, though it was rejected by Malory's own editor, William Caxton, who preferred a Welsh location. \nIdentifications.\nArthurian scholar Norris J. Lacy commented that \"Camelot, located nowhere in particular, can be anywhere.\" The romancers' versions of Camelot draw on earlier traditions of Arthur's fabulous court. The Celliwig of \"Culhwch and Olwen\" appears in the Welsh Triads as well; this early Welsh material places Wales' greatest leader outside its national boundaries. Geoffrey's description of Caerleon is probably based on his personal familiarity with the town and its Roman ruins; it is less clear that Caerleon was associated with Arthur before Geoffrey. Several French romances (\"Perlesvaus\", the Didot \"Perceval\" attributed to Robert de Boron, and even the early romances of Chr\u00e9tien such as \"Erec and Enide\" and \"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\") have Arthur hold court at \"Carduel in Wales\", a northern city based on the real Carlisle. Malory's identification of Camelot as Winchester was probably partially inspired by the latter city's history: it had been the capital of Wessex under Alfred the Great, and boasted the Winchester Round Table, an artefact constructed in the 13th century but widely believed to be the original by Malory's time. Caxton rejected the association, saying Camelot was in Wales and that its ruins could still be seen; this is a likely reference to the Roman ruins at Caerwent.\nIn 1542, John Leland reported that the locals around Cadbury Castle (formerly known as Camalet) in Somerset considered it to be the original Camelot. This theory, which was repeated by later antiquaries, is bolstered, or may have derived from, Cadbury's proximity to the River Cam and the villages of Queen Camel and West Camel, and remained popular enough to help inspire a large-scale archaeological dig in the 20th century. These excavations, led by archaeologist Leslie Alcock from 1966 to 1970, were titled \"Cadbury-Camelot\" and won much media attention. The dig revealed that the site seems to have been occupied as early as the 4th millennium BC and to have been refortified and occupied by a major Brittonic ruler and his war band from c.\u2009470. This early medieval settlement continued until around 580. The works were by far the largest known fortification of the period, double the size of comparative \"caers\" and with Mediterranean artefacts representing extensive trade and Saxon ones showing possible conquest. The use of the name Camelot and the support of Geoffrey Ashe helped ensure much publicity for the finds, but Alcock himself later grew embarrassed by the supposed Arthurian connection to the site. Following the arguments of David Dumville, Alcock felt the site was too late and too uncertain to be a tenable Camelot. Modern archaeologists follow him in rejecting the name, calling it instead Cadbury Castle hill fort. Despite this, Cadbury remains widely associated with Camelot.\nThe name of the Romano-British town of Camulodunum (modern Colchester) was derived from the Celtic god Camulus. However, it was located well within territory usually thought to have been conquered early in the 5th century by Saxons, so it is unlikely to have been the location of any \"true\" Camelot, as Arthur is traditionally dated to the late 5th and early 6th century. The town was definitely known as Colchester as early as the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" in 917. Even Colchester Museum argues strongly regarding the historical Arthur: \"It would be impossible and inconceivable to link him to the Colchester area, or to Essex more generally,\" pointing out that the connection between the name Camulodunum and Colchester was unknown until the 18th century. Arthurian scholar Peter Field has suggested that another Camulodunum, a former Roman fort, is a likely location of King Arthur's Camelot and that \"Slack, on the outskirts of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire,\" is where Arthur would have held court. This is because of the name, and also regarding its strategic location: it is but a few miles from the extreme south-west of Hen Ogledd (also making close to North Wales), and would have been a flagship point in staving off attacks to the Celtic kingdoms from the Angles and others.\nOther places in Britain with names related to \"Camel\" have also been suggested, such as Camelford in Cornwall, located down the River Camel from where Geoffrey places Camlann, the scene of Arthur's final battle. The area's connections with Camelot and Camlann are merely speculative. Further north, Camelon and its connections with Arthur's O'on have been mentioned in relation to Camelot, but Camelon may be an antiquarian neologism coined after the 15th century, with its earlier name being \"Carmore\" or \"Carmure\". Graham Phillips rejected the word \"Camelot\" entirely as just Chr\u00e9tien's invention and instead proposed the old Roman city of Viroconium (near Shrewsbury in modern England) as Arthur's capital, citing archaeological evidence of a grand palace having been in use around 500 AD. Alistair Moffat identified Camelot with Roxburgh in Scotland.\nModern culture.\nCamelot has become a permanent fixture in modern interpretations of the Arthurian legend. The symbolism of Camelot so impressed Alfred, Lord Tennyson that he wrote up a prose sketch on the castle as one of his earliest attempts to treat the legend. Modern stories typically retain Camelot's lack of precise location and its status as a symbol of the Arthurian world, though they typically transform the castle itself into romantically lavish visions of a High Middle Ages palace. Some writers of the \"realist\" strain of modern Arthurian fiction have attempted a more sensible Camelot. Inspired by Alcock's Cadbury-Camelot excavation, some authors such as Marion Zimmer Bradley and Mary Stewart place their Camelots in that place and describe it accordingly.\nCamelot lends its name to the musical \"Camelot\", which was adapted into a film of the same title, featuring the Castle of Coca, Segovia as Camelot. An Arthurian television series \"Camelot\" was also named after the castle, as were some other works including the video game \"Camelot\" and the comic book series \"Camelot 3000\". French television series \"Kaamelott\" presents a humorous alternative version of the Arthurian legend; Camelot Theme Park is a now-abandoned Arthurian theme park resort located in the English county of Lancashire. The Camelot Group was the first operator of the UK National Lottery with lottery machines named after characters, places, and objects in Arthurian legend. The vast cultural impact of Camelot can be seen in numerous works, products, and organisations. https://, a University of Rochester exhibit by Alan and Barbara Tepa Lupack offered a cross-section of 350 such items in 2024.\nIn strictly American contexts, Camelot era refers to the presidency of John F. Kennedy. In a 1963 \"Life\" interview, Jacqueline, his widow, referenced a line from the Lerner and Loewe musical to describe the Kennedy era White House: \"Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot.\" She indicated that it was one of Kennedy's favourite lyrics from the musical and added, \"there'll be great Presidents again [...] but there'll never be another Camelot again.\"\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Contras war against the Sandinista government lasted from 1979 until 1990 and was one of the highest profile conflicts of the Cold War.\nFollowing the Nicaraguan Revolution in 1979, which led to the fall of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, Nicaragua's president by the Sandinistas, various groups were formed in opposition to the Sandinistas, including by Samoza allies and former members of the National Guard, and also by Anti-Somozistas' groups whom had previously been aligned with and fought alongside the Sandinistas. The United States and several other countries provided military assistance and financial aid to the Contras. In 1981, the CIA and Argentina's Secretariat of Intelligence persuaded several Contra groups to unite into the larger Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). \nIn 1986, the Boland Amendment was passed to end U.S. aid to the Contras; yet the Reagan administration continued to illegally fund the Contras, which resulted in a scandal known as the Iran\u2013Contra affair. By 1987, most of the Contra militias had united into the Nicaraguan Resistance, within which the Nicaraguan Democratic Force was the largest group.\nDuring the war, the Contras' tactics featured terrorism and human rights violations against civilians. The Reagan administration said that the Contras' tactics did not include attacks against civilians. The CIA said that Contra terrorism resulted from \"the poor discipline characteristic of irregular forces\", that terrorism was not an official military doctrine of the Contras, and that the Contra leader responsible was executed. The Global Terrorism Database reports that Contras carried out more than 1,300 terrorist attacks.\nAfter a cutoff in U.S. military support, and with both sides facing international pressure to bring an end to the conflict, the contras agreed to negotiations with the FSLN. With the help of five Central American presidents, including Daniel Ortega (then-President of Nicaragua), the sides agreed that a voluntary demobilization of the contras should start in early December 1989. They chose this date to facilitate free and fair elections in Nicaragua in February 1990.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Contras were not a monolithic group, but a combination of three distinct elements of Nicaraguan society:\nMain groups.\nIn September 1981, the CIA and Argentina's intelligence agency, seeking to unify the anti-Sandinista cause before initiating large scale aid, persuaded 15 September Legion, the UDN, and several former smaller groups to merge as the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, which was known in Spanish as Fuerza Democr\u00e1tica Nicarag\u00fcense and was often referred to as FDN, a Spanish acronym. \nThe FDN was led by its Enrique Bermudez, its military commander, who led its war efforts against the Sandinistas, and Adolfo Calero Portocarrero, a Nicaraguan businessman who opposed the Somoza regime and led its political directorate. \u00c9dgar Chamorro later said that the UDN opposed working with the Guardsmen and that the merging only took place because of insistence by the CIA.\nBased in Honduras, Nicaragua's northern neighbor, under the command of former National Guard Colonel Enrique Berm\u00fadez, the new FDN began recruiting other smaller insurgent forces in the north. Largely financed, trained, equipped, armed and organized by the U.S., it emerged as the largest and most active Contra group.\nIn April 1982, Ed\u00e9n Pastora (\"Comandante Cero\"), one of the heroes in the fight against Somoza, organized the Sandinista Revolutionary Front (FRS) \u2013 embedded in the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance (ARDE) \u2013 and declared war on the Sandinista government. Himself a former Sandinista who had held several high posts in the government, he had resigned abruptly in 1981 and defected, believing that the newly found power had corrupted the Sandinistas' original ideas. A popular and charismatic leader, Pastora initially saw his group develop quickly. He confined himself to operate in the southern part of Nicaragua; after a press conference he was holding on 30 May 1984 was bombed, he \"voluntarily withdrew\" from the Contra struggle.\nA third force, Misurasata, appeared among the Miskito, Sumo and Rama Amerindian peoples of Nicaragua's Atlantic coast, who in December 1981 found themselves in conflict with the authorities following the government's efforts to nationalize Indian land. In the course of this conflict, forced removal of at least 10,000 Indians to relocation centers in the interior of the country and subsequent burning of some villages took place. The Misurasata movement split in 1983, with the breakaway Misura group of Stedman Fagoth Muller, which aligned more closely with the FDN, and the rest accommodating themselves with the Sandinistas: on 8 December 1984 a ceasefire agreement known as the Bogota Accord was signed by Misurasata and the Nicaraguan government. A subsequent autonomy statute in September 1987 largely defused Miskito resistance.\nUnity efforts.\nU.S. officials were active in attempting to unite the Contra groups. In June 1985 most of the groups reorganized as the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO), under the leadership of Adolfo Calero, Arturo Cruz, and Alfonso Robelo, each of whom opposed the Sandinista revolution. After UNO's dissolution early in 1987, the Nicaraguan Resistance (RN) was organized along similar lines in May.\nU.S. military and financial assistance.\nIn front of the International Court of Justice, the Nicaraguan government claimed that the Contras were altogether a creation of the U.S. This claim was rejected but the evidence of a very close relationship between the Contras and the United States was considered overwhelming and incontrovertible. The U.S. played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising the Contras over a long period, and it is unlikely that the Contras would have been capable of carrying out significant military operations without this support, given the large amount of training and weapons shipments that the Sandinistas had received from Cuba and the Soviet Union.\nPolitical background.\nThe U.S. government viewed the leftist Sandinistas as a threat to economic interests of American corporations in Nicaragua and to national security. U.S. President Ronald Reagan stated in 1983 that \"The defense of [the USA's] southern frontier\" was at stake. \"In spite of the Sandinista victory being declared fair, the United States continued to oppose the left-wing Nicaraguan government.\" and opposed its ties to Cuba and the Soviet Union. Ronald Reagan, who had assumed the American presidency in January 1981, accused the Sandinistas of importing Cuban-style socialism and aiding leftist guerrillas in El Salvador. The Reagan administration continued to view the Sandinistas as undemocratic despite the 1984 Nicaraguan elections being generally declared fair by foreign observers. Throughout the 1980s the Sandinista government was regarded as \"Partly Free\" by Freedom House, an organization financed by the U.S. government. \nOn 4 January 1982, Reagan signed the top secret National Security Decision Directive 17 (NSDD-17), giving the CIA the authority to recruit and support the Contras with $19 million in military aid. The effort to support the Contras was one component of the Reagan Doctrine, which called for providing military support to movements opposing Soviet-supported, communist governments.\nBy December 1981, the United States had already begun to support armed opponents of the Sandinista government. From the beginning, the CIA was in charge. The arming, clothing, feeding, and supervision of the Contras became the most ambitious paramilitary and political action operation mounted by the agency in nearly a decade.\nIn the fiscal year 1984, the U.S. Congress approved $24 million in aid to the Contras. After this, since the Contras failed to win widespread popular support or military victories within Nicaragua, opinion polls indicated that a majority of the U.S. public was not supportive of the Contras, the Reagan administration lost much of its support regarding its Contra policy within Congress after disclosure of CIA mining of Nicaraguan ports, and a report of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research commissioned by the State Department found Reagan's allegations about Soviet influence in Nicaragua \"exaggerated\", Congress cut off all funds for the Contras in 1985 by the third Boland Amendment. The Boland Amendment had first been passed by Congress in December 1982. At this time, it only outlawed U.S. assistance to the contras \"for the purpose of overthrowing the Nicaraguan government\", while allowing assistance for other purposes. In October 1984, it was amended to forbid action by not only the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency but all U.S. government agencies.\nNevertheless, the case for support of the Contras continued to be made in Washington, D.C., by both the Reagan administration and the Heritage Foundation, which argued that support for the Contras would counter Soviet influence in Nicaragua.\nOn 1 May 1985 President Reagan announced that his administration perceived Nicaragua to be \"an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\", and declared a \"national emergency\" and a trade embargo against Nicaragua to \"deal with that threat\". It \"is now a given; it is true\", the Washington Post declared in 1986, \"the Sandinistas are communists of the Cuban or Soviet school\"; that \"The Reagan administration is right to take Nicaragua as a serious menace\u2014to civil peace and democracy in Nicaragua and to the stability and security of the region\"; that we must \"fit Nicaragua back into a Central American mode\" and \"turn Nicaragua back toward democracy\", and with the \"Latin American democracies\" \"demand reasonable conduct by regional standard.\"\nSoon after the embargo was established, Managua re-declared \"a policy of nonalignment\" and sought the aid of Western Europe, who were opposed to U.S. policy, to escape dependency on the Soviet Union. Since 1981 U.S. pressures had curtailed Western credit to and trade with Nicaragua, forcing the government to rely almost totally on the Eastern bloc for credit, other aid, and trade by 1985. In his 1997 study on U.S. low intensity warfare, Kermit D. Johnson, a former Chief of the U.S. Army Chaplains, contends that U.S. hostility toward the revolutionary government was motivated not by any concern for \"national security\", but rather by what the world relief organization Oxfam termed \"the threat of a good example\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was alarming that in just a few months after the Sandinista revolution, Nicaragua received international acclaim for its rapid progress in the fields of literacy and health. It was alarming that a socialist-mixed-economy state could do in a few short months what the Somoza dynasty, a U.S. client state, could not do in 45 years! It was truly alarming that the Sandinistas were intent on providing the very services that establish a government's political and moral legitimacy.&lt;\nThe government's program included increased wages, subsidized food prices, and expanded health, welfare, and education services. And though it nationalized Somoza's former properties, it preserved a private sector that accounted for between 50 and 60 percent of GDP.\nAtrocities.\nThe United States began to support Contra activities against the Sandinista government by December 1981, with the CIA at the forefront of operations. The CIA supplied the funds and the equipment, coordinated training programs, and provided intelligence and target lists. While the Contras had little military successes, they did prove adept at carrying out CIA guerrilla warfare strategies from training manuals which advised them to incite mob violence, \"neutralize\" civilian leaders and government officials and attack \"soft targets\"\u2014including schools, health clinics and cooperatives. The agency added to the Contras' sabotage efforts by blowing up refineries and pipelines, and mining ports. Finally, according to former Contra leader Edgar Chamorro, CIA trainers also gave Contra soldiers large knives. \"A commando knife [was given], and our people, everybody wanted to have a knife like that, to kill people, to cut their throats\".11:34 In 1985 \"Newsweek\" published a series of photos taken by Frank Wohl, a conservative student admirer traveling with the Contras, entitled \"Execution in the Jungle\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe CIA officer in charge of the covert war, Duane \"Dewey\" Clarridge, admitted to the House Intelligence Committee staff in a secret briefing in 1984 that the Contras were routinely murdering \"civilians and Sandinista officials in the provinces, as well as heads of cooperatives, nurses, doctors and judges\". But he claimed that this did not violate President Reagan's executive order prohibiting assassinations because the agency defined it as just 'killing'. \"After all, this is war\u2014a paramilitary operation\", Clarridge said in conclusion. Edgar Chamorro explained the rationale behind this to a U.S. reporter. \"Sometimes terror is very productive. This is the policy, to keep putting pressure until the people cry 'uncle'\".1:50 The CIA manual for the Contras, \"Tayacan\", states that the Contras should gather the local population for a public tribunal to \"shame, ridicule and humiliate\" Sandinista officials to \"reduce their influence\". It also recommends gathering the local population to witness and take part in public executions.179 These types of activities continued throughout the war.\nIn April 1987, an American aid worker named Benjamin Linder was killed by Contras. After the signing of the Central American Peace Accord in August 1987, the year war related deaths and economic destruction reached its peak, the Contras eventually entered negotiations with the Sandinista government (1988), and the war began to deescalate.\nBy 1989 the U.S.-backed Contra war and economic isolation had inflicted severe economic suffering on Nicaraguans. The U.S. government knew that the Nicaraguans had been exhausted from the war, which had cost 30,865 lives, and that voters usually vote the incumbents out during economic decline. By the late 1980s Nicaragua's internal conditions had changed so radically that the U.S. approach to the 1990 elections differed greatly from 1984. A united opposition of 14 political parties organized into the National Opposition Union (Uni\u00f3n Nacional Oppositora, UNO) with the support of the United States National Endowment for Democracy. UNO presidential nominee Violeta Chamorro was received by President George H. W. Bush at the White House.\nThe Contra war escalated over the year before the election. The U.S. promised to end the economic embargo should Chamorro win.\nThe UNO scored a decisive victory on 25 February 1990. Chamorro won with 55 percent of the presidential vote as compared to Daniel Ortega's 41 percent. Of 92 seats in the National Assembly, UNO gained 51, and the FSLN won 39. On 25 April 1990, Chamorro assumed presidency from Ortega.\nIllegal covert operations.\nWith Congress blocking further aid to the Contras, the Reagan administration sought to arrange funding and military supplies by means of third countries and private sources. Between 1984 and 1986, $34 million from third countries and $2.7 million from private sources were raised this way. The secret Contra assistance was run by the National Security Council, with officer Lt. Col. Oliver North in charge. With the third-party funds, North created an organization called \"The Enterprise\", which served as the secret arm of the NSC staff and had its own airplanes, pilots, airfield, ship, operatives, and secret Swiss bank accounts. It also received assistance from personnel from other government agencies, especially from CIA personnel in Central America. This operation functioned, however, without any of the accountability required of U.S. government activities. The Enterprise's efforts culminated in the Iran\u2013Contra Affair of 1986\u20131987, which facilitated contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to Iran.\nAccording to the London Spectator, U.S. journalists in Central America had long known that the CIA was flying in supplies to the Contras inside Nicaragua before the scandal broke. No journalist paid it any attention until the alleged CIA supply man, Eugene Hasenfus, was shot down and captured by the Nicaraguan army. Similarly, reporters neglected to investigate many leads indicating that Oliver North was running the Contra operation from his office in the National Security Council.\nAccording to the National Security Archive, Oliver North had been in contact with Manuel Noriega, the military leader of Panama later convicted on drug charges, whom he personally met. The issue of drug money and its importance in funding the Nicaraguan conflict was the subject of various reports and publications. The contras were funded by drug trafficking, of which the United States was aware. Senator John Kerry's 1988 Committee on Foreign Relations report on Contra drug links concluded that \"senior U.S. policy makers were not immune to the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the Contras' funding problems\".\nThe Reagan administration's support for the Contras continued to stir controversy well into the 1990s. In August 1996, \"San Jose Mercury News\" reporter Gary Webb published a series titled \"Dark Alliance\", alleging that the Contras contributed to the rise of crack cocaine in California.\nGary Webb's career as a journalist was subsequently discredited by the leading U.S. papers, \"The New York Times\", the \"Washington Post\", and the \"Los Angeles Times\". An internal CIA report, entitled, \"Managing a Nightmare\", shows the agency used \"a ground base of already productive relations with journalists\" to help counter what it called \"a genuine public relations crisis.\" In the 1980s, Douglas Farah worked as a journalist, covering the civil wars in Central America for the \"Washington Post\". According to Farah, while it was common knowledge that the Contras were involved in cocaine trafficking, the editors of the \"Washington Post\" refused to take it seriously:\nIf you're talking about our intelligence community tolerating \u2014 if not promoting \u2014 drugs to pay for black ops, it's rather an uncomfortable thing to do when you're an establishment paper like the Post. If you were going to be directly rubbing up against the government, they wanted it more solid than it could probably ever be done.\nAn investigation by the United States Department of Justice also stated that their \"review did not substantiate the main allegations stated and implied in the \"Mercury News\" articles.\" Regarding the specific charges towards the CIA, the DOJ wrote \"the implication that the drug trafficking by the individuals discussed in the \"Mercury News\" articles was connected to the CIA was also not supported by the facts.\" The CIA also investigated and rejected the allegations.\nPropaganda.\nDuring the time the U.S. Congress blocked funding for the contras, the Reagan government engaged in a campaign to alter public opinion and change the vote in Congress on contra aid. For this purpose, the NSC established an interagency working group, which in turn coordinated the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the Caribbean (managed by Otto Reich), which conducted the campaign. The S/LPD produced and widely disseminated a variety of pro-contra publications, arranged speeches and press conferences. It also disseminated \"white propaganda\"\u2014pro-Contra newspaper articles by paid consultants who did not disclose their connection to the Reagan administration.\nOn top of that, Oliver North helped Carl Channell's tax-exempt organization, the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty, to raise $10 million, by arranging numerous briefings for groups of potential contributors at the premises of the White House and by facilitating private visits and photo sessions with President Reagan for major contributors. Channell in turn, used part of that money to run a series of television advertisements directed at home districts of Congressmen considered swing votes on Contra aid. Out of the $10 million raised, more than $1 million was spent on pro-Contra publicity.\nInternational Court of Justice ruling.\nIn 1984 the Sandinista government filed a suit in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against the United States (\"Nicaragua v. United States\"), which resulted in a 1986 judgment against the United States. The ICJ held that the U.S. had violated international law as well as a 1956 treaty by supporting the contras in their rebellion against the Nicaraguan government and by mining Nicaragua's harbors. Regarding the alleged human rights violations by the contras, however, the ICJ took the view that the United States could be held accountable for them only if it would have been proven that the U.S. had effective control of the Contra operations resulting in these alleged violations. Nevertheless, the ICJ found that the U.S. encouraged acts contrary to general principles of humanitarian law by producing the manual \"Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare (Operaciones sicol\u00f3gicas en guerra de guerrillas\") and disseminating it to the contras. The manual, amongst other things, advised on how to rationalize killings of civilians and recommended to hire professional killers for specific selective tasks.\nThe United States, which did not participate in the merits phase of the proceedings, maintained that the ICJ's power did not supersede the Constitution of the United States and argued that the court did not seriously consider the Nicaraguan role in El Salvador, while it accused Nicaragua of actively supporting armed groups there, specifically in the form of supply of arms. The ICJ had found that evidence of a responsibility of the Nicaraguan government in this matter was insufficient. The U.S. argument was affirmed, however, by the dissenting opinion of ICJ member U.S. Judge Schwebel, who concluded that in supporting the Contras, the United States acted lawfully in collective self-defence in El Salvador's support. The U.S. blocked enforcement of the ICJ judgment by the United Nations Security Council and thereby prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any actual compensation. The Nicaraguan government finally withdrew the complaint from the court in September 1992 (under the later, post-FSLN, government of Violeta Chamorro), following a repeal of the law requiring the country to seek compensation.\nHuman rights violations.\nAmericas Watch, which subsequently became part of Human Rights Watch, accused the Contras of:\nHuman Rights Watch released a report on the situation in 1989, which stated: \"[The] contras were major and systematic violators of the most basic standards of the laws of armed conflict, including by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians, selectively murdering non-combatants, and mistreating prisoners.\"\nIn his affidavit to the World Court, former contra Edgar Chamorro testified that \"The CIA did not discourage such tactics. To the contrary, the Agency severely criticized me when I admitted to the press that the FDN had regularly kidnapped and executed agrarian reform workers and civilians. We were told that the only way to defeat the Sandinistas was to\u00a0...kill, kidnap, rob and torture\".\nContra leader Adolfo Calero denied that his forces deliberately targeted civilians: \"What they call a cooperative is also a troop concentration full of armed people. We are not killing civilians. We are fighting armed people and returning fire when fire is directed at us.\"\nControversy.\nSeveral articles were published by U.S. press, including by \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"The New Republic\", accusing Americas Watch and other bodies of ideological bias and unreliable reporting. The articles alleged that Americas Watch gave too much credence to alleged Contra abuses and systematically tried to discredit Nicaraguan human rights groups such as the Permanent Commission on Human Rights, which blamed the most human rights abuses on the Sandinistas.\nIn 1985, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Three weeks ago, Americas Watch issued a report on human rights abuses in Nicaragua. One member of the Permanent Commission for Human Rights commented on the Americas Watch report and its chief investigator Juan Mendez: \"The Sandinistas are laying the groundwork for a totalitarian society here and yet all Mendez wanted to hear about were abuses by the contras. How can we get people in the U.S. to see what's happening here when so many of the groups who come down are pro-Sandinista?\"\nHuman Rights Watch, the umbrella organization of Americas Watch, replied to these allegations: \"Almost invariably, U.S. pronouncements on human rights exaggerated and distorted the real human rights violations of the Sandinista regime, and exculpated those of the U.S.-supported insurgents, known as the contras\u00a0... The Bush administration is responsible for these abuses, not only because the contras are, for all practical purposes, a U.S. force, but also because the Bush administration has continued to minimize and deny these violations, and has refused to investigate them seriously.\"\nMilitary successes and election of Violeta Chamorro.\nBy 1986 the Contras were besieged by charges of corruption, human-rights abuses, and military ineptitude. A much-vaunted early 1986 offensive never materialized, and Contra forces were largely reduced to isolated acts of terrorism. In October 1987, however, the contras staged a successful attack in southern Nicaragua. Then on 21 December 1987, the FDN launched attacks at Bonanza, Siuna, and Rosita in Zelaya province, resulting in heavy fighting. ARDE Frente Sur attacked at El Almendro and along the Rama road. These large-scale raids mainly became possible as the contras were able to use U.S.-provided Redeye missiles against Sandinista Mi-24 helicopter gunships, which had been supplied by the Soviets. Nevertheless, the Contras remained tenuously encamped within Honduras and were not able to hold Nicaraguan territory.\nThere were isolated protests among the population against the draft implemented by the Sandinista government, which even resulted in full-blown street clashes in Masaya in 1988. However, a June 1988 survey in Managua showed the Sandinista government still enjoyed strong support but that support had declined since 1984. Three times as many people identified with the Sandinistas (28%) than with all the opposition parties put together (9%); 59% did not identify with any political party. Of those polled, 85% opposed any further US aid to the Contras; 40% believed the Sandinista government to be democratic, while 48% believed it to be not democratic. People identified the war as the largest problem but were less likely to blame it for economic problems compared to a December 1986 poll; 19% blamed the war and US blockade as the main cause of economic problems while 10% blamed the government. Political opposition groups were splintered and the Contras began to experience defections, although United States aid maintained them as a viable military force.\nAfter a cutoff in U.S. military support, and with both sides facing international pressure to bring an end to the conflict, the contras agreed to negotiations with the FSLN. With the help of five Central American presidents, including Ortega, the sides agreed that a voluntary demobilization of the contras should start in early December 1989. They chose this date to facilitate free and fair elections in Nicaragua in February 1990 (even though the Reagan administration had pushed for a delay of contra disbandment).\nIn the resulting February 1990 elections, Violeta Chamorro and her party the UNO won an upset victory of 55% to 41% over Daniel Ortega. Opinion polls leading up to the elections divided along partisan lines, with 10 of 17 polls analyzed in a contemporary study predicting an UNO victory while seven predicted the Sandinistas would retain power.\nPossible explanations include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless Violeta Chamorro won. Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the Contras, with a Canadian observer mission claiming that 42 people were killed by the Contras in \"election violence\" in October 1989. Sandinistas were also accused of intimidation and abuses during the election campaign. According to the Puebla Institute, by mid-December 1989, seven opposition leaders had been murdered, 12 had disappeared, 20 had been arrested, and 30 others assaulted. In late January 1990, the OAS observer team reported that \"a convoy of troops attacked four truckloads of UNO sympathizers with bayonets and rifle butts, threatening to kill them.\" This led many commentators to conclude that Nicaraguans voted against the Sandinistas out of fear of a continuation of the Contra war and economic deprivation.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for leading one of the first draft sequences of the human genome and led the first team to transfect a cell with a synthetic chromosome. Venter founded Celera Genomics, the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). He was the co-founder of Human Longevity Inc. and Synthetic Genomics. He was listed on \"Time\" magazine's 2007 and 2008 \"Time\" 100 list of the most influential people in the world. In 2010, the British magazine \"New Statesman\" listed Craig Venter at 14th in the list of \"The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010\". In 2012, Venter was honored with the Dan David Prize for his contribution to genome research. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2013. He is a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's advisory board.\nEarly life and education.\nJohn Craig Venter was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, the son of Elisabeth and John Venter. His family moved to Millbrae, California during his childhood. In his youth, he did not take his education seriously, preferring to spend his time on the water in boats or surfing. According to his biography, \"A Life Decoded\", he was said never to be a terribly engaged student, having Cs and Ds on his eighth-grade report cards. Venter considered that his behavior in his adolescence was indicative of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and later found ADHD-linked genetic variants in his own DNA. He graduated from Mills High School. His father died suddenly at age 59 from cardiac arrest, giving him a lifelong awareness of his own mortality. He quotes a saying: \"If you want immortality, do something meaningful with your life.\"\nAlthough he opposed the Vietnam War, Venter was drafted and enlisted in the United States Navy where he worked as a hospital corpsman in the intensive-care ward of a field hospital. He served from 1967 to 1968 at the Naval Support Activity Danang in Vietnam. While in Vietnam, he attempted suicide by swimming out to sea, but changed his mind more than a mile out.\nBeing confronted with severely injured and dying marines on a daily basis instilled in him a desire to study medicine, although he later switched to biomedical research.\nVenter began his college education in 1969 at a community college, College of San Mateo in California, and later transferred to the University of California, San Diego, where he studied under biochemist Nathan O. Kaplan. He received a Bachelor of Science in biochemistry in 1972 and a Doctor of Philosophy in physiology and pharmacology in 1975 from UCSD.\nCareer.\nAfter working as an associate professor, and later as full professor, at the State University of New York at Buffalo, he joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1984.\nEST controversy.\nWhile an employee of the NIH, Venter learned how to identify mRNA and began to learn more about those expressed in the human brain. The short cDNA sequence fragments Venter discovered by automated DNA sequencing, he named expressed sequence tags, or ESTs. The NIH Office of Technology Transfer decided to file a patent on the ESTs discovered by Venter, patenting the genes identified based on studies of mRNA expression in the human brain. When Venter disclosed the NIH strategy during a Congressional hearing, a firestorm of controversy erupted. The NIH later stopped the effort and abandoned the patent applications it had filed, following public outcry.\nHuman Genome Project.\nVenter was passionate about the power of genomics to transform healthcare radically. Venter believed that whole genome shotgun sequencing was the fastest and most effective way to get useful human genome data. However, the method was rejected by the Human Genome Project, since some geneticists felt it would not be accurate enough for a genome as complicated as that of humans, that it would be logistically more difficult, and that it would cost significantly more.\nVenter viewed the slow pace of progress in the Human Genome Project as an opportunity to continue his interest in trying his shotgun sequencing method to speed up human genome sequencing, so he sought funding from the private sector to start Celera Genomics. The company planned to profit from their work by creating genomic data to which users could subscribe for a fee. The goal consequently put pressure on the public genome program and spurred several groups to redouble their efforts to produce the full sequence. Venter's effort won him renown as he and his team at Celera Corporation shared credit for sequencing the first draft human genome with the publicly funded Human Genome Project.\nIn 2000, Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Public Genome Project jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome, a full three years ahead of the expected end of the Public Genome Program. The announcement was made along with U.S. President Bill Clinton, and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. Venter and Collins thus shared an award for \"Biography of the Year\" from A&amp;E Network.\nOn February 15, 2001, the Human Genome Project consortium published the first Human Genome in the journal \"Nature\", followed one day later by a Celera publication in \"Science\". Despite some claims that shotgun sequencing was in some ways less accurate than the clone-by-clone method chosen by the Human Genome Project, the technique became widely accepted by the scientific community.\nVenter was fired by Celera in early 2002. According to his biography, Venter was fired because of a conflict with the main investor, Tony White, specifically barring him from attending the White House ceremony celebrating the achievement of sequencing the human genome.\nGlobal Ocean Sampling Expedition.\nThe Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS) is an ocean exploration genome project with the goal of assessing the genetic diversity in marine microbial communities and to understand their role in nature's fundamental processes. Begun as a Sargasso Sea pilot sampling project in August 2003, the full Expedition was announced by Venter on March 4, 2004. The project, which used Venter's personal yacht, \"Sorcerer II\", started in Halifax, Canada, circumnavigated the globe and returned to the U.S. in January 2006.\nSynthetic Genomics.\nIn June 2005, Venter co-founded Synthetic Genomics, a firm dedicated to using modified microorganisms to produce clean fuels and biochemicals. In July 2009, ExxonMobil announced a $600 million collaboration with Synthetic Genomics to research and develop next-generation biofuels. \nVenter continues to work on the creation of engineered diatomic microalgae for the production of biofuels.\nVenter is seeking to patent the first partially synthetic species possibly to be named \"Mycoplasma laboratorium\". There is speculation that this line of research could lead to producing bacteria that have been engineered to perform specific reactions, for example, produce fuels, make medicines, combat global warming, and so on.\nIn May 2010, a team of scientists led by Venter became the first to create successfully what was described as \"synthetic life\". This was done by synthesizing a very long DNA molecule containing an entire bacterium genome, and introducing this into another cell, analogous to the accomplishment of Eckard Wimmer's group, who synthesized and ligated an RNA virus genome and \"booted\" it in cell lysate. The single-celled organism contains four \"watermarks\"\nwritten into its DNA to identify it as synthetic and to help trace its descendants. The watermarks include \nOn March 25, 2016, Venter reported the creation of Syn 3.0, a synthetic genome having the fewest genes of any freely living organism (473 genes). Their aim was to strip away all nonessential genes, leaving only the minimal set necessary to support life.\nThis stripped-down, fast reproducing cell is expected to be a valuable tool for researchers in the field.\nIn August 2018, Venter retired as chairman of the board, saying he wanted to focus on his work at the J. Craig Venter Institute. He will remain as a scientific advisor to the board.\nJ. Craig Venter Institute.\nIn 2006 Venter founded the J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI), a nonprofit which conducts research in synthetic biology. It has facilities in La Jolla and in Rockville, Maryland and employs over 200 people.\nIn April 2022 Venter sold the La Jolla JCVI facility to the University of California, San Diego for $25 million. Venter will continue to lead a separate nonprofit research group, also known as the J. Craig Venter Institute, and stressed that he is not retiring. The Venter Institute has out grown its current building with multiple new facility hires and will be moving into new space in 2025.\nIndividual human genome.\nOn September 4, 2007, a team led by Sam Levy published one of the first genomes of an individual human\u2014Venter's own DNA sequence. Some of the sequences in Venter's genome are associated with wet earwax, increased risk of antisocial behavior, Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases. \nThe Human Reference Genome Browser is a web application for the navigation and analysis of Venter's recently published genome. The HuRef database consists of approximately 32 million DNA reads sequenced using microfluidic Sanger sequencing, assembled into 4,528 scaffolds and 4.1 million DNA variations identified by genome analysis. These variants include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), block substitutions, short and large indels, and structural variations like insertions, deletions, inversions and copy number changes.\nThe browser enables scientists to navigate the HuRef genome assembly and sequence variations, and to compare it with the NCBI human build 36 assembly in the context of the NCBI and Ensembl annotations. The browser provides a comparative view between NCBI and HuRef consensus sequences, the sequence multi-alignment of the HuRef assembly, Ensembl and dbSNP annotations, HuRef variants, and the underlying variant evidence and functional analysis. The interface also represents the haplotype blocks from which diploid genome sequence can be inferred and the relation of variants to gene annotations. The display of variants and gene annotations are linked to external public resources including dbSNP, Ensembl, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Gene Ontology (GO).\nUsers can search the HuRef genome using HUGO gene names, Ensembl and dbSNP identifiers, HuRef contig or scaffold locations, or NCBI chromosome locations. Users can then easily and quickly browse any genomic region via the simple and intuitive pan and zoom controls; furthermore, data relevant to specific loci can be exported for further analysis.\nHuman Longevity, Inc..\nOn March 4, 2014, Venter and co-founders Peter Diamandis and Robert Hariri announced the formation of Human Longevity, Inc., a company focused on extending the healthy, \"high performance\" human lifespan. At the time of the announcement the company had already raised $70\u00a0million in venture financing, which was expected to last 18\u00a0months. Venter served as the chairman and chief executive officer\u00a0(CEO) until May 2018, when he retired. The company said that it plans to sequence 40,000 genomes per year, with an initial focus on cancer genomes and the genomes of cancer patients.\nHuman Longevity filed a lawsuit in 2018 against Venter, accusing him of stealing trade secrets. Allegations were made stating that Venter had departed with his company computer that contained valuable information that could be used to start a competing business. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by a California judge on the basis that Human Longevity were unable to present a case that met the legal threshold required for a company, or individual, to sue when its trade secrets have been stolen.\nHuman Longevity's mission is to extend healthy human lifespan by the use of high-resolution big data diagnostics from genomics, metabolomics, microbiomics, and proteomics, and the use of stem cell therapy.\nPublished books.\nVenter is the author of three books, the first of which is an autobiography titled \"A Life Decoded\". In Venter's second book, \"Life at the Speed of Light\", he announced his theory that this is the generation in which there appears to be a dovetailing of the two previously diverse fields of science represented by computer programming and the genetic programming of life by DNA sequencing. He was applauded for his position on this by futurist Ray Kurzweil. Venter's most recent book, co-authored by David Ewing Duncan, \"The Voyage of Sorcerer II: The Expedition that Unlocked the Secrets of the Ocean's Microbiome\", details the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition, spanning a 15-year period during which microbes from the world's oceans were collected and their DNA sequenced.\nPersonal life.\nAfter a 12-year marriage to Barbara Rae-Venter, with whom he had a son, Christopher, he married Claire M. Fraser remaining married to her until 2005. In late 2008 he married Heather Kowalski. They live in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, CA. Venter is an atheist.\nVenter was 75 when he sold his main research building to UCSD in 2022. The institute had out grown the space and will be moving to a new facility in 2025. The Venter Institute campus in Rockville MD also continues to expand. He said he has no intention of retiring. He has a home in La Jolla and a ranch in Borrego Springs, California, as well as homes in two small towns in Maine. He indulges in two passions: sailing and flying a Cirrus 22T plane, which he calls \"the ultimate freedom\".\nIn popular culture.\nVenter has been the subject of articles in several magazines, including \"Wired\", \"The Economist\", Australian science magazine \"Cosmos\", and \"The Atlantic\".\nVenter appears in the two-hour 2001 \"NOVA\" special, \"Cracking the code of life\".\nOn May 16, 2004, Venter gave the commencement speech at Boston University.\nOn December 4, 2007, Venter gave the Dimbleby lecture for the BBC in London.\nVenter gave the Distinguished Public Lecture during the 2007 Michaelmas Term at the James Martin 21st Century School at Oxford University. Its title was \"Genomics \u2013 From humans to the environment\".\nVenter delivered the 2008 convocation speech for Faculty of Science honours and specialization students at the University of Alberta.\nIn February 2008, he gave a speech about his current work at the TED conference.\nVenter was featured in \"Time\" magazine's \"The Top 10 Everything of 2008\" article. Number three in 2008's Top 10 Scientific Discoveries was a piece outlining his work stitching together the 582,000 base pairs necessary to invent the genetic information for a whole new bacterium.\nOn May 20, 2010, Venter announced the creation of first self-replicating semi-synthetic bacterial cell.\nIn the June 2011 issue of \"Men's Journal\", Venter was featured as the \"Survival Skills\" celebrity of the month. He shared various anecdotes and advice, including stories of his time in Vietnam, as well as mentioning a bout with melanoma on his back, which subsequently resulted in his \"giving a pound of flesh\" to surgery.\nIn May 2011, Venter was the commencement speaker at the 157th commencement of Syracuse University.\nIn May 2017, Venter was the guest of honor and keynote speaker at the inauguration ceremony of the Center for Systems Biology Dresden.\nWorks.\nVenter has authored over 200 publications in scientific journals.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7554", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7554", "title": "Carl Rogers", "text": "American psychologist (1902\u20131987)\nCarl Ransom Rogers (January 8, 1902 \u2013 February 4, 1987) was an American psychologist who was one of the founders of humanistic psychology and was known especially for his person-centered psychotherapy. Rogers is widely considered one of the founding fathers of psychotherapy research and was honored for his research with the Award for Distinguished Scientific Contributions by the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1956.\nThe person-centered approach, Rogers's approach to understanding personality and human relationships, found wide application in various domains, such as psychotherapy and counseling (client-centered therapy), education (student-centered learning), organizations, and other group settings. For his professional work he received the Award for Distinguished Professional Contributions to Psychology from the APA in 1972. In a study by Steven J. Haggbloom and colleagues using six criteria such as citations and recognition, Rogers was found to be the sixth most eminent psychologist of the 20th century and second, among clinical psychologists, only to Sigmund Freud. Based on a 1982 survey of 422 respondents of U.S. and Canadian psychologists, he was considered the most influential psychotherapist in history (Freud ranked third).\nBiography.\nRogers was born on January 8, 1902, in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. His father, Walter A. Rogers, was a civil engineer and a Congregationalist by religious denomination. His mother, Julia M. Cushing, was a homemaker and devout Baptist. Carl was the fourth of their six children.\nRogers could read well before kindergarten. After being raised in a strict religious environment as an altar boy at the vicarage of Jimpley, he became isolated, independent, and disciplined, gaining knowledge and an appreciation for the scientific method in a practical world. At the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, he joined the fraternity Alpha Kappa Lambda and initially planned to study agriculture before switching to history and finally settling on religion.\nAt age 20, following his 1922 trip to Beijing, China, for an international Christian conference, Rogers started to doubt his religious convictions. To help him clarify his career choice, he attended a seminar entitled \"Why Am I Entering the Ministry?\" after which he decided to change careers. In 1924, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin, married fellow Wisconsin student and Oak Park resident Helen Elliott, and enrolled at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Sometime later, he reportedly became an atheist. Although referred to as an atheist early in his career, Rogers was eventually described as an agnostic. He reportedly spoke about spirituality quite often in his later years. Brian Thorne, who knew and collaborated with Rogers throughout the latter's final decade of life, writes: \"In his later years his openness to experience compelled him to acknowledge the existence of a dimension to which he attached such adjectives as mystical, spiritual, and transcendental\". Rogers concluded that there is a realm \"beyond\" scientific psychology\u2014a realm he came to prize as \"the indescribable, the spiritual.\"\nAfter two years at Union, Rogers left to attend Teachers College, Columbia University, obtaining an M.A. in 1927 and a Ph.D. in 1931. While completing his doctoral work, he engaged in scientific studies of children. As an intern in 1927\u20131928 at the now-defunct Institute for Child Guidance in New York, Rogers studied with psychologist Alfred Adler. Later in life, Rogers recalled: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Accustomed as I was to the rather rigid Freudian approach of the Institute\u2014seventy-five-page case histories, and exhaustive batteries of tests before even thinking of \"treating\" a child\u2014I was shocked by Dr. Adler's very direct and deceptively simple manner of immediately relating to the child and the parent. It took me some time to realize how much I had learned from him. In 1930, Rogers served as director of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in Rochester, New York. From 1935 to 1940, he lectured at the University of Rochester and wrote \"The Clinical Treatment of the Problem Child\" (1939), based on his experience in working with troubled children. He was strongly influenced in constructing his client-centered approach by the post-Freudian psychotherapeutic practice of Otto Rank, especially as embodied in the work of Rank's disciple: noted clinician and social work educator Jessie Taft. In 1940, Rogers became professor of clinical psychology at Ohio State University, where he wrote his second book, \"Counseling and Psychotherapy\" (1942). In it, Rogers suggests that by establishing a relationship with an understanding, accepting therapist, a client can resolve difficulties and gain the insight necessary to restructure their life.\nIn 1945, Rogers was invited to set up a counseling center at the University of Chicago. While a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago (1945\u20131957), Rogers helped establish a counseling center connected with the university and conducted studies to determine his methods' effectiveness. His findings and theories appeared in \"Client-Centered Therapy\" (1951) and \"Psychotherapy and Personality Change\" (1954). One of his graduate students at the University of Chicago, Thomas Gordon, established the Parent Effectiveness Training movement. Another student, Eugene T. Gendlin, who was getting his Ph.D. in philosophy, developed the psychotherapeutic method of focusing based on Rogerian listening.\nIn 1947, he was elected president of the American Psychological Association. In 1956, Rogers became the first president of the American Academy of Psychotherapists. He taught psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1957\u20131963). During this time, he wrote one of his best-known books, \"On Becoming a Person\" (1961). A student of his there, Marshall Rosenberg, went on to develop Nonviolent Communication. Rogers and Abraham Maslow pioneered a movement called humanistic psychology, which reached its peak in the 1960s. In 1961, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Rogers was also one of the people who questioned the rise of McCarthyism in the 1950s. In articles, he criticized society for its backward-looking affinities.\nRogers continued teaching at the University of Wisconsin until 1963 when he became a resident at the new Western Behavioral Sciences Institute (WBSI) in La Jolla, California. Rogers left the WBSI to help found the Center for Studies of the Person in 1968. His later books include \"Carl Rogers on Personal Power\" (1977) and \"Freedom to Learn for the '80s\" (1983). He remained a La Jolla resident for the rest of his life, doing therapy, giving speeches, and writing.\nIn his later years, Rogers focused on applying his theories to address political oppression and social conflict globally. He facilitated dialogue between Protestants and Catholics in Belfast, Blacks and Whites in South Africa, and people transitioning to democracy in Brazil. In the U.S., he worked with health consumers and providers. At 85, his final trip was to the Soviet Union, where he conducted workshops that promoted communication and creativity, impressed by the awareness of his work among Russians.\nBetween 1974 and 1984, Rogers, his daughter Natalie Rogers, and psychologists Maria Bowen, Maureen O'Hara, and John K. Wood convened a series of residential programs in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, and Japan: the Person-Centered Approach Workshops. The workshops focused on cross-cultural communications, personal growth, self-empowerment, and learning for social change.\nIn 1987, Rogers suffered a fall that resulted in a fractured pelvis; he had life alert and was able to contact paramedics. He had a successful operation, but his pancreas failed the next night, and he died a few days later after a heart attack.\nTheory.\nRogers's theory of the self is considered humanistic, existential, and phenomenological. It is based directly on the \"phenomenal field\" personality theory of Combs and Snygg (1949). Rogers's elaboration of his theory is extensive. He wrote 16 books and many more journal articles about it. Prochaska and Norcross (2003) states Rogers \"consistently stood for an empirical evaluation of psychotherapy. He and his followers have demonstrated a humanistic approach to conducting therapy and a scientific approach to evaluating therapy need not be incompatible.\"\nNineteen propositions.\nRogers's theory (as of 1951) was based on 19 propositions:\nIn relation to No. 17, Rogers is known for practicing \"unconditional positive regard\", which is defined as accepting a person \"without negative judgment of ... [a person's] basic worth\".\nDevelopment of the personality.\nWith regard to development, Rogers described principles rather than stages. The main issue is the development of a self-concept and the progress from an undifferentiated self to being fully differentiated.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Self Concept ... the organized consistent conceptual gestalt composed of perceptions of the characteristics of 'I' or 'me' and the perceptions of the relationships of the 'I' or 'me' to others and to various aspects of life, together with the values attached to these perceptions. It is a gestalt which is available to awareness though not necessarily in awareness. It is a fluid and changing gestalt, a process, but at any given moment it is a specific entity. (Rogers, 1959)\nIn the development of the self-concept, he saw conditional and unconditional positive regard as key. Those raised in an environment of unconditional positive regard have the opportunity to fully actualize themselves. Those raised in an environment of conditional positive regard feel worthy only if they match conditions (what Rogers describes as \"conditions of worth\") that others have laid down for them.\nFully functioning person.\nOptimal development, as referred to in proposition 14, results in a certain process rather than static state. Rogers calls this \"the good life\", where the organism continually aims to fulfill its potential. He listed the characteristics of a fully functioning person (Rogers 1961):\nIncongruity.\nRogers identified the \"real self\" as the aspect of a person that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic values and needs, and receives positive regard from others and self. On the other hand, to the extent that society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency and people are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, receiving only conditional positive regard and self-regard, Rogers said that people develop instead an \"ideal self\". By \"ideal\", he was suggesting something not real, something always out of reach, a standard people cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the \"I am\" and the \"I should\", Rogers called \"incongruity\".\nPsychopathology.\nRogers described the concepts of \"congruence\" and \"incongruence\" as important in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency. At the same time, he recognized the need for \"positive regard\". In a fully congruent person, realizing their potential is not at the expense of experiencing positive regard. They are able to lead authentic and genuine lives. Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falsity and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by those around them make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with others' approval. They live lives that are not true to themselves.\nRogers suggested that the incongruent individual, who is always on the defensive and cannot be open to all experiences, is not functioning ideally and may even be malfunctioning. They work hard at maintaining and protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic, this is difficult, and they are under constant threat. They deploy \"defense mechanisms\" to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: \"distortion\" and \"denial\". Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept. This defensive behavior reduces the consciousness of the threat but not the threat itself. And so, as the threats mount, the work of protecting the self-concept becomes more difficult and the individual becomes more defensive and rigid in their self-structure. If the incongruity is immoderate this process may lead the individual to a state that would typically be described as neurotic. Their functioning becomes precarious and psychologically vulnerable. If the situation worsens it is possible that the defenses cease to function altogether and the individual becomes aware of the incongruity of their situation. Their personality becomes disorganised and bizarre; irrational behavior, associated with earlier denied aspects of self, may erupt uncontrollably.\nApplications.\nPerson-centered therapy.\nRogers originally developed his theory as the foundation for a system of therapy. He initially called it \"non-directive therapy\" but later replaced the term \"non-directive\" with \"client-centered\", and still later \"person-centered\". Even before the publication of \"Client-Centered Therapy\" in 1951, Rogers believed the principles he was describing could be applied in a variety of contexts, not just in therapy. As a result, he started to use the term \"person-centered approach\" to describe his overall theory. Person-centered therapy is the application of the person-centered approach to therapy. Other applications include a theory of personality, interpersonal relations, education, nursing, cross-cultural relations and other \"helping\" professions and situations. In 1946 Rogers co-authored \"Counseling with Returned Servicemen\" with John L. Wallen (the creator of the behavioral model known as \"The Interpersonal Gap\"), documenting the application of a person-centered approach to counseling military personnel returning from World War II.\nThe first empirical evidence of the client-centered approach's effectiveness was published in 1941 at the Ohio State University by Elias Porter, using the recordings of therapeutic sessions between Rogers and his clients. Porter used Rogers's transcripts to devise a system to measure the degree of directiveness or non-directiveness a counselor employed. The counselor's attitude and orientation were shown to be instrumental in the decisions the client made.\nLearner-centered teaching.\nThe application to education has a large robust research tradition similar to that of therapy, with studies having begun in the late 1930s and continuing today (Cornelius-White, 2007). Rogers described the approach to education in \"Client-Centered Therapy\" and wrote \"Freedom to Learn\" devoted exclusively to the subject in 1969. \"Freedom to Learn\" was revised twice. The new Learner-Centered Model is similar in many regards to this classical person-centered approach to education.\nBefore Rogers's death, he and Harold Lyon began a book, \"On Becoming an Effective Teacher\u2014Person-centered Teaching, Psychology, Philosophy, and Dialogues with Carl R. Rogers and Harold Lyon\", that Lyon and Reinhard Tausch completed and published in 2013. It contains Rogers's last unpublished writings on person-centered teaching. Rogers had the following five hypotheses regarding learner-centered education:\nRogerian rhetorical approach.\nIn 1970, Richard Young, Alton L. Becker, and Kenneth Pike published \"Rhetoric: Discovery and Change\", a widely influential college writing textbook that used a Rogerian approach to communication to revise the traditional Aristotelian framework for rhetoric. The Rogerian method of argument involves each side restating the other's position to the satisfaction of the other, among other principles. In a paper, it can be expressed by carefully acknowledging and understanding the opposition, rather than dismissing them.\nCross-cultural relations.\nThe application to cross-cultural relations has involved workshops in highly stressful situations and global locations, including conflicts and challenges in South Africa, Central America, and Ireland. Rogers, Alberto Zucconi, and Charles Devonshire co-founded the Istituto dell'Approccio Centrato sulla Persona (Person-Centered Approach Institute) in Rome, Italy.\nRogers's international work for peace culminated in the Rust Peace Workshop, which took place in November 1985 in Rust, Austria. Leaders from 17 nations convened to discuss the topic \"The Central America Challenge\". The meeting was notable for several reasons: it brought national figures together as people (not as their positions), it was a private event, and was an overwhelming positive experience where members heard one another and established real personal ties, as opposed to stiffly formal and regulated diplomatic meetings.\nPerson-centered, dialogic politics.\nSome scholars believe there is a politics implicit in Rogers's approach to psychotherapy. Toward the end of his life, Rogers came to that view himself. The central tenet of Rogerian, person-centered politics is that public life need not consist of an endless series of winner-take-all battles among sworn opponents; rather, it can and should consist of an ongoing dialogue among all parties. Such dialogue is characterized by respect among the parties, authentic speaking by each, and\u2014ultimately\u2014empathic understanding among all parties. Out of such understanding, mutually acceptable solutions will (or at least can) flow.\nDuring his last decade, Rogers facilitated or participated in a wide variety of dialogic activities among politicians, activists, and other social leaders, often outside the U.S. He also lent his support to several non-traditional U.S. political initiatives, including the \"12-Hour Political Party\" of the Association for Humanistic Psychology and the founding of a \"transformational\" political organization, the New World Alliance. By the 21st century, interest in dialogic approaches to political engagement and change had become widespread, especially among academics and activists. Theorists of a specifically Rogerian, person-centered approach to politics as dialogue have made substantial contributions to that project.\nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA).\nFrom the late 1950s into the '60s, Rogers served on the board of the Human Ecology Fund, a CIA-funded organization that provided grants to researchers looking into personality. In addition, he and other people in the field of personality and psychotherapy were given a lot of information about Khrushchev. \"We were asked to figure out what we thought of him and what would be the best way of dealing with him. And that seemed to be an entirely principled and legitimate aspect. I don't think we contributed very much, but, anyway, we tried.\"\nResearch on his work.\nHoward Kirschenbaum has conducted extensive research on the work of Carl Rogers and the person-centered/client centered approach. Kirschenbaum published the first thorough book in English on Rogers\u2019 life and work, titled, \"On Becoming Carl Rogers\" in 1979, followed by the biography, \"The Life and Work of Carl Rogers\" in 2007.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term Casimir pressure is sometimes used when it is described in units of force per unit area. It is named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Casimir, who predicted the effect for electromagnetic systems in 1948.\nIn the same year Casimir, together with Dirk Polder, described a similar effect experienced by a neutral atom in the vicinity of a macroscopic interface which is called the Casimir\u2013Polder force. Their result is a generalization of the London\u2013van der Waals force and includes retardation due to the finite speed of light. The fundamental principles leading to the London\u2013van der Waals force, the Casimir force, and the Casimir\u2013Polder force can be formulated on the same footing.\nIn 1997, a direct experiment by Steven K. Lamoreaux quantitatively measured the Casimir force to be within 5% of the value predicted by the theory.\nThe Casimir effect can be understood by the idea that the presence of macroscopic material interfaces, such as electrical conductors and dielectrics, alters the vacuum expectation value of the energy of the second-quantized electromagnetic field. Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the materials, the Casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.\nAny medium supporting oscillations has an analogue of the Casimir effect. For example, beads on a string as well as plates submerged in turbulent water or gas illustrate the Casimir force.\nIn modern theoretical physics, the Casimir effect plays an important role in the chiral bag model of the nucleon; in applied physics it is significant in some aspects of emerging microtechnologies and nanotechnologies.\nPhysical properties.\nThe typical example is of two uncharged conductive plates in a vacuum, placed a few nanometers apart. In a classical description, the lack of an external field means that no field exists between the plates, and no force connects them. When this field is instead studied using the quantum electrodynamic vacuum, it is seen that the plates do affect the virtual photons that constitute the field, and generate a net force \u2013 either an attraction or a repulsion depending on the plates' specific arrangement. Although the Casimir effect can be expressed in terms of virtual particles interacting with the objects, it is best described and more easily calculated in terms of the zero-point energy of a quantized field in the intervening space between the objects. This force has been measured and is a striking example of an effect captured formally by second quantization.\nThe treatment of boundary conditions in these calculations is controversial. In fact, \"Casimir's original goal was to compute the van der Waals force between polarizable molecules\" of the conductive plates. Thus it can be interpreted without any reference to the zero-point energy (vacuum energy) of quantum fields.\nBecause the strength of the force falls off rapidly with distance, it is measurable only when the distance between the objects is small. This force becomes so strong that it becomes the dominant force between uncharged conductors at submicron scales. In fact, at separations of 10\u00a0nm \u2013 about 100\u00a0times the typical size of an atom \u2013 the Casimir effect produces the equivalent of about 1\u00a0atmosphere of pressure (the precise value depends on surface geometry and other factors).\nHistory.\nDutch physicists Hendrik Casimir and Dirk Polder at Philips Research Labs proposed the existence of a force between two polarizable atoms and between such an atom and a conducting plate in 1947; this special form is called the Casimir\u2013Polder force. After a conversation with Niels Bohr, who suggested it had something to do with zero-point energy, Casimir alone formulated the theory predicting a force between neutral conducting plates in 1948. This latter phenomenon is called the Casimir effect.\nPredictions of the force were later extended to finite-conductivity metals and dielectrics, while later calculations considered more general geometries. Experiments before 1997 observed the force qualitatively, and indirect validation of the predicted Casimir energy was made by measuring the thickness of liquid helium films. Finally, in 1997 Lamoreaux's direct experiment quantitatively measured the force to within 5% of the value predicted by the theory. Subsequent experiments approached an accuracy of a few percent.\nPossible causes.\nVacuum energy.\nThe causes of the Casimir effect are described by quantum field theory, which states that all of the various fundamental fields, such as the electromagnetic field, must be quantized at each and every point in space. In a simplified view, a \"field\" in physics may be envisioned as if space were filled with interconnected vibrating balls and springs, and the strength of the field can be visualized as the displacement of a ball from its rest position. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate wave equation for the particular field in question. The second quantization of quantum field theory requires that each such ball-spring combination be quantized, that is, that the strength of the field be quantized at each point in space. At the most basic level, the field at each point in space is a simple harmonic oscillator, and its quantization places a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. Excitations of the field correspond to the elementary particles of particle physics. However, even the vacuum has a vastly complex structure, so all calculations of quantum field theory must be made in relation to this model of the vacuum.\nThe vacuum has, implicitly, all of the properties that a particle may have: spin, polarization in the case of light, energy, and so on. On average, most of these properties cancel out: the vacuum is, after all, \"empty\" in this sense. One important exception is the vacuum energy or the vacuum expectation value of the energy. The quantization of a simple harmonic oscillator states that the lowest possible energy or zero-point energy that such an oscillator may have is\nformula_1\nSumming over all possible oscillators at all points in space gives an infinite quantity. Since only \"differences\" in energy are physically measurable (with the notable exception of gravitation, which remains beyond the scope of quantum field theory), this infinity may be considered a feature of the mathematics rather than of the physics. This argument is the underpinning of the theory of renormalization. Dealing with infinite quantities in this way was a cause of widespread unease among quantum field theorists before the development in the 1970s of the renormalization group, a mathematical formalism for scale transformations that provides a natural basis for the process.\nWhen the scope of the physics is widened to include gravity, the interpretation of this formally infinite quantity remains problematic. There is currently no compelling explanation as to why it should not result in a cosmological constant that is many orders of magnitude larger than observed. However, since we do not yet have any fully coherent quantum theory of gravity, there is likewise no compelling reason as to why it should instead actually result in the value of the cosmological constant that we observe.\nThe Casimir effect for fermions can be understood as the spectral asymmetry of the fermion operator (\u22121)\"F\", where it is known as the Witten index.\nRelativistic van der Waals force.\nAlternatively, a 2005 paper by Robert Jaffe of MIT states that \"Casimir effects can be formulated and Casimir forces can be computed without reference to zero-point energies. They are relativistic, quantum forces between charges and currents. The Casimir force (per unit area) between parallel plates vanishes as alpha, the fine structure constant, goes to zero, and the standard result, which appears to be independent of alpha, corresponds to the alpha approaching infinity limit\", and that \"The Casimir force is simply the (relativistic, retarded) van der Waals force between the metal plates.\" Casimir and Polder's original paper used this method to derive the Casimir\u2013Polder force. In 1978, Schwinger, DeRadd, and Milton published a similar derivation for the Casimir effect between two parallel plates. More recently, Nikolic proved from first principles of quantum electrodynamics that the Casimir force does not originate from the vacuum energy of the electromagnetic field, and explained in simple terms why the fundamental microscopic origin of Casimir force lies in van der Waals forces.\nEffects.\nCasimir's observation was that the second-quantized quantum electromagnetic field, in the presence of bulk bodies such as metals or dielectrics, must obey the same boundary conditions that the classical electromagnetic field must obey. In particular, this affects the calculation of the vacuum energy in the presence of a conductor or dielectric.\nConsider, for example, the calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the electromagnetic field inside a metal cavity, such as, for example, a radar cavity or a microwave waveguide. In this case, the correct way to find the zero-point energy of the field is to sum the energies of the standing waves of the cavity. To each and every possible standing wave corresponds an energy; say the energy of the nth standing wave is En. The vacuum expectation value of the energy of the electromagnetic field in the cavity is then\nformula_2\nwith the sum running over all possible values of n enumerating the standing waves. The factor of is present because the zero-point energy of the nth mode is \"En\", where En is the energy increment for the nth mode. (It is the same as appears in the equation \"E\" \n \"\u0127\u03c9\".) Written in this way, this sum is clearly divergent; however, it can be used to create finite expressions.\nIn particular, one may ask how the zero-point energy depends on the shape s of the cavity. Each energy level En depends on the shape, and so one should write \"En\"(\"s\") for the energy level, and for the vacuum expectation value. At this point comes an important observation: The force at point p on the wall of the cavity is equal to the change in the vacuum energy if the shape s of the wall is perturbed a little bit, say by \"\u03b4s\", at p. That is, one has\nformula_3\nThis value is finite in many practical calculations.\nAttraction between the plates can be easily understood by focusing on the one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance a from one of two widely separated plates (distance l apart). With \"a\" \u226a \"l\", the states within the slot of width a are highly constrained so that the energy E of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region l where there is a large number of states (about ) with energy evenly spaced between E and the next mode in the narrow slot, or in other words, all slightly larger than E. Now on shortening a by an amount da (which is negative), the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to \u2212, whereas all the states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to \u2212 (note the different denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode in the slot. Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make a slightly smaller, the plates drawing each other closer, across the thin slot.\nDerivation of Casimir effect assuming zeta-regularization.\nIn the original calculation done by Casimir, he considered the space between a pair of conducting metal plates at distance a apart. In this case, the standing waves are particularly easy to calculate, because the transverse component of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish on the surface of a conductor. Assuming the plates lie parallel to the xy-plane, the standing waves are\nformula_4\nwhere \u03c8 stands for the electric component of the electromagnetic field, and, for brevity, the polarization and the magnetic components are ignored here. Here, kx and ky are the wavenumbers in directions parallel to the plates, and\nformula_5\nis the wavenumber perpendicular to the plates. Here, n is an integer, resulting from the requirement that \u03c8 vanish on the metal plates. The frequency of this wave is\nformula_6\nwhere c is the speed of light. The vacuum energy is then the sum over all possible excitation modes. Since the area of the plates is large, we may sum by integrating over two of the dimensions in k-space. The assumption of periodic boundary conditions yields,\nformula_7\nwhere A is the area of the metal plates, and a factor of 2 is introduced for the two possible polarizations of the wave. This expression is clearly infinite, and to proceed with the calculation, it is convenient to introduce a regulator (discussed in greater detail below). The regulator will serve to make the expression finite, and in the end will be removed. The zeta-regulated version of the energy per unit-area of the plate is\nformula_8\nIn the end, the limit \"s\" \u2192 0 is to be taken. Here s is just a complex number, not to be confused with the shape discussed previously. This integral sum is finite for s real and larger than 3. The sum has a pole at \"s\" \n 3, but may be analytically continued to \"s\" \n 0, where the expression is finite. The above expression simplifies to:\nformula_9\nwhere polar coordinates \"q\"2 \n \"kx\"2 + \"ky\"2 were introduced to turn the double integral into a single integral. The q in front is the Jacobian, and the 2\"\u03c0\" comes from the angular integration. The integral converges if Re(\"s\") &gt; 3, resulting in\nformula_10\nThe sum diverges at s in the neighborhood of zero, but if the damping of large-frequency excitations corresponding to analytic continuation of the Riemann zeta function to \"s\" \n 0 is assumed to make sense physically in some way, then one has\nformula_11\nBut \"\u03b6\"(\u22123) \n and so one obtains\nformula_12\nThe analytic continuation has evidently lost an additive positive infinity, somehow exactly accounting for the zero-point energy (not included above) outside the slot between the plates, but which changes upon plate movement within a closed system. The Casimir force per unit area for idealized, perfectly conducting plates with vacuum between them is\nformula_13\nwhere\nThe force is negative, indicating that the force is attractive: by moving the two plates closer together, the energy is lowered. The presence of \u0127 shows that the Casimir force per unit area is very small, and that furthermore, the force is inherently of quantum-mechanical origin.\nBy integrating the equation above it is possible to calculate the energy required to separate to infinity the two plates as:\nformula_14\nwhere\nIn Casimir's original derivation, a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance a from one of two widely separated plates (distance L apart). The zero-point energy on \"both\" sides of the plate is considered. Instead of the above \"ad hoc\" analytic continuation assumption, non-convergent sums and integrals are computed using Euler\u2013Maclaurin summation with a regularizing function (e.g., exponential regularization) not so anomalous as in the above.\nMore recent theory.\nCasimir's analysis of idealized metal plates was generalized to arbitrary dielectric and realistic metal plates by Evgeny Lifshitz and his students. Using this approach, complications of the bounding surfaces, such as the modifications to the Casimir force due to finite conductivity, can be calculated numerically using the tabulated complex dielectric functions of the bounding materials. Lifshitz's theory for two metal plates reduces to Casimir's idealized force law for large separations a much greater than the skin depth of the metal, and conversely reduces to the force law of the London dispersion force (with a coefficient called a Hamaker constant) for small a, with a more complicated dependence on a for intermediate separations determined by the dispersion of the materials.\nLifshitz's result was subsequently generalized to arbitrary multilayer planar geometries as well as to anisotropic and magnetic materials, but for several decades the calculation of Casimir forces for non-planar geometries remained limited to a few idealized cases admitting analytical solutions. For example, the force in the experimental sphere\u2013plate geometry was computed with an approximation (due to Derjaguin) that the sphere radius R is much larger than the separation a, in which case the nearby surfaces are nearly parallel and the parallel-plate result can be adapted to obtain an approximate force (neglecting both skin-depth and higher-order curvature effects). However, in the 2010s a number of authors developed and demonstrated a variety of numerical techniques, in many cases adapted from classical computational electromagnetics, that are capable of accurately calculating Casimir forces for arbitrary geometries and materials, from simple finite-size effects of finite plates to more complicated phenomena arising for patterned surfaces or objects of various shapes.\nMeasurement.\nOne of the first experimental tests was conducted by Marcus Sparnaay at Philips in Eindhoven (Netherlands), in 1958, in a delicate and difficult experiment with parallel plates, obtaining results not in contradiction with the Casimir theory, but with large experimental errors.\nThe Casimir effect was measured more accurately in 1997 by Steve K. Lamoreaux of Los Alamos National Laboratory, and by Umar Mohideen and Anushree Roy of the University of California, Riverside. In practice, rather than using two parallel plates, which would require phenomenally accurate alignment to ensure they were parallel, the experiments use one plate that is flat and another plate that is a part of a sphere with a very large radius.\nIn 2001, a group (Giacomo Bressi, Gianni Carugno, Roberto Onofrio and Giuseppe Ruoso) at the University of Padua (Italy) finally succeeded in measuring the Casimir force between parallel plates using microresonators. Numerous variations of these experiments are summarized in the 2009 review by Klimchitskaya.\nIn 2013, a conglomerate of scientists from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, University of Florida, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory demonstrated a compact integrated silicon chip that can measure the Casimir force. The integrated chip defined by electron-beam lithography does not need extra alignment, making it an ideal platform for measuring Casimir force between complex geometries. In 2017 and 2021, the same group from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology demonstrated the non-monotonic Casimir force and distance-independent Casimir force, respectively, using this on-chip platform.\nRegularization.\nIn order to be able to perform calculations in the general case, it is convenient to introduce a regulator in the summations. This is an artificial device, used to make the sums finite so that they can be more easily manipulated, followed by the taking of a limit so as to remove the regulator.\nThe heat kernel or exponentially regulated sum is\nformula_15\nwhere the limit \"t\" \u2192 0+ is taken in the end. The divergence of the sum is typically manifested as\nformula_16\nfor three-dimensional cavities. The infinite part of the sum is associated with the bulk constant C which \"does not\" depend on the shape of the cavity. The interesting part of the sum is the finite part, which is shape-dependent. The Gaussian regulator\nformula_17\nis better suited to numerical calculations because of its superior convergence properties, but is more difficult to use in theoretical calculations. Other, suitably smooth, regulators may be used as well. The zeta function regulator\nformula_18\nis completely unsuited for numerical calculations, but is quite useful in theoretical calculations. In particular, divergences show up as poles in the complex s plane, with the bulk divergence at \"s\" \n 4. This sum may be analytically continued past this pole, to obtain a finite part at \"s\" \n 0.\nNot every cavity configuration necessarily leads to a finite part (the lack of a pole at \"s\" \n 0) or shape-independent infinite parts. In this case, it should be understood that additional physics has to be taken into account. In particular, at extremely large frequencies (above the plasma frequency), metals become transparent to photons (such as X-rays), and dielectrics show a frequency-dependent cutoff as well. This frequency dependence acts as a natural regulator. There are a variety of bulk effects in solid state physics, mathematically very similar to the Casimir effect, where the cutoff frequency comes into explicit play to keep expressions finite. (These are discussed in greater detail in \"Landau and Lifshitz\", \"Theory of Continuous Media\".)\nGeneralities.\nThe Casimir effect can also be computed using the mathematical mechanisms of functional integrals of quantum field theory, although such calculations are considerably more abstract, and thus difficult to comprehend. In addition, they can be carried out only for the simplest of geometries. However, the formalism of quantum field theory makes it clear that the vacuum expectation value summations are in a certain sense summations over so-called \"virtual particles\".\nMore interesting is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the Van der Waals force, to be understood as a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus one considers the Hamiltonian of a system as a function of the arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in configuration space. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.\nIn the chiral bag model of the nucleon, the Casimir energy plays an important role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the spectral asymmetry is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum expectation value of the baryon number, cancelling the topological winding number of the pion field surrounding the nucleon.\nA \"pseudo-Casimir\" effect can be found in liquid crystal systems, where the boundary conditions imposed through anchoring by rigid walls give rise to a long-range force, analogous to the force that arises between conducting plates.\nDynamical Casimir effect.\nThe dynamical Casimir effect is the production of particles and energy from an accelerated \"moving mirror\". This reaction was predicted by certain numerical solutions to quantum mechanics equations made in the 1970s. In May 2011 an announcement was made by researchers at the Chalmers University of Technology, in Gothenburg, Sweden, of the detection of the dynamical Casimir effect. In their experiment, microwave photons were generated out of the vacuum in a superconducting microwave resonator. These researchers used a modified SQUID to change the effective length of the resonator in time, mimicking a mirror moving at the required relativistic velocity. If confirmed this would be the first experimental verification of the dynamical Casimir effect. In March 2013 an article appeared on the PNAS scientific journal describing an experiment that demonstrated the dynamical Casimir effect in a Josephson metamaterial. In July 2019 an article was published describing an experiment providing evidence of optical dynamical Casimir effect in a dispersion-oscillating fibre. In 2020, Frank Wilczek et al., proposed a resolution to the information loss paradox associated with the moving mirror model of the dynamical Casimir effect. Constructed within the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the dynamical Casimir effect (moving mirror) has been used to help understand the Unruh effect.\nRepulsive forces.\nThere are a few instances where the Casimir effect can give rise to repulsive forces between uncharged objects. Evgeny Lifshitz showed (theoretically) that in certain circumstances (most commonly involving liquids), repulsive forces can arise. This has sparked interest in applications of the Casimir effect toward the development of levitating devices. An experimental demonstration of the Casimir-based repulsion predicted by Lifshitz was carried out by Munday et al. who described it as \"quantum levitation\". Other scientists have also suggested the use of gain media to achieve a similar levitation effect, though this is controversial because these materials seem to violate fundamental causality constraints and the requirement of thermodynamic equilibrium (Kramers\u2013Kronig relations). Casimir and Casimir\u2013Polder repulsion can in fact occur for sufficiently anisotropic electrical bodies; for a review of the issues involved with repulsion see Milton et al. A notable recent development on repulsive Casimir forces relies on using chiral materials. Q.-D. Jiang at Stockholm University and Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek at MIT show that chiral \"lubricant\" can generate repulsive, enhanced, and tunable Casimir interactions.\nTimothy Boyer showed in his work published in 1968 that a conductor with spherical symmetry will also show this repulsive force, and the result is independent of radius. Further work shows that the repulsive force can be generated with materials of carefully chosen dielectrics.\nSpeculative applications.\nIt has been suggested that the Casimir forces have application in nanotechnology, in particular silicon integrated circuit technology based micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems, and so-called Casimir oscillators.\nIn 1995 and 1998 Maclay et al. published the first models of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) with Casimir forces. While not exploiting the Casimir force for useful work, the papers drew attention from the MEMS community due to the revelation that Casimir effect needs to be considered as a vital factor in the future design of MEMS. In particular, Casimir effect might be the critical factor in the stiction failure of MEMS.\nIn 2001, Capasso et al. showed how the force can be used to control the mechanical motion of a MEMS device. The researchers suspended a polysilicon plate from a torsional rod \u2013 a twisting horizontal bar just a few microns in diameter. When they brought a metallized sphere close up to the plate, the attractive Casimir force between the two objects made the plate rotate. They also studied the dynamical behaviour of the MEMS device by making the plate oscillate. The Casimir force reduced the rate of oscillation and led to nonlinear phenomena, such as hysteresis and bistability in the frequency response of the oscillator. According to the team, the system's behaviour agreed well with theoretical calculations.\nThe Casimir effect shows that quantum field theory allows the energy density in very small regions of space to be negative relative to the ordinary vacuum energy, and the energy densities cannot be arbitrarily negative as the theory breaks down at atomic distances. Such prominent physicists such as Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne, have speculated that such effects might make it possible to stabilize a traversable wormhole.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a mint in order to facilitate trade. They are most often issued by a government. Coins often have images, numerals, or text on them. The faces of coins or medals are sometimes called the \"obverse\" and the \"reverse\", referring to the front and back sides, respectively. The obverse of a coin is commonly called \"heads\", because it often depicts the head of a prominent person, and the reverse is known as \"tails\".\nThe first metal coins \u2013 invented in the ancient Greek world and disseminated during the Hellenistic period \u2013 were precious metal\u2013based, and were invented in order to simplify and regularize the task of measuring and weighing bullion (bulk metal) carried around for the purpose of transactions. They carried their value within the coins themselves, but the stampings also induced manipulations, such as the clipping of coins to remove some of the precious metal.\nMost modern coinage metals are base metal, and their value comes from their status as fiat money \u2014 the value of the coin is established by law. In the last hundred years, the face value of circulated coins has occasionally been lower than the value of the metal they contain, primarily due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these coins from circulation, possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law). Currently coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually, the highest value coin in circulation (excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. Coins are usually more efficient than banknotes because they last longer: banknotes last only about four years, compared with 30 years for a coin.\nExceptions to the rule of face value being higher than content value currently occur for bullion coins made of copper, silver, or gold (and rarely other metals, such as platinum or palladium), intended for collectors or investors in precious metals. Examples of modern gold collector/investor coins include the British sovereign minted by the United Kingdom, the American Gold Eagle minted by the United States, the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf minted by Canada, and the Krugerrand, minted by South Africa. While the Eagle and Sovereign coins have nominal (purely symbolic) face values, the Krugerrand does not. Commemorative coins usually serve as collector's items only, although some countries also issue commemorative coins for regular circulation, such as the 2\u20ac commemorative coins and U.S. America the Beautiful quarters.\nHistory.\nTongbei in Bronze Age China (c. 1100 BC).\nIn the late Chinese Bronze Age, standardized cast tokens were made, such as those discovered in a tomb near Anyang. These were replicas in bronze of earlier Chinese currency, cowrie shells, so they were named \"Bronze Shell\".\nChina Henan coin factory (c. 640 \u2013 550 BC).\nThe world's oldest known coin factory has been excavated in the ancient city \"Guanzhuang\" in Henan province in China. The factory produced shovel-shaped bronze coins between 640 B.C. and 550 B.C., making it the oldest securely dated minting site.\nIron Age.\nLydian and Ionian electrum coins (c. 600 BC).\nThe earliest coins are mostly associated with Iron Age Anatolia of the late 7th century BC, and especially with the kingdom of Lydia perhaps during the reign of Gyges, more certainly as electrum coins minted for king Alyattes of Lydia (died c.\u2009560 BC).\nEarly electrum coins (an alluvial alloy of gold and silver, varying wildly in proportion, and usually about 40\u201355% gold) were not standardized in weight, and in their earliest stage may have been ritual objects, such as badges or medals, issued by priests. The unpredictability of the composition of naturally occurring electrum implied that it had a variable value, which greatly hampered its development.\nMost of the early Lydian coins include no writing (\"myth\" or \"inscription\"), only an image of a symbolic animal. Therefore, the dating of these coins relies primarily on archaeological evidence, with the most commonly cited evidence coming from excavations of the foundation deposit at the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, also called the Ephesian Artemision (which would later evolve into one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). This was the site of the earliest known deposit of electrum coins inscribed as Phanes, dated to 625\u2013600 BC from Ephesus in Ionia, with the legend \u03a6\u0391\u0395\u039d\u039f\u03a3 \u0395\u039c\u0399 \u03a3H\u039c\u0391 (or similar) (\"I am the badge/sign/mark of Phanes/light\") or just bearing the name \u03a6\u0391\u039d\u0395\u039f\u03a3 (\"of Phanes\"). Anatolian Artemis was the \u03a0\u03cc\u03c4\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 \u0398\u03b7\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd (\"Potnia Th\u00ear\u00f4n\", \"Mistress of Animals\"), whose symbol was the stag. It took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day's subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread. Maybe the first coins to be used for retailing on a large-scale basis were likely small silver fractions, hemiobol, Ancient Greek coinage minted by the Ionian Greeks in the late sixth century BC.\nIn contrast Herodotus mentioned the innovation made by the Lydians:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So far as we have any knowledge, they [the Lydians] were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coins, and the first who sold goods by retail.\nAnd both Aristotle (fr. 611,37, ed. V. Rose) and Pollux (Onamastikon IX.83), mention that the first issuer of coinage was Hermodike/Demodike of Cyme. Cyme was a city in Aeolia, nearby Lydia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Another example of local pride is the dispute about coinage, whether the first one to strike it was Pheidon of Argos, or Demodike of Kyme (who was wife of Midas the Phrygian and daughter of King Agammemnon of Kyme), or Erichthonios and Lycos of Athens, or the Lydians (as Xenophanes says) or the Naxians (as Anglosthenes thought).\nMany early Lydian and Greek coins were minted under the authority of private individuals and are thus more akin to tokens or badges than to modern coins, though due to their numbers it is evident that some were official state issues.\nBullion and unmarked metals (6th century BC).\nMetal ingots, silver bullion or unmarked bars were probably in use for exchange among many of the civilizations that mastered metallurgy. The weight and purity of bullion would be the key determinant of value. In the Achaemenid Empire in the early 6th century BC, coinage was yet unknown. The barter system, as well as silver bullion were used instead for trade. The practice of using silver bars for currency also seems to have been current in Central Asia from the 6th century BC. Coins were an evolution of \"currency\" systems of the Late Bronze Age, when various cultures used standard-sized ingots and tokens such as knife money to store and transfer value. Phoenician metal ingots had to be stamped with the name of a current ruler to guarantee their worth and value, which is probably how stamping busts and designs began, although political advertising \u2013 glorification of a state or of a ruler \u2013 may also play a role.\nCroesus: Pure gold and silver coins (c. 560\u2013546 BC).\nThe successor of Alyattes, king Croesus (r. c. 560\u2013546 BC), became associated with great wealth in Greek historiography. He is credited with issuing the \"Croeseid\", the first true gold coins with a standardized purity for general circulation. and the world's first bimetallic monetary system c. 550 BC.\nCoins spread rapidly in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, leading to the development of Ancient Greek coinage and Achaemenid coinage, and further to Illyrian coinage.\nAchaemenid coinage (546\u2013330 BC).\nWhen Cyrus the Great (550\u2013530 BC) came to power, coinage was unfamiliar in his realm. Barter and to some extent silver bullion was used instead for trade. The practice of using silver bars for currency also seems to have been current in Central Asia from the 6th century.\nCyrus the Great introduced coins to the Persian Empire after 546 BC, following his conquest of Lydia and the defeat of its king Croesus, who had put in place the first coinage in history. With his conquest of Lydia, Cyrus acquired a region in which coinage was invented, developed through advanced metallurgy, and had already been in circulation for about 50 years, making the Lydian Kingdom one of the leading trade powers of the time. It seems Cyrus initially adopted the Lydian coinage as such, and continued to strike Lydia's lion-and-bull coinage.\nOriginal coins of the Achaemenid Empire were issued from 520 BC \u2013 450 BC to 330 BC. The Persian daric was the first truly Achaemenid gold coin which, along with a similar silver coin, the Siglos, represented the bimetallic monetary standard of the Achaemenid Persian Empire.\nCoinage of Southern Asia under the Achaemenid Empire.\nThe Achaemenid Empire already reached the doors of India during the original expansion of Cyrus the Great, and the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley is dated to c. 515 BC under Darius I. An Achaemenid administration was established in the area. The Kabul hoard, also called the Chaman Hazouri hoard, is a coin hoard discovered in the vicinity of Kabul, Afghanistan, containing numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many Greek coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The deposit of the hoard is dated to the Achaemenid period, in approximately 380 BC. The hoard also contained many locally produced silver coins, minted by local authorities under Achaemenid rule. Several of these issues follow the \"western designs\" of the facing bull heads, a stag, or Persian column capitals on the obverse, and incuse punch on the reverse.\nAccording to numismatist Joe Cribb, these finds suggest that the idea of coinage and the use of punch-marked techniques was introduced to India from the Achaemenid Empire during the 4th century BC. More Achaemenid coins were also found in Pushkalavati and in Bhir Mound.\nGreek Archaic coinage (until about 480 BC).\nAccording to Aristotle (fr. 611,37, ed. V. Rose) and Pollux (Onamastikon IX.83), the first issuer of Greek coinage was Hermodike of Kyme.\nA small percentage of early Lydian/Greek coins have a legend. The most ancient inscribed coin known is from nearby Caria. This coin has a Greek legend reading \"phaenos emi sema\" interpreted variously as \"I am the badge of Phanes\", or \"I am the sign of light\". The Phanes coins are among the earliest of Greek coins; a hemihekte of the issue was found in the foundation deposit of the temple of Artemis at Ephesos (the oldest deposit of electrum coins discovered). One assumption is that Phanes was a mercenary mentioned by Herodotus, another that this coin is associated with the primeval god Phanes or \"Phanes\" might have been an epithet of the local goddess identified with Artemis. Barclay V. Head found these suggestions unlikely and thought it more probably \"the name of some prominent citizen of Ephesus\".\nAnother candidate for the site of the earliest coins is Aegina, where Chelone (\"turtle\") coins were first minted c. 700 BC. Coins from Athens and Corinth appeared shortly thereafter, known to exist at least since the late 6th century BC.\nAntiquity.\nClassical Greek antiquity (480 BC~).\nThe Classical period saw Greek coinage reach a high level of technical and aesthetic quality. Larger cities now produced a range of fine silver and gold coins, most bearing a portrait of their patron god or goddess or a legendary hero on one side, and a symbol of the city on the other. Some coins employed a visual pun: some coins from Rhodes featured a rose, since the Greek word for rose is \"rhodon\". The use of inscriptions on coins also began, usually the name of the issuing city.\nThe wealthy cities of Sicily produced some especially fine coins. The large silver \"decadrachmes\" (10-drachmes) coin from Syracuse is regarded by many collectors as the finest coin produced in the ancient world, perhaps ever. Syracusan issues were rather standard in their imprints, one side bearing the head of the nymph Arethusa and the other usually a victorious quadriga. The tyrants of Syracuse were fabulously rich, and part of their public relations policy was to fund quadrigas for the Olympic chariot race, a very expensive undertaking. As they were often able to finance more than one quadriga at a time, they were frequent victors in this highly prestigious event. Syracuse was one of the epicenters of numismatic art during the classical period. Led by the engravers Kimon and Euainetos, Syracuse produced some of the finest coin designs of antiquity.\nAmongst the first centers to produce coins during the Greek colonization of Southern Italy (the so-called \"Magna Graecia\") were Paestum, Crotone, Sybaris, Caulonia, Metapontum, and Taranto. These ancient cities started producing coins from 550\u00a0BC to 510\u00a0BC.\nAmisano, in a general publication, including the Etruscan coinage, attributing it the beginning to c.\u2009560\u00a0BC in Populonia, a chronology that would leave out the contribution of the Greeks of Magna Graecia and attribute to the Etruscans the burden of introducing the coin in Italy. In this work, constant reference is made to classical sources, and credit is given to the origin of the Etruscan Lydia, a source supported by Herodotus, and also to the invention of coin in Lydia.\nAppearance of dynastic portraiture (5th century BC).\nAlthough many of the first coins illustrated the images of various gods, the first portraiture of actual rulers appears with the coinage of Lycia in the 5th century BC. No ruler had dared illustrating his own portrait on coinage until that time. The Achaemenids had been the first to illustrate the person of their king or a hero in a stereotypical manner, showing a bust or the full body but never an actual portrait, on their Sigloi and Daric coinage from c. 500 BC. A slightly earlier candidate for the first portrait-coin is Themistocles the Athenian general, who became a Governor of Magnesia on the Meander, c. 465\u2013459 BC, for the Achaemenid Empire, although there is some question as to whether his coins may have represented Zeus rather than himself. Themistocles may have been in a unique position in which he could transfer the notion of individual portraiture, already current in the Greek world, and at the same time wield the dynastic power of an Achaemenid dynasty who could issue his own coins and illustrate them as he wished. From the time of Alexander the Great, portraiture of the issuing ruler would then become a standard, generalized, feature of coinage.\nIndian coins (c. 400 BC \u2013 AD 100).\nThe Karshapana is the earliest punch-marked coin found in India, produced from at least the mid-4th century BC, and possibly as early as 575 BC, influenced by similar coins produced in Gandhara under the Achaemenid empire, such as those of the Kabul hoard, or other examples found at Pushkalavati and in Bhir Mound.\nChinese round coins (350 BC~).\nIn China, early round coins appeared in the 4th century BC and were adopted for all China by Emperor Qin Shi Huang Di at the end of 3rd century BC. The round coin, the precursor of the familiar cash coin, circulated in both the spade and knife money areas in the Zhou period, from around 350 BC. Apart from two small and presumably late coins from the State of Qin, coins from the spade money area have a round hole and refer to the \"jin\" and \"liang\" units. Those from the knife money area have a square hole and are denominated in \"hua\" (\u5316).\nAlthough for discussion purposes the Zhou coins are divided up into categories of knives, spades, and round coins, it is apparent from archaeological finds that most of the various kinds circulated together. A hoard found in 1981, near Hebi in north Henan province, consisted of: 3,537 Gong spades, 3 Anyi arched foot spades, 8 Liang \"Dang Lie\" spades, 18 Liang square foot spades and 1,180 Yuan round coins, all contained in three clay jars.\nHellenistic period (320 BC \u2013 AD 30).\nThe Hellenistic period was characterized by the spread of Greek culture across a large part of the known world. Greek-speaking kingdoms were established in Egypt and Syria, and for a time also in Iran and as far east as what is now Afghanistan and northwestern India. Greek traders spread Greek coins across this vast area, and the new kingdoms soon began to produce their own coins. Because these kingdoms were much larger and wealthier than the Greek city states of the classical period, their coins tended to be more mass-produced, as well as larger, and more frequently in gold. They often lacked the aesthetic delicacy of coins of the earlier period.\nStill, some of the Greco-Bactrian coins, and those of their successors in India, the Indo-Greeks, are considered the finest examples of Greek numismatic art with \"a nice blend of realism and idealization\", including the largest coins to be minted in the Hellenistic world: the largest gold coin was minted by Eucratides (reigned 171\u2013145 BC), the largest silver coin by the Indo-Greek king Amyntas Nikator (reigned c. 95\u201390 BC). The portraits \"show a degree of individuality never matched by the often bland depictions of their royal contemporaries further West\" (Roger Ling, \"Greece and the Hellenistic World\").\nRoman period (290 BC~).\nCoinage followed Greek colonization and influence first around the Mediterranean and soon after to North Africa (including Egypt), Syria, Persia, and the Balkans. Coins came late to the Roman Republic compared with the rest of the Mediterranean, especially Greece and Asia Minor where coins were invented in the 7th century BC. The currency of central Italy was influenced by its natural resources, with bronze being abundant (the Etruscans were famous metal workers in bronze and iron) and silver ore being scarce. The coinage of the Roman Republic started with a few silver coins apparently devised for trade with Celtic in northern Italy and the Greek colonies in Southern Italy, and heavy cast bronze pieces for use in Central Italy. The first Roman coins, which were crude, heavy cast bronzes, were issued c. 289 BC.\nAmisano, in a general publication, including the Etruscan coinage, attributing it the beginning to about 550 BC in Populonia, a chronology that would leave out the contribution of the Greeks of Magna Graecia and attribute to the Etruscans the burden of introducing the coin in Italy. In this work, constant reference is made to classical sources, and credit is given to the origin of the Etruscan Lydia, a source supported by Herodotus, and also to the invention of coin in Lydia.\nMiddle Ages.\nCharlemagne, in 800 AD, implemented a series of reforms upon becoming \"Holy Roman Emperor\", including the issuance of a standard coin, the silver penny. Between 794 and 1200 the penny was the only denomination of coin in Western Europe. Minted without oversight by bishops, cities, feudal lords and fiefdoms, by 1160, coins in Venice contained only 0.05g of silver, while England's coins were minted at 1.3g. Large coins were introduced in the mid-13th century. In England, a dozen pennies was called a \"shilling\" and twenty shillings a \"pound\": consistent with e.g. France.\nDebasement of coin was widespread. There were periods of significant debasement in 1340\u201360 and 1417\u201329, when no small coins were minted, and by the 15th century the issuance of small coin was further restricted by government restrictions and even prohibitions. With the exception of the Great Debasement, England's coins were consistently minted from sterling silver (silver content of 92.5%). A lower quality of silver with more copper mixed in, used in Barcelona, was called billon. The first European coin to use Arabic numerals to date the year in which the coin was minted was the St. Gall silver \"Plappart\" of 1424.\nItaly has been influential at a coinage point of view: the Florentine florin, one of the most used coinage types in European history and one of the most important coins in Western history, was struck in Florence in the 13th century, while the Venetian sequin, minted from 1284 to 1797, was the most prestigious gold coin in circulation in the commercial centers of the Mediterranean Sea. The Florentine florin was the first European gold coin struck in sufficient quantities since the 7th century to play a significant commercial role. The Florentine florin was used for larger transactions such as those used in dowries, international trade or for tax-related matters.\nModern history.\nGenoese coins became important in the 16th century during the Golden age of Genoese banking, with the Spanish Empire funnelling its massive wealth from Spanish America through the Bank of Saint George. With the decline in the fortunes of the Genoese banks and the Spanish Empire in the 17th century, however, the Genoese lira also depreciated substantially. The silver scudo's value increased to 6.5 lire in 1646, 7.4 lire in 1671, and 8.74 lire just before the Austrian occupation of Genoa in 1746.\nVariations in the weight of precious metals used in international trade, particularly in imports of spices and textiles into Europe, explain the numerous monetary reforms that occurred in this period. The effect of these transactions on the available reserves of gold and silver was at the origin of the various monetary reforms, which changed the price of silver compared to gold. Faced with the distinct monetary systems developed by Genoa, Venice or Florence, the widespread use in the 15th century of the silver thaler, of constant size and weight, allowed conversion operations to be limited and therefore exchanges facilitated. The thaler was the monetary unit of the Germanic countries until the 19th century and is considered the ancestor of the United States dollar. At the same time, the Mexican Mint was established on May 11, 1535, by order of the Spanish king following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Opened in April 1536, this mint had the right to mint silver Spanish real which became the basis of the monetary system of the Spanish Empire. Louis XIII had the Louis d'or minted in 1640 to compete with these coins.\nThe first attested siege coins appeared at the siege of Pavia in 1524. Auxiliary coins consisted, among the Greeks and Romans as in our modern societies, of coins strongly linked to copper. In particular, the red copper alloy was used for its physical properties, suitable for objects constantly subjected to manipulation: malleability, resistance to impacts, wear and corrosion (only gold has better resistance to corrosion). This alloy was often mixed with a little tin, zinc and especially nickel for their anti-corrosive, ductile and anti-fouling properties.\nValue.\nCurrency.\nMost coins presently are made of a base metal, and their value comes from their status as fiat money. The value of the coin is established by law, and thus is determined by the free market as national currencies are used in domestic trade and traded in the international market. These coins are monetary tokens, just as paper currency is: their value is usually not backed by metal, but rather by some form of government guarantee.\nCoins may be in circulation with face values lower than the value of their component metals due to inflation, as market values for the metal overtake the face value of the coin. Examples are the pre-1965 US dime, quarter, half dollar, and dollar (containing slightly less than a tenth, quarter, half, and full ounce of silver, respectively), US nickel, and pre-1982 US penny. As a result of the increase in the value of copper, the United States greatly reduced the amount of copper in each penny. Since mid-1982, United States pennies are made of 97.5% zinc, with the remaining 2.5% being a coating of copper. Extreme differences between face values and metal values of coins cause coins to be hoarded or removed from circulation by illicit smelters in order to realize the value of their metal content. This is an example of Gresham's law. The United States Mint, in an attempt to avoid this, implemented new interim rules on December 14, 2006, subject to public comment for 30 days, which criminalized the melting and export of pennies and nickels. Violators can be fined up to $10,000 and/or imprisoned for up to five years. In the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in the United States, 31 CFR \u00a7\u00a082.1 forbids unauthorized persons from exporting, melting, or treating any 5 or 1 cent coins.\nCollector's items.\nA coin's value as a collector's item or as an investment generally depends on its condition, specific historical significance, rarity, quality, beauty of the design and general popularity with collectors. If a coin is greatly lacking in all of these, it is unlikely to be worth much. The value of bullion coins is also influenced to some extent by those factors, but is largely based on the value of their gold, silver, or platinum content. Sometimes non-monetized bullion coins such as the Canadian Maple Leaf and the American Gold Eagle are minted with nominal face values less than the value of the metal in them, but as such coins are never intended for circulation, these face values have no relevance.\nCollector catalogs often include information about coins to assists collectors with identifying and grading. Additional resources can be found online for collectors These are collector clubs, collection management tools, marketplaces, trading platforms, and forums,\nDebasement and clipping.\nThroughout history, monarchs and governments have often created more coinage than their supply of precious metals would allow if the coins were pure metal. By replacing some fraction of a coin's precious metal content with a base metal (often copper or nickel), the intrinsic value of each individual coin was reduced (thereby \"debasing\" the money), allowing the coining authority to produce more coins than would otherwise be possible. Debasement occasionally occurs in order to make the coin physically harder and therefore less likely to be worn down as quickly, but the more usual reason is to profit from the difference between face value and metal value. Debasement of money almost always leads to price inflation. Sometimes price controls are at the same time also instituted by the governing authority, but historically these have generally proved unworkable.\nThe United States is unusual in that it has only slightly modified its coinage system (except for the images and symbols on the coins, which have changed a number of times) to accommodate two centuries of inflation. The one-cent coin has changed little since 1856 (though its composition was changed in 1982 to remove virtually all copper from the coin) and still remains in circulation, despite a greatly reduced purchasing power. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest coin in common circulation is valued at 25 cents, a very low value for the largest denomination coin compared to many other countries. Increases in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc meant that both the US one- and five-cent coins became worth more for their raw metal content than their face (fiat) value. In particular, copper one-cent pieces (those dated prior to 1982 and some 1982-dated coins) contained about two cents' worth of copper.\nSome denominations of circulating coins that were formerly minted in the United States are no longer made. These include coins with a face value of a half cent, two cents, three cents, and twenty cents. (The half dollar and dollar coins are still produced, but mostly for vending machines and collectors.) In the past, the US also coined the following denominations for circulation in gold: One dollar, $2.50, three dollars, five dollars, ten dollars, and twenty dollars. In addition, cents were originally slightly larger than the modern quarter and weighed nearly half an ounce, while five-cent coins (known then as \"half dimes\") were smaller than a dime and made of a silver alloy. Dollar coins were also much larger, and weighed approximately an ounce. One-dollar gold coins are no longer produced and rarely used. The US also issues bullion and commemorative coins with the following denominations: 50\u00a2, $1, $5, $10, $25, $50, and $100.\nCirculating coins commonly suffered from \"shaving\" or \"clipping\": the public would cut off small amounts of precious metal from their edges to sell it and then pass on the mutilated coins at full value. Unmilled British sterling silver coins were sometimes reduced to almost half their minted weight. This form of debasement in Tudor England was commented on by Sir Thomas Gresham, whose name was later attached to Gresham's law. The monarch would have to periodically recall circulating coins, paying only the bullion value of the silver, and reminting them. This, also known as recoinage, is a long and difficult process that was done only occasionally. Many coins have milled or reeded edges, originally designed to make it easier to detect clipping.\nCutting.\nSome coins made of precious metals were manufactured with a cross on one side to make it easier to split the coin into halves or quarters.\nModern features.\nThe side of a coin carrying an image of a monarch, other authority (\"see List of people on coins\"), or a national emblem is called the \"obverse\" (colloquially, \"heads\"); the other side, carrying various types of information, is called the \"reverse\" (colloquially, \"tails\"). The year of minting is usually shown on the obverse, although some Chinese coins, most Canadian coins, the pre-2008 British 20p coin, the post-1999 American quarter, and all Japanese coins are exceptions.\nThe relation of the images on the obverse and reverse of a coin is the coin's orientation. If the image on the obverse of the coin is right side up and turning the coin left or right on its vertical axis reveals that the reverse of the coin is also right side up, then the coin is said to have medallic orientation\u2014typical of the Euro and pound sterling; if, however, turning the coin left or right shows that the reverse image is upside down, then the coin is said to have coin orientation, characteristic of the coins of the United States dollar.\nBimetallic coins are sometimes used for higher values and for commemorative purposes. In the 1990s, France used a tri-metallic coin. Common circulating bimetallic examples include the \u20ac1, \u20ac2, British \u00a31, \u00a32 and Canadian $2 and several peso coins in Mexico.\nThe \"exergue\" is the space on a coin beneath the main design, often used to show the coin's date, although it is sometimes left blank or contains a mint mark, privy mark, or some other decorative or informative design feature. Many coins do not have an exergue at all, especially those with few or no legends, such as the Victorian bun penny.\nNot all coins are round; they come in a variety of shapes. The Australian 50-cent coin, for example, has twelve flat sides. Some coins have wavy edges, e.g. the $2 and 20-cent coins of Hong Kong and the 10-cent coins of Bahamas. Some are square-shaped, such as the 15-cent coin of the Bahamas and the 50-cent coin from Aruba. During the 1970s, Swazi coins were minted in several shapes, including squares, polygons, and wavy edged circles with 8 and 12 waves.\nHistorically, a considerable variety of coinage metals (including alloys) and other materials (e.g. porcelain) have been used to produce coins for circulation, collection, and metal investment: bullion coins often serve as more convenient stores of assured metal quantity and purity than other bullion.\nSome other coins, like the British 20 and 50 pence coins and the Canadian Loonie, have an odd number of sides, with the edges rounded off. This way the coin has a constant diameter, recognizable by vending machines whichever direction it is inserted.\nA triangular coin with a face value of \u00a35 (produced to commemorate the 2007/2008 Tutankhamun exhibition at The O2 Arena) was commissioned by the Isle of Man: it became legal tender on 6 December 2007. Other triangular coins issued earlier include: Cabinda coin, Bermuda coin, 2 Dollar Cook Islands 1992 triangular coin, Uganda Millennium Coin and Polish Sterling-Silver 10-Zloty Coin.\nSome medieval coins, called bracteates, were so thin they were struck on only one side.\nMany coins over the years have been manufactured with integrated holes such as Chinese \"cash\" coins, Japanese coins, Colonial French coins, etc. This may have been done to permit their being strung on cords, to facilitate storage and being carried. Nowadays, holes help to differentiate coins of similar size and metal, such as the Japanese 50 yen and 100 yen coin.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint is now able to produce holographic-effect gold and silver coinage. However, this procedure is not limited to only bullion or commemorative coinage. The 500 yen coin from Japan was subject to a massive amount of counterfeiting. The Japanese government in response produced a circulatory coin with a holographic image.\nThe Royal Canadian Mint has also released several coins that are colored, the first of which was in commemoration of Remembrance Day. The subject was a colored poppy on the reverse of a 25-cent piece minted through a patented process.\nAn example of non-metallic composite coins (sometimes incorrectly called plastic coins) was introduced into circulation in Transnistria on 22 August 2014. Most of these coins are also non-circular, with different shapes corresponding to different coin values.\nFor a list of many pure metallic elements and their alloys which have been used in actual circulation coins and for trial experiments, see coinage metals.\nOther uses.\nMedia of expression.\nCoins can be used as creative media of expression \u2013 from fine art sculpture to the penny machines that can be found in amusement parks. Hobo nickels and love tokens are art objects carved from coins.\nIn the United States, such alterations are legal. 31 CFR \u00a7\u00a082.2(b) states that: \"The prohibition contained in \u00a7\u00a082.1 against the treatment of 5-cent coins and one-cent coins shall not apply to the treatment of these coins for educational, amusement, novelty, jewelry, and similar purposes as long as the volumes treated and the nature of the treatment makes it clear that such treatment is not intended as a means by which to profit solely from the value of the metal content of the coins.\"\nLove tokens created by convicts from the British Isles who were sentenced to transportation to Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries used coins to leave messages of remembrance to loved ones left behind in Britain. The coins were defaced, smoothed and inscribed, either by stippling or engraving, with sometimes touching words of loss. These coins were called \"convict love tokens\" or \"leaden hearts\". Some of these tokens are in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.\nCultural references.\nCoins have been depicted in art and literature. A roman sestertius is shown in the painting Portrait of a Man with a Roman Coin by Memling. An Ecuadorian gold doubloon plays a key role in the novel Moby-Dick. Coins appear in the New Testament; for example, the thirty pieces of silver (possibly Tyrian shekels) exemplify Judas's betrayal and two leptons (the widow's mite) demonstrate true generosity. In Ancient Greek funeral and burial practices, an obol was often placed on or in the mouth.\nPhysics and chemistry.\nFlipping.\nTo flip a coin to see whether it lands \"heads\" or \"tails\" is to use it as a two-sided die in what is known in mathematics as a Bernoulli trial: if the probability of heads (in the parlance of Bernoulli trials, a \"success\") is exactly 0.5, the coin is fair.\nSpinning.\nCoins can also be spun on a flat surface such as a table. This results in the following phenomenon: as the coin falls over and rolls on its edge, it spins faster and faster (formally, the precession rate of the symmetry axis of the coin, i.e., the axis passing from one face of the coin to the other) before coming to an abrupt stop. This is mathematically modeled as a finite-time singularity \u2013 the precession rate is accelerating to infinity, before it suddenly stops, and has been studied using high speed photography and devices such as Euler's Disk. The slowing down is predominantly caused by rolling friction (air resistance is minor), and the singularity (divergence of the precession rate) can be modeled as a power law with exponent approximately \u22121/3.\nOdor.\nIron and copper coins have a characteristic metallic smell that is produced upon contact with oils in the skin. Perspiration is chemically reduced upon contact with these metals, which causes the skin oils to decompose, forming with iron the volatile molecule 1-octen-3-one.\nRegional examples.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, small, engraved gold coins called Piloncitos have been excavated, some as lightweight as 0.09 to 2.65 grams. Piloncitos have been unearthed from Mandaluyong, Bataan, the banks of the Pasig River, Batangas, Marinduque, Samar, Leyte and some areas in Mindanao. Large quantities were found in Indonesian archaeological sites, suggesting that they may not have originated in the Philippines, but rather were imported. However, numerous Spanish accounts state that the gold coins were mined and made in the Philippines, such as the following from 1586:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"The people of this island (Luzon) are very skillful in their handling of gold. They weigh it with the greatest skill and delicacy that have ever been seen. The first thing they teach their children is the knowledge of gold and the weights with which they weigh it, for there is no other money among them.\"\nThe term \"Piloncitos\" is a contemporary word, used by modern-day antique collectors, who thought that the cone-shaped pieces looked like a pilon of sugar. Early historical descriptions of the term include the Spanish \"granitas de oro\" (small grains of gold), or simply by whatever local language terms were used to mean \"gold\" in those times, such as \"bulawan.\"\nPiloncitos are presumably an offshoot of silver coinage and may have evolved into the bullet or pod duang coinage of Sukhothai in Thailand.\nEarly historical records document the extensive use of gold throughout the Philippine archipelago before the arrival of European colonists. It was used extensively as currency, and also used in everyday items such as clothing and finery.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7561", "revid": "47078414", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7561", "title": "Classical Kuiper belt object", "text": "Kuiper belt object, not controlled by an orbital resonance with Neptune\nA classical Kuiper belt object, also called a cubewano ( \"QB1-o\"), is a low-eccentricity Kuiper belt object (KBO) that orbits beyond Neptune and is not controlled by an orbital resonance with Neptune. Cubewanos have orbits with semi-major axes in the 40\u201350\u00a0AU range and, unlike Pluto, do not cross Neptune's orbit. That is, they have low-eccentricity and sometimes low-inclination orbits like the classical planets.\nThe name \"cubewano\" derives from the first trans-Neptunian object (TNO) found after Pluto and Charon: 15760 Albion, which until January 2018 had only the provisional designation (15760) 1992 QB1. Similar objects found later were often called \"QB1-os\", or \"cubewanos\", after this object, though the term \"classical\" is much more frequently used in the scientific literature.\nObjects identified as cubewanos include:\nHaumea was provisionally listed as a cubewano by the Minor Planet Center in 2006, but was later found to be in a resonant orbit.\nOrbits: 'hot' and 'cold' populations.\nThere are two basic dynamical classes of classical Kuiper-belt bodies: those with relatively unperturbed ('cold') orbits, and those with markedly perturbed ('hot') orbits.\nMost cubewanos are found between the 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune (populated by plutinos) and the 1:2 resonance. 50000 Quaoar, for example, has a near-circular orbit close to the ecliptic. Plutinos, on the other hand, have more eccentric orbits bringing some of them closer to the Sun than Neptune.\nThe majority of classical objects, the so-called \"cold population\", have low inclinations (&lt; 5\u00b0) and near-circular orbits, lying between 42 and 47\u00a0AU. A smaller population (the \"hot population\") is characterised by highly inclined, more eccentric orbits. The terms 'hot' and 'cold' has nothing to do with surface or internal temperatures, but rather refer to the orbits of the objects, by analogy to molecules in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they heat up.\nThe Deep Ecliptic Survey reports the distributions of the two populations; one with the inclination centered at 4.6\u00b0 (named \"Core\") and another with inclinations extending beyond 30\u00b0 (\"Halo\").\nDistribution.\nThe vast majority of KBOs (more than two-thirds) have inclinations of less than 5\u00b0 and eccentricities of less than 0.1\u00a0. Their semi-major axes show a preference for the middle of the main belt; arguably, smaller objects close to the limiting resonances have been either captured into resonance or have their orbits modified by Neptune.\nThe 'hot' and 'cold' populations are strikingly different: more than 30% of all cubewanos are in low inclination, near-circular orbits. The parameters of the plutinos' orbits are more evenly distributed, with a local maximum in moderate eccentricities in 0.15\u20130.2 range, and low inclinations 5\u201310\u00b0.\nSee also the comparison with scattered disk objects.\nCubewanos form a clear 'belt' outside Neptune's orbit, whereas the plutinos approach, or even cross Neptune's orbit. When orbital inclinations are compared, 'hot' cubewanos can be easily distinguished by their higher inclinations, as the plutinos typically keep orbits &lt;20\u00b0. The high inclination of 'hot' cubewanos has not been explained.\nCold and hot populations: physical characteristics.\nIn addition to the distinct orbital characteristics, the two populations display different physical characteristics.\nThe difference in colour between the red cold population, such as 486958 Arrokoth, and more heterogeneous hot population was observed as early as in 2002.\nRecent studies, based on a larger data set, indicate the cut-off inclination of 12\u00b0 (instead of 5\u00b0) between the cold and hot populations and confirm the distinction between the homogenous red cold population and the bluish hot population.\nAnother difference between the low-inclination (cold) and high-inclination (hot) classical objects is the observed number of binary objects. Binaries are quite common on low-inclination orbits and are typically similar-brightness systems. Binaries are less common on high-inclination orbits and their components typically differ in brightness. This correlation, together with the differences in colour, support further the suggestion that the currently observed classical objects belong to at least two different overlapping populations, with different physical properties and orbital history.\nToward a formal definition.\nThere is no official definition of 'cubewano' or 'classical KBO'. However, the terms are normally used to refer to objects free from significant perturbation from Neptune, thereby excluding KBOs in orbital resonance with Neptune (resonant trans-Neptunian objects). The Minor Planet Center (MPC) and the Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) do not list cubewanos (classical objects) using the same criteria. Many TNOs classified as cubewanos by the MPC, such as dwarf planet Makemake, are classified as ScatNear (possibly scattered by Neptune) by the DES. may be an inner cubewano near the plutinos. Furthermore, there is evidence that the Kuiper belt has an 'edge', in that an apparent lack of low-inclination objects beyond 47\u201349\u00a0AU was suspected as early as 1998 and shown with more data in 2001. Consequently, the traditional usage of the terms is based on the orbit's semi-major axis, and includes objects situated between the 2:3 and 1:2 resonances, that is between 39.4 and 47.8 AU (with exclusion of these resonances and the minor ones in-between).\nThese definitions lack precision: in particular the boundary between the classical objects and the scattered disk remains blurred. , there are 870 objects with perihelion (q) &gt; 40 AU and aphelion (Q) &lt; 48 AU.\nDES classification.\nIntroduced by the report from the Deep Ecliptic Survey by J. L. Elliott et al. in 2005 uses formal criteria based on the mean orbital parameters. Put informally, the definition includes the objects that have never crossed the orbit of Neptune. According to this definition, an object qualifies as a classical KBO if:\nSSBN07 classification.\nAn alternative classification, introduced by B. Gladman, B. Marsden and C. van Laerhoven in 2007, uses a 10-million-year orbit integration instead of the Tisserand's parameter. Classical objects are defined as not resonant and not being currently scattered by Neptune.\nFormally, this definition includes as \"classical\" all objects with their \"current\" orbits that\nUnlike other schemes, this definition includes the objects with major semi-axis less than 39.4 AU (2:3 resonance)\u2014termed inner classical belt, or more than 48.7 (1:2 resonance) \u2013 termed outer classical belt, and reserves the term main classical belt for the orbits between these two resonances.\nFamilies.\nThe first known collisional family in the classical Kuiper belt\u2014a group of objects thought to be remnants from the breakup of a single body\u2014is the Haumea family. It includes Haumea, its moons, and seven smaller bodies. The objects not only follow similar orbits but also share similar physical characteristics. Unlike many other KBO their surface contains large amounts of water ice (H2O) and no or very little tholins. The surface composition is inferred from their neutral (as opposed to red) colour and deep absorption at 1.5 and 2. \u03bcm in infrared spectrum. Several other collisional families might reside in the classical Kuiper belt.\nExploration.\nAs of January 2019, only one classical Kuiper belt object has been observed up close by spacecraft. Both Voyager spacecraft have passed through the region before the discovery of the Kuiper belt. New Horizons was the first mission to visit a classical KBO. After its successful exploration of the Pluto system in 2015, the NASA spacecraft has visited the small KBO 486958 Arrokoth at a distance of on 1\u00a0January 2019.\nList.\nHere is a very generic list of classical Kuiper belt objects.

{"id": "7564", "revid": "50965538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7564", "title": "Foreign policy of the United States", "text": " \nThe officially stated goals of the foreign policy of the United States of America, including all the bureaus and offices in the United States Department of State, as mentioned in the \"Foreign Policy Agenda\" of the Department of State, are \"to build and sustain a more democratic, secure, and prosperous world for the benefit of the American people and the international community\". Liberalism has been a key component of US foreign policy since its independence from Britain. Since the end of World War II, the United States has had a grand strategy which has been characterized as being oriented around primacy, \"deep engagement\", and/or liberal hegemony. This strategy entails that the United States maintains military predominance; builds and maintains an extensive network of allies (exemplified by NATO, bilateral alliances and foreign US military bases); integrates other states into US-designed international institutions (such as the IMF, WTO/GATT, and World Bank); and limits the spread of nuclear weapons.\nThe United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs states as some of its jurisdictional goals: \"export controls, including nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware; measures to foster commercial interaction with foreign nations and to safeguard American business abroad; international commodity agreements; international education; protection of American citizens abroad; and expulsion\". U.S. foreign policy and foreign aid have been the subject of much debate and criticism, both domestically and abroad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC_left/styles.css\" /&gt;\nForeign policy development.\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution grants power of foreign policy to the president of the United States, including powers to command the military, negotiate treaties, and appoint ambassadors. The Department of State carries out the president's foreign policy. The State Department is usually pulled between the wishes of Congress, and the wishes of the residing president. The Department of Defense carries out the president's military policy. The Central Intelligence Agency is an independent agency responsible for gathering intelligence on foreign activity. Some checks and balances are applied to the president's powers of foreign policy. Treaties negotiated by the president require ratification by the Senate to take force as United States law. The president's ambassadorial nominations also require Senate approval before taking office. Military actions must first be approved by both chambers of Congress.\nThe Constitution grants Congress the power to approve the president's picks for ambassadors and the power to declare war. The president is commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. He appoints a secretary of state and ambassadors with the advice and consent of the Senate. The secretary acts similarly to a foreign minister, because they are the primary conductor of foreign affairs. While foreign policy has varied slightly from president to president, there have generally been consistently similar goals throughout different administrations.\nGenerally speaking there are 4 schools of thought regarding foreign policy. First is Neo-Isolationists, who believe the United States should maintain a very narrow focus and avoid all involvement in the rest of the world. Second is selective-engagement which avoids all conflicts with other nations, and is semi-restrictive on its foreign policy. Third is cooperative security, which requires more involvement throughout the world, occasionally countering threats to the country. Finally is the idea of primacy which seeks to advance the United States well beyond all other nations of the world, placing it first in all matters.\n===International little of American foreign policy consists of international agreements made with other countries. Treaties are governed by the Treaty Clause of the United States Constitution. This clause dictates that the president negotiates treaties with other countries or political entities, and signs them. For a treaty to be ratified by the provisions of this clause, it must be approved by two-thirds of the United States Senate. Typically treaties are first discussed and voted on by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. If approved, the United States exchanges the instruments of ratification with the relevant foreign states. In \"Missouri v. Holland\", the Supreme Court ruled that the power to make treaties under the U.S. Constitution is a power separate from the other enumerated powers of the federal government, and hence the federal government can use treaties to legislate in areas which would otherwise fall within the exclusive authority of the states. Between 1789 and 1990, the Senate approved more than 1,500 treaties, rejected 21 and withdrew 85 without further action. As of 2019, 37 treaties were pending Senate approval.\nInternational agreements, sometimes also collectively referred to as treaties, can also be entered into by other mechanisms, though they have different legal implications than Senate-ratified treaties. The president can unilaterally make executive agreements. Under the Supreme Court decisions \"United States v. Pink\" (1942) and \"Reid v. Covert\" (1957), these have the force of law only to the degree they were made by exercising a power in the scope of the president's authority.\nCongressional-executive agreements are commonly used to enshrine the provisions of an international compact into federal law. Under this procedure, the executive branch negotiates the language, which is then approved by Congress and signed by the President as a regular piece of legislation, only requiring a simple majority of both houses. This procedure has been upheld by federal courts, though some scholars question its constitutionality because it bypasses the explicit Senate ratification procedure spelled out for treaties.\nThe State Department has taken the position that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties represents established law. Following ratification, the United States incorporates treaty law into the body of U.S. federal law. As a result, Congress can modify or repeal treaties after they are ratified. This can overrule an agreed-upon treaty obligation even if that is seen as a violation of the treaty under international law. Several U.S. court rulings confirmed this understanding, including Supreme Court decisions in \"Paquete Habana v. the United States\" (1900), and \"Reid v. Covert\" (1957), as well as a lower court ruling in \"Garcia-Mir v. Meese\" (1986). As a result of the \"Reid v. Covert\" decision, the United States adds a reservation to the text of every treaty that says in effect that the United States intends to abide by the treaty but that if the treaty is found to be in violation of the Constitution, the United States legally is then unable to abide by the treaty since the American signature would be \"ultra vires\".\nHistorical overview.\nThe main trend regarding the history of U.S. foreign policy since the American Revolution is the shift from non-interventionism before and after World War I, to its growth as a world power and global hegemon during World War II and throughout the Cold War in the 20th century. Since the 19th century, U.S. foreign policy also has been characterized by a shift from the realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. Over time, other themes, key goals, attitudes, or stances have been variously expressed by presidential 'doctrines'.\n18th century.\nForeign policy themes were expressed considerably in George Washington's farewell address; these included, among other things, observing good faith and justice towards all nations and cultivating peace and harmony with all, excluding both \"inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others\", \"steer[ing] clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world\", and advocating trade with all nations. Foreign policy in the first years of American independence constituted the balancing of relations with Great Britain and France. The Federalist Party supported Washington's foreign policy and sought close ties with Britain, but the Democratic-Republican Party favored France. Under the Federalist government of John Adams, the United States engaged in conflict with France in the Quasi-War, but the rival Jeffersonians feared Britain and favored France in the 1790s, declaring the War of 1812 on Britain. Jeffersonians vigorously opposed a large standing army and any navy until attacks against American shipping by Barbary corsairs spurred the country into developing a navy, resulting in the First Barbary War in 1801.\n19th century.\nAmerican foreign policy was mostly peaceful and marked by steady expansion of its foreign trade during the 19th century. As the Jeffersonians took power in the 1800s, they opposed a large standing army and any navy until attacks against American shipping by Barbary corsairs spurred the country into developing a naval force projection capability, resulting in the First Barbary War in 1801. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 doubled the nation's geographical area. The American policy of neutrality had caused tensions to rise with Britain in the Atlantic and with Native American nations in the frontier. This led to the War of 1812 and helped cement American foreign policy as independent of Europe. After the War of 1812, there were disagreements as to whether the United States should be isolated or be more involved in global activities.\nIn the 1820s, the Monroe Doctrine was established as the primary foreign policy doctrine of the United States, establishing Latin America as an American sphere of influence and rejecting European colonization in the region. The 1830s and 1840s were marked by increasing conflict with Mexico, exacerbated by the Texas annexation and culminating in the Mexican\u2013American War in 1846. Following the war, the United States claimed much of what is now the Southwestern United States, and the Gadsden Purchase further expanded this territory. Relations with Britain continued to be strained as a result of border conflicts until they were resolved by the Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty in 1842. The Perry Expedition of 1853 led to Japan establishing relations with the United States.\nThe Diplomacy of the American Civil War emphasized preventing European involvement in the war. During the Civil War, Spain and France defied the Monroe Doctrine and expanded their colonial influence in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, respectively. The Alaska Purchase was negotiated with Russia in 1867 and the Newlands Resolution annexed Hawaii in 1898. The Spanish\u2013American War took place during 1898, resulting in the United States claiming Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, and causing Spain to retract claims upon Cuba. Generally speaking the Foreign Policy of the United States during this era was anchored in a policy of wealth building for the nation.\n20th century.\nFollowing the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States entered the 20th century as an emerging great power with colonies in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Under Theodore Roosevelt, the United States adopted the Roosevelt Corollary, which indicated American willingness to use its military strength to end conflicts and wrongdoings in Latin America. Following the independence of Panama, the United States and Panama negotiated the construction of the Panama Canal, during which time the Panama Canal Zone was placed under American jurisdiction. The United States established the Open Door Policy with China during this time as well. The 20th century was marked by two world wars in which Allied powers, along with the United States, defeated their enemies, and through this participation the United States increased its international reputation.\nWorld War I and interbellum.\nEntry into World War I was a hotly debated issue in the 1916 presidential election. President Wilson's Fourteen Points was developed from his idealistic Wilsonianism program of spreading democracy and fighting militarism to prevent future wars. It became the basis of the German Armistice (which amounted to a military surrender) and the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The resulting Treaty of Versailles, due to European allies' punitive and territorial designs, showed insufficient conformity with these points, and the U.S. signed separate treaties with each of its adversaries; due to Senate objections also, the U.S. never joined the League of Nations, which was established as a result of Wilson's initiative. In the 1920s, the United States followed an independent course, and succeeded in a program of naval disarmament, and refunding the German economy. Operating outside the League it became a dominant player in diplomatic affairs. New York became the financial capital of the world, but the Wall Street Crash of 1929 hurled the Western industrialized world into the Great Depression. American trade policy relied on high tariffs under the Republicans, and reciprocal trade agreements under the Democrats, but in any case exports were at very low levels in the 1930s. Post WWI, the United States entered back into isolation from world events. This was largely due to the Great Depression of 1929.\nWorld War II.\nThe United States adopted an isolationist foreign policy from 1932 to 1938, but this position was challenged by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Franklin D. Roosevelt advocated strong support of the allies, establishing the United States as the Arsenal of Democracy by providing military equipment without entering the war. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States joined the allies as combatants in World War II.\nRoosevelt mentioned four fundamental freedoms, which ought to be enjoyed by people \"everywhere in the world\"; these included the freedom of speech and religion, as well as freedom from want and fear. Roosevelt helped establish terms for a post-war world among potential allies at the Atlantic Conference; specific points were included to correct earlier failures, which became a step toward the United Nations. American policy was to counter Japan, to force out of China, and to prevent attacking the Soviet Union. Japan reacted with an attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and the United States was at war with Japan, Germany, and Italy. Instead of the loans given to allies in World War I, the United States provided Lend-Lease grants of $50,000,000,000. Working closely with Winston Churchill of Britain, and Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, Roosevelt sent his forces into the Pacific against Japan, then into North Africa against Italy and Germany, and finally into Europe starting with France and Italy in 1944 against the Germans. The American economy roared forward, doubling industrial production, and building vast quantities of airplanes, ships, tanks, munitions, and, finally, the atomic bomb. The culmination of World War II ended in the defeat of Nazi Germany, and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The post World War II era saw the rise of the United States as the global leader, which necessitated an effort by the United States to instill liberal democracy around the world.\nCold War.\nAfter the war, the U.S. rose to become the dominant economic power with broad influence in much of the world, with the key policies of the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine. Almost immediately, two broad camps formed during the Cold War; one side was led by the U.S. and the other by the Soviet Union, but this situation also led to the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement. This period lasted until almost the end of the 20th century and is thought to be both an ideological and power struggle between the two superpowers. The United States extended its influence in the years after World War II, enacting the Marshall Plan to support the reconstruction process in European countries and seeking to combat Communism through containment. This strategy of containment resulted in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War in particular was highly controversial, and its perceived failures reduced popularity for foreign intervention in the United States. The invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union contributed directly to fueling tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. This began with President Carter announcing the United States interests in maintaining the status quo within the Persian Gulf region, resulting in the Carter Doctrine. The Regan administration escalated the tensions by supporting freedom fighters around the world, most notably in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion. The Soviet Union and the United States did not engage in direct conflict, but rather supported small proxies that opposed the other. In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved into separate nations, and the Cold War formally ended as the United States gave separate diplomatic recognition to the Russian Federation and other former Soviet states.\nIn domestic politics, foreign policy was not usually a central issue. In 1945\u20131970, the Democratic Party took a strong anti-Communist line and supported wars in Korea and Vietnam. Then the party split with a strong, \"dovish\", pacifist element (typified by 1972 presidential candidate George McGovern). Many \"hawks\", advocates for war, joined the neoconservative movement and started supporting the Republicans\u2014especially Reagan\u2014based on foreign policy. Meanwhile, down to 1952 the Republican Party was split between an isolationist wing, based in the Midwest and led by Senator Robert A. Taft, and an internationalist wing based in the East and led by Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the 1952 nomination largely on foreign policy grounds. Since then the Republicans have been characterized by American nationalism, strong opposition to Communism, and strong support for Israel.\n21st century.\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, the United States entered the 21st century as the sole superpower, though this status has been challenged by China, India, Russia, and the European Union. Substantial problems remain, such as climate change, nuclear proliferation, and the specter of international terrorism.\nThe September 11 attacks in 2001 caused a policy shift, in which America declared a \"war on terror\". The United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and invaded Iraq in 2003, emphasizing nation-building and the neutralization of terrorist threats in the Middle East. During the war on terror, the United States significantly expanded its military and intelligence capacities while also pursuing economic methods of targeting opposing governments. After a phased withdrawal from Iraq, In 2014, the Islamic State emerged as a major hostile power in the Middle East, and the United States led a military intervention in Iraq and Syria to combat it. The extended nature of American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has resulted in support for isolationism and reduced involvement in foreign conflicts.\nIn 2011, the United States led a NATO intervention in Libya. In 2013, disclosures of American surveillance programs revealed that United States intelligence policy included extensive global surveillance activities against foreign governments and citizens.\nIn 2017, diplomats from other countries developed new tactics to engage with President Donald Trump's brand of American nationalism. Peter Baker of \"The New York Times\" reported on the eve of his first foreign trip as president that the global diplomatic community had devised a strategy of keeping interactions brief, complimenting him, and giving him something he can consider a victory. Before the Trump presidency, foreign policy in the U.S. was the result of bipartisan consensus on an agenda of strengthening its position as the number one power. That consensus has since fractured, with Republican and Democratic politicians increasingly calling for a more restrained approach. Foreign policy under the Trump administration involved heightened tensions with Iran, a trade war through increased tariffs, and a reduced role in international organizations.\nAdvancing a \"Free and Open Indo-Pacific\" has become the core of the U.S. national security strategy and has been embraced by both Democratic and Republican administrations. The United States ended its wars in the Greater Middle East with the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Unlike the Trump administration, which is more concerned with containing China's influence, foreign policy of the Biden-Harris administration shifted to an increased focus on Russia following the attempted Russian election interference in 2016 and developments in the Russo-Ukrainian War. With the rise of Russia and China as co-superpowers, the United States has had to shift its relations to more cooperation rather than coercion, with Russia and China pursuing a more self serving global system.\nIn early 2023, when China brokered the long-awaited reconciliation of Saudi-Arabia Iran relations, the U.S. found itself on the sidelines of political developments in the Middle East. The JCPOA, which attempted to control the nuclear capabilities of Iran, was not fully reinstated after the Trump administration abandoned the international agreement supported by European powers in 2018. As China attempted to fill this vacuum, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine further tested the international alliances with the U.S. Iran and other larger powers such as India as well as Arab nations did not adopt any of the economic sanctions imposed on Russia but to the contrary, increased their economic and strategic alliances with Russia or China. As China is focussing primarily on the global expansion of its economy, Russia was able to maintain its military and energy-related influence not only in Asia but also in Africa and South America. With regard to the Middle East, trade from these nations with China is three times greater than the trade with the U.S. As China is extending its mid-East reach, Russia despite its battered economy from sanctions still remains influential in South America with trade relations that are difficult to deconstruct through U.S. American influence. While China's influence in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Africa is still hindered by commercial and currency-related U.S. trade policies, it is perceived more and more as a peace negotiator than a communist aggressor, particularly outside of Europe and North America. While the U.S. still upholds its moral dominance by advocating for democracy, its foreign policies are increasingly marked by a perceived inability to defend its image as an exporter of peace and prosperity.\nIn a July 2025 meeting with High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas, Director of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Foreign Affairs Commission Office Wang Yi stated that China did not want to see Russia's loss in Ukraine. The diplomats reported, China fears the United States could focus more on Asia, once the conflict in Europe is over.\nThe Trump administration boycotted the November 2025 summit with G20 leaders, which took place in South Africa.\nDiplomatic policy.\nThe diplomatic policy of the United States is created by the president and carried out by the Department of State. The department's stated mission is to \"protect and promote U.S. security, prosperity, and democratic values and shape an international environment in which all Americans can thrive.\" Its objectives during the 2022-2026 period include renewing U.S. leadership, promoting global prosperity, strengthening democratic institutions, revitalizing the diplomatic workforce and institutions, and serving U.S. citizens abroad. As of 2022, the United States has bilateral relations with all but four United Nations members.\nThe United States government emphasizes human rights in foreign policy. Annual reports produced by the Department of State, such as \"Advancing Freedom and Democracy\" and the \"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices\", track the status of human rights around the world. The National Endowment for Democracy provides financial aid to promote democracy internationally.\nInternational agreements.\nThe United States is party to thousands of international agreements with other countries, territories, and international organizations. These include arms control agreements, human rights treaties, environmental protocols, and free trade agreements. Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States also maintains a relationship of free association with the countries of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, grants the United States military access to the countries in exchange for military protection, foreign aid, and access domestic American agencies.\nThe United States is a member of many international organizations. It is a founding member of the United Nations and holds a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. The United States is also a member of other global organizations, including the World Trade Organization. Regional organizations in which the United States is a member include NATO, Organization of American States, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. As the largest economy in the world, the United States is also a member of organizations for the most developed nations, including the OECD, the Group of Seven, and the G20.\nNon-participation in multi-lateral agreements.\nThe United States notably does not participate in various international agreements adhered to by almost all other industrialized countries, by almost all the countries of the Americas, or by almost all other countries in the world. With a large population and economy, on a practical level this can undermine the effect of certain agreements, or give other countries a precedent to cite for non-participation in various agreements.\nIn some cases the arguments against participation include that the United States should maximize its sovereignty and freedom of action, or that ratification would create a basis for lawsuits that would treat American citizens unfairly. In other cases, the debate became involved in domestic political issues, such as gun control, climate change, and the death penalty.\nExamples include:\nForeign aid.\nForeign assistance is a core component of the State Department's international affairs budget, and aid is considered an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy. There are four major categories of non-military foreign assistance: bilateral development aid, economic assistance supporting U.S. political and security goals, humanitarian aid, and multilateral economic contributions (for example, contributions to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund). In absolute dollar terms, the United States government is the largest international aid donor. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) manages the bulk of bilateral economic assistance, while the Treasury Department handles most multilateral aid. Foreign aid is a highly partisan issue in the United States, with liberals, on average, supporting foreign aid much more than conservatives do.\nThe United States first began distributing regular foreign aid in the aftermath of World War II and the onset of the Cold War. Foreign aid has been used to foster closer relations with foreign nations, strengthen countries that could potentially become future allies and trading partners, and provide assistance for people of countries most in need. American foreign aid contributed to the Green Revolution in the 1960s and the democratization of Taiwan and Colombia. Since the 1970s, issues of human rights have become increasingly important in American foreign policy, and several acts of Congress served to restrict foreign aid from governments that \"engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights\". In 2011, President Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. In the 2019 fiscal year, the United States spent $39.2 billion in foreign aid, constituting less than one percent of the federal budget.\nWar on drugs.\nUnited States foreign policy is influenced by the efforts of the U.S. government to control imports of illicit drugs, including cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and cannabis. This is especially true in Latin America, a focus for the U.S. war on drugs. These foreign policy efforts date back to at least the 1900s, when the U.S. banned the importation of non-medical opium and participated in the 1909 International Opium Commission, one of the first international drug conferences.\nOver a century later, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act requires the President to identify the major drug transit or major illicit drug-producing countries. In September 2005, the following countries were identified: Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Two of these, Burma and Venezuela are countries that the U.S. considers to have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements during the previous 12 months. Notably absent from the 2005 list were Afghanistan, the People's Republic of China and Vietnam; Canada was also omitted in spite of evidence that criminal groups there are increasingly involved in the production of MDMA destined for the United States and that large-scale cross-border trafficking of Canadian-grown cannabis continues. The U.S. believes that the Netherlands are successfully countering the production and flow of MDMA to the U.S.\nIn 2011, overdose deaths in the U.S. were on a decline mostly due to interdiction efforts and international cooperation to reduce the production of illicit drugs. Since about 2014, a reversal of this trend could be clearly seen as legal semi-synthetic opioids and cocaine stimulants were replaced by the fully synthetic fentanyl and methamphetamine. By 2022, overdose deaths caused by illicit fentanyl led to the worst drug crisis the U.S. has ever experienced in its history, with 1,500 people dying every week of overdose-related cases. By 2022, deaths caused by fentanyl significantly reduced the life expectancy in the U.S. and were also seen as a major drag on the U.S. economy. Despite efforts to control the trade of chemicals used in the synthesis of fentanyl, the tide of fentanyl-related deaths continues to be a major threat to U.S. national security.\nRegional diplomacy.\nAfrica.\nAmerican involvement with Africa has historically been limited. During the war on terror, the United States increased its activities in Africa to fight terrorism in conjunction with African countries as well as to support democracy in Africa through the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Africa has also been the subject of competition between American and Chinese investment strategies. In 2007 the U.S. was sub-Saharan Africa's largest single export market accounting for 28% of exports (second in total to the EU at 31%). 81% of U.S. imports from this region were petroleum products.\nAsia.\nAmerica's relations with Asia have tended to be based on a \"hub and spoke\" model instead of multilateral relations, using a series of bilateral relationships where states coordinate with the United States instead of through a unified bloc. On May 30, 2009, at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates urged the nations of Asia to build on this hub and spoke model as they established and grew multilateral institutions such as ASEAN, APEC and the ad hoc arrangements in the area. In 2011, Gates said the United States must serve as the \"indispensable nation\", for building multilateral cooperation. As of 2022, the Department of Defense considers China to be the greatest threat to the policy goals of the United States.\nCanada.\nCanada has historically been a close ally to the United States, and their foreign policies often work in conjunction. The armed forces of Canada and the United States have a high level of interoperability, and domestic air force operations have been fully integrated between the two countries through NORAD. Almost all of Canada's energy exports go to the United States, making it the largest foreign source of U.S. energy imports; Canada is consistently among the top sources for U.S. oil imports, and it is the largest source of U.S. natural gas and electricity imports. Trade between the United States and Canada as well as Mexico is facilitated through the USMCA.\nEurope.\nThe United States has close ties with the European Union, and it is a member of NATO along with several European countries. The United States has close relations with most countries of Europe. Much of American foreign policy has involved combating the Soviet Union in the 20th century and Russia in the 21st century.\nLatin America.\nThe Monroe Doctrine has historically made up the foreign policy of the United States in regard to Latin America. Under this policy, the United States would consider Latin America to be under its sphere of influence and defend Latin American countries from European hostilities. The United States was heavily involved in the politics of Panama during the early 20th century in order to construct the Panama Canal. Cuba was an ally of the United States following its independence, but it was identified as a major national security threat following the Cuban Revolution; Cuba\u2013United States relations remain poor.\nMiddle East.\nThe Middle East region was first proclaimed to be of national interest to the United States during World War II, and relations were secured with Saudi Arabia to secure additional oil supplies. The Middle East continued to be regarded as an area of vital importance to the United States during the Cold War, and American containment policy emphasized preventing Soviet influence from taking hold in the Middle East. The Truman, Eisenhower, and Nixon Doctrines all played roles in the formulation of the Carter Doctrine, which stated that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its national interests in the Persian Gulf region. Carter's successor, President Ronald Reagan, extended the policy in October 1981 with the Reagan Doctrine, which proclaimed that the United States would intervene to protect Saudi Arabia, whose security was threatened after the outbreak of the Iran\u2013Iraq War. During the so-called war on terror, the United States increased its involvement in the region; some analysts have argued that the implementation of the Carter Doctrine and the Reagan Doctrine also played a role in the outbreak of the 2003 Iraq War.\nTwo-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves are estimated to be found in the Persian Gulf, and the United States imports oil from several Middle Eastern countries. While its imports have exceeded domestic production since the early 1990s, new hydraulic fracturing techniques and discovery of shale oil deposits in Canada and the American Dakotas offer the potential for increased energy independence from oil exporting countries such as OPEC.\nOceania.\nAustralia and New Zealand are close allies of the United States. Together, the three countries compose the ANZUS collective security agreement. The United States and the United Kingdom also have a separate agreement, AUKUS, with Australia. After it captured the islands from Japan during World War II, the United States administered the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1947 to 1986 (1994 for Palau). The Northern Mariana Islands became a U.S. territory (part of the United States), while Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau became independent countries. Each has signed a Compact of Free Association that gives the United States exclusive military access in return for U.S. defense protection and conduct of military foreign affairs (except the declaration of war) and a few billion dollars of aid. These agreements also generally allow citizens of these countries to live and work in the United States with their spouses (and vice versa), and provide for largely free trade. The federal government also grants access to services from domestic agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Weather Service, the United States Postal Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and U.S. representation to the International Frequency Registration Board of the International Telecommunication Union.\nDefense policy.\nDefense policy of the United States is established by the president under the role of commander-in-chief, and it is carried out by the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. As of 2022, the stated objective of the Department of Defense is to deter attacks against the United States and its allies in order to protect the American people, expand America's prosperity, and defend democratic values. The department recognizes China as the greatest foreign threat to the United States, with Russia, North Korea, Iran, and violent extremist organizations recognized as other major foreign threats. Most American troops stationed in foreign countries operate in non-combat roles. As of 2021, about 173,000 troops are deployed in 159 countries. Japan, Germany, and South Korea are host to the largest numbers of American troops due to continued military cooperation following World War II and the Korean War. The United States has not been involved in a major war since the conclusion of the War in Afghanistan in 2021, though American forces continue to operate against terrorist groups in the Middle East and Africa through the Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001. The United States also provides billions of dollars of military aid to allied countries each year.\nThe Constitution of the United States requires that Congress authorize any military conflict initiated by the president. This has been carried out through formal declarations of war, Congressional authorizations without formal declaration, and through United Nations Security Council Resolutions that are legally recognized by Congress. The War Powers Resolution of 1973 limited the ability of the president to use the military without Congressional authorization. Prior to 2001, 125 instances of American presidents using military force without Congressional authorization had been identified. Since 2001, the Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001 (AUMF) has granted the president the power to engage in military conflict with any country, organization, or person that was involved in carrying out the September 11 attacks. American presidents have since interpreted the AUMF to authorize military campaigns against terrorist groups associated with al-Qaeda in several countries.\nAlliances and partnerships.\nThe Department of Defense considers cooperation with American allies and partners to be \"critical\" to achieving American defense objectives. The department makes a distinction between alliances, which are formal military agreements between countries through a treaty, and strategic partnerships, which are military cooperation agreements that aren't bound by specific terms. The United States military works in cooperation with many national governments, and the United States has approximately 750 military bases in at least 80 different countries. In addition to military agreements, the United States is a member of multiple international disarmament organizations, including the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\nThe United States is a founding member of NATO, an alliance of 29 North American and European nations formed to defend Western Europe against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Under the NATO charter, the United States legally recognizes any attack on a NATO member as an attack on all NATO members. The United States is also a founding member of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, an alliance of 19 North and South American nations. The United States is one of the three members of ANZUS, along with Australia and New Zealand, and it also has military alliances with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Thailand. Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States is responsible for the defense of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. The United States has also designated several countries as major non-NATO allies. These are countries that are not members of NATO but are granted certain privileges in regard to defense trade and security cooperation, including eligibility for certain trade deals and research collaboration. The president is empowered to designate additional foreign countries as major non-NATO allies.\nSince it became a superpower in the mid-20th century, the United States has primarily carried out defense operations by leading and participating in multilateral coalitions. These coalitions may be constructed around existing defensive alliances, such as NATO, or through separate coalitions constructed through diplomatic negotiations and acting in a common interest. The United States has not engaged in unilateral military action since the invasion of Panama in 1989. United States military action may take place in accordance with or in opposition to the wishes of the United Nations. The United States has opposed the expansion of United Nations peacekeeping beyond its previous scope, instead supporting the use of multilateral coalitions in hostile countries and territories.\nMilitary aid.\nThe U.S. provides military aid through many channels, including direct funding, support for training, or distribution of military equipment. Military aid spending has varied over time, with spending reaching as high as $35 billion in 1952, adjusted for inflation. The United States established a cohesive military aid policy during World War II, when the Lend-Lease program was implemented to support the Allied powers. After the war, the United States continued to provide military aid in line with other foreign aid programs to support American allies. Programs such as Foreign Military Financing and Foreign Military Sales oversee distribution of military aid.\nAccording to a 2016 report by the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. topped the market in global weapon sales for 2015, with $40\u00a0billion sold. The largest buyers were Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Pakistan, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq. In 2020, the United States distributed $11.6 billion in military aid, the lowest since 2004. Military aid is one of the main forms of foreign aid, with 23% of American foreign aid in 2020 taking the form of military aid. Afghanistan was the primary recipient of American military aid in the 2010s. In 2022, military aid policy in the United States shifted from Afghanistan to Ukraine following the end of the War in Afghanistan and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of 2021, the United States has military bases in at least 80 countries.\nThe table below outlines the ten largest recipients of United States military aid in 2020 and their estimated aid in billions.\nMissile defense.\nThe Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was a proposal by U.S. President Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983 to use ground and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles, later dubbed \"Star Wars\". The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). Though it was never fully developed or deployed, the research and technologies of SDI paved the way for some anti-ballistic missile systems of today.\nIn February 2007, the U.S. started formal negotiations with Poland and Czech Republic concerning construction of missile shield installations in those countries for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system (in April 2007, 57% of Poles opposed the plan). According to press reports, the government of the Czech Republic agreed (while 67% Czechs disagree) to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors is supposed to be built in Poland.\nRussia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on the Russia's border with NATO if the United States refuses to abandon plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech Republic. In April 2007, Putin warned of a new Cold War if the Americans deployed the shield in Central Europe. Putin also said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under an Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 with the United States.\nOn August 14, 2008, the United States and Poland announced a deal to implement the missile defense system in Polish territory, with a tracking system placed in the Czech Republic. \"The fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between Russia and the United States over the situation in Georgia shows that, of course, the missile defense system will be deployed not against Iran but against the strategic potential of Russia\", Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's NATO envoy, said.\nKeir A. Lieber and Daryl G. Press, argue in Foreign Affairs that U.S. missile defenses are designed to secure Washington's nuclear primacy and are chiefly directed at potential rivals, such as Russia and China. The authors note that Washington continues to eschew nuclear first strike and contend that deploying missile defenses \"would be valuable primarily in an offensive context, not a defensive one; as an adjunct to a US First Strike capability, not as a stand-alone shield\":\nIf the United States launched a nuclear attack against Russia (or China), the targeted country would be left with only a tiny surviving arsenal, if any at all. At that point, even a relatively modest or inefficient missile defense system might well be enough to protect against any retaliatory strikes.\nThis analysis is corroborated by the Pentagon's 1992 Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), prepared by then Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and his deputies. The DPG declares that the United States should use its power to \"prevent the reemergence of a new rival\" either on former Soviet territory or elsewhere. The authors of the Guidance determined that the United States had to \"Field a missile defense system as a shield against accidental missile launches or limited missile strikes by 'international outlaws'\" and also must \"Find ways to integrate the 'new democracies' of the former Soviet bloc into the U.S.-led system\". The National Archive notes that Document 10 of the DPG includes wording about \"disarming capabilities to destroy\" which is followed by several blacked out words. \"This suggests that some of the heavily excised pages in the still-classified DPG drafts may include some discussion of preventive action against threatening nuclear and other WMD programs.\"\nRobert David English, writing in \"Foreign Affairs\", observes that the DPG's second recommendation has also been proceeding on course. \"Washington has pursued policies that have ignored Russian interests (and sometimes international law as well) in order to encircle Moscow with military alliances and trade blocs conducive to U.S. interests.\"\nOn September 12, 2024, the U.S. disclosed that Russia obtained ballistic missiles from Iran for its war in Ukraine, leading to new sanctions on Russian entities involved. The U.S. also targeted Iran Air and other organizations linked to Iran\u2019s missile activities, though Iran denies supplying the weapons. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Ukraine and Poland to discuss further support, as Ukraine urges stronger actions.\nExporting democracy.\nStudies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U.S. in exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations. Until recently, scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U.S. attempts to export democracy have been \"negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive\". Other studies find U.S. intervention has had mixed results, and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries.\nIntelligence policy.\nIntelligence policy is developed by the president and carried out by the United States Intelligence Community, led by the Director of National Intelligence. The Intelligence Community includes 17 offices and bureaus within various executive departments as well as the Central Intelligence Agency. Its stated purpose is to utilize insights, protected information, and understanding of adversaries to advance national security, economic strength, and technological superiority.\nThe Intelligence Community provides support for all diplomatic and military action undertaken by the United States and serves to inform government and military decision-making, as well as collecting and analyzing global economic and environmental information. The primary functions of the Intelligence Community are the collection and analysis of information, and it is responsible for collecting information on foreign subjects that is not available publicly or through diplomatic channels. Collection of information typically takes the form of signals intelligence, imagery intelligence, and human intelligence. Information collected by American intelligence is used to counter foreign intelligence, terrorism, narcotics trafficking, WMD proliferation, and international organized crime.\nCounterintelligence.\nThe Intelligence Community is responsible for counterintelligence to protect the United States from foreign intelligence services. The Central Intelligence Agency is responsible for counterintelligence activities abroad, while the Federal Bureau of Investigation is responsible for combating foreign intelligence operations in the United States. The goal of American counterintelligence is to protect classified government information as well as trade secrets of American industry. Offensive counterintelligence operations undertaken by the United States include recruiting foreign intelligence agents, monitoring suspected foreign agents, and collecting information on the intentions of foreign intelligence services, while defensive counterintelligence operations include investigating suspected cases of espionage and producing analyses of foreign intelligence threats.\nCounterintelligence operations in the United States began when the Espionage Act of 1917 was used to prosecute German infiltrators and saboteurs during World War I. Today, counterintelligence is applied in the United States as a tool of national security. Due to its global influence, the United States is considered to be the world's greatest target for intelligence operations. Terrorists, tyrants, foreign adversaries, and economic competitors have all been found to engage in \"a range of intelligence activities\" directed against the United States. Terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda have been found to employ intelligence practices similar to those of foreign powers, and American counterintelligence operations play a significant role in counterterrorism.\nCovert action.\nIn addition to intelligence gathering, the Central Intelligence Agency is authorized by the National Security Act of 1947 to engage in covert action. Covert action is undertaken to influence conditions in foreign countries without evidence of American involvement. This may include enacting propaganda campaigns, offering support to factions within a country, providing logistical assistance to foreign governments, or disrupting illegal activities. The use of covert action is controversial within the Intelligence Community due to the potential harm to foreign relations and public image, but most individuals involved in American intelligence cite it as an \"essential\" option to prevent terrorism, drug trafficking, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\nExamples of covert involvement in regime change.\nUnited States foreign policy also includes covert actions to topple foreign governments that have been opposed to the United States. According to J. Dana Stuster, writing in \"Foreign Policy\", there are seven \"confirmed cases\" where the U.S.\u2014acting principally through the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), but sometimes with the support of other parts of the U.S. government, including the Navy and State Department\u2014covertly assisted in the overthrow of a foreign government: Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Congo in 1960, the Dominican Republic in 1961, South Vietnam in 1963, Brazil in 1964, and Chile in 1973. Stuster states that this list excludes \"U.S.-supported insurgencies and failed assassination attempts\" such as those directed against Cuba's Fidel Castro, as well as instances where U.S. involvement has been alleged but not proven (such as Syria in 1949).\nIn 1953, the CIA, working with the British government, initiated \"Operation Ajax\" against the Prime Minister of Iran Mohammad Mossadegh who had attempted to nationalize Iran's oil, threatening the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This had the effect of restoring and strengthening the authoritarian monarchical reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. In 1957, the CIA and Israeli Mossad aided the Iranian government in establishing its intelligence service, SAVAK, later blamed for the torture and execution of the regime's opponents.\nA year later, in \"Operation PBSuccess\", the CIA assisted the local military in toppling the democratically elected left-wing government of Jacobo \u00c1rbenz in Guatemala and installing the military dictator Carlos Castillo Armas. The United Fruit Company lobbied for \u00c1rbenz's overthrow as his land reforms jeopardized their land holdings in Guatemala, and painted these reforms as a communist threat. The coup triggered a decades long civil war which claimed the lives of an estimated 200,000 people (42,275 individual cases have been documented), mostly through 626 massacres against the Maya population perpetrated by the U.S.-backed Guatemalan military. An independent Historical Clarification Commission found that U.S. corporations and government officials \"exercised pressure to maintain the country's archaic and unjust socio-economic structure\", and that U.S. military assistance had a \"significant bearing on human rights violations during the armed confrontation\".\nDuring the massacre of at least 500,000 alleged communists in 1960s Indonesia, U.S. government officials encouraged and applauded the mass killings while providing covert assistance to the Indonesian military which helped facilitate them. This included the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta supplying Indonesian forces with lists of up to 5,000 names of suspected members of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), who were subsequently killed in the massacres. In 2001, the CIA attempted to prevent the publication of the State Department volume \"Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964\u20131968\", which documents the U.S. role in providing covert assistance to the Indonesian military for the express purpose of the extirpation of the PKI. In July 2016, an international panel of judges ruled the killings constitute crimes against humanity, and that the US, along with other Western governments, were complicit in these crimes.\nIn 1970, the CIA worked with coup-plotters in Chile in the attempted kidnapping of General Ren\u00e9 Schneider, who was targeted for refusing to participate in a military coup upon the election of Salvador Allende. Schneider was shot in the botched attempt and died three days later. The CIA later paid the group $35,000 for the failed kidnapping.\nAccording to one peer-reviewed study, the U.S. intervened in 81 foreign elections between 1946 and 2000.\nThe failed 1961 CIA Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba was an attempt by the U.S. government to overthrow a regime. Not only did this cause a diplomatic embarrassment, it also damaged the CIA's credibility internationally.\nPublic image.\nUnited States foreign policy has been the subject of debate, receiving praise and criticism domestically and abroad. As of 2019, public opinion in the United States is closely divided on American involvement in world affairs. 53% of Americans wish for the United States to be active in world affairs, while 46% of Americans wish for less involvement overseas. American involvement in the global economy is received more positively by the American people, with 73% considering it to be a \"good thing\".\nGlobal opinion.\nOverall, the United States is viewed positively by the rest of the world. The Eurasia Group Foundation reported that as of 2021, 85% of respondents from 10 countries have a favorable opinion of the United States and 81% favor American hegemony over Chinese hegemony. Those with an unfavorable view of the United States most commonly cited interventionism, and in particular the War in Afghanistan, as their reason. It was also found that the exercise of soft power increased favorable opinions while the exercise of hard power decreased favorable opinions. Citizens of Brazil, Nigeria, and India were found to have more favorable opinions of the United States, while citizens of China and Germany were found to have less favorable opinions of the United States.\nInternational opinion about the US has often changed with different executive administrations. For example, in 2009, the French public favored the United States when President Barack Obama (75% favorable) replaced President George W. Bush (42%). After President Donald Trump took the helm in 2017, French public opinion about the US fell from 63% to 46%. These trends were also seen in other European countries. According to the 2025 Pew report, trust in the US president in high-income countries has fallen from 53% in 2024, when US President Joe Biden was in power, to 22% after Trump returned to the White House.\nMany democracies have voluntary military ties with the United States. See NATO, ANZUS, U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Mutual Defense Treaty with South Korea, and Major non-NATO ally. Those nations with military alliances with the U.S. can spend less on the military since they can count on U.S. protection. This may give a false impression that the U.S. is less peaceful than those nations. A 2013 global poll in 65 countries found that the United States is perceived as the biggest threat to world peace, with 24% of respondents identifying it as such. A majority of Russian respondents named the United States as the greatest threat, as well as significant minorities in China, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Argentina, Greece, Turkey, and Pakistan.\nA 2025 Pew survey in 24 countries, including 10 European countries, found that the share of respondents who have a positive view of the United States had declined in most of them compared to 2024. According to a 2025 Pew survey conducted in 25 countries, only 35% of respondents had a positive view of the United States, down from 51% in 2024.\nForeign intervention.\nEmpirical studies (see democide) have found that democracies, including the United States, inflict significantly fewer civilian casualties than dictatorships. Media may be biased against the U.S. regarding reporting human rights violations. Studies have found that \"The New York Times\" coverage of worldwide human rights violations predominantly focuses on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear U.S. involvement, while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations. For example, the bloodiest war in recent time, involving eight nations and killing millions of civilians, was the Second Congo War, which was almost completely ignored by the media.\nJournalists and human rights organizations have been critical of US-led airstrikes and targeted killings by drones which have in some cases resulted in collateral damage of civilian populations. In early 2017, the U.S. faced criticism from some scholars, activists and media outlets for dropping 26,171 bombs on seven countries throughout 2016: Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan.\nResearch on the democratic peace theory has generally found that democracies, including the United States, have not made war on one another. There have been U.S. support for coups against some democracies, but for example Spencer R. Weart argues that part of the explanation was the perception, correct or not, that these states were turning into Communist dictatorships. Also important was the role of rarely transparent United States government agencies, who sometimes mislead or did not fully implement the decisions of elected civilian leaders.\nCritics from the left cite episodes that undercut leftist governments or showed support for Israel. Others cite human rights abuses and violations of international law. Critics have charged that the U.S. presidents have used democracy to justify military intervention abroad. Critics also point to declassified records which indicate that the CIA under Allen Dulles and the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover aggressively recruited more than 1,000 Nazis, including those responsible for war crimes, to use as spies and informants against the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\nStudies have been devoted to the historical success rate of the U.S. in exporting democracy abroad. Some studies of American intervention have been pessimistic about the overall effectiveness of U.S. efforts to encourage democracy in foreign nations. Some scholars have generally agreed with international relations professor Abraham Lowenthal that U.S. attempts to export democracy have been \"negligible, often counterproductive, and only occasionally positive\". Other studies find U.S. intervention has had mixed results, and another by Hermann and Kegley has found that military interventions have improved democracy in other countries.\nAmerica's history of non-intervention has been criticized as well. In his World Policy Journal review of Bill Kauffman's 1995 book \"America First! Its History, Culture, and Politics\", Benjamin Schwartz described America's history of isolationism as a \"tragedy\" and being rooted in Puritan thinking.\nToday the U.S. states that democratic nations best support U.S. national interests. According to the U.S. State Department, \"Democracy is the one national interest that helps to secure all the others. Democratically governed nations are more likely to secure the peace, deter aggression, expand open markets, promote economic development, protect American citizens, combat international terrorism and crime, uphold human and worker rights, avoid humanitarian crises and refugee flows, improve the global environment, and protect human health.\" According to former U.S. President Bill Clinton, \"Ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack each other.\" In one view mentioned by the U.S. State Department, democracy is also good for business. Countries that embrace political reforms are also more likely to pursue economic reforms that improve the productivity of businesses. Accordingly, since the mid-1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, there has been an increase in levels of foreign direct investment going to emerging market democracies relative to countries that have not undertaken political reforms. Leaked cables in 2010 suggested that the \"dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States' relations with the world\".\nThe United States officially maintains that it supports democracy and human rights through several tools. Examples of these tools are as follows:\nSupport for authoritarian governments.\nBoth currently and historically, the United States has been willing to cooperate with authoritarian governments to pursue its geopolitical goals. The U.S. has faced criticism for backing right-wing dictators that systematically violated human rights, such as Augusto Pinochet of Chile, Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay, Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt of Guatemala, Jorge Rafael Videla of Argentina, Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 of Chad Yahya Khan of Pakistan, and Suharto of Indonesia. Critics have also accused the United States of facilitating and supporting state terrorism in the Global South during the Cold War, such as Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terror organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America.\nRegarding support for certain anti-Communist dictatorships during the Cold War, a response is that they were seen as a necessary evil, with the alternatives even worse Communist or fundamentalist dictatorships. David Schmitz says this policy did not serve U.S. interests. Friendly tyrants resisted necessary reforms and destroyed the political center (though not in South Korea), while the 'realist' policy of coddling dictators brought a backlash among foreign populations with long memories. Some critical scholars and journalists, including Jason Hickel and Vincent Bevins, argue that the U.S. backed such dictators in order to reinforce Western business interests and to expand capitalism into countries of the Global South who were attempting to pursue alternative paths.\nThe U.S. has been accused of complicity in war crimes for backing the Saudi Arabian-led intervention into the Yemeni Civil War, which has triggered a humanitarian catastrophe, including a cholera outbreak and millions facing starvation.\nNiall Ferguson argues that the U.S. is incorrectly blamed for all of the human rights violations perpetrated by U.S.-supported governments. Ferguson writes that there is general agreement that Guatemala was the worst of the U.S.-backed regimes during the Cold War, but the U.S. cannot be credibly blamed for all of the estimated 200,000 deaths during the long Guatemalan Civil War. The U.S. Intelligence Oversight Board writes that military aid was cut for long periods because of such violations, that the U.S. helped stop a coup in 1993, and that efforts were made to improve the conduct of the security services.\nHuman rights.\nSince the 1970s, issues of human rights have become increasingly important in American foreign policy. Congress took the lead in the 1970s. Following the Vietnam War, the feeling that U.S. foreign policy had grown apart from traditional American values was seized upon by Representative Donald M. Fraser (D, MN), leading the Subcommittee on International Organizations and Movements, in criticizing Republican Foreign Policy under the Nixon administration. In the early 1970s, Congress concluded the Vietnam War and passed the War Powers Act. As \"part of a growing assertiveness by Congress about many aspects of Foreign Policy\", human rights concerns became a battleground between the Legislative and the Executive branches in the formulation of foreign policy. David Forsythe points to three specific, early examples of Congress interjecting its own thoughts on foreign policy:\nThese measures were repeatedly used by Congress, with varying success, to affect U.S. foreign policy towards the inclusion of Human Rights concerns. Specific examples include El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and South Africa. The Executive (from Nixon to Reagan) argued that the Cold War required placing regional security in favor of U.S. interests over any behavioral concerns of national allies. Congress argued the opposite, in favor of distancing the United States from oppressive regimes. Nevertheless, according to historian Daniel Goldhagen, during the last two decades of the Cold War, the number of American client states practicing mass murder outnumbered those of the Soviet Union. John Henry Coatsworth, a historian of Latin America and the provost of Columbia University, suggests the number of repression victims in Latin America alone far surpassed that of the USSR and its East European satellites during the period 1960 to 1990. W. John Green contends that the United States was an \"essential enabler\" of \"Latin America's political murder habit, bringing out and allowing to flourish some of the region's worst tendencies\".\nOn December 6, 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. He also criticized Russia's law discriminating against gays, joining other western leaders in the boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia.\nIn June 2014, a Chilean court ruled that the United States played a key role in the murders of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, both American citizens, shortly after the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7565", "revid": "51024399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7565", "title": "Christmas in Poland", "text": "Christmas in Poland, known in the Polish language as Bo\u017ce Narodzenie (God's Birth) or Gwiazdka (Little Star), is a major annual celebration, as in most countries of the Christian world. The observance of Christmas in Poland developed gradually over the centuries, beginning in ancient times; combining old Polish pagan customs with the religious practice introduced after the Christianization of Poland by the Catholic Church. Later influences include the mutual permeating of local traditions, lore, and folk culture. It is one of the most important religious holidays for Poles, who follow strict traditional customs, some of which are not found elsewhere in Europe.\nThe Day of Saint Nicholas on 6 December is the unofficial beginning of the festive season in Poland. Well-behaved children receive small gifts on the day, whereas naughty children receive a lump of coal or a \"r\u00f3zga\" twig. The highlight of the holiday is Christmas Eve on 24 December; Christmas trees are traditionally decorated and lit in family rooms on the morning of Christmas Eve. The Polish Wigilia supper begins with the appearance of the first star, which corresponds to the Star of Bethlehem. During preparation, hay is spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Jesus Christ was born in a manger. An empty place setting is left symbolically at the table for the Lord or lost wanderer. The supper begins with the breaking of the Christmas wafer (\"op\u0142atek\"). The meals must be vegetarian (with the exception of fish) as a sign of fasting and twelve different dishes are prepared, thus symbolizing the Twelve Apostles. The celebration ends with the exchange of presents and a midnight mass in churches.\nOther aspects of Polish Christmas include nativity plays called \"Jase\u0142ka\" or \"Herody\", outdoor nativity scenes, the singing of carols, notably \"God Is Born\" or \"Midst Quiet Night\", and Kulig, a horse-pulled sleigh ride. The tradition of crafting and hand-making Christmas szopkas in Krak\u00f3w was declared UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage.\nAdvent.\nAmong the special tasks carried out in private homes during Advent (a time of waiting for the celebration of the Nativity of Jesus) is the baking of the Christmas piernik (gingerbread), and the making of Christmas decorations. Pierniks are made in a variety of shapes, including hearts, animals, and St. Nicholas figures. St. Nicholas does not play a major role on Christmas Day, but is celebrated on his Saint feast day of December 6. He visits good children in secret and leaves presents for them.\nTraditionally, the Christmas trees are decorated with glass baubles, garlands and many homemade ornaments including painted eggshells, shiny red apples, walnuts, wrapped chocolate shapes, candles, etc. They are lit on Christmas Eve before Wigilia. At the top of each tree there is a star or a glittering tree topper. In many homes, sparklers are hung on the branches of the trees for wintery ambiance. Sometimes the trees are left standing until February 2, the feast day of St. Mary of the Candle of Lighting.\nDuring Advent and all the way until Epiphany, or the baptism of Jesus (day of January 6), the \"gwiazdory\", or the star carriers walk through the villages. Some of them sing carols; others recite verses or put on \"szopki\", or \"herody\" (nativity scenes). The last two customs are inspired by the traditional manger scenes or \"Jase\u0142ka\" (crib). One tradition unique to Poland and Lithuania is the sharing of the \"op\u0142atek\", a thin wafer into which a holy picture is pressed. In the old days, people carried these wafers from house to house wishing their neighbors a Merry Christmas. Nowadays, op\u0142atek is mostly shared with members of the family and immediate neighbors before the Christmas Eve supper (Wigilia in the Polish language). As each person shares pieces of the wafer with another, they are supposed to forgive each other any hurts that have occurred over the past year and wish them happiness in the coming year.\n\"Wigilia\", the Christmas Eve supper.\nIn Poland, Christmas Eve is a day first of fasting, then of feasting. The Wigilia feast begins at the appearance of the first star. There is no red meat served but fish, usually carp. The supper, which includes many traditional dishes and desserts can sometimes last for over two hours. It is followed by the exchange of gifts. The next day, the Christmas Day, is often spent visiting friends. In Polish tradition, people combine religion and family closeness at Christmas. Although gift-giving plays a major role in the rituals, the emphasis is placed more on the making of special foods and decorations.\nOn the night of Christmas Eve, so important is the appearance of the first star in remembrance of the Star of Bethlehem, that it has been given an affectionate name of \"the little star\" or Gwiazdka (the female counterpart of St. Nicholas). On that evening, children watch the sky anxiously hoping to be the first to cry out, \"The star has come!\" Only after it appears, the family members sit down to a dinner table.\nAccording to tradition, bits of hay are spread beneath the tablecloth as a reminder that Christ was born in a manger. Others partake in the practice of placing money under the tablecloth for each guest, in order to wish for prosperity in the coming year. Some practice the superstition that an even number of people must be seated around the table. In many homes an empty place setting is symbolically left at the table for the Baby Jesus or, for a lonely wanderer who may be in need of food, or if a deceased relative should come and would like to share in the meal.\nThe supper begins with the breaking of the op\u0142atek wafer. Everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. They then share a piece with each family member. A tradition exists among some families to serve twelve different dishes at Wigilia symbolizing the Twelve Apostles, or perhaps, an odd number of dishes for good luck (usually five, seven, or nine).\nA traditional Wigilia supper in Poland includes fried carp and borscht (beetroot soup) or mushroom consomm\u00e9 with uszka (tortellini). Carp provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; carp fillet, carp in aspic and gefilte fish. Universal Polish Christmas foods are pierogi as well as some herring dishes, and for dessert, makowiec or noodles with poppy seed. Often, there is a compote of dry fruits for a drink.\nThe remainder of the evening is given to stories and songs around the Christmas tree. In some areas of the country, children are taught that \"The Little Star\" brings gifts. As presents are unwrapped, carollers may walk from house to house receiving treats along the way.\nChristmas Eve ends with \"Pasterka\", the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the shepherds to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the newborn Messiah. The custom of Christmas night liturgy was introduced in the Christian churches after the second half of the 5th century. In Poland that custom arrived together with the coming of Christianity. The next day (December 25) begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses. According to scripture, the Christmas Day masses are interchangeable allowing for greater flexibility in choosing the religious services by individual parishioners.\n\"Kol\u0119dy\", the Christmas carols.\nChristmas carols are not celebrated in Poland until during-and-after the Christmas Vigil Mass called \"Pasterka\" held between 24 and 25 of December. The Christmas season often runs until February 2. The early hymns sung in the Catholic church were brought to Poland by the Franciscan Brothers in the Middle Ages. The early Christmas music was Latin in origin. When the Polish words and melodies started to become popular, including many new secular pastorals (, or shepherd's songs), they were not written down originally, but rather taught among people by heart. Notably, the song \"God Is Born\" (\"B\u00f3g si\u0119 rodzi\") with lyrics written by Franciszek Karpi\u0144ski in 1792 became the Christmas hymn of Poland already in the court of King Stefan Batory. Many of the early Polish carols were collected in 1838 by Rev. Mioduszewski in a book called \"Pastora\u0142ki i Kol\u0119dy z Melodiami\" (Pastorals and Carols with Melodies), including \"Midst Quiet Night\".\nPolish hand-made Christmas ornaments.\nPoland produces some of the finest hand blown glass Christmas ornaments in Europe. Families and collectors value these ornaments for high quality, traditional artwork, and unique decorations.\nPolish blown-glass Christmas ornaments are generally manufactured only in the winter season. The modern glass workshops and manufacturers tend to be localized in the southern regions of Poland.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7566", "revid": "1329099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7566", "title": "Carousel (musical)", "text": "Musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein\nCarousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics). The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Moln\u00e1r's 1909 play \"Liliom\", transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. A secondary plot line deals with millworker Carrie Pipperidge and her romance with ambitious fisherman Enoch Snow. The show includes the songs \"If I Loved You\", \"June Is Bustin' Out All Over\" and \"You'll Never Walk Alone\". Richard Rodgers later wrote that \"Carousel\" was his favorite of all his musicals.\nFollowing the spectacular success of the first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, \"Oklahoma!\" (1943), the pair sought to collaborate on another piece, knowing that any resulting work would be compared with \"Oklahoma!\", most likely unfavorably. They were initially reluctant to seek the rights to \"Liliom\"; Moln\u00e1r had refused permission for the work to be adapted in the past, and the original ending was considered too depressing for the musical theatre. After acquiring the rights, the team created a work with lengthy sequences of music and made the ending more hopeful.\nThe musical required considerable modification during out-of-town tryouts, but once it opened on Broadway on April 19, 1945, it was an immediate hit with both critics and audiences. \"Carousel\" initially ran for 890 performances and duplicated its success in the West End in 1950. Though it has never achieved as much commercial success as \"Oklahoma!\", the piece has been repeatedly revived, recorded several times and was filmed in 1956. A production by Nicholas Hytner enjoyed success in 1992 in London, in 1994 in New York and on tour. Another Broadway revival opened in 2018. In 1999, \"Time\" magazine named \"Carousel\" the best musical of the 20th century.\nBackground.\n\"Liliom\".\nFerenc Moln\u00e1r's Hungarian-language drama, \"Liliom\", premiered in Budapest in 1909. The audience was puzzled by the work, and it lasted only thirty-odd performances before being withdrawn, the first shadow on Moln\u00e1r's successful career as a playwright. \"Liliom\" was not presented again until after World War I. When it reappeared on the Budapest stage, it was a tremendous hit.\nExcept for the ending, the plots of \"Liliom\" and \"Carousel\" are very similar. Andreas Zavocky (nicknamed Liliom, the Hungarian word for \"lily\", a slang term for \"tough guy\"), a carnival barker, falls in love with Julie Zeller, a servant girl, and they begin living together. With both discharged from their jobs, Liliom is discontented and contemplates leaving Julie, but decides not to do so on learning that she is pregnant. A subplot involves Julie's friend Marie, who has fallen in love with Wolf Biefeld, a hotel porter\u2014after the two marry, he becomes the owner of the hotel. Desperate to make money so that he, Julie and their child can escape to America and a better life, Liliom conspires with lowlife Ficsur to commit a robbery, but it goes badly, and Liliom stabs himself. He dies, and his spirit is taken to heaven's police court. As Ficsur suggested while the two waited to commit the crime, would-be robbers like them do not come before God Himself. Liliom is told by the magistrate that he may go back to Earth for one day to attempt to redeem the wrongs he has done to his family, but must first spend sixteen years in a fiery purgatory.\nOn his return to Earth, Liliom encounters his daughter Louise, who, like her mother, is now a factory worker. Saying that he knew her father, he tries to give her a star he stole from the heavens. When Louise refuses to take it, he strikes her. Not realizing who he is, Julie confronts him, but finds herself unable to be angry with him. Liliom is ushered off to his fate, presumably Hell, and Louise asks her mother if it is possible to feel a hard slap as if it was a kiss. Julie reminiscently tells her daughter that it is very possible for that to happen.\nAn English translation of \"Liliom\" was credited to Benjamin \"Barney\" Glazer, though there is a story that the actual translator, uncredited, was Rodgers' first major partner Lorenz Hart. The Theatre Guild presented it in New York City in 1921, with Joseph Schildkraut as Liliom, and the play was a success, running 300\u00a0performances. A 1940 revival with Burgess Meredith and Ingrid Bergman was seen by both Hammerstein and Rodgers. Glazer, in introducing the English translation of \"Liliom\", wrote of the play's appeal:\nAnd where in modern dramatic literature can such pearls be matched\u2014Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love she had always been ashamed to tell; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom, the thieves' song ringing in her ears; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven.\u00a0... The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist.\nInception.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became well known for creating Broadway hits with other partners. Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as \"Babes in Arms\" (1937), \"The Boys from Syracuse\" (1938) and \"Pal Joey\" (1940). Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre: \"On Your Toes\" was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the \"Slaughter on Tenth Avenue\" scene), while \"Pal Joey\" flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero. Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as \"Rose-Marie\" (1924), \"The Desert Song\" (1926), \"The New Moon\" (1927) and \"Show Boat\" (1927). Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an Oscar for his song with Jerome Kern, \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\", which was included in the 1941 film \"Lady Be Good\".\nBy the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, becoming unreliable and prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him. Hammerstein was eager to do so, and their first collaboration was \"Oklahoma!\" (1943). Thomas Hischak states, in his \"The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia\", that \"Oklahoma!\" is \"the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. In fact, the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before \"Oklahoma!\" and what came after it.\" An innovation for its time in integrating song, character, plot and dance, \"Oklahoma!\" would serve, according to Hischak, as \"the model for Broadway shows for decades\", and proved a huge popular and financial success. Once it was well-launched, what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair. Film producer Samuel Goldwyn saw \"Oklahoma!\" and advised Rodgers to shoot himself, which, according to Rodgers, \"was Sam's blunt but funny way of telling me that I'd never create another show as good as \"Oklahoma!\"\" As they considered new projects, Hammerstein wrote, \"We're such fools. No matter what we do, everyone is bound to say, 'This is not another \"Oklahoma!\"' \"\n\"Oklahoma!\" had been a struggle to finance and produce. Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theatre Guild, producers of the blockbuster musical, who together formed what they termed \"the Gloat Club\". At one such luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Moln\u00e1r's \"Liliom\" into a musical. Both men refused\u2014they had no feeling for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre. In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might need to change the setting from Hungary while in rehearsal. At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed \"Liliom\", suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole. Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with \"zis\" and \"zose\", would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics.\nA breakthrough came when Rodgers, who owned a house in Connecticut, proposed a New England setting. Hammerstein wrote of this suggestion in 1945,\nI began to see an attractive ensemble\u2014sailors, whalers, girls who worked in the mills up the river, clambakes on near-by islands, an amusement park on the seaboard, things people could do in crowds, people who were strong and alive and lusty, people who had always been depicted on the stage as thin-lipped puritans\u2014a libel I was anxious to refute\u00a0... as for the two leading characters, Julie with her courage and inner strength and outward simplicity seemed more indigenous to Maine than to Budapest. Liliom is, of course, an international character, indigenous to nowhere.\nRodgers and Hammerstein were also concerned about what they termed \"the tunnel\" of Moln\u00e1r's second act\u2014a series of gloomy scenes leading up to Liliom's suicide\u2014followed by a dark ending. They also felt it would be difficult to set Liliom's motivation for the robbery to music. Moln\u00e1r's opposition to having his works adapted was also an issue; he had famously turned down Giacomo Puccini's request to adapt \"Liliom\" as an opera, stating that he wanted the piece to be remembered as his, not Puccini's. In 1937, Moln\u00e1r, who had recently emigrated to the United States, had declined another offer from Kurt Weill to adapt the play into a musical.\nThe pair continued to work on the preliminary ideas for a \"Liliom\" adaptation while pursuing other projects in late 1943 and early 1944\u2014writing the film musical \"State Fair\" and producing \"I Remember Mama\" on Broadway. Meanwhile, the Theatre Guild took Moln\u00e1r to see \"Oklahoma!\" Moln\u00e1r stated that if Rodgers and Hammerstein could adapt \"Liliom\" as beautifully as they had modified \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" into \"Oklahoma!\", he would be pleased to have them do it. The Guild obtained the rights from Moln\u00e1r in October 1943. The playwright received one percent of the gross and $2,500 for \"personal services\". The duo insisted, as part of the contract, that Moln\u00e1r permit them to make changes in the plot. At first, the playwright refused, but eventually yielded. Hammerstein later stated that if this point had not been won, \"we could never have made \"Carousel\".\"\nIn seeking to establish through song Liliom's motivation for the robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in \"Pal Joey\". Rodgers and Hart had overcome the problem with a song that Joey sings to himself, \"I'm Talking to My Pal\". This inspired \"Soliloquy\". Both partners later told a story that \"Soliloquy\" was only intended to be a song about Liliom's dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl. However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943, state: \"Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number for the end of the scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely.\"\nHammerstein and Rodgers returned to the \"Liliom\" project in mid-1944. Hammerstein was uneasy as he worked, fearing that no matter what they did, Moln\u00e1r would disapprove of the results. \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" had been a little-known work; \"Liliom\" was a theatrical standard. Moln\u00e1r's text also contained considerable commentary on the Hungarian politics of 1909 and the rigidity of that society. A dismissed carnival barker who hits his wife, attempts a robbery and commits suicide seemed an unlikely central character for a musical comedy. Hammerstein decided to use the words and story to make the audience sympathize with the lovers. He also built up the secondary couple, who are incidental to the plot in \"Liliom\"; they became Enoch Snow and Carrie Pipperidge. \"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\" was repurposed from a song, \"A Real Nice Hayride\", written for \"Oklahoma!\" but not used.\nMoln\u00e1r's ending was unsuitable, and after a couple of false starts, Hammerstein conceived the graduation scene that ends the musical. According to Frederick Nolan in his book on the team's works: \"From that scene the song \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" sprang almost naturally.\" In spite of Hammerstein's simple lyrics for \"You'll Never Walk Alone\", Rodgers had great difficulty in setting it to music. Rodgers explained his rationale for the changed ending,\n\"Liliom\" was a tragedy about a man who cannot learn to live with other people. The way Moln\u00e1r wrote it, the man ends up hitting his daughter and then having to go back to purgatory, leaving his daughter helpless and hopeless. We couldn't accept that. The way we ended \"Carousel\" it may still be a tragedy but it's a hopeful one because in the final scene it is clear that the child has at last learned how to express herself and communicate with others.\nWhen the pair decided to make \"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\" into an ensemble number, Hammerstein realized he had no idea what a clambake was like, and researched the matter. Based on his initial findings, he wrote the line, \"First came codfish chowder\". However, further research convinced him the proper term was \"codhead chowder\", a term unfamiliar to many playgoers. He decided to keep it as \"codfish\". When the song proceeded to discuss the lobsters consumed at the feast, Hammerstein wrote the line \"We slit 'em down the back/And peppered 'em good\". He was grieved to hear from a friend that lobsters are always slit down the front. The lyricist sent a researcher to a seafood restaurant and heard back that lobsters are always slit down the back. Hammerstein concluded that there is disagreement about which side of a lobster is the back. One error not caught involved the song \"June Is Bustin' Out All Over\", in which sheep are depicted as seeking to mate in late spring\u2014they actually do so in the winter. Whenever this was brought to Hammerstein's attention, he told his informant that 1873 was a special year, in which sheep mated in the spring.\nRodgers early decided to dispense with an overture, feeling that the music was hard to hear over the banging of seats as latecomers settled themselves. In his autobiography, Rodgers complained that only the brass section can be heard during an overture because there are never enough strings in a musical's small orchestra. He determined to force the audience to concentrate from the beginning by opening with a pantomime scene accompanied by what became known as \"The Carousel Waltz\". The pantomime paralleled one in the Moln\u00e1r play, which was also used to introduce the characters and situation to the audience. Author Ethan Mordden described the effectiveness of this opening:\nOther characters catch our notice\u2014Mr. Bascombe, the pompous mill owner, Mrs. Mullin, the widow who runs the carousel and, apparently, Billy; a dancing bear; an acrobat. But what draws us in is the intensity with which Julie regards Billy\u2014the way she stands frozen, staring at him, while everyone else at the fair is swaying to the rhythm of Billy's spiel. And as Julie and Billy ride together on the swirling carousel, and the stage picture surges with the excitement of the crowd, and the orchestra storms to a climax, and the curtain falls, we realize that R &amp; H have not only skipped the overture \"and\" the opening number but the exposition as well. They have plunged into the story, right into the middle of it, in the most intense first scene any musical ever had.\nCasting.\nThe casting for \"Carousel\" began when \"Oklahoma!\"'s production team, including Rodgers and Hammerstein, was seeking a replacement for the part of Curly (the male lead in \"Oklahoma!\"). Lawrence Langner had heard, through a relative, of a California singer named John Raitt, who might be suitable for the part. Langner went to hear Raitt, then urged the others to bring Raitt to New York for an audition. Raitt asked to sing \"Largo al factotum\", Figaro's aria from \"The Barber of Seville\", to warm up. The warmup was sufficient to convince the producers that not only had they found a Curly, they had found a Liliom (or Billy Bigelow, as the part was renamed). Theresa Helburn made another California discovery, Jan Clayton, a singer/actress who had made a few minor films for MGM. She was brought east and successfully auditioned for the part of Julie.\nThe producers sought to cast unknowns. Though many had played in previous Hammerstein or Rodgers works, only one, Jean Casto (cast as carousel owner Mrs. Mullin, and a veteran of \"Pal Joey\"), had ever played on Broadway before. It proved harder to cast the ensemble than the leads, due to the war\u2014Rodgers told his casting director, John Fearnley, that the sole qualification for a dancing boy was that he be alive. Rodgers and Hammerstein reassembled much of the creative team that had made \"Oklahoma!\" a success, including director Rouben Mamoulian and choreographer Agnes de Mille. Miles White was the costume designer while Jo Mielziner (who had not worked on \"Oklahoma!\") was the scenic and lighting designer. Even though \"Oklahoma!\" orchestrator Russell Bennett had informed Rodgers that he was unavailable to work on \"Carousel\" due to a radio contract, Rodgers insisted he do the work in his spare time. He orchestrated \"The Carousel Waltz\" and \"(When I Marry) Mister Snow\" before finally being replaced by Don Walker. A new member of the creative team was Trude Rittmann, who arranged the dance music. Rittmann initially felt that Rodgers mistrusted her because she was a woman, and found him difficult to work with, but the two worked together on Rodgers' shows until the 1970s.\nTryouts.\nRehearsals began in January 1945; either Rodgers or Hammerstein was always present. Raitt was presented with the lyrics for \"Soliloquy\" on a five-foot long sheet of paper\u2014the piece ran nearly eight minutes. Staging such a long solo number presented problems, and Raitt later stated that he felt that they were never fully addressed. At some point during rehearsals, Moln\u00e1r came to see what they had done to his play. There are a number of variations on the story. As Rodgers told it, while watching rehearsals with Hammerstein, the composer spotted Moln\u00e1r in the rear of the theatre and whispered the news to his partner. Both sweated through an afternoon of rehearsal in which nothing seemed to go right. At the end, the two walked to the back of the theatre, expecting an angry reaction from Moln\u00e1r. Instead, the playwright said enthusiastically, \"What you have done is so beautiful. And you know what I like best? The ending!\" Hammerstein wrote that Moln\u00e1r became a regular attendee at rehearsals after that.\nLike most of the pair's works, \"Carousel\" contains a lengthy ballet, \"Billy Makes a Journey\", in the second act, as Billy looks down to the Earth from \"Up There\" and observes his daughter. In the original production the ballet was choreographed by de Mille. It began with Billy looking down from heaven at his wife in labor, with the village women gathered for a \"birthing\". The ballet involved every character in the play, some of whom spoke lines of dialogue, and contained a number of subplots. The focus was on Louise, played by Bambi Linn, who at first almost soars in her dance, expressing the innocence of childhood. She is teased and mocked by her schoolmates, and Louise becomes attracted to the rough carnival people, who symbolize Billy's world. A youth from the carnival attempts to seduce Louise, as she discovers her own sexuality, but he decides she is more girl than woman, and he leaves her. After Julie comforts her, Louise goes to a children's party, where she is shunned. The carnival people reappear and form a ring around the children's party, with Louise lost between the two groups. At the end, the performers form a huge carousel with their bodies.\nThe play opened for tryouts at the Shubert Theater in New Haven, Connecticut, on March 22, 1945. The first act was well-received; the second act was not. Casto recalled that the second act finished about 1:30\u00a0a.m. The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference. Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result. John Fearnley commented, \"Now I see why these people have hits. I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life.\" De Mille said of this conference, \"not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished. Nor was there any idle joking.\u00a0... We cut and cut and cut and then we went to bed.\" By the time the company left New Haven, de Mille's ballet was down to forty minutes.\nA major concern with the second act was the effectiveness of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers \"Mr. and Mrs. God\"), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, \"We've got to get God out of that parlor\". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, \"I don't care where you put Him. Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only get Him out of that parlor!\" Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by \"The New Republic\" as \"a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth\". Hammerstein wrote that Moln\u00e1r's advice that they combine two scenes into one was key to pulling together the second act and represented \"a more radical departure from the original than any change we had made\". A reprise of \"If I Loved You\" was added in the second act, which Rodgers felt needed more music. \nThe pre-Broadway premiere was in Boston at the Colonial Theater on March 27, 1945, starring John Raitt and Jan Clayton as Billy and Julie; it played through April 15. An even shorter version of the ballet was presented during the final two weeks in Boston, but on the final night there de Mille expanded it back to forty minutes, and it brought the house down, causing both Rodgers and Hammerstein to embrace her.\nSynopsis.\nAct 1.\nTwo young female millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's carousel after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts the attention of the barker, Billy Bigelow (\"The Carousel Waltz\"). When Julie lets Billy put his arm around her during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive (\"You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan\"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow (\"(When I Marry) Mister Snow\"), to whom she is newly engaged. Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other (\"If I Loved You\").\nOver a month passes, and preparations for the summer clambake are under way (\"June Is Bustin' Out All Over\"). Julie and Billy, now married, live at Julie's cousin Nettie's spa. Julie confides in Carrie that Billy, frustrated over being unemployed, hit her. Carrie has happier news\u2014she is engaged to Enoch, who enters as she discusses him (\"(When I Marry) Mister Snow (reprise))\". Billy arrives with his ne'er-do-well whaler friend, Jigger. Billy is openly rude to Enoch and Julie, then leaves with Jigger, followed by a distraught Julie. Enoch tells Carrie that he expects to become rich selling herring and to have a large family, larger perhaps than Carrie is comfortable having (\"When the Children Are Asleep\").\nJigger and his shipmates, joined by Billy, then sing about life on the sea (\"Blow High, Blow Low\"). The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help with a robbery, but Billy declines, as the victim\u2014Julie's former boss, Mr. Bascombe\u2014might have to be killed. Mrs. Mullin enters and tries to tempt Billy back to the carousel (and to her). He would have to abandon Julie; a married barker cannot evoke the same sexual tension as one who is single. Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives and the others leave. She tells him that she is pregnant, and Billy is overwhelmed with happiness, ending all thoughts of returning to the carousel. Once alone, Billy imagines the fun he will have with Bill Jr.\u2014until he realizes that his child might be a girl, and reflects soberly that \"you've got to be a \"father\" to a girl\" (\"Soliloquy\"). Determined to provide financially for his future child, whatever the means, Billy decides to be Jigger's accomplice.\nThe whole town leaves for the clambake. Billy, who had earlier refused to go, agrees to join in, to Julie's delight, as he realizes that being seen at the clambake is integral to his and Jigger's alibi (\"Act I Finale\").\nAct 2.\nEveryone reminisces about the huge meal and much fun (\"This Was a Real Nice Clambake\"). Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks in at the wrong moment, and declares that he is finished with her (\"Geraniums In the Winder\"), as Jigger jeers (\"There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman\"). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that \"he's your feller and you love him\" (\"What's the Use of Wond'rin'?\"). Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. She begs him to give it to her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.\nAs they wait, Jigger and Billy gamble with cards. They stake their shares of the anticipated robbery spoils. Billy loses: his participation is now pointless. Unknown to Billy and Jigger, Mr. Bascombe, the intended victim, has already deposited the mill's money. The robbery fails: Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger escapes. Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives just in time for him to say his last words to her and die. Julie strokes his hair, finally able to tell him that she loved him. Carrie and Enoch, reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair (\"You'll Never Walk Alone\").\nBilly's defiant spirit (\"The Highest Judge of All\") is taken Up There to see the Starkeeper, a heavenly official. The Starkeeper tells Billy that the good he did in life was not enough to get into heaven, but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a day to try to do good to redeem himself. He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since his suicide, and suggests that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise. He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: \"Billy Makes a Journey\"). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter. The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young. The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter. He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.\nOutside Julie's cottage, Carrie describes her visit to New York with the now-wealthy Enoch. Carrie's husband and their many children enter to fetch her\u2014the family must get ready for the high school graduation later that day. Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters. Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe. He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged: each insults the other's father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away. Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to be a friend of her father. He offers her a gift\u2014the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand. He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow\u2014and Julie understands her perfectly. Louise retreats to the house, as Julie notices the star that Billy dropped; she picks it up and seems to feel Billy's presence (\"If I Loved You (Reprise)\").\nBilly invisibly attends Louise's graduation, hoping for one last chance to help his daughter and redeem himself. The beloved town physician, Dr. Seldon (who resembles the Starkeeper) advises the graduating class not to rely on their parents' success or be held back by their failure (words directed at Louise). Seldon prompts everyone to sing an old song, \"You'll Never Walk Alone\". Billy, still invisible, whispers to Louise, telling her to believe Seldon's words, and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl, she learns she does not have to be an outcast. Billy goes to Julie, telling her at last that he loved her. As his widow and daughter join in the singing, Billy is taken to his heavenly reward.\nPrincipal roles and notable performers.\n\u00b0 denotes original Broadway cast\nMusical numbers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProductions.\nEarly productions.\nThe original Broadway production opened at the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. Sedated with morphine, he could see only part of the stage. As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. Rodgers' daughter Mary caught sight of her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears.\nThe original production ran for 890 performances, closing on May 24, 1947. The original cast included John Raitt (Billy), Jan Clayton (Julie), Jean Darling (Carrie), Eric Mattson (Enoch Snow), Christine Johnson (Nettie Fowler), Murvyn Vye (Jigger), Bambi Linn (Louise) and Russell Collins (Starkeeper). In December 1945, Clayton left to star in the Broadway revival of \"Show Boat\" and was replaced by Iva Withers; Raitt was replaced by Henry Michel in January 1947; Darling was replaced by Margot Moser.\nAfter closing on Broadway, the show went on a national tour for two years. It played for five months in Chicago alone, visited twenty states and two Canadian cities, covered and played to nearly two million people. The touring company had a four-week run at New York City Center in January 1949.&lt;ref name=\"NYT/Calta 1949-01-25\"&gt;Calta, Louis. https://. \"The New York Times\", January 25, 1949, p. 27. Retrieved on December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the City Center run, the show was moved back to the Majestic Theatre starring Stephen Douglass (Billy) and Iva Withers (Julie), in the hopes of filling the theatre until \"South Pacific\" opened in early April. Ticket sales were mediocre, however, and the show closed almost a month early.&lt;ref name=\"NYT/Calta 1949-02-28\"&gt;Calta, Louis. https://. \"The New York Times\", February 28, 1949, p. 15. Retrieved on December 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe musical premiered in the West End, London, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, on June 7, 1950. The production was restaged by Jerome Whyte, with a cast that included Douglass and Withers reprising their roles as Billy and Julie, and Margot Moser as Carrie. \"Carousel\" ran in London for 566 performances, remaining there for over a year and a half.\nSubsequent productions.\n\"Carousel\" was revived in 1954 and 1957 at City Center, presented by the New York City Center Light Opera Company. Both times, the production featured Barbara Cook, though she played Carrie in 1954 and Julie in 1957 (playing alongside Howard Keel as Billy). The production was then taken to Belgium to be performed at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair, with David Atkinson as Billy, Ruth Kobart as Nettie, and Clayton reprising the role of Julie, which she had originated.\nIn August 1965, Rodgers and the Music Theater of Lincoln Center produced \"Carousel\" for 47 performances. John Raitt reprised the role of Billy, with Jerry Orbach as Jigger and Reid Shelton as Enoch Snow. The roles of the Starkeeper and Dr. Seldon were played by Edward Everett Horton in his final stage appearance. The following year, New York City Center Light Opera Company brought \"Carousel\" back to City Center for 22 performances, with Bruce Yarnell as Billy and Constance Towers as Julie.\nNicholas Hytner directed a new production of \"Carousel\" in 1992, at London's Royal National Theatre, with choreography by Sir Kenneth MacMillan and designs by Bob Crowley. In this staging, the story begins at the mill, where Julie and Carrie work, with the music slowed down to emphasize the drudgery. After work ends, they move to the shipyards and then to the carnival. As they proceed on a revolving stage, carnival characters appear, and at last the carousel is assembled onstage for the girls to ride. Louise is seduced by the ruffian boy during her Act 2 ballet, set around the ruins of a carousel. Michael Hayden played Billy not as a large, gruff man, but as a frustrated smaller one, a time bomb waiting to explode. Joanna Riding (Julie) and Janie Dee (Carrie) won Olivier Awards for their performances, the production won Best Musical Revival, and Hytner won as director. Patricia Routledge played Nettie. Clive Rowe, as Enoch, was nominated for an Olivier Award. Enoch and Carrie were cast as an interracial couple whose eight children, according to the review in \"The New York Times\", looked like \"a walking United Colors of Benetton ad\". The production's limited run from December 1992 through March 1993 was a sellout. It re-opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre in London in September 1993, presented by Cameron Mackintosh, where it continued until May 1994.\nThe Hytner production moved to New York's Vivian Beaumont Theater, where it opened on March 24, 1994, and ran for 322 performances. This won five Tony Awards, including best musical revival, as well as awards for Hytner, MacMillan, Crowley and Audra McDonald (as Carrie). The cast also included Sally Murphy as Julie, Shirley Verrett as Nettie, Fisher Stevens as Jigger and Eddie Korbich as Enoch. Replacements for Billy included Marcus Lovett and James Barbour. One change made from the London to the New York production was to have Billy strike Louise across the face, rather than on the hand. According to Hayden, \"He does the one unpardonable thing, the thing we can't forgive. It's a challenge for the audience to like him after that.\" The Hytner \"Carousel\" was presented in Japan in May 1995. A U.S. national tour with a scaled-down production began in February 1996 in Houston and closed in May 1997 in Providence, Rhode Island. Producers sought to feature young talent on the tour, with Patrick Wilson as Billy and Sarah Uriarte Berry, and later Jennifer Laura Thompson, as Julie.\nA revival opened at London's Savoy Theatre on December 2, 2008, after a week of previews, starring Jeremiah James (Billy), Alexandra Silber (Julie) and Lesley Garrett (Nettie). The production received warm to mixed reviews. It closed in June 2009, a month early. Michael Coveney, writing in \"The Independent\", admired Rodgers' music but stated, \"Lindsay Posner's efficient revival doesn't hold a candle to the National Theatre 1992 version\". A production at Theater Basel, Switzerland, in 2016 to 2017, with German dialogue, was directed by Alexander Charim and choreographed by Teresa Rotemberg. Bryony Dwyer, Christian Miedl and Cheryl Studer starred, respectively, as Julie Jordan, Billy Bigelow and Nettie Fowler. A semi-staged revival by the English National Opera opened at the London Coliseum in 2017. The production was directed by Lonny Price, conducted by David Charles Abell, and starred Alfie Boe as Billy, Katherine Jenkins as Julie and Nicholas Lyndhurst as the Starkeeper. The production received mixed to positive reviews.\nThe third Broadway revival began previews on February 28, 2018, at the Imperial Theatre and officially opened on April 12. It closed on September 16, 2018. The production starred Jessie Mueller, Joshua Henry, Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Lindsay Mendez and Alexander Gemignani. The production was directed by Jack O'Brien and choreographed by Justin Peck. The songs \"Geraniums in the Winder\" and \"There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman\" were cut from this revival. Ben Brantley wrote in \"The New York Times\", \"The tragic inevitability of \"Carousel\" has seldom come across as warmly or as chillingly as it does in this vividly reimagined revival. ... [W]ith thoughtful and powerful performances by Mr. Henry and Ms. Mueller, the love story at the show's center has never seemed quite as ill-starred or, at the same time, as sexy. ... [T]he Starkeeper ... assumes new visibility throughout, taking on the role of Billy's angelic supervisor.\" Brantley strongly praised the choreography, all the performances and the designers. He was unconvinced, however, by the \"mother-daughter dialogue that falls so abrasively on contemporary ears\", where Julie tries to justify loving an abusive man, and other scenes in Act 2, particularly those set in heaven, and the optimism of the final scene. Most of the reviewers agreed that while the choreography and performances (especially the singing) were excellent, characterizing the production as sexy and sumptuous, O'Brien's direction did little to help the show deal with modern sensibilities about men's treatment of women, instead indulging in nostalgia.\nFrom July to September 2021 the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre in London presented a staging by Timothy Sheader, with choreography by Drew McOnie. The cast included Carly Bawden as Julie, Declan Bennett as Billy and Joanna Riding as Nettie.\nFilm, television and concert versions.\nA film version of the musical was made in 1956, starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones. It follows the musical's story fairly closely, although a prologue, set in the Starkeeper's heaven, was added. The film was released only a few months after the release of the film version of \"Oklahoma!\" It garnered some good reviews, and the soundtrack recording was a best seller. As the same stars appeared in both pictures, however, the two films were often compared, generally to the disadvantage of \"Carousel\". Thomas Hischak, in \"The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia\", later wondered \"if the smaller number of \"Carousel\" stage revivals is the product of this often-lumbering [film] musical\".\nThere was also an abridged (100 minute) 1967 network television version that starred Robert Goulet, with choreography by Edward Villella. BBC Radio Theatre broadcast a concert of \"Carousel\" in July 1995 starring Mandy Patinkin as Billy. In 2002, Carnegie Hall presented a concert of the musical starring Hugh Jackman and Audra McDonald as Billy and Julie, directed by Walter Bobbie. Other cast members included Jason Danieley, Judy Kaye, Lauren Ward, Norbert Leo Butz, Philip Bosco and Blythe Danner.\nThe New York Philharmonic presented a staged concert version of the musical from February 28 to March 2, 2013, at Avery Fisher Hall. Kelli O'Hara played Julie, with Nathan Gunn as Billy, Stephanie Blythe as Nettie, Jessie Mueller as Carrie, Danieley as Enoch, Shuler Hensley as Jigger, John Cullum as the Starkeeper, and Kate Burton as Mrs. Mullin. Tiler Peck danced the role of Louise to choreography by Warren Carlyle. The production was directed by John Rando and conducted by Rob Fisher. Charles Isherwood of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical as you are ever likely to hear.\" It was broadcast as part of the PBS \"Live from Lincoln Center\" series, premiering on April 26, 2013.\nMusic and recordings.\nMusical treatment.\nRodgers designed \"Carousel\" to be an almost continuous stream of music, especially in Act 1. In later years, Rodgers was asked if he had considered writing an opera. He stated that he had been sorely tempted to, but saw \"Carousel\" in operatic terms. He remembered, \"We came very close to opera in the Majestic Theatre.\u00a0... There's much that is operatic in the music.\"\nRodgers uses music in \"Carousel\" in subtle ways to differentiate characters and tell the audience of their emotional state. In \"You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan\", the music for the placid Carrie is characterized by even eighth-note rhythms, whereas the emotionally restless Julie's music is marked by dotted eighths and sixteenths; this rhythm will characterize her throughout the show. When Billy whistles a snatch of the song, he selects Julie's dotted notes rather than Carrie's. Reflecting the close association in the music between Julie and the as-yet unborn Louise, when Billy sings in \"Soliloquy\" of his daughter, who \"gets hungry every night\", he uses Julie's dotted rhythms. Such rhythms also characterize Julie's Act 2 song, \"What's the Use of Wond'rin'\". The stable love between Enoch and Carrie is strengthened by her willingness to let Enoch not only plan his entire life, but hers as well. This is reflected in \"When the Children Are Asleep\", where the two sing in close harmony, but Enoch musically interrupts his intended's turn at the chorus with the words \"Dreams that won't be interrupted\". Rodgers biographer Geoffrey Block, in his book on the Broadway musical, points out that though Billy may strike his wife, he allows her musical themes to become a part of him and never interrupts her music. Block suggests that, as reprehensible as Billy may be for his actions, Enoch requiring Carrie to act as \"the little woman\", and his having nine children with her (more than she had found acceptable in \"When the Children are Asleep\") can be considered to be even more abusive.\nThe twelve-minute \"bench scene\", in which Billy and Julie get to know each other and which culminates with \"If I Loved You\", according to Hischak, \"is considered the most completely integrated piece of music-drama in the American musical theatre\". The scene is almost entirely drawn from Moln\u00e1r and is one extended musical piece; Stephen Sondheim described it as \"probably the single most important moment in the revolution of contemporary musicals\". \"If I Loved You\" has been recorded many times, by such diverse artists as Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Sammy Davis Jr., Mario Lanza and Chad and Jeremy. The D-flat major theme that dominates the music for the second act ballet seems like a new melody to many audience members. It is, however, a greatly expanded development of a theme heard during \"Soliloquy\" at the line \"I guess he'll call me 'The old man'\u00a0\".\nWhen the pair discussed the song that would become \"Soliloquy\", Rodgers improvised at the piano to give Hammerstein an idea of how he envisioned the song. When Hammerstein presented his collaborator with the lyrics after two weeks of work (Hammerstein always wrote the words first, then Rodgers would write the melodies), Rodgers wrote the music for the eight-minute song in two hours. \"What's the Use of Wond'rin'\u00a0\", one of Julie's songs, worked well in the show but was never as popular on the radio or for recording, and Hammerstein believed that the lack of popularity was because he had concluded the final line, \"And all the rest is talk\" with a hard consonant, which does not allow the singer a vocal climax.\nIrving Berlin later stated that \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" had the same sort of effect on him as the 23rd Psalm. When singer Mel Torm\u00e9 told Rodgers that \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" had made him cry, Rodgers nodded impatiently. \"You're supposed to.\" The frequently recorded song has become a widely accepted hymn. The cast recording of \"Carousel\" proved popular in Liverpool, like many Broadway albums, and in 1963, the Brian Epstein-managed band, Gerry and the Pacemakers had a number-one hit with the song. At the time, the top ten hits were played before Liverpool F.C. home matches; even after \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" dropped out of the top ten, fans continued to sing it, and it has become closely associated with the soccer team and the city of Liverpool. A BBC program, \"Soul Music\", ranked it alongside \"Silent Night\" and \"Abide With Me\" in terms of its emotional impact and iconic status.\nRecordings.\nThe cast album of the 1945 Broadway production was issued on 78s, and the score was significantly cut\u2014as was the 1950 London cast recording. Theatre historian John Kenrick notes of the 1945 recording that a number of songs had to be abridged to fit the 78 format, but that there is a small part of \"Soliloquy\" found on no other recording, as Rodgers cut it from the score immediately after the studio recording was made.\nA number of songs were cut for the 1956 film, but two of the deleted numbers had been recorded and were ultimately retained on the soundtrack album. The expanded CD version of the soundtrack, issued in 2001, contains all of the singing recorded for the film, including the cut portions, and nearly all of the dance music. The recording of the 1965 Lincoln Center revival featured Raitt reprising the role of Billy. Studio recordings of \"Carousel\"'s songs were released in 1956 (with Robert Merrill as Billy, Patrice Munsel as Julie, and Florence Henderson as Carrie), 1962 and 1987. The 1987 version featured a mix of opera and musical stars, including Samuel Ramey, Barbara Cook and Sarah Brightman. Kenrick recommends the 1962 studio recording for its outstanding cast, including Alfred Drake, Roberta Peters, Claramae Turner, Lee Venora, and Norman Treigle.\nBoth the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner production contain portions of dialogue that, according to Hischak, speak to the power of Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy. Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all-around performance of \"Carousel\" on disc, despite uneven singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy's Julie and the strong supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard). The Stratford Festival issued a recording in 2015.\nCritical reception and legacy.\nThe musical received almost unanimous rave reviews after its opening in 1945. According to Hischak, reviews were not as exuberant as for \"Oklahoma!\" as the critics were not taken by surprise this time. John Chapman of the \"Daily News\" termed it \"one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen and I shall remember it always\". \"The New York Times\"'s reviewer, Lewis Nichols, stated that \"Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who can do no wrong, have continued doing no wrong in adapting \"Liliom\" into a musical play. Their \"Carousel\" is on the whole delightful.\" Wilella Waldorf of the \"New York Post\", however, complained, \"\"Carousel\" seemed to us a rather long evening. The \"Oklahoma!\" formula is becoming a bit monotonous and so are Miss de Mille's ballets. All right, go ahead and shoot!\" \"Dance Magazine\" gave Linn plaudits for her role as Louise, stating, \"Bambi doesn't come on until twenty minutes before eleven, and for the next forty minutes, she practically holds the audience in her hand\". Howard Barnes in the \"New York Herald Tribune\" also applauded the dancing: \"It has waited for Miss de Mille to come through with peculiarly American dance patterns for a musical show to become as much a dance as a song show.\"\nWhen the musical returned to New York in 1949, \"The New York Times\" reviewer Brooks Atkinson described \"Carousel\" as \"a conspicuously superior musical play\u00a0... \"Carousel\", which was warmly appreciated when it opened, seems like nothing less than a masterpiece now.\" In 1954, when \"Carousel\" was revived at City Center, Atkinson discussed the musical in his review:\n\"Carousel\" has no comment to make on anything of topical importance. The theme is timeless and universal: the devotion of two people who love each other through thick and thin, complicated in this case by the wayward personality of the man, who cannot fulfill the responsibilities he has assumed. \u00a0... Billy is a bum, but \"Carousel\" recognizes the decency of his motives and admires his independence. There are no slick solutions in \"Carousel\".\nStephen Sondheim noted the duo's ability to take the innovations of \"Oklahoma!\" and apply them to a serious setting: \"\"Oklahoma!\" is about a picnic, \"Carousel\" is about life and death.\" Critic Eric Bentley, on the other hand, wrote that \"the last scene of \"Carousel\" is an impertinence: I refuse to be lectured to by a musical comedy scriptwriter on the education of children, the nature of the good life, and the contribution of the American small town to the salvation of souls.\"\n\"New York Times\" critic Frank Rich said of the 1992 London production: \"What is remarkable about Mr. Hytner's direction, aside from its unorthodox faith in the virtues of simplicity and stillness, is its ability to make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein's vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good.\" The Hytner production in New York was hailed by many critics as a grittier \"Carousel\", which they deemed more appropriate for the 1990s. Clive Barnes of the \"New York Post\" called it a \"defining \"Carousel\"\u2014hard-nosed, imaginative, and exciting.\"\nCritic Michael Billington has commented that \"lyrically [\"Carousel\"] comes perilously close to acceptance of the inevitability of domestic violence.\" BroadwayWorld.com stated in 2013 that \"Carousel\" is now \"considered somewhat controversial in terms of its attitudes on domestic violence\" because Julie chooses to stay with Billy despite the abuse; actress Kelli O'Hara noted that the domestic violence that Julie \"chooses to deal with \u2013 is a real, existing and very complicated thing. And exploring it is an important part of healing it.\"\nRodgers considered \"Carousel\" his favorite of all his musicals and wrote, \"it affects me deeply every time I see it performed\". In 1999, \"Time\" magazine, in its \"Best of the Century\" list, named \"Carousel\" the Best Musical of the 20th century, writing that Rodgers and Hammerstein \"set the standards for the 20th century musical, and this show features their most beautiful score and the most skillful and affecting example of their musical storytelling\". Hammerstein's grandson, Oscar Andrew Hammerstein, in his book about his family, suggested that the wartime situation made \"Carousel\"'s ending especially poignant to its original viewers, \"Every American grieved the loss of a brother, son, father, or friend\u00a0... the audience empathized with [Billy's] all-too-human efforts to offer advice, to seek forgiveness, to complete an unfinished life, and to bid a proper good-bye from beyond the grave.\" Author and composer Ethan Mordden agreed with that perspective:\nIf \"Oklahoma!\" developed the moral argument for sending American boys overseas, \"Carousel\" offered consolation to those wives and mothers whose boys would only return in spirit. The meaning lay not in the tragedy of the present, but in the hope for a future where no one walks alone.\nAwards and nominations.\nOriginal 1945 Broadway production.\n\"Note: The Tony Awards were not established until 1947, and so \"Carousel\" was not eligible to win any Tonys for the original Broadway production.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some critics have suggested that unlike CCM and older Christian rock, Christian alternative rock generally emphasizes musical style over lyrical content as a defining genre characteristic, though the degree to which the faith appears in the music varies from artist to artist.\nHistory.\nChristian alternative music has its roots in the early 1980s, as the earliest efforts at Christian punk and new wave were recorded by artists like Andy McCarroll and Moral Support, Undercover, the 77s, Steve Scott, Adam Again, Quickflight, Daniel Amos, Youth Choir (later renamed the Choir), Lifesavers Underground, Michael Knott, the Prayer Chain, Altar Boys, Breakfast with Amy, Steve Taylor, 4-4-1, David Edwards and Vector. Early labels, most now-defunct, included Blonde Vinyl, Frontline, Exit, and Refuge.\nBy the 1990s, many of these bands and artists had disbanded, were no longer performing, or were being carried by independent labels because their music tended to be more lyrically complex (and often more controversial) than mainstream Christian pop. The modern market is currently supported by labels such as Tooth &amp; Nail, Gotee and Floodgate. These companies are often children of, or partially owned, by general market labels such as Warner, EMI, and Capitol Records, giving successful artists an opportunity to \"cross over\" into mainstream markets.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He came to prominence in the 1980s with a series of short stories collectively named the \"Books of Blood\", which established him as a leading horror author. His work has been adapted into films, notably the \"Hellraiser\" series (the first installment of which he also wrote and directed) and the \"Candyman\" series.\nBarker's paintings and illustrations have been shown in galleries in the United States, and have appeared in his books. He has also created characters and series for comic books, and some of his more popular horror stories have been featured in ongoing comics series.\nEarly life.\nBarker was born in Liverpool on 5 October 1952. His mother, Joan Ruby (n\u00e9e Revill), was a painter and school welfare officer; his father, Leonard Barker, worked as the personnel director for an industrial relations firm. He was educated at Dovedale Primary School and Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool before joining the University of Liverpool, where he studied English and philosophy. At the age of three, he witnessed the infamous death of French skydiver L\u00e9o Valentin, who plummeted to the ground during a performance at an air show in Liverpool. He would later allude to Valentin in many of his stories.\nTheatrical work.\nBarker's involvement in live theatre began while still in school with productions of \"Voodoo\" and \"Inferno\" in 1967. He collaborated on six plays with \"Theatre of the Imagination\" in 1974 and two more that he was the sole writer of, \"A Clowns' Sodom\" and \"Day of the Dog,\" for \"The Mute Pantomime Theatre\" in 1976 and 1977.\nBarker co-founded the avant-garde theatrical troupe The Dog Company in 1978 with former schoolmates and up-and-coming actors, many of whom would go on to become key collaborators in his film work; Doug Bradley, his long-time friend and former classmate at Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool, took on the now-iconic role of Pinhead in the \"Hellraiser\" series while Peter Atkins wrote the scripts for the first three \"Hellraiser\" sequels. Over the next five years Barker wrote nine plays, often serving as director, including some of his best-known stage productions, \"The History of The Devil\", \"Frankenstein in Love\", and \"The Secret Life of Cartoons\".\nFrom 1982 to 1983, he wrote \"Crazyface\", \"Subtle Bodies\", and \"Colossus\" for the Cockpit Youth Theatre.\nHis theatrical work came to a close as he shifted focus to writing the \"Books of Blood\".\nWriting career.\nBarker is an author of horror and fantasy, although he has said that he thinks of his writing less and less as horror. He began writing early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in \"Books of Blood\" 1\u20136) and the Faustian novel \"The Damnation Game\" (1985). Later he moved toward modern-day fantasy and urban fantasy with horror elements in \"Weaveworld\" (1987), \"The Great and Secret Show\" (1989), the world-spanning \"Imajica\" (1991), and \"Sacrament\" (1996).\nWhen \"Books of Blood\" was first published in the United States in paperback, Stephen King was quoted on the book covers: \"I have seen the future of horror and his name is Clive Barker.\" As influences on his writing, Barker lists Herman Melville, Edgar Allan Poe, Ray Bradbury, William S. Burroughs, William Blake, and Jean Cocteau, among others.\nHe is the writer of the best-selling \"Abarat\" series.\nIn early 2024, he announced he would stop attending conventions and public events so he could focus more on his writing, as he was working on the manuscripts for 31 different projects, some closer to completion than others.\nPersonal life.\nBarker stated on \"Loveline\" in 1996 that he had several relationships with older women during his teenage years, but realised he was gay when he was around 18 or 19 years old. He dated John Gregson from 1975 to 1986, and was later in a relationship from 1996 to 2009 with photographer David Armstrong, who was described as his husband in the introduction to \"Coldheart Canyon\".\nDuring his early years as a writer, Barker occasionally worked as an escort when his writing did not provide sufficient income. He has been open about his experiences with sadomasochism, calling himself a \"six\" on its \"sliding scale\".\nIn 2003, Barker received the Davidson/Valentini Award at the 15th GLAAD Media Awards.\nBarker is critical of organized religion, but has said that the Bible influences his work and spirituality. In 2017, he clarified on Facebook that he did not identify as a Christian.\nBarker said in a December 2008 online interview (published in March 2009) that he had throat polyps which were so severe that a doctor told him he was taking in only 10% of the air he was supposed to. He has had two surgical procedures to remove them and believes his voice has improved as a result. He said he did not have cancer and has given up cigars.\nIn 2012, Barker fell into a coma for several days after contracting toxic shock syndrome, triggered by a visit to a dentist where a spillage of poisonous bacteria entered his bloodstream and almost killed him. Realising he might have just a short time to live, he decided to put his personal concerns about the world and society into the novel \"Deep Hill\", which he thought could be his final book.\nAs of 2015, Barker is a member of the board of advisers for the Hollywood Horror Museum.\nFilm work.\nBarker wrote the screenplays for \"Underworld\" (1985) and \"Rawhead Rex\" (1986), both directed by George Pavlou. Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with \"Hellraiser\" (1987), based on his novella \"The Hellbound Heart\". After his film \"Nightbreed\" (1990) flopped, Barker returned to write and direct \"Lord of Illusions\" (1995). The short story \"The Forbidden\", from Barker's \"Books of Blood\", provided the basis for the 1992 film \"Candyman\" and its three sequels. He had been working on a series of film adaptations of his \"The Abarat Quintet\" books under The Walt Disney Company's management, but due to creative differences, the project was cancelled.\nHe served as an executive producer for the 1998 film \"Gods and Monsters\", a semi-fictional tale of \"Frankenstein\" director James Whale's later years, which won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Barker said of his interest in the project: \"Whale was gay, I'm gay; Whale was English, I'm English\u2026Whale made some horror movies, and I've made some horror movies. It seemed as if I should be helping to tell this story.\" Barker also provided the foreword on the published shooting script.\nIn 2005, Barker and horror film producer Jorge Saralegui created the film production company Midnight Picture Show with the intent of producing two horror films per year.\nIn October 2006, Barker announced through his website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original \"Hellraiser\" film. He was developing a film based on his \"Tortured Souls\" line of toys from McFarlane Toys. In 2020, Barker regained control of the \"Hellraiser\" franchise, and served as executive producer on a 2022 reboot film for the streaming service Hulu.\nTelevision work.\nIn May 2015, \"Variety\" reported that Clive Barker was developing a television series adaptation of various creepypastas in partnership with Warner Brothers, to be called \"Clive Barker's Creepypastas\", a feature arc based on \"Slender Man\" and \"Ben Drowned\". Barker was involved in a streaming service film adaptation of \"The Books of Blood\" in 2020, and is developing a \"Nightbreed\" television series directed by Michael Dougherty and written by Josh Stolberg for SyFy. In April 2020, HBO was announced to be developing a \"Hellraiser\" television series that would serve as \"an elevated continuation and expansion\" of its mythology with Mark Verheiden and Michael Dougherty writing the series and David Gordon Green directing several episodes.

Typically set in imaginary worlds, fantasy comedy often involves puns on, and parodies of, other works of fantasy.\nLiterature.\nThe subgenre rose in the nineteenth century. Elements of fantasy comedy can be found in such nineteenth century works\nas some of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales, Charles Dickens' \"Christmas Books\", and Lewis Carroll's Alice books. The first writer to specialize in the subgenre was \"F. Anstey\" in novels such as \"Vice Versa\" (1882), where magic disrupts Victorian society with humorous results. Anstey's work was popular enough to inspire several imitations, including E. Nesbit's light-hearted children's fantasies, \"The Phoenix and the Carpet\" (1904) and \"The Story of the Amulet\" (1906). The United States had several writers of fantasy comedy, including James Branch Cabell, whose satirical fantasy \"Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice\" (1919) was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscenity. Another American writer in a similar vein was Thorne Smith, whose works (such as \"Topper\" and \"The Night Life of the Gods\") were popular and influential, and often adapted for film and television. Humorous fantasies narrated in a \"gentleman's club\" setting are common; they include John Kendrick Bangs' \"A House-Boat on the Styx\" (1895), Lord Dunsany's \"Jorkens\" stories, and Maurice Richardson's \n\"The Exploits of Englebrecht\" (1950).\nAccording to Lin Carter, T. H. White's works exemplify fantasy comedy, L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt's Harold Shea stories are early exemplars. The overwhelming bulk of de Camp's fantasy was comic. Pratt and de Camp were among several contributors to \"Unknown Worlds\", a pulp magazine which emphasized fantasy with a comedic element. The work of Fritz Leiber also appeared in \"Unknown Worlds\", including his Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, a jocose take on the sword and sorcery subgenre.\nIn more modern times, Terry Pratchett's \"Discworld\" books, Piers Anthony's \"Xanth\" books, Robert Asprin's \"MythAdventures\" of Skeeve and Aahz books, and Tom Holt's books provide good examples, as do many of the works by Christopher Moore. There are also comic-strips/graphic novels in the humorous fantasy genre, including Chuck Whelon's Pewfell series and the webcomics \"8-Bit Theater\" and \"The Order of the Stick\". Other authors of the genre in modern times include C.K. McDonnell, Jasper Fforde, Neil Gaiman, Robert Rankin, John Brosnan, Craig Shaw Gardner, David Lee Stone and Esther Freisner, as well as countless independent authors.\nOther media.\nThe subgenre has also been represented in television, such as in the television series \"I Dream of Jeannie\", \"Kr\u00f6d M\u00e4ndoon\". Examples on radio are the BBC's \"Hordes of the Things\" and \"ElvenQuest\". Fantasy comedy films can either be parodies (\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\"), comedies with fantastical elements (\"Being John Malkovich, Barbie\") or animated (\"Shrek\"). It has also been used with fantasy as the primary genre and comedy as the secondary, as in the case of \"\" and its .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7575", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7575", "title": "CLU (programming language)", "text": "Type of programming language\nCLU is a class-based programming language created at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Barbara Liskov and her students starting in 1973. While it did not find extensive use, it introduced many features that are used widely now, and is seen as a step in the development of object-oriented programming (OOP).\nKey contributions include abstract data types, call-by-sharing, iterators, multiple return values (a form of parallel assignment), type-safe parameterized types, and type-safe variant types. It is also notable for its use of classes with constructors and methods, but without inheritance.\nClusters.\nThe syntax of CLU was based on ALGOL, then the starting point for most new language designs. The key addition was the concept of a \"cluster\", CLU's type extension system and the root of the language's name (CLUster). Clusters correspond generally to the concept of a \"class\" in an OO language. For instance, here is the CLU syntax for a cluster that implements complex numbers:\n complex_number = cluster is add, subtract, multiply, ...\n rep = record [ real_part: real, imag_part: real ]\n add = proc ... end add;\n subtract = proc ... end subtract;\n multiply = proc ... end multiply;\n end complex_number;\nA cluster implements a data abstraction, which is a set of objects and a set of primitive operations to create and manipulate those objects. These correspond to the public components of a class in recent OO languages. A cluster also defines a type that can be named outside the cluster (in this case, \"complex_number\"), but its representation type (rep) is hidden from external clients.\nCluster names are global, and no namespace mechanism was provided to group clusters or allow them to be created \"locally\" inside other clusters.\nIn a cluster, the explicit type conversions \"up\" and \"down\" change between the abstract type and the representation; implicit conversions between these types are signified using the special type \"cvt\". CLU does not otherwise perform implicit type conversions. There is a universal type \"any\", and a procedure force[] to check that an object is a certain type. Objects may be mutable or immutable, the latter being \"base types\" such as integers, booleans, characters and strings.\nOther features.\nAnother key feature of the CLU type system are \"iterators\", which return objects from a collection serially, one after another. Iterators offer an identical application programming interface (API) no matter what data they are being used with. Thus the iterator for a collection of codice_1s can be used interchangeably with that for an array of codice_2s. A distinctive feature of CLU iterators is that they are implemented as coroutines, with each value being provided to the caller via a \"yield\" statement. Iterators like those in CLU are now a common feature of many modern languages, such as C#, Ruby, and Python, though recently they are often referred to as generators.\nCLU also includes exception handling, based on various attempts in other languages; exceptions are raised using codice_3 and handled with codice_4. Unlike most other languages with exception handling, exceptions are not implicitly resignaled up the calling chain. Also unlike most other languages that provide exception handling, exceptions in CLU are considered part of ordinary execution flow and are considered a \"normal\" and efficient type-safe way to break out of loops or to return from functions; this allows for direct assignment of return values \"except when\" other conditions apply. Exceptions that are neither caught nor resignaled explicitly are immediately converted into a special failure exception that typically terminates the program.\nCLU is often credited as being the first language with type-safe variant types, called \"oneofs\", before the language ML had them.\nA final distinctive feature in CLU is parallel assignment (multiple assignment), where more than one variable can appear on the left hand side of an assignment operator. For instance, writing codice_5 would exchange values of codice_6 and codice_7. In the same way, functions could return several values, like . Parallel assignment (though not multiple return values) predates CLU, appearing in CPL (1963), named \"simultaneous assignment\", but CLU popularized it and is often credited as the direct influence leading to parallel assignment in later languages.\nAll objects in a CLU program live in the heap, and memory management is automatic.\nCLU supports type-parameterized user-defined data abstractions. It was the first language to offer type-safe bounded parameterized types, using \"where clauses\" to express constraints on actual type arguments. Unlike in languages with template-based generics, a use of such a data abstraction can be type-checked without access to the implementation of the abstraction.\nInfluence.\nCLU and Ada were major inspirations for C++ templates.\nCLU's exception handling mechanisms influenced later languages like C++, Java and many others.\nSather, Python, and C# include iterators, which first appeared in CLU.\nPerl and Lua took multiple assignment and multiple returns from function calls from CLU.\nPython and Ruby borrowed call by sharing, the \"yield\" statement, and multiple assignment.\nThe characters of the \"Tron\" and \"\" movies are named after CLU.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7577", "revid": "6575218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7577", "title": "History of the Soviet Union (1982\u20131991)", "text": "The history of the Soviet Union from 1982 through 1991 spans the period from the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's death until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Due to the years of Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development, and complex systemic problems in the command economy, Soviet output stagnated. Failed attempts at reform, a standstill economy, and the success of the proxies of the United States against the Soviet Union's forces in the war in Afghanistan led to a general feeling of discontent, especially in the Soviet-occupied Central and Eastern Europe (including the Baltic states).\nGreater political and social freedoms, instituted by the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, created an atmosphere of open criticism of the communist regime, and also \"perestroika\". The dramatic drop of the price of oil in 1985 and 1986 profoundly influenced actions of the Soviet leadership.\nNikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was succeeded by Nikolai Ryzhkov, and Vasili Kuznetsov, the acting Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, was succeeded by Andrei Gromyko, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nSeveral republics began resisting central control, and increasing democratization led to a weakening of the central government. The Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991 when Boris Yeltsin seized power in the aftermath of a failed coup that had attempted to topple the reform-minded Gorbachev.\nLeadership transition.\nBy 1982, the stagnation of the Soviet economy was obvious, as evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union had been importing grain from the U.S. throughout the 1970s, but the system was so firmly entrenched that any real change seemed impossible. A huge rate of defense spending consumed large parts of the economy. The transition period that separated the Brezhnev and Gorbachev eras resembled the former much more than the latter, although hints of reform emerged as early as 1983.\nAndropov interregnum.\nBrezhnev died on 10 November 1982. After a two-day power struggle Yuri Andropov became the new General Secretary. He maneuvered his way into power both through his KGB connections and by gaining the support of the military by promising not to cut defense spending. For comparison, some of his rivals such as Konstantin Chernenko were skeptical of a continued high military budget. Aged 68, Andropov was the oldest person ever appointed as General Secretary. Andropov began a thorough house-cleaning throughout the party and state bureaucracy, a decision made easy by the fact that the Central Committee had an average age of 69. He replaced more than one-fifth of the Soviet ministers and regional party first secretaries and more than one-third of the department heads within the Central Committee apparatus. As a result, he replaced the aging leadership with younger, more vigorous administrators. But Andropov's ability to reshape the top leadership was constrained by his own age and poor health and the influence of Chernenko, his rival and longtime ally of Brezhnev who had previously supervised personnel matters in the Central Committee.\nThe transition of power from Brezhnev to Andropov was notably the first one in Soviet history to occur completely peacefully with no one being imprisoned, killed, or forced from office.\nDomestic policies.\nAndropov's domestic policy leaned heavily towards restoring discipline and order to Soviet society. He eschewed radical political and economic reforms, promoting instead a small degree of candor in politics and mild economic experiments similar to those that had been associated with the late Premier Alexei Kosygin's initiatives in the mid-1960s. In tandem with such economic experiments, Andropov launched an anti-corruption drive that reached high into the government and party ranks. Unlike Brezhnev, who possessed several mansions and a fleet of luxury cars, he lived quite simply. While visiting Budapest in early 1983, he expressed interest in Hungary's Goulash Communism and that the sheer size of the Soviet economy made strict top-down planning impractical. Changes were needed in a hurry for 1982 had witnessed the country's worst economic performance, with real GDP growth at almost zero percent.\nForeign policies.\nAndropov faced a series of foreign policy crises: the hopeless situation of the Soviet army in Afghanistan, threatened revolt in Poland, growing animosity with China, the polarization threat of war in the Middle East, and troubles in Ethiopia and South Africa. The most critical threat was the \"Second Cold War\" launched by American President Ronald Reagan and a specific attack on rolling back what he denounced as the \"Evil Empire\". Reagan was using American economic power, and Soviet economic weakness, to escalate massive spending on the Cold War, emphasizing high technology that Moscow lacked. The main response was raising the military budget to 70 percent of the national budget, and supplying billions of dollars' worth of military aid to Syria, Iraq, Libya, South Yemen, the PLO, Cuba, and North Korea. That included tanks and armored troop carriers, hundreds of fighter planes, as well as anti-aircraft systems, artillery systems, and all sorts of high tech equipment for which the USSR was the main supplier for its allies. Andropov's main goal was to avoid an open war.\nIn foreign policy, the conflict in Afghanistan continued even though Andropov\u2014who now felt the invasion was a mistake\u2014half-heartedly explored options for a negotiated withdrawal. Andropov's rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the United States. During a much-publicized \"walk in the woods\" with Soviet dignitary Yuli Kvitsinsky, American diplomat Paul Nitze suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in Europe on both sides that was ultimately ignored by the Politburo. Kvitsinsky would later write that, despite his own efforts, the Soviet leadership was not interested in compromise, instead calculating that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate. On 8 March 1983, during Andropov's reign as General Secretary, U.S. President Ronald Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an \"evil empire\". The same month, on 23 March, Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative. Reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defense would be \"consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty\". However, Andropov was dismissive of this claim, and said that \"It is time they [Washington] stopped ... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war. ... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane\".\nIn August 1983, Andropov announced that the country was stopping all work on space-based weapons. Meanwhile, Soviet\u2013U.S. arms control talks on intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe were suspended by the Soviet Union in November 1983 and by the end of the year, the Soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations.\nMassive bad publicity worldwide came when Soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner, Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which carried 269 passengers and crew. It had strayed over the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983 on its scheduled route from Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul, South Korea. The Soviet system was unprepared to deal with a civilian airliner, and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question. Instead of admitting an accident, Soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a Western provocation. Together with its low credibility explanation in 1986 of the meltdown of the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises; the propaganda system was only aimed at people who already were committed friends of the Soviet Union. Both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures, compounded by human error.\nUS\u2212Soviet relations deteriorated rapidly especially after \"evil empire\" denunciation. The official press agency TASS accused Reagan of \"thinking only in terms of confrontation and bellicose, lunatic anti-communism\". Further Soviet outrage was directed at Reagan's stationing of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe. In Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua and elsewhere, under the Reagan Doctrine, the US began undermining Soviet-supported governments by supplying arms to anti-communist resistance movements in these countries.\nReagan's decision to deploy medium-range Pershing II missiles in Western Europe met with mass protests in countries such as France and West Germany, sometimes numbering 1 million people at a time. Many Europeans became convinced that the US and not the Soviet Union was the more aggressive country, and there was fear over the prospect of a war, especially since there was a widespread conviction in Europe that the US, being separated from the Red Army by two oceans as opposed to a short land border, was insensitive to the people of Germany and other countries. Moreover, the memory of World War II was still strong and many Germans could not forget the destruction and mass rapes committed by Soviet troops in the closing days of that conflict. This attitude was helped along by the Reagan Administration's comments that a war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact would not necessarily result in the use of nuclear weapons.\nAndropov's death and legacy.\nAndropov's health declined rapidly during the tense summer and fall of 1983, and he became the first Soviet leader to miss the anniversary celebrations of the 1917 revolution that November. He died in February 1984 of kidney failure after disappearing from public view for several months.\nAmong his legacy to the Soviet Union was his discovery and promotion of Mikhail Gorbachev. Beginning in 1978, Gorbachev advanced in two years through the Kremlin hierarchy to full membership in the Politburo. His responsibilities for the appointment of personnel allowed him to make the contacts and distribute the favors necessary for a future bid to become general secretary. At this point, Western experts believed that Andropov was grooming Gorbachev as his successor. However, although Gorbachev acted as a deputy to the general secretary throughout Andropov's illness, Gorbachev's time had not yet arrived when his patron died early in 1984.\nChernenko interregnum.\nAt 73, Konstantin Chernenko was in poor health, suffering from emphysema, and unable to play an active role in policy making when he was chosen, after lengthy discussion, to succeed Andropov. But Chernenko's short time in office did bring some significant policy changes. The personnel changes and investigations into corruption undertaken under Andropov's tutelage came to an end. Chernenko advocated more investment in consumer goods and services and in agriculture. He also called for a reduction in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's (CPSU) micromanagement of the economy and greater attention to public opinion. However, KGB repression of Soviet dissidents also increased. In February 1983, Soviet representatives withdrew from the World Psychiatric Organization in protest of that group's continued complaints about the use of psychiatry to suppress dissent. This policy was underlined in June when Vladimir Danchev, a broadcaster for Radio Moscow, referred to the Soviet troops in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan as \"invaders\" while conducting English-language broadcasts. After refusing to retract this statement, he was sent to a mental institution for several months. Valery Senderov, a leader of an unofficial union of professional workers, was sentenced to seven years in a labor camp early in the year for speaking out on discrimination practiced against Jews in education and the professions.\nAlthough Chernenko had called for renewed \"d\u00e9tente\" with the West, little progress was made towards closing the rift in East\u2212West relations during his rule. The Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, retaliating for the United States-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. In September 1984, the Soviet Union also prevented a visit to West Germany by East German leader Erich Honecker. Fighting in Afghanistan also intensified, but in the late autumn of 1984 the United States and the Soviet Union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985.\nRise of Gorbachev.\nIn addition to the failing economy, the prolonged war in Afghanistan, often referred to as the Soviet Union's \"Vietnam War\", led to increased public dissatisfaction with the Communist regime. Also, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 added motive force to Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika reforms, which eventually spiraled out of control and caused the Soviet system to collapse.\nOusting the old guard.\nAfter years of stagnation, the \"new thinking\" of younger Communist apparatchik began to emerge. Following the death of terminally ill Konstantin Chernenko, the Politburo elected Mikhail Gorbachev to the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1985. At 54, Gorbachev was the youngest person since Joseph Stalin to become General Secretary and the country's first head of state born a Soviet citizen instead of a subject of the tsar. During his official confirmation on 11 March, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko spoke of how the new Soviet leader had filled in for Chernenko as CC Secretariat, and praised his intelligence and flexible, pragmatic ideas instead of rigid adherence to party ideology. Gorbachev was aided by a lack of serious competition in the Politburo. He immediately began appointing younger men of his generation to important party posts, including Nikolai Ryzhkov, Secretary of Economics, Viktor Cherbrikov, KGB Chief, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze (replacing the 75-year-old Gromyko), Secretary of Defense Industries Lev Zaikov, and Secretary of Construction Boris Yeltsin. Removed from the Politburo and Secretariat was Grigory Romanov, who had been Gorbachev's most significant rival for the position of General Secretary. Gromyko's removal as Foreign Minister was the most unexpected change given his decades of unflinching, faithful service compared to the unknown, inexperienced Shevardnadze.\nMore predictably, the 80-year-old Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was succeeded by Nikolai Ryzhkov, and Vasili Kuznetsov, the acting Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, was succeeded by Andrei Gromyko, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nFurther down the chain, up to 40% of the first secretaries of the \"oblasts\" (provinces) were replaced with younger, better educated, and more competent men. The defense establishment was also given a thorough shakeup with the commanders of all 16 military districts replaced along with all theaters of military operation, as well as the three Soviet fleets. Not since World War II had the Soviet military had such a rapid turnover of officers. Sixty-eight-year-old Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov was fully rehabilitated after having fallen from favor in 1983\u201384 due to his handling of the KAL 007 shootdown and his ideas about improving Soviet strategic and tactical doctrines were made into an official part of defense policy, although some of his other ambitions such as developing the military into a smaller, tighter force based on advanced technology were not considered feasible for the time being. Many, but not all, of the younger army officers appointed during 1985 were proteges of Ogarkov.\nGorbachev got off to an excellent start during his first months in power. He projected an aura of youth and dynamism compared to his aged predecessors and made frequent walks in the streets of the major cities answering questions from ordinary citizens. He became the first leader that spoke with the Soviet people in person. When he made public speeches, he made clear that he was interested in constructive exchanges of ideas instead of merely reciting lengthy platitudes about the excellence of the Soviet system. He also spoke candidly about the slackness and run-down condition of Soviet society in recent years, blaming alcohol abuse, poor workplace discipline, and other factors for these situations. Alcohol was a particular nag of Gorbachev's, especially as he himself did not drink, and he made one of his major policy aims curbing the consumption of it.\nForeign policy.\nIn terms of foreign policy, the most important one, relations with the United States, remained twitchy through 1985. In October, Gorbachev made his first visit to a non-communist country when he traveled to France and was warmly received. The fashion-conscious French were also captivated by his wife Raisa and political pundits widely believed that the comparatively young Soviet leader would have a PR advantage over President Reagan, who was 20 years his senior.\nReagan and Gorbachev met for the first time in Geneva in November. The three weeks preceding the summit meeting were marked by an unprecedented Soviet media campaign against the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), taking advantage of opposition at home in the US to the program. When it finally took place, the two superpower leaders established a solid rapport that boded well for the future despite Reagan's refusal to compromise on abandonment of SDI. A joint communique by both parties stated that they were in agreement that nuclear war could not be won by either side and must never be allowed to happen. It was also agreed that Reagan and Gorbachev would carry out two more summit meetings in 1986\u201387.\nJimmy Carter had decisively ended the policy of d\u00e9tente by financially aiding the Mujahideen movement in Afghanistan. This served as a pretext for the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan six months later with the aims of supporting the Afghan government, controlled by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. Tensions between the superpowers increased during this time, when Carter placed trade embargoes on the Soviet Union and stated that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was \"the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War.\"\nEconomy.\nEast-West tensions increased during the 1981\u20131985 first term of US President Ronald Reagan, reaching levels not seen since the Cuban Missile Crisis as Reagan increased US military spending to 7% of the GDP. To match the military buildup, the Soviet Union increased its own military spending to 27% of its GDP and froze production of civilian goods at 1980 levels, causing a sharp economic decline in the already failing Soviet economy.\nThe US financed the training for the Mujahideen warlords in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, which eventually culminated in fall of the Soviet satellite state. While the CIA and MI6 and the People's Liberation Army of China financed the operation along with the Pakistan government against the Soviet Union, eventually the Soviet Union began looking for a withdrawal route and in 1988 the Geneva Accords were signed between Communist-Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; under the terms Soviet troops were to withdraw. Once the withdrawal was complete the Pakistan ISI continued to support the Mujahideen against the Communist Government and by 1992, the government collapsed. US President Reagan also actively hindered the Soviet Union's ability to sell natural gas to Europe whilst simultaneously actively working to keep gas prices low, which kept the price of Soviet oil low and further starved the Soviet Union of foreign capital. This \"long-term strategic offensive,\" which contrasts with the essentially reactive and defensive strategy of \"containment\", accelerated the fall of the Soviet Union by encouraging it to overextend its economic base.\nThe proposition that special operations by the CIA in Saudi Arabia affected the prices of Soviet oil was refuted by Marshall Goldman\u2014one of the leading experts on the economy of the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the Saudis decreased their production of oil in 1985 (it reached a 16-year low), whereas the peak of oil production was reached in 1980. They increased the production of oil in 1986, reduced it in 1987 with a subsequent increase in 1988, but not to the levels of 1980 when production reached its highest level. The real increase happened in 1990, by which time the Cold War was almost over. Goldman asked why, if Saudi Arabia had such an effect on Soviet oil prices, did prices not fall in 1980 when the production of oil by Saudi Arabia reached its highest level\u2014three times as much oil as in the mid-eighties\u2014and why did the Saudis wait till 1990 to increase their production, five years after the CIA's supposed intervention? Why didn't the Soviet Union collapse in 1980 then?\nBy the time Gorbachev ushered in the process that would lead to the dismantling of the Soviet administrative command economy through his programs of \"uskoreniye\" (speed-up of economic development) and \"perestroika\" (political and economic restructuring) announced in 1986, the Soviet economy suffered from both hidden inflation and pervasive supply shortages aggravated by an increasingly open black market that undermined the official economy. Additionally, the costs of superpower status\u2014the military, space program, subsidies to client states\u2014were out of proportion to the Soviet economy. The new wave of industrialization based upon information technology had left the Soviet Union desperate for Western technology and credits in order to counter its increasing backwardness.\nReforms.\nThe Law on Cooperatives enacted in May 1988 was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since Vladimir Lenin's New Economic Policy, the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.\n\"Glasnost\" resulted in greater freedom of speech and the press becoming far less controlled. Thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were also released. Soviet social science became free to explore and publish on many subjects that had previously been off limits, including conducting public opinion polls. The All\u2212Union Center for Public Opinion Research (VCIOM)\u2014the most prominent of several polling organizations that were started then\u2014 was opened. State archives became more accessible, and some social statistics that had been kept secret became open for research and publication on sensitive subjects such as income disparities, crime, suicide, abortion, and infant mortality. The first center for gender studies was opened within a newly formed Institute for the Socio\u2212Economic Study of Human Population.\nIn January 1987, Gorbachev called for democratization: the infusion of democratic elements such as multi-candidate elections into the Soviet political process. A 1987 conference convened by Soviet economist and Gorbachev adviser Leonid Abalkin, concluded: \"Deep transformations in the management of the economy cannot be realized without corresponding changes in the political system.\"\nIn June 1988, at the CPSU's Nineteenth Party Conference, Gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus. On 1 December 1988, the Supreme Soviet amended the Soviet constitution to allow for the establishment of a Congress of People's Deputies as the Soviet Union's new supreme legislative body.\nElections to the new Congress of People's Deputies were held throughout the USSR in March and April 1989. Gorbachev, as General Secretary of the Communist Party, could be forced to resign at any moment if the communist elite became dissatisfied with him. To proceed with reforms opposed by the majority of the communist party, Gorbachev aimed to consolidate power in a new position, President of the Soviet Union, which was independent from the CPSU and the soviets (councils) and whose holder could be impeached only in case of direct violation of the law. On 15 March 1990, Gorbachev was elected as the first executive president. At the same time, Article 6 of the constitution was changed to deprive the CPSU of a monopoly on political power.\nUnintended consequences.\nGorbachev's efforts to streamline the Communist system offered promise, but ultimately proved uncontrollable and resulted in a cascade of events that eventually concluded with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initially intended as tools to bolster the Soviet economy, the policies of \"perestroika\" and \"glasnost\" soon led to unintended consequences.\nRelaxation under \"glasnost\" resulted in the Communist Party losing its absolute grip on the media. Before long, and much to the embarrassment of the authorities, the media began to expose severe social and economic problems the Soviet government had long denied and actively concealed. Problems receiving increased attention included poor housing, alcoholism, drug abuse, pollution, outdated Stalin-era factories, and petty to large-scale corruption, all of which the official media had ignored. Media reports also exposed crimes committed by Joseph Stalin and the Soviet regime, such as the gulags, his treaty with Adolf Hitler, and the Great Purges, which had been ignored by the official media. Moreover, the ongoing war in Afghanistan, and the mishandling of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, further damaged the credibility of the Soviet government at a time when dissatisfaction was increasing.\nIn all, the positive view of Soviet life long presented to the public by the official media was rapidly fading, and the negative aspects of life in the Soviet Union were brought into the spotlight. This undermined the faith of the public in the Soviet system and eroded the Communist Party's social power base, threatening the identity and integrity of the Soviet Union itself.\nFraying amongst the members of the Warsaw Pact countries and instability of its western allies, first indicated by Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa's 1980 rise to leadership of the trade union Solidarity, accelerated, leaving the Soviet Union unable to depend upon its Eastern European satellite states for protection as a buffer zone. By 1989, following his doctrine of \"new political thinking\", Gorbachev had repudiated the Brezhnev Doctrine in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its Warsaw Pact allies (\"Sinatra Doctrine\"). Gradually, each of the Warsaw Pact countries saw their communist governments fall to popular elections and, in the case of Romania, a violent uprising. By 1990, the governments of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania, all of which had been imposed after World War II, were brought down as revolutions swept Eastern Europe.\nThe Soviet Union also began experiencing upheaval as the political consequences of \"glasnost\" reverberated throughout the country. Despite efforts at containment, the upheaval in Eastern Europe inevitably spread to nationalities within the USSR. In elections to the regional assemblies of the Soviet Union's constituent republics, nationalists as well as radical reformers swept the board. As Gorbachev had weakened the system of internal political repression, the ability of the USSR's central Moscow government to impose its will on the USSR's constituent republics had been largely undermined. Massive peaceful protests in the Baltic republics such as the Baltic Way and the Singing Revolution drew international attention and bolstered independence movements in various other regions.\nThe rise of nationalism under \"freedom of speech\" soon re-awakened simmering ethnic tensions in various Soviet republics, further discrediting the ideal of a unified Soviet people. One instance occurred in February 1988, when the government in Nagorno-Karabakh, a predominantly ethnic Armenian region in the Azerbaijan SSR, passed a resolution calling for unification with the Armenian SSR. Violence against local Azerbaijanis was reported on Soviet television, provoking massacres of Armenians in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait.\nEmboldened by the liberalized atmosphere of \"glasnost\", public dissatisfaction with economic conditions was much more overt than ever before in the Soviet period. Although \"perestroika\" was considered bold in the context of Soviet history, Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform were not radical enough to restart the country's chronically sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms made some inroads in decentralization, but Gorbachev and his team left intact most of the fundamental elements of the Stalinist system, including price controls, inconvertibility of the ruble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production.\nThe value of all consumer goods manufactured in 1990 in retail prices was about 459 billion rubles ($2.1 trillion). Nevertheless, the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue. Tax revenues declined as republic and local governments withheld tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy. The anti\u2212alcohol campaign reduced tax revenues as well, which in 1982 accounted for about 12% of all state revenue. The elimination of central control over production decisions, especially in the consumer goods sector, led to the breakdown in traditional supplier\u2212producer relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones. Thus, instead of streamlining the system, Gorbachev's decentralization caused new production bottlenecks.\nDissolution of the Soviet Union.\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union' was a process of systematic disintegration, which occurred in the economy, social structure and political structure. It resulted in the abolition of the Soviet Federal Government (\"the Union center\") and independence of the USSR's republics on 26 December 1991. The process was caused by a weakening of the Soviet government, which led to disintegration and took place from about 19 January 1990 to 26 December 1991. The process was characterized by many of the republics of the Soviet Union declaring their independence and being recognized as sovereign nation-states.\nAndrei Grachev, the Deputy Head of the Intelligence Department of the Central Committee, summed up the denouement of the downfall quite cogently:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Gorbachev actually put the sort of final blow to the resistance of the Soviet Union by killing the fear of the people. It was still that this country was governed and kept together, as a structure, as a government structure, by the fear from Stalinist times.\"\nPost-Soviet restructuring.\nTo restructure the Soviet administrative command system and implement a transition to a market economy, Yeltsin's shock program was employed within days of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The subsidies to money-losing farms and industries were cut, price controls abolished, and the ruble moved towards convertibility. New opportunities for Yeltsin's circle and other entrepreneurs to seize former state property were created, thus restructuring the old state-owned economy within a few months.\nAfter obtaining power, the vast majority of \"idealistic\" reformers gained huge possessions of state property using their positions in the government and became business oligarchs in a manner that appeared antithetical to an emerging democracy. Existing institutions were conspicuously abandoned prior to the establishment of new legal structures of the market economy such as those governing private property, overseeing financial markets, and enforcing taxation.\nMarket economists believed that the dismantling of the administrative command system in Russia would raise GDP and living standards by allocating resources more efficiently. They also thought the collapse would create new production possibilities by eliminating central planning, substituting a decentralized market system, eliminating huge macroeconomic and structural distortions through liberalization, and providing incentives through privatization.\nSince the USSR's collapse, Russia faced many problems that free market proponents in 1992 did not expect. Among other things, 25% of the population lived below the poverty line, life expectancy had fallen, birthrates were low, and the GDP was halved. There was a sharp increase in economic inequality between 1988/1989 and 1993/1995, with the Gini ratio increasing by an average of 9 points for all former socialist countries. These problems led to a series of crises in the 1990s, which nearly led to the election of Yeltsin's Communist challenger, Gennady Zyuganov, in the 1996 presidential election. After the turn of the century, the economy of Russia has begun to improve greatly, due to major investments and business development and also due to high prices of natural resources.\nHistoriography.\nAccording to Boris N. Mironov, by 2020 Russian scholars had produced over 300 books, 3000 articles, and 20 dissertations trying to explain the collapse. Two approaches were taken. The first is to look at the short term, 1985\u20131991, emphasizing personalities. external causes and policy mistakes. The second looks at long-term economic, political, cultural, and social structures.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is closely related to, and mutually intelligible with, Standard Italian which is based on its sister Florentine dialect.\nCorsica is situated approximately 123.9\u00a0km (77.0 miles; 66 nautical miles) off the western coast of Tuscany; and with historical connections, the Corsican language is considered a part of Tuscan varieties, from that part of the Italian peninsula, and thus is closely related to Florentine-based standard Italian.\nUnder the long-standing influence of Tuscany's Pisa, and the historic Republic of Genoa, over Corsica, the Corsican language once filled the role of a vernacular, with Italian functioning as the island's official language until France acquired the island from the Republic of Genoa (1768); by 1859, French had replaced Italian as Corsica's first language so much so that, by the time of the Liberation of France (1945), nearly every islander had at least a working-knowledge of French. The 20th century saw a vast language shift, with the islanders adapting and changing their communications to the extent that there were no monolingual Corsican-speakers left by the 1960s. By 1995, an estimated 65% of islanders had some degree of proficiency in Corsican, and a minority of around 10% used Corsican as a first language.\nClassification.\nCorsican is classed as a regional language under French law. It is almost universally agreed that Corsican is typologically and traditionally Italo-Romance, but its specific position therein is more controversial. Some scholars argue that Corsican belongs to the Centro-Southern Italian dialects, while others are of the opinion that it is closely related to, or as part of, Italy's Tuscan dialect varieties. Italian and the dialects of Corsican (especially Northern Corsican) are in fact very mutually intelligible. Southern Corsican, in spite of the geographical proximity, has as its closest linguistic neighbour not Sardinian (a separate group with which it is not mutually intelligible), but rather the Extreme Southern Italian dialects like Siculo-Calabrian. It has been theorised, on the other hand, that a Sardinian variety, or a variety very similar to Sardo-Romance, might have been originally spoken in Corsica prior to the island's Tuscanisation under Pisan and Genoese rule.\nThe matter is controversial in light of the historical, cultural and particularly strong linguistic bonds that Corsica had traditionally formed with the Italian Mainland from the Middle Ages until the 19th century: in contrast to the neighbouring Sardinia, Corsica's installment into a diglossic system with Italian as the island's prestige language ran so deep that both Corsican and Italian might be even, and in fact were, perceived as two sociolinguistic levels of a single language. Corsican and Italian traditionally existed on a spectrum, and the dividing lines between them were blurred enough that the locals needed little else but a change of register to communicate in an official setting. \"Tuscanising\" their tongue, or as the Corsican elites would have once said, \"parl\u00e0 in crusca\" (\"speaking in \"crusca\"\", from the name of the Academy dedicated to the standardisation of the Italian language), allowed for a practice not of code-switching, but rather of code-mixing which is quite typical of the Mainland Italian dialects. Italian was perceived as different from Corsican, but not as much as the differences between the two main isoglosses of Northern and Southern Corsican, as spoken by their respective native speakers. When Pasquale Paoli found himself exiled in London, he replied to Samuel Johnson's query on the peculiar existence of a \"rustic language\" very different from Italian that such a language existed only in Sardinia; in fact, the existence of Corsican as the island's native vernacular did not take anything away from Paoli's claims that Corsica's official language was Italian.\nToday's Corsican is the result of these historical vicissitudes, which have morphed the language to an idiom that bears a strong resemblance to the medieval Tuscan once spoken at the time of Dante and Boccaccio, and still existing in peripheral Tuscany (Lucca, Garfagnana, Elba, Capraia). The correspondence of modern Corsican to ancient Tuscan can be seen from almost any aspect of the language, ranging from the phonetics, morphology, lexicon to the syntax. One of the characteristics of standard Italian is the retention of the -\"re\" infinitive ending, as in Latin \"mittere\" \"send\"; such infinitival ending is lost in Tuscan as well as Corsican, resulting in the outcome \"mette\" / \"metta\", \"to put\". Whereas the relative pronoun in Italian for \"who\" is \"chi\" and \"what\" is \"che\"/\"(che) cosa\", it is an uninflected \"ch\u00ec\" in Corsican. The only unifying, as well as distinctive, feature which separates the Corsican dialects from the mainland Tuscan ones, with the exception of Amiatino, Pitiglianese, and Capraiese, is the retention of word-final \"o\"-\"u\". For example, the Italian demonstrative pronouns \"questo\" \"this\" and \"quello\" \"that\" become in Corsican \"questu\" or \"quistu\" and \"quellu\" or \"quiddu\": this feature was also typical of the early Italian texts during the Middle Ages.\nEven after the acquisition of Corsica by Louis XV, Italian continued to be the island's language of education, literature, religion and local affairs. The affluent youth still went to Italy to pursue higher studies. (It has been estimated that Corsican presence in Pisa amounted to a fourth of the University's total student body in 1830.) Local civil registers continued to be written in Italian until 1855; it was on 9 May 1859, that Italian was replaced by French as the island's official language, although the latter would start to take root among the islanders from 1882 onwards, through the Jules Ferry laws aimed at spreading literacy across the French provinces. Even so, a specifically homegrown Corsican (rather than Italian) literature in Corsica only developed belatedly and, in its earliest phase, there were no autonomous cultural instances; Corsican writers, such as Salvatore Viale, even prided themselves on their affiliation to the broader Italian sphere, considering Corsican \"one of the lowest, impure dialects of Italy\".\nIt was the Italian Fascist aggressive claims to the island in the 20th century, followed by their invasion, that provoked a popular backlash, estranging the native islanders from standard Italian and, if anything, only accelerated their shifting to the French even further. By the Liberation of France, any previously existing link between the two linguistic varieties and with Italy altogether had been severed; any promotion of Corsican, which had been politicized by the local collaborators with the regime, would be met with popular criticism and even suspicion of potentially harboring irredentist sentiments. From then on, Corsican would grow independently of Italian to become, later in the 1970s, a centerpiece of the \"Riacquistu\" (\"reacquisition\") movement for the rediscovery of Corsican culture. Nationalist calls for Corsican to be put on the same footing as French led the French National Assembly, in 1974, to extend the 1951 Deixonne Law, which initially recognized only a few languages (Breton, Basque, Catalan and Occitan), to including Corsican as well, among others, not as a dialect of Italian, but as one of France's full-fledged regional languages. (See governmental support.)\nOrigins.\nThe common relationship between Corsica and central Italy can be traced from as far back as the Etruscans, who asserted their presence on the island in as early as 500 BC. In 40 AD, the natives of Corsica reportedly did not speak Latin. The Roman exile, Seneca the Younger, reported that both coast and interior were occupied by natives whose language he was not able to understand. More specifically, Seneca claimed that the island's population was the result of the stratification of different ethnic groups, such as the Greeks, the Ligures (see the Ligurian hypothesis) and the Iberians, whose language had long since stopped being recognizable among the population due to the intermixing of the other two groups. The occupation of the island by the Vandals around the year 469 marked the end of authoritative influence by Latin speakers. (See Medieval Corsica.) If the natives of that time spoke Latin, they must have acquired it during the late empire.\nModern Corsican has been influenced by the languages of the major powers taking an interest in Corsican affairs; earlier by those of the medieval Italian powers, such as the Papal States (828\u20131077), the Republic of Pisa (1077\u20131282) and the Republic of Genoa (1282\u20131768), and finally by France which, since 1859, has promulgated the official Parisian French. The term \"gallicised Corsican\" refers to the evolution of Corsican starting from about the year 1950, whereas \"distanciated Corsican\" refers to an idealized variety of Corsican following linguistic purism, by means of removing any French-derived elements.\nDialects.\nCorsica.\nThe two most widely spoken forms of the Corsican language are the groups spoken in the Bastia and Corte area (generally throughout the northern half of the island, known as Haute-Corse, \"Cismonte\" or \"Corsica suprana\"), and the groups spoken around Sart\u00e8ne and Porto-Vecchio (generally throughout the southern half of the island, known as Corse-du-Sud, \"Pumonti\" or ). The dialect of Ajaccio has been described as in transition. The dialects spoken at Calvi and Bonifacio (Bonifacino) are dialects of the Ligurian language.\nThis division along the Girolata-Porto Vecchio line was due to the massive immigration from Tuscany which took place in Corsica during the lower Middle Ages: as a result, the northern Corsican dialects became very close to a central Italian dialect like Tuscan, while the southern Corsican varieties could keep the original characteristics of the language which make it much more similar to Sicilian and, only to some extent, Sardinian.\nNorthern Corsican.\nThe Northern Corsican macro variety (\"Supranacciu\", \"Supranu\", \"Cismuntincu\" or \"Cismontano\") is the most widespread on the island and standardised as well, and is spoken in North-West Corsica around the districts of Bastia and Corte. The dialects of Bastia and Cap Corse belong to the Western Tuscan dialects; they being, with the exception of Florentine, the closest to standard Italian. All the dialects presenting, in addition to what has already been stated, the conditional formed in (e.g. \"she would love\") are generally considered \"Cismontani\" dialects, situated north of a line uniting the villages of Piana, Vico, Vizzavona, Ghisoni and Ghisonaccia, and also covering the subgroups from the Cap Corse (which, unlike the rest of the island and similarly to Italian, uses \"lu\", \"li\", \"la\", \"le\" as definite articles), Bastia (besides i &gt; e and a &gt; e, u &gt; o: , , , ; a &gt; o: , , ), Balagna, Niolo and Corte (which retain the general Corsican traits: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ).\nTransitional area.\nAcross the Northern and Southern borders of the line separating the Northern dialects from the Southern ones, there is a transitional area picking up linguistic phenomena associated with either of the two groups, with some local peculiarities. Along the Northern line are the dialects around Piana and Calcatoggio, from Cinarca with Vizzavona (which form the conditional as in the South), and Fiumorbo through Ghisonaccia and Ghisoni, which have the retroflex sound (written \"-dd-\") for historical -ll-; along the Southern line, the dialects of Ajaccio (retroflex \"-dd-\", realized as -\"ghj\"-, feminine plurals ending in \"i\", some Northern words like \"cane\" and \"accatt\u00e0\" instead of \"ghjacaru\" and \"cumpr\u00e0\", as well as \"ellu\"/\"ella\" and not \"eddu\"/\"edda\"; minor variations: \"sabbatu\" &gt; \"sabbitu\", \"u li d\u00e0\" &gt; \"ghi lu d\u00e0\"; final syllables often stressed and truncated: \"marinari\" &gt; \"marin\u00e0\", &gt; \"panatt\u00e8\", \"castellu\" &gt; \"cast\u00e8\", \"cuchjari\" &gt; \"cuchj\u00e0\"), the Gravona area, Bastelica (which would be classified as Southern, but is also noted for its typical rhotacism: \"Basterga\") and Solenzara, which did not preserve the Latin short vowels: \"seccu\", \"peru\", \"rossu\", \"croci\", \"pozzu\".\nSouthern Corsican.\nThe Southern Corsican macro variety (\"Suttanacciu\", \"Suttanu\", \"Pumuntincu\" or \"Oltramontano\") is the most archaic and conservative group, spoken in the districts of Sart\u00e8ne and Porto-Vecchio. Unlike the Northern varieties and similarly to Sardinian, the group retains the distinction of the Latin short vowels \"\u012d\" and \"\u016d\" (e.g. \"pilu\", \"bucca\"). It is also strongly marked by the presence of the voiced retroflex stop, like Sicilian (e.g. \"aceddu\", \"beddu\", \"quiddu\", \"ziteddu\", \"famidda\"), and the conditional mood formed in \"-\u00eca\" (e.g. \"(idda) amar\u00eca\" \"she would love\"). All the \"Oltramontani\" dialects are from an area located to the South of Porticcio, Bastelica, Col di Verde and Solenzara. Notable dialects are those from around Taravo (retroflex -\"dd\"- only for historical -ll-: \"frateddu\", \"suredda\", \"beddu\"; preservation of the palatal lateral approximant: \"pigli\u00e0\", \"famiglia\", \"figliolu\", ; does not preserve the Latin short vowels: \"seccu\", \"peru\", \"rossu\", \"croci\", \"pozzu\"), Sart\u00e8ne (preserving the Latin short vowels: \"siccu\", \"piru\", \"russu\", \"cruci\", \"puzzu\"; changing historical \"-rn-\" to \"-rr-\": \"forru\", \"carri\", \"corru\"; substituting the stop for the palatal lateral approximant: \"pidd\u00e0\", \"famidda\", \"fiddolu\", \"voddu\"; imperfect tense like \"cant\u00e0vami\", \"cant\u00e0vani\"; masculine plurals ending in \"a\": \"l'ochja\", \"i poma\"; having \"eddu/edda/eddi\" as personal pronouns), the Alta Rocca (the most conservative area in Corsica, being very close to the varieties spoken in Northern Sardinia), and the Southern region located between the hinterlands of Porto-Vecchio and Bonifacio (masculine singulars always ending in \"u\": \"fiumu\", \"paesu\", \"patronu\"; masculine plurals always ending in \"a\": \"i letta\", \"i solda\", \"i ponta\", \"i foca\", \"i mura\", \"i loca\", \"i balcona\"; imperfect tense like \"cant\u00e0iami\", \"cant\u00e0iani\").\nSardinia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sassarese derives from the Italian language and, more precisely, from ancient Tuscan, which by the 12th century had slowly grown to become the parlance of the commoners, at a time when the bourgeois and nobles still spoke Logudorese Sardinian. During the age of the Free Commune (1294\u20131323), the Sassarese dialect was nothing more than a contaminated Pisan, to which Sardinian, Corsican and Spanish expressions had been added; it is therefore not an indigenous dialect, but rather a continental one and, to be more specific, a mixed Tuscan dialect with its own peculiarities, and different from the Corsican-imported Gallurese.\u2014\u200a\nSome Italo-Romance languages that might have originated from Southern Corsican, but are also heavily influenced by the Sardinian language, are spoken in the neighbouring island of Sardinia.\nGallurese is spoken in the extreme north of the island, including the region of Gallura, while Sassarese is spoken in Sassari and in its neighbourhood, in the northwest of Sardinia. Their geographical position in Sardinia has been theorised to be the result of different migration waves from the already tuscanized Corsicans and the Tuscans, who then proceeded to settle in Sardinia and slowly displace the indigenous Logudorese Sardinian varieties spoken therein (at present, Luras is the only town in the middle of Gallura that has retained the original language).\nOn the Maddalena archipelago, which was culturally Corsican but had been annexed to the Savoyard Kingdom of Sardinia a short while before Corsica was ceded by Genoa to France in 1767, the local dialect (called \"isulanu\" or \"maddaleninu\") was brought by fishermen and shepherds from Bonifacio over a long period of immigration in the 17th and 18th centuries. Though influenced by Gallurese, it has maintained the original characteristics of Southern Corsican. In the dialect of \"maddalenino\", as it is known in Italian, there are also numerous words of Genoese and Ponzese origin.\nAlthough Gallurese and Sassarese both belong to Italo-Dalmatian, which is a group typologically different from Sardinian, it has long been a subject of debate whether the two should be included as dialects either of Corsican or of Sardinian or, in light of their historical development, even considered languages of their own. It has been argued that all these varieties should be placed in a single category, Southern Romance, but such classification has not garnered universal support among linguists.\nOn 14 October 1997, Article 2 Item 4 of Law Number 26 of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia granted \"the Sassarese and Gallurese dialects\" (\u00ab\"al dialetto sassarese e a quello gallurese\"\u00bb) equal legal status with the other languages indigenous to Sardinia. Thus, even though they would technically not be covered by the national law pertaining to the historical linguistic minorities, among which is Sardinian, Sassarese and Gallurese are nonetheless recognized by the Sardinian government on a regional level.\nNumber of speakers.\nThe situation of Corsican with regard to French as the country's national language is analogous to that of many other French regions and provinces, which have or used to have a traditional language of their own, even though the islanders' switch from their local idiom to regional French has happened relatively later and the presence of Corsican, albeit declining, is still strongly felt among the population. In 1980, about 70 percent of the island's population \"had some command of the Corsican language.\" In 1990, out of a total population of about 254,000, the percentage had declined to 50 percent, with 10 percent of the island's residents using it as a first language. The language appeared to be in serious decline when the French government reversed its unsupportive stand and initiated some strong measures to save it.\nThe January 2007 estimated population of Corsica was 281,000, whereas the figure for the March 1999 census, when most of the studies\u2014though not the linguistic survey work referenced in this article\u2014were performed, was about 261,000. Only a fraction of the population at either time spoke Corsican with any fluency.\nAccording to an official survey run on behalf of the Territorial Collectivity of Corsica which took place in April 2013, in Corsica, the Corsican language had a number of speakers between 86,800 and 130,200, out of a total population amounting to 309,693 inhabitants. 28% of the overall population was able to speak Corsican well, while an additional 14% had a capacity to speak it \"quite well.\" The percentage of those who had a solid oral understanding of the language varies between a minimum of 25 percent in the 25\u201334 age group and the maximum of 65 percent in the over-65 age group: almost a quarter of the former age group reported that they were not able to understand Corsican, while only a small minority of the older people did not understand it. While 32 percent of the population of Northern Corsica was reported to speak Corsican quite well, this percentage dropped to 22 percent for Southern Corsica. Moreover, 10 percent of the population of Corsica spoke only French, while 62 percent code-switched between French and at least some Corsican. 8 percent of the Corsicans knew how to write correctly in Corsican, while about 60 percent of the population did not know how to write in Corsican. While 90 percent of the population was in favor of a Corsican-French bilingualism, 3 percent would have liked to have only Corsican as the official language in the island, and 7 percent would have preferred French to have this role.\nUNESCO classifies Corsican as a \"definitely endangered language.\" The Corsican language is a key vehicle for Corsican culture, which is notably rich in proverbs and in polyphonic song.\nGovernmental support.\nWhen the French Assembly passed the Deixonne Law in 1951, which made it possible for regional languages to be taught at school, Alsatian, Flemish and Corsican were not included on the ground of being classified as \"dialectes allog\u00e8nes\" of German, Dutch and Italian respectively, i.e. dialects of foreign languages and not languages in themselves. Only in 1974 were they too politically recognized as regional languages for their teaching on a voluntary basis.\nThe 1991 Joxe Statute, in setting up the Collectivit\u00e9 Territoriale de Corse, also provided for the Corsican Assembly, and charged it with developing a plan for the optional teaching of Corsican. The University of Corsica Pasquale Paoli at Corte, Haute-Corse took a central role in the planning.\nAt the primary school level Corsican is taught up to a fixed number of hours per week (three in the year 2000) and is a voluntary subject at the secondary school level, but is required at the University of Corsica. It is available through adult education. It can be spoken in court or in the conduct of other government business if the officials concerned speak it. The Cultural Council of the Corsican Assembly advocates for its use, for example, on public signs.\nIn 2023, in a judgement initiated by local prefect and going in opposite direction of recent trends, usage of the Corsican language in French public offices and the regional parliament was legally banned, the existence of the \"Corsican people\" was also deemed unconstitutional.\nLiterature.\nAccording to the anthropologist Dumenica Verdoni, writing new literature in modern Corsican, known as the \"Riacquistu\", is an integral part of affirming Corsican identity. Some individuals have returned from careers in continental France to write in Corsican, including Dumenicu Togniotti, director of the \"Teatru Paisanu\", which produced polyphonic musicals, 1973\u20131982, followed in 1980 by Michel Raffaelli's \"Teatru di a Testa Mora\", and Saveriu Valentini's \"Teatru Cupabbia\" in 1984. Modern prose writers include Alanu di Meglio, Ghjacumu Fusina, Lucia Santucci, and Marcu Biancarelli.\nThere were writers working in Corsican in the 1700s and 1800s.\nFerdinand Gregorovius, a 19th-century traveller and enthusiast of Corsican culture, reported that the preferred form of the literary tradition of his time was the \"vocero\", a type of polyphonic ballad originating from funeral obsequies. These laments were similar in form to the chorales of Greek drama except that the leader could improvise. Some performers were noted at this, such as the 1700s Mariola della Piazzole and Clorinda Franseschi. However, the trail of written popular literature of known date in Corsican currently goes no further back than the 17th century. An undated corpus of proverbs from communes may well precede it (see under \"External links\" below). Corsican has also left a trail of legal documents ending in the late 12th century. At that time the monasteries held considerable land on Corsica and many of the churchmen were notaries.\nBetween 1200 and 1425 the monastery of Gorgona, which belonged to the Order of Saint Benedict for much of that time and was in the territory of Pisa, acquired about 40 legal papers of various sorts related to Corsica. As the church was replacing Pisan prelates with Corsican ones there, the legal language shows a transition from entirely Latin through partially Latin and partially Corsican to entirely Corsican. The first known surviving document containing some Corsican is a bill of sale from Patrimonio dated to 1220. These documents were moved to Pisa before the monastery closed its doors and were published there. Research into earlier evidence of Corsican is ongoing.\nAlphabet and spelling.\nCorsican is written in the standard Latin script, using 21 of the letters for native words, like in Italian. The letters j, k, w, x, and y are found only in foreign names, still like in Italian, but also in French vocabulary. The digraphs and trigraphs \"chj\", \"ghj\", \"sc\" and \"sg\" are also defined as \"letters\" of the alphabet in its modern scholarly form (compare the presence of \"ch\" or \"ll\" in the old Spanish alphabet) and appear respectively after \"c\", \"g\" and \"s\".\nThe primary diacritic used is the grave accent, indicating word stress when it is not penultimate. In scholarly contexts, disyllables may be distinguished from diphthongs by use of the diaeresis on the former vowel (as in Italian and distinct from French and English). In older writing, the acute accent is sometimes found on stressed \u27e8e\u27e9, the circumflex on stressed \u27e8o\u27e9, indicating respectively () and () phonemes.\nCorsican has been regarded as a dialect of Italian historically, similar to the Romance lects developed on the Italian peninsula, and in writing, it also resembles Italian (with the generalised substitution of -\"u\" for final -\"o\" and the articles \"u\" and \"a\" for \"il/lo\" and \"la\" respectively; however, both the dialect of Cap Corse and Gallurese retain the original articles \"lu\" and \"la\"). On the other hand, the phonemes of the modern Corsican dialects have undergone complex and sometimes irregular phenomena depending on phonological context, so the pronunciation of the language for foreigners familiar with other Romance languages is not straightforward.\nPhonology.\nVowels.\nAs in Italian, the grapheme \u27e8i\u27e9 appears in some digraphs and trigraphs in which it does not represent the phonemic vowel. All vowels are pronounced except in a few well-defined instances. \u27e8i\u27e9 is not pronounced between \u27e8sc/sg/c/g\u27e9 and \u27e8a/o/u\u27e9: \"sciarpa\" ; or initially in some words: \"istu\" \nVowels may be nasalized before \u27e8n\u27e9 (which is assimilated to \u27e8m\u27e9 before \u27e8p\u27e9 or \u27e8b\u27e9) and the palatal nasal consonant represented by \u27e8gn\u27e9. The nasal vowels are represented by the vowel plus \u27e8n\u27e9, \u27e8m\u27e9 or \u27e8gn\u27e9. The combination is a digraph or trigraph indicating the nasalized vowel. The consonant is pronounced in weakened form. The same combination of letters might not be the digraph or trigraph but might be just the non-nasal vowel followed by the consonant at full weight. The speaker must know the difference. Example of nasal: \u27e8pane\u27e9 is pronounced and not .\nThe Northern and central dialects in the vicinity of the Taravo river adopt the Italian seven-vowel system (the Italo-Western type and a unique type where the short high vowels of Latin are uniquely reflected as mid-low vowels), whereas all the Southern ones around the so-called \"archaic zone\" with its centre being the town of Sart\u00e8ne (including the Gallurese dialect spoken in Northern Sardinia) resort to a five-vowel system without length differentiation, like Sardinian.\nThe vowel inventory, or collection of phonemic vowels (and the major allophones), transcribed in IPA symbols, is:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
