Although the content is mostly derived from the \"Discourses of Epictetus\", it is not a summary of the \"Discourses\" but rather a compilation of practical precepts. Eschewing metaphysics, Arrian focuses his attention on Epictetus's work applying philosophy to daily life. Thus, the book is a manual to show the way to achieve mental freedom and happiness in all circumstances.\nThe \"Enchiridion\" was well known in the medieval world and was specially adapted for use in Greek-speaking monasteries. In the 15th century it was translated into Latin, and then, with the advent of printing, into multiple European languages. It reached the height of popularity in the 17th century, in parallel with the Neostoicism movement.\nContents.\nThe word \"Enchiridion\" () is an adjective meaning \"in the hand\" or \"ready to hand\". The word sometimes meant a handy sword, or dagger, but coupled with the word \"book\" (\"biblion\", ) it means a handy book or hand-book. Epictetus in the \"Discourses\" often speaks of principles which his pupils should have \"ready to hand\" (). Common English translations of the title are Manual or Handbook.\nThe \"Enchiridion\" consists of fifty-three short chapters typically consisting of a paragraph or two, and appears to be a loosely-structured selection of maxims. It was compiled some time in the early 2nd century. Around half of the material in the \"Enchiridion\" has been shown to have been derived from the surviving four books of \"Discourses\" but variously modified. Some chapters appear to be reformulations of ideas which appear throughout the \"Discourses\". Other parts are presumed to be derived from the lost \"Discourses\".\nThe 6th-century philosopher Simplicius, in his commentary on the work, refers to a letter written by Arrian which prefaced the text. In this letter Arrian stated that the \"Enchiridion\" was selected from the \"Discourses of Epictetus\" according to what he considered to be most useful, most necessary, and most adapted to move people's minds. In his commentary, Simplicius divided the text into four distinct sections suggesting a graded approach to philosophy:\nThere are some puzzles concerning the inclusion of two chapters. Chapter 29, a one-page \"Discourse\" which compares the training needed to become a Stoic with the rigorous approach needed to become an Olympic victor, is practically word for word identical with \"Discourse\" iii.\u00a015. Since it was omitted in one of the early Christian editions (\"Par\"), and not commented on by Simplicius, it may not have been in the original edition. Chapter 33 consists of a list of moral instructions, which are \"not obviously related to Epictetus' normal Stoic framework.\"\nThemes.\nThe \"Enchiridion\" begins with the statement, \"Of things, some depend upon ourselves, others do not depend upon ourselves.\" So it starts with announcing that the business and concern of the real self is with matters subject to its own control, uninfluenced by external chance or change. Epictetus makes a sharp distinction between our own internal world of mental benefits and harms and the external world beyond our control. Freedom is to wish for nothing which is not up to ourselves. When we are tried by misfortune, we should never let our suffering overwhelm our sense of inward mastery and freedom.\nA constant vigilance is required, and one should never relax attention to one's reason, for it is judgements, not things, which disturb people.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about the things. For example, \"death is nothing dreadful (or else it would have appeared dreadful to Socrates)\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"\nReason is the decisive principle in everything. Thus, we must exercise our power of assent over impressions and wish for nothing, nor avoid anything that is up to other people.\nTo a large extent, the \"Enchiridion\" suppresses many of the more amiable aspects of Epictetus, which can be found in the \"Discourses\", but this reflects the nature of the compilation. Some believe that, unlike the \"Discourses\" which seeks to encourage the student through argument and logic, the \"Enchiridion\" largely consists of a set of rules to follow. Others challenge this view, arguing that the chapters of the \"Enchiridion\" can be interpreted as containing arguments and articulating concepts that develop progressively throughout the work. The work is built on the conception that the wise person, by the aid of philosophy, may reap benefit from every experience in life. With proper training the student can flourish in adverse situations as well as favorable ones. The human spirit has capacities as yet undeveloped, but which it is for our good to develop. Thus, the book is a manual on how to make progress towards what is necessary and sufficient for happiness.\nEpictetus makes vivid use of imagery, and analogies include life depicted as: a ship's voyage (Ch. 7), an inn (Ch. 11), a banquet (Chs. 15, 36), and acting in a play (Ch. 17, 37). He takes many examples from everyday life, including: a broken jug (Ch. 3), a trip to the baths (Chs. 4, 43), his own lameness (Ch. 9), the loss of a child (Ch. 11), and the price of lettuce (Ch. 25).\nReception.\nFor many centuries, the \"Enchiridion\" maintained its authority both with pagans and Christians. \nCommentary of Simplicius.\nIn the 6th century the Neoplatonist philosopher Simplicius of Cilicia wrote a huge commentary on the \"Enchiridion\", which is more than ten times the bulk of the original text. Chapter after chapter of the \"Enchiridion\" is dissected, discussed, and its lessons drawn out with a certain laboriousness. Simplicius' commentary offers a distinctly Platonist vision of the world, one which is often at odds with the Stoic content of the \"Enchiridion\". Sometimes Simplicius exceeds the scope of a commentary; thus his commentary on \"Enchiridion\" 27 (Simplicius ch. 35) becomes a refutation of Manichaeism.\nChristian adaptations.\nThe \"Enchiridion\" was adapted three different times by Greek Christian writers. The oldest manuscript, \"Paraphrasis Christiana\" (\"Par\"), dates to the 10th century. Another manuscript, falsely ascribed to Nilus (\"Nil\"), dates to the 11th century. A third manuscript, Vaticanus gr. 2231 (\"Vat\"), dates to the 14th century. It is not known when the original versions of these manuscripts were first made. These guides served as a rule and guide for monastic life. The most obvious changes are in the use of proper names: thus the name Socrates is sometimes changed to Paul. All three texts follow the \"Enchiridion\" quite closely, although the \"Par\" manuscript is more heavily modified: adding or omitting words, abridging or expanding passages, and occasionally inventing new passages.\nTransmission.\nOver one hundred manuscripts of the \"Enchiridion\" survive.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[a] The oldest extant manuscripts of the authentic \"Enchiridion\" date from the 14th century, but the oldest Christianised ones date from the 10th and 11th centuries, perhaps indicating the Byzantine world's preference for the Christian versions. The \"Enchiridion\" was first translated into Latin by Niccol\u00f2 Perotti in 1450, and then by Angelo Poliziano in 1479. The first printed edition (\"editio princeps\") was Poliziano's Latin translation published in 1497. The original Greek was first published (somewhat abbreviated) with Simplicius's \"Commentary\" in 1528. The edition published by Johann Schweigh\u00e4user in 1798 was the major edition for the next two-hundred years. A critical edition was produced by Gerard Boter in 1999.\nThe separate editions and translations of the \"Enchiridion\" are very many. The \"Enchiridion\" reached its height of popularity in the period 1550\u20131750. It was translated into most European languages, and there were multiple translations in English, French, and German. The first English translation was by James Sandford in 1567 (a translation of a French version) and this was followed by a translation (from the Greek) by John Healey in 1610. The \"Enchiridion\" was even partly translated into Chinese by the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci. The popularity of the work was assisted by the Neostoicism movement initiated by Justus Lipsius in the 16th century. Another Neostoic, Guillaume du Vair, translated the book into French in 1586 and popularised it in his \"La Philosophie morale des Stoiques\".\nModern era.\nIn the 17th century the German monk Matthias Mittner compiled a guide on mental tranquillity for the Carthusian Order by taking the first thirty-five of his fifty precepts from the \"Enchiridion\". \nIn the English-speaking world it was particularly well known in the 17th century: at that time it was the \"Enchiridion\" rather than the \"Discourses\" which was usually read. It was among the books John Harvard bequeathed to the newly founded Harvard College in 1638. The work, being written in a clear distinct style, made it accessible to readers with no formal training in philosophy, and there was a wide readership among women in England. The writer Mary Wortley Montagu made her own translation of the \"Enchiridion\" in 1710 at the age of twenty-one. The \"Enchiridion\" was a common school text in Scotland during the Scottish Enlightenment\u2014Adam Smith had a 1670 edition in his library, acquired as a schoolboy. \nAt the end of the 18th century, the \"Enchiridion\" is attested in the personal libraries of Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.\nThe Simplicius' commentary enjoyed its own period of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries. An English translation by George Stanhope in 1694 ran through four editions in the early 18th century. Edward Gibbon remarked in his \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" that Simplicius' \"Commentary on Epictetus\" \"is preserved in the library of nations, as a classic book\" unlike the commentaries on Aristotle \"which have passed away with the fashion of the times.\"\nThe current division of the work into fifty-three chapters was first adopted by Johann Schweigh\u00e4user in his 1798 edition; earlier editions tended to divide the text into more chapters (especially splitting chapter 33). Gerard Boter in his 1999 critical edition keeps Schweigh\u00e4user's fifty-three chapters but splits chapters 5, 14, 19, and 48 into two parts. \nIn the 19th century, Walt Whitman discovered the \"Enchiridion\" when he was about the age of sixteen. It was a book he would repeatedly return to, and late in life he called the book \"sacred, precious to me: I have had it about me so long\u2014lived with it in terms of such familiarity.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\na. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ Gerard Boter in his 1999 critical edition catalogues 59 extant manuscripts of the \"Encheiridion\" proper, and another 27 manuscripts of Simplicius' \"Commentary\" which contain the \"Encheiridion\" as \"lemmata\" (headings). He also lists 37 Christianised manuscripts, (24 \"Par\", 12 \"Nil\", 1 \"Vat\"). Cf. \nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Alternatively, Kinmei might have been referred to as or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\nEvents of Kinmei's life.\nBecause of several chronological discrepancies in the account of Emperor Kinmei in the \"Nihon Shoki\", some believe that he was actually ruling a rival court to that of Emperors Ankan and Senka. Nevertheless, according to the traditional account, it was not until the death of Emperor Kinmei's older brother Emperor Senka that he gained the throne.\nAccording to this account, Emperor Senka died in 539 at the age of 73; and succession passed to the third son of Emperor Keitai. This Imperial Prince was the next youngest brother of Emperor Senka. He would come to be known as Emperor Kinmei. He established his court at in Yamato.\nThe Emperor's chief counselors were:\nAlthough the imperial court was not moved to the Asuka region of Japan until 592, Emperor Kinmei's rule is considered by some to be the beginning of the Asuka period of Yamato Japan, particularly by those who associate the Asuka period primarily with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan from Baekje.\nAccording to the \"Nihon Shoki\", Emperor Kinmei received a bronze statue of Gautama Buddha as a gift from King Song Myong (\u8056\u660e\u738b, \"Seimei \u014c\") of Baekje, alongside a significant envoy of artisans, monks, and other artifacts in 552. Though some regard this event as the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan, texts such as the J\u014dg\u016b Sh\u014dtoku H\u014d\u014d Teisetsu indicate Buddhism may have been introduced as early as 538.\nThe advent of Buddhism across the Japanese Archipelago contributed to a deep rift between the Mononobe clan, whose members supported the worship of Japan's traditional deities, and the Soga clan, whose members supported the adoption of Buddhism.\nAccording to the \"Nihon Shoki\", Emperor Kinmei ruled until his death in 571. Although the text states that Emperor Kinmei was buried in the , the current scholarly consensus instead holds that he is more likely to have been buried in the , located in .\nThe Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.

According to Nihongi, he had six wives, but the \"Kojiki\" gives only five wives; identifying the third consort to be the same as the sixth one.

Moriya, the most influential supporter of Shinto, conspired with Emperor Y\u014dmei's brother, Prince Anahobe, and after Emperor Yomei's death they made an abortive attempt to seize the throne.

She was a daughter of Emperor Kinmei. Her mother was Soga no Iname's daughter, Soga no Kitashihime. Suiko was the younger sister of Emperor Y\u014dmei.\nBiography.\nEmpress Suiko was a consort to her half-brother, Emperor Bidatsu, but after Bidatsu's first wife died she became his official consort and was given the title \u014ckisaki (official consort of the emperor). She bore eight children.\nAfter Bidatsu's death, Suiko's brother, Emperor Y\u014dmei, came to power for about two years before dying of illness. Upon Y\u014dmei's death, another power struggle arose between the Soga clan and the Mononobe clan, with the Sogas supporting Prince Hatsusebe and the Mononobes supporting Prince Anahobe. The Sogas prevailed once again and Prince Hatsusebe acceded to the throne as Emperor Sushun in 587. However, Sushun began to resent the power of Soga no Umako, the head of the Soga clan, and Umako, perhaps out of fear that Sushun might strike first, had him assassinated by in 592. When asked to accede to the throne to fill the power vacuum that subsequently developed, Suiko became the first of what would be several examples in Japanese history where a woman was chosen to accede to the throne to avert a power struggle.\nSuiko's contemporary title would not have been \"tenn\u014d\", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jit\u014d. Rather, it was presumably \"Sumeramikoto\" or \"Amenoshita Shiroshimesu \u014ckimi\" (\u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b), meaning \"the great Queen who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Suiko might have been referred to as (\u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b) or the \"Great Queen of Yamato\".\nPrince Sh\u014dtoku was appointed regent the following year. Although political power during Suiko's reign is widely viewed as having been wielded by Prince Sh\u014dtoku and Soga no Umako, Suiko was far from powerless. The mere fact that she survived and her reign endured suggests she had significant political skills.\nIn 599, an earthquake destroyed buildings throughout Yamato Province in what is now Nara Prefecture.\nSuiko's refusal to grant Soga no Umako's request that he be granted the imperial territory known as Kazuraki no Agata in 624 is cited as evidence of her independence from his influence. Some of the many achievements under Empress Suiko's reign include the official recognition of Buddhism by the issuance of the Flourishing Three Treasures Edict in 594. Suiko was also one of the first Buddhist monarchs in Japan, and had taken the vows of a nun shortly before becoming empress.\nThe reign of this empress was marked by the opening of relations with the Sui court in 600, the adoption of the Twelve Level Cap and Rank System in 603 and the adoption of the Seventeen-article constitution in 604.\nThe adoption of the Sexagenary cycle calendar (\"Jikkan J\u016bnishi\") in Japan is attributed to Empress Suiko in 604.\nAt a time when imperial succession was generally determined by clan leaders rather than the emperor, Suiko left only vague indications of succession to two candidates while on her deathbed. One, Prince Tamura, was a grandson of Emperor Bidatsu and was supported by the main line of Sogas, including Soga no Emishi. The other, Prince Yamashiro, was a son of Prince Sh\u014dtoku and had the support of some lesser members of the Soga clan. After a brief struggle within the Soga clan in which one of Prince Yamashiro's main supporters was killed, Prince Tamura was chosen and he acceded to the throne as Emperor Jomei in 629.\nEmpress Suiko ruled for 35 years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Gensh\u014d, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\nThe actual site of Suiko's grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Osaka.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suiko's mausoleum. It's formally named \"Shinaga no Yamada no misasagi\".\nBeginning of historical writing in Japan.\nSinologist Wm. Theodore de Bary believed that it was not until the reign of Suiko that \"consciously written [Japanese] history becomes a reality\". He noted the name Suiko can be translated to \"conjecture of the past\", suggesting that this posthumous title was \"bestowed on the empress because the writing of history was considered to be an outstanding achievement of her reign\". He commented that \"little of the material from the ancient Japanese past can be taken seriously\" and the earliest extant Japanese annals were the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihon Shoki\", which both date to the 8th century.\nSpouse and children.\nEmpress Suiko, born as Princess Nukatabe (\u984d\u7530\u90e8\u7687\u5973), was the daughter of Emperor Kinmei and his consort (Hi), Soga no Kitashihime.

Japan assisted Paekche loyals in an attempt to aid the revival of Paekche dynasty. Early in 661, Saimei responded to the situation by leaving her capital in Yamato Province. Her plan was to lead a military expedition to Korea. The empress stayed in Ishiyu Temporary Palace in Iyo Province, today D\u014dgo Onsen. In May she arrived at Asakura Palace in the north part of Tsukushi province in Ky\u016bsh\u016b, today a part of Fukuoka Prefecture.

According to the \"Nihonshoki\", he was of gentle personality and was in favor of Buddhism.\nIn 645, he created a new city in the area called Naniwa, and moved the capital from Yamato Province to this new city (see Nara). The new capital had a seaport and was good for foreign trade and diplomatic activities. In 653, K\u014dtoku sent an envoy to the court of the Tang dynasty in China, but some of the ships were lost \"en route\".\nNaka no \u014ce held the rank of crown prince and was the \"de facto\" leader of the government. In 653 Naka no \u014ce proposed to move the capital again to Yamato province. K\u014dtoku denied. Naka no \u014ce ignored the emperor's policy and moved to the former province. Many courtiers of the court, including Empress Hashihito, followed him. K\u014dtoku was left in the palace. In the next year he died of an illness. After his death, Naka would not ascend to the throne. Instead, his mother and the sister of K\u014dtoku, the former Empress Kogyoku, ascended to the throne under another name, Empress Saimei.\nHe enacted the Taika Reform edicts.

He established a new government and carried out political reforms. He then assumed real political power as the crown prince of both Emperor K\u014dtoku and Empress Saimei. Despite the death of Empress Saimei, he did not accede to the throne for seven years, and came to the throne only after the relocation of the capital to \u014cmi in 668. He created Japan's first family register, the \"K\u014dgo Nenjaku\", and the first code of law, the \u014cmi Code.\nTraditional narrative.\nTenji was the son of Emperor Jomei, but was preceded as ruler by his mother Empress Saimei.\nPrior to his accession, he was known as .\nEvents of Tenji's life.\nAs prince, Naka no \u014ce played a crucial role in ending the near-total control the Soga clan had over the imperial family. In 644, seeing the Soga continue to gain power, he conspired with Nakatomi no Kamatari and Soga no Kurayamada no Ishikawa no Maro to assassinate Soga no Iruka in what has come to be known as the Isshi Incident. Although the assassination did not go exactly as planned, Iruka was killed, and his father and predecessor, Soga no Emishi, committed suicide soon after. Following the Isshi Incident, Iruka's adherents dispersed largely without a fight, and Naka no \u014ce was named heir apparent. He also married the daughter of his ally Soga no Kurayamada, thus ensuring that a significant portion of the Soga clan's power was on his side.\nEvents of Tenji's reign.\nNaka no \u014ce reigned as Emperor Tenji from 661 to 672.\nTenji was particularly active in improving the military institutions established during the Taika Reforms.\nDeath of the emperor.\nFollowing his death in 672, there ensued a succession dispute between his fourteen children (many by different mothers). In the end, he was succeeded by his son, Prince \u014ctomo, also known as Emperor K\u014dbun, then by Tenji's brother Prince \u014cama, also known as Emperor Tenmu. Almost one hundred years after Tenji's death, the throne passed to his grandson Emperor K\u014dnin.\nPost-Meiji chronology\n* In the 10th year of Tenji, in the 11th month (671): Emperor Tenji, in the , designated his son as his heir; and modern scholars construe this as meaning that the son would have received the succession (\"senso\") after his father's death. Shortly thereafter, Emperor K\u014dbun is said to have acceded to the throne (\"sokui\"). If this understanding were valid, then it would follow:\n* In the 1st year of K\u014dbun (672): Emperor K\u014dbun, in the 1st year of his reign (\u5f18\u6587\u5929\u7687\u5143\u5e74), died; and his uncle \u014caomi\"-shinn\u014d\" received the succession (\"senso\") after the death of his nephew.

It is formally named \"Yamashina no misasagi\".\nPoetry.\nThe \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\" includes poems attributed to emperors and empresses; and according to Donald Keene, evolving \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\" studies have affected the interpretation of even simple narratives like \"The Three Hills.\" The poem was long considered to be about two male hills in a quarrel over a female hill, but scholars now consider that Kagu and Miminashi might be female hills in love with the same male hill, Unebi. This still-unresolved enigma in poetic form is said to have been composed by Emperor Tenji while he was still Crown Prince during the reign of Empress Saimei:\nOne of his poems was chosen by Fujiwara no Teika as the first in the popular \"Hyakunin Isshu\" anthology:\nAfter his death, his wife, Empress Yamato wrote a song of longing about her husband.\n\"Kugyo\".\nThe top during Emperor Tenji's reign included:\nPrince \u014ctomo (\u014ctomo\"-shinn\u014d\") was the favorite son of Emperor Tenji; and he was also the first to be accorded the title of \"Daij\u014d-daijin.\"\nNon\"-neng\u014d\" period.\nThe years of Tenji's reign are not linked by scholars to any era or \"neng\u014d\".

The following year, \u014cama received word that \u014ctomo, now ruler, was planning to kill him. He fled Yoshino with a group of followers, beginning the Jinshin War. Along with a group of retainers and the governor of Ise Province, \u014cama was able to block off the mountain passes to the northern and eastern provinces, where he raised an army against his nephew. \u014ctomo was defeated and forced to commit suicide. \u014cama took the throne under the name Tenmu.\nTenmu made a number of political reforms, modeling his government after the centralized state of Tang China. He was likely the first Japanese ruler to use the title of ('emperor') and the first to be described as a divine being () in his lifetime. He redistributed political titles among his family and political supporters and created four new ranks at the top of the noble title system. He selected a site for a new capital around 683, on which (after his death) was likely built Fujiwara-ky\u014d. He was an enthusiastic supporter of both Buddhism and the goddess Amaterasu, making various reforms to Buddhist clerical governance and elevating Amaterasu's Ise Shrine to preeminence in Japan.\nTenmu's health began to decline in 685. In attempt to gain divine favor, the imperial court sponsored large-scale Buddhist rituals, but he died in 686. This began a mourning period and interregnum almost twice the length as usual, during which both of his crown princes died: Prince \u014ctsu was executed later the same year, likely on the orders of Tenmu's consort Uno-no-sarara, while Prince Kusakabe died of ill health in 689. Uno-no-sarara ascended to the throne in 689 as Empress Jit\u014d.\nBackground and early life.\nPrince \u014cama was the son of Emperor Jomei of Asuka Japan and his consort Princess Takara, and the younger brother of Naka no \u014ce. His date of birth is unclear; traditional sources date his birth to either 613 or 621, but this would make him older than Naka, born in 626. Some modern historians have estimated a date around 630, owing to the existence of a middle sister, Princess Hashihito, between the two brothers. Due to the much older date in traditional sources, archaeologist Yuji Seki theorized that \u014cama may have been the son of Takara and her first husband, Prince Takamuku.\nJomei had ascended to the throne in 629, around the time of \u014cama's birth, following the death of the long-reigning Empress Suiko. Suiko had never selected an heir after the death of Prince Sh\u014dtoku in 622, leading to a protracted succession dispute between Jomei (the grandson of Suiko and Emperor Bidatsu) and Sh\u014dtoku's son Yamashiro. Although Jomei took the throne with the support of Senior Minister Soga no Emishi, Yamashiro continued to press his claim.\nUpon Jomei's death in 641, Yamashiro stood as the strongest potential candidate for emperor, as Jomei's crown prince Naka no \u014ce was only sixteen years old. However, Emishi continued to oppose Yamashiro, and proposed Jomei's son Furuhito no \u014ce (whose mother was a member of the Soga clan) take the throne. Lacking significant backing, Emishi agreed to a compromise following the precedent of Empress Suiko's ascension, and Princess Takara took the throne as Empress K\u014dgyoku. Emishi's son Soga no Iruka became the dominant political figure during K\u014dgyoku's reign, seizing control of administrative affairs and purging many of his opponents, including Yamashiro and his family. A triumvirate of three statesmen\u2014Nakatomi no Kamatari, Soga no Ishikawa Maro, and Prince Naka no \u014ce\u2014assassinated Iruka in 645. K\u014dgyoku abdicated, initially intending for Naka to take the throne; however, with pressure from Nakatomi, her brother Prince Karu took the throne as Emperor K\u014dtoku.\nKotoku was succeeded by the former Empress K\u014dgyoku in 655, who reigned again under the new name Saimei. In 660, the Korean kingdom of Baekje (an ally of Japan) fell to a combined Tang\u2013Silla force. The following year, Saimei, alongside Naka and \u014cama, sailed to Kyushu to oversee the construction of an armada to invade Korea and restore Baekje. Saimei died in Kyushu in the 9th month of that year, and Prince Naka was appointed as an interim regent, unwilling to officially take the throne; two years later, the Japanese armada was defeated. Naka oversaw the expansion of fortifications around Kyushu, seeking to defend against a possible Sino-Korean invasion, and integrated provincial elites into the court rank system. These efforts increased royal authority, but created considerable unrest among the Japanese clans. \n\u014cama's first wife was Princess Nukata, the daughter of an obscure noble named Prince Kagami. \u014cama also married four of Naka's daughters, likely as an effort to lessen the influence of prominent families such as the Soga over future successors. Among these was Uno-no-sarara, who became his chief consort. He married five other wives, including Kamatari's daughter Ioe. Around 660, Nukata was forced to leave \u014cama in order to marry Prince Naka.\nRise to power.\nNaka appears to have ambiguously supported Prince \u014cama as his successor; the 8th century chronicle \"Nihon Shoki\" inconsistently labels him as a crown prince. Naka moved the capital to the \u014ctsu Palace in \u014cmi Province in 667 and was formally enthroned as Emperor Tenji the next year. Following this, he distanced himself from his brother to support his own favorite son, Prince \u014ctomo, as his successor. The \"T\u014dshi Kaden\", an 8th century history of the Fujiwara clan, relays an anecdote from Tenji's coronation banquet in 668, stating that \u014cama startled Tenji by throwing a spear into the floorboards in front of him. Tenji is said to have drawn his sword and prepared to kill his brother, but the Fujiwara ancestor Nakatomi no Kamatari calmed his temper and saved the crown prince.\n\u014ctomo was granted the title of (prime minister) in early 671. The following day, either \u014cama or \u014ctomo was tasked with performing court duties; the chronicles are unclear and contradictory on who was entrusted with this role. In the eighth month of that year, Tenji became seriously ill and summoned \u014cama, offering him the position as his successor. Either unwilling to become emperor or fearing that his acceptance would be used as pretext to have him removed from succession, \u014cama refused, instead proposing that Tenji's consort Yamatohime serve as empress, with \u014ctomo as her regent. \u014cama shaved his hair and asked permission from Tenji to become a Buddhist monk; Tenji accepted two days later, and \u014cama traveled to Yoshino Palace in southern Yamato Province with a small group followers. It is unknown if Tenji genuinely sought to offer the throne to his brother, or if the offer was made as part of a plot against him.\nJinshin War.\nTenji died in the 12th month of 671. Although \u014ctomo was recognized as his successor by the imperial court in \u014cmi, later chronicles such as the \"Nihon Shoki\" do not recognize him as an emperor, and it is unclear if he was ever enthroned; he may have simply controlled affairs as the designated heir, possibly with Yamatohime as an uncrowned empress regnant. The imperial court suspected a conspiracy on \u014cama's part, and cut him off from receiving supplies from the capital. In the sixth month of 672, \u014cama received a report from his political allies in Mino Province that \u014ctomo was plotting to attack him, and fled east on horseback, beginning a succession dispute known as the Jinshin War. Alongside a small group of retainers and soldiers from Yamato Province, he was accompanied by Uno-no-sarara and their eleven-year-old son Kusakabe.\n\u014cama was limited by the small group of soldiers which came to support him. However, he was able to receive the support of the governor of Ise Province, who sent a force of five hundred soldiers to close the Suzuka Barrier, one of two mountain passes allowing access to the eastern provinces from the Kansai region. Following this, he was additionally able to gain support from officials in Owari and Mino, and possibly from the governors of Shinano and Kai. However, most governors were appointed directly by the \u014cmi court, and continued to recognize its rule. Various local chieftains from across the eastern and northern provinces formed an important wellspring of support: he was able to mobilize a large number of supporters in eastern Japan, especially including the chieftains of the Hokuriku region, which had generally been affiliated with those in Owari and Mino. In Yamato, the powerful \u014ctomo clan (unrelated to Prince \u014ctomo) sided with \u014cama, likely due to their opposition to the dominant Soga clan and the court's move to \u014cmi. A strong hatred of \u014ctomo's Bakejean generals may have also pushed the \u014ctomo and the immigrant Yamatonoaya clan to support \u014cama.\nWhile \u014cama was able to gain a significant amount of support in the north and east, the \u014cmi court was unsuccessful in reinforcing his armies from the western and southern provinces. Despite this, pro-\u014cmi forces were able to push back a contingent of \u014cama's troops in Yamato Province early in the seventh month of 672. After this, \u014cama split his main force into three armies: the largest marched through Fuwa Pass and along the southern shore of Lake Biwa, another went along the north of the lake, and the last retreated back through Mino and Ise to reinforce the troops in Yamato. Although shaken by a night cavalry raid, \u014cama's largest army routed \u014ctomo's forces at Seta, just to the southeast of \u014cmi. Prince \u014ctomo was forced to commit suicide by the end of the seventh month. \u014cama executed or banished his top officials (inherited from Tenji's government), but pardoned many of the other ministers of the \u014cmi court. \u014cama was enthroned at Asuka in 673. He is often referred to during his reign by his posthumous name, Emperor Tenmu .\nReign.\nTenmu was the 40th emperor in the traditional order of succession. He was likely the first ruler of Japan to use the title of Emperor (, literally \"heavenly sovereign\") in his lifetime, with its use attested by a (wooden tablet) dating to his reign. The exact origins of the title is unknown; Tenmu, known to have an interest in Daoism, may have adopted it imitation of the Daoist deity Tianhuang Emperor (), a name also used for the North Star. Alternatively, it may have been borrowed from China, as Emperor Gaozong of Tang briefly adopted the Chinese equivalent () in 674. Before this, Japanese rulers generally used the title of King () or potentially Great King (), alongside various other ceremonial titles attested in the \"Nihon Shoki\".\nShortly after he took office, a set of Korean dignitaries from the states of Goguryeo, Silla, and Tamna came to Kyushu to send their condolences for Tenji's death; they were rejected and asked to return home, told that Tenmu was only accepting envoys which came to offer congratulations to him. During his rise to power, the geopolitical situation in Korea began to shift: following a conflict with the Tang, Silla was able to gain hegemony over the Korean peninsula, pushing Chinese forces north and capturing the former territory of Bakeje. Tenmu continued to reinforce northern Kyushu against a potential invasion and maintained the fortification system began by his brother. He began a practice of ferrying border guards from eastern Honshu to reinforce posts in Kyushu. Tenmu took a different foreign policy than his brother, cutting off formal relationships with the Tang in favor of the ascendant Silla.\nAdministrative reforms.\nUnder Tenmu's reign, the Japanese state began to adopt elements of Chinese statecraft, seeking to create a more centralized state, while likely also taking inspiration from the structure of the rising Silla, which featured a powerful ritualistic emperor heading a powerful ministerial government. As Tenmu had most of the top officials under Tenji executed in the aftermath of the Jinshin War, he was able to redistribute the top political postings among his supporters. He opened up and expanded the ranks of his court, recruiting courtiers from among the realm's elites and chieftains. Unlike the reigns of many other emperors, no preeminent ministers came to power under Tenmu, as he leaned heavily on his immediate family for support.\nDue to his reforms, Tenmu's reign is often seen as the beginning of the Japanese imperial system (). He left vacant the positions of Minister of the Left () and Minister of the Right ()\u2014previously the most powerful political appointments\u2014while appointing a member of the imperial clan to the new post of Counselor (), who served as his private secretary. Various other members of his immediate family received appointments: his consort Uno-no-sarara served as one of his main advisors, while two of his sons were given important posts during the early 680s. He largely preserved the old system of noble titles (), but created four new ranks at the top of the hierarchy: for members of the imperial clan, for clan chiefs related to the royal family, and and for chiefs of other clans loyal to imperial rule. \nBetween 680 and 684, Tenmu granted noble titles to 177 families. Tenmu's government inherited some aspects of his predecessors; he preserved a government structure of six ministries subordinate to a Council of State () and a Secretariat (). The Justice Ministry () in particular saw expansion under Tenmu's reign, who proclaimed that both officials and nonofficials would be judged and punished for crimes.\nConstruction.\nUpon taking the throne, Tenmu returned the imperial court from \u014cmi to the old capital of Asuka. He ordered the construction of the new imperial palace of Kiyomihara at the site of three previous palaces in the prior decades, the first built by his father Jomei around 630. Although grand in scale\u2014the \"Nihon Shoki\" describes it as featuring a variety of offices, halls, and a (Hall of State) in addition to the imperial residence and courtyard\u2014it was constructed very quickly, and likely incorporated parts of the previous palaces at the site. This may have only been intended as a temporary capital, as by 767 Tenmu began searching for a site to build a new, larger capital city (tentatively referred to as , 'the new walled [city]\") based off Chinese-style urban planning. However, he did not seem to have found a suitable site for some time after he became emperor. \nAround 682 or 683, Tenmu seems to have settled on a location for his new capital; this was likely Fujiwara-ky\u014d, a site near Asuka which would become Japan's first Chinese-style planned city. In addition to the new capital, he advocated for the coastal center of Naniwa-ky\u014d to become a walled secondary capital, likely in imitation of the Tang dynasty's capitals at Chang'an and Luoyang.\nReligious policy.\nOne poem, allegedly written by \u014ctomo no Miyuki in 672 following Tenmu's victory in the Jinshin War, celebrates him and the palace of Kiyomihara, and is possibly the first Japanese poem to describe a ruler as a (divine being); Tenmu himself is thought to have begun the practice of beginning imperial edicts with the proclamation \"Hear ye the edict of an emperor of Japan who is a manifest \". He reformed the system of worship, prioritizing the imperial clan in various religious matters: Amaterasu, the ancestral goddess of the imperial clan, was prioritized above other ancestral , while the himself was placed at the top of both the hierarchy of religious leaders and the system of rites and offerings. The Ise Shrine to Amaterasu was made the preeminent shrine in Japan, with Tenmu reviving the practice of appointing an imperial princess to reside at the temple in order to worship Amaterasu on his behalf. \nTenmu sponsored and regularized official Buddhist rites, performed at the three temples he granted official status, all located in the vicinity of Kiyomihara: Gufuku-ji, Gang\u014d-ji, and (the most prestigious) Daikandai-ji. The Soga-backed Asuka-dera, while not formally an official temple, was treated as such in accordance with Tenmu's edicts. Buddhist institutions became increasingly dependent on state backing during his reign; he reorganized the Prelates' Office (), staffing it with clerics housed at Daikandai-ji. He moved one of the top Buddhist officials formerly under the Prelates' Office, the Chief of the Law (), into the secular Agency of Buddhist and Alien Affairs (\"Genbary\u014d\"), which managed immigration in addition to Buddhist matters. In 673, Tenmu oversaw the completion of the Takechi no \u014cdera temple, and commissioned construction of the grand Yakushi-ji temple in 680. He also sponsored the copying of the entire Buddhist canon in a project completed in 677.\nDeath and legacy.\nTenmu's health began to decline in the ninth month of 685. Various Buddhist rituals and prayers were performed in an attempt to aid him, and an infusion of the herb was prepared to restore his health. His health continued to decline over the following year. In the sixth month of 686, his advisors advised that the Kusanagi no Tsurugi sword\u2014one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan\u2014had been cursed and was contributed to his ill health; it was taken to its home Atsuta Shrine for safekeeping. The \"Nihon Shoki\" reports a rapid succession of rituals conducted over the seventh and eighth months: Buddhist functionaries were called to the palace to perform penitential rituals and read sutras, while the ('Great Purification Ceremony') was ordered to be conducted in every province. Early in the seventh month, half of all taxes were remitted, forced labor was suspended, and the era name was changed to Shuch\u014d, an action often made during dire situations for the desire of a new beginning.\nAround the end of the seventh month and the beginning of the eighth, hundreds of people were called up to become monks and nuns in Tenmu's honor, and a hundred statues of Guanyin were placed around the palace. Various fiefs were distributed to imperial princes and preeminent temples; the exact distribution was used to indicate how Tenmu judged the relative rank of each prince, as well as to show support to the noble benefactors of the temples. On the ninth day of the ninth month, Tenmu died and a temporary burial palace (the ) was erected at the capital. Officials from various departments and offices pronounced eulogies in his honor, and the monthly anniversary of his death was declared a day of mourning. Prince Kusakabe led funeral processions in his honor over the following months. A poem in Tenmu's honor is attributed to the widowed empress, Uno-no-sarara, lamenting how she can not let go of her grief over his death. \nAfter his death, construction at Naniwa-ky\u014d was halted; the site burned down the same year, and it was not rebuilt for another forty years. Tenmu was permanently reinterred on the 11th day of the 11th month in 688, over two years after his death, ending a lengthy period of and allowing for the instatement of a formal successor. Tenmu was given a long posthumous name, Ama-no-nunahara-oki-no-mahito-no-sumera-mikoto, 'Emperor, the Perfected Man of the Offing in the Central Marsh of Heaven\", incorporating a variety of Daoist terms. Tenmu's tomb is believed to be the Noguchi \u014cbo Kofun at the site of Fujiwara-ky\u014d in what is now the city of Kashihara. Empress Jit\u014d (formerly Uno-no-sarara) was also later interred at this tomb.\nSuccession.\nIn 679, Tenmu traveled to Yoshino and had six of his sons\u2014Kusakabe, \u014ctsu, Takechi, Kawashima, Osakabe, and Shiki\u2014swear an oath to not begin a succession dispute after his death, proclaiming that although born of separate mothers, all would be treated as if they were the sons of his chief consort Uno-no-sarara. Tenmu's other sons were too young to make the pledge, but they were still bound to its legal effects. In an edict promulgated in 681, Tenmu ordered the compilation of a new law code (the Asuka Kiyomihara Code) and proclaimed Kusakabe a senior prince, serving with full royal prerogative; this seems to indicate that he favored Kusakabe (his son with Princess Uno-no-sarara) to succeed him as emperor. However, in 683, he also granted elevated status to Prince \u014ctsu, who (like Kusakabe) was his son with one of Tenji's daughters. It is unknown why Tenmu created an apparent rival to Kusakabe's position in the succession. From 683 until Tenmu's death, the state was managed by the co-rulership of Kusakabe, \u014ctsu, Tenmu, and the queen consort Uno-no-sarara.\nFollowing Tenmu's death, \u014ctsu was left politically isolated due to the prior death of his mother Princess \u014cta and the preeminent power of his aunt Uno-no-sarara. Likely under her orders, \u014ctsu was charged with treason and executed in 686. Kusakabe's succession was delayed by the extremely long mourning period of twenty-seven months (almost double the average of around fifteen months). Both a lack of political consensus over Kusakabe and a desire to elevate the status of the deceased emperor likely contributed to this lengthy interregnum. Kusakabe died in 689, long in poor health, leaving the succession uncertain. Following the precedent of Suiko and K\u014dgyoku and seeking to maintain Tenmu's branch of the royal dynasty (a merger of Tenmu's and Tenji's lines), Uno-no-sarara ascended to the throne in 690, ruling as Empress Jit\u014d. Jit\u014d reigned until 697, when she retired to become the first ('empress emeritus') in favor of Kusakabe's son, the young Prince Karu, who took the throne as Emperor Monmu. \nTenmu's descendants would continue to rule as emperor throughout most of the late Asuka and Nara period. His stem line ruled until the death of Empress Sh\u014dtoku in 770, who was succeeded in favor of one of Tenji's descendants, Prince Shirakabe, who took the throne as Emperor K\u014dnin.\nSources and historiography.\nThe \"Nihon Shoki\", published in 720, gives little coverage of the reign of Jomei, and as a result scant information is available on Tenmu's early life. The book gives Tenmu two chapters: the first covers the Jinshin War and his rise to power, while the second covers his reign itself. Despite the succession conflict, the \"Nihon Shoki\" treats Tenmu's reign as having begun immediately after Tenji's death, although Tenmu was not able to return to the capital to rule for ten months after this point. Tenmu is portrayed as trying to assert his rightful rule against those loyal to Prince \u014ctomo. \u014ctomo was recognized as a former emperor by some early modern historians such as Ban Nobutomo, but only in 1870 was he officially recognized as Tenmu's predecessor.\nThe Jinshin War and Tenmu's rise to power is described in a short preface to the 8th century chronicle \"Kojiki\" ('records of ancient matters'). The section within the \"Kojiki\" strongly supports Tenmu, describing him as a 'submerged dragon' and 'molting cicada' who was called upon by heaven to take the throne and purify the land of the 'evil rebels'. The section also claims that he surpassed the Yellow Emperor and King of Zhou in his virtue and mastery of the Way.\nThe \"Kojiki\" preface claims that Tenmu had a deep interest in history, and was upset by the disordered state of the \"Teiki\" ('imperial chronicles') and \"Ky\u016bji\" ('ancient accounts'). He is said to have ordered the court attendant Hieda no Are to compile these into a single definitive record; these were then transcribed by the scribe \u014c no Yasumaro during Empress Genmei's reign and presented to the throne as the \"Kojiki\" in 712. The \"Nihon Shoki\" also claims to be created on the order of Emperor Tenmu, but attributes its compiliation to a council of twelve princes and noblemen rather than any individual; although some scholars (such as the 19th-century theologian Hirata Atsutane) have claimed that both texts stem from the same origin, others have theorized that they stem from two different orders by Tenmu, or that work on the \"Nihon Shoki\" only began after the \"Kojiki\" was finished. The texts may have attributed their creation to Tenmu in order to legitimize their historical content.\nPoetry.\nThree poems in the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\", the oldest collection of Japanese poetry, are credited to Tenmu. These comprise one and three ; the most famous is a reply to a poem by his former wife Princess Nukata, in which he expresses her longing for her after she was taken by his brother Tenji. The other poems attributed to Tenmu celebrate and praise Yoshino. These are juxtaposed in the same volume by other praise poems for Yoshino by Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, alongside poems about the ruined \u014cmi capital by Hitomaro and Takechi no Kurohito. The historian Torquil Duthie theorized that the Yoshino Palace became a symbol of Tenmu's divine authority under the reigns of Jit\u014d and her successors; Jit\u014d made a large number of visits to the site, a practice resurrected by Tenmu's great-grandson Emperor Sh\u014dmu in the 8th century. Tenmu also serves as the subject of a number of other poems through the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\". Poems mourning him are attributed to Jit\u014d, Prince Kusakabe, and Prince Takechi.\nFamily.\nTenmu had ten consorts, four of whom were daughters of his brother Tenji. He had ten sons and seven daughters. Additionally, he adopted two of Tenji's sons as his own, Prince Kawashima and Prince Shiki. His consorts were:\nNotes.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The two female monarchs before Jit\u014d were Suiko and K\u014dgyoku/Saimei. The five women sovereigns reigning after Jit\u014d were Genmei, Gensh\u014d, K\u014dken/Sh\u014dtoku, Meish\u014d, and Go-Sakuramachi.\nTraditional narrative.\nEmpress Jit\u014d was the daughter of Emperor Tenji. Her mother was Ochi-no-Iratsume, the daughter of Minister \u014c-omi Soga no Yamada-no Ishikawa Maro. She was the wife of Tenji's full brother Emperor Tenmu, whom she succeeded on the throne.\nEmpress Jit\u014d's given name was , or alternatively Uno.\nEvents of Jit\u014d's reign.\nJit\u014d took responsibility for court administration after the death of her husband, Emperor Tenmu, who was also her uncle. She acceded to the throne in 687 in order to ensure the eventual succession of her son, Kusakabe-shinn\u014d. Throughout this period, Empress Jit\u014d ruled from the Fujiwara Palace in Yamato. In 689, Jit\u014d prohibited \"Sugoroku\", in 690 at enthronement she performed special ritual then gave pardon and in 692 she travelled to Ise against the counsel of minister Miwa-no-Asono-Takechimaro.\nPrince Kusakabe was named as crown prince to succeed Jit\u014d, but he died at a young age. Kusakabe's son, Karu-no-o, was then named as Jit\u014d's successor. He eventually would become known as Emperor Monmu.\nEmpress Jit\u014d reigned for eleven years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was followed on the throne by her daughter, Empress Gensh\u014d, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\nIn 697, Jit\u014d abdicated in Monmu's favor; and as a retired sovereign, she took the post-reign title \"daij\u014d-tenn\u014d\". After this, her imperial successors who retired took the same title after abdication.\nJit\u014d continued to hold power as a cloistered ruler, which became a persistent trend in Japanese politics.\nThe actual site of Jit\u014d's grave is known. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Jit\u014d's mausoleum. It is formally named \"Ochi-no-Okanoe no misasagi\".\n\"Kugy\u014d\".\n\"Kugy\u014d\" (\u516c\u537f) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Jit\u014d's reign, this apex of the \"Daij\u014d-kan\" included:\nNon\"-neng\u014d\" period.\nJit\u014d's reign is not linked by scholars to any era or neng\u014d. The Taika era innovation of naming time periods \u2013 \"neng\u014d\" \u2013 languished until Mommu reasserted an imperial right by proclaiming the commencement of Taih\u014d in 701.\nHowever, Brown and Ishida's translation of \"Gukansh\u014d\" offers an explanation which muddies a sense of easy clarity:\nThe eras that fell in this reign were: (1) the remaining seven years of Shuch\u014d [(686+7=692?)]; and (2) Taika, which was four years long [695\u2013698].

Her reign spanned the years 715 through 724.\nGensh\u014d was the fifth of eight women to take on the role of empress regnant, and the only one in the history of Japan to have inherited her title from another empress regnant rather than from a male predecessor. The four female monarchs before Gensh\u014d were Suiko, K\u014dgyoku, Jit\u014d and Genmei; the three reigning after her were K\u014dken, Meish\u014d, and Go-Sakuramachi.\nTraditional narrative.\nBefore her ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, her personal name (\"imina\") was Hidaka\"-hime\".\nGensh\u014d was an elder sister of Emperor Monmu and daughter of Prince Kusakabe and his wife who later became Empress Genmei. Therefore, she was a granddaughter of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jit\u014d by her father and a granddaughter of Emperor Tenji through her mother.\nEvents of Gensh\u014d's life.\nEmpress Gensh\u014d's succession to the throne was intended as a regency until Prince Obito, the son of her deceased younger brother Monmu, was mature enough to ascend the throne. Obito would later become the Emperor Sh\u014dmu.\nObito was appointed Crown Prince in 714 by Empress Genmei. In the next year, 715, Empress Genmei, then in her fifties, abdicated in favor of her daughter Gensh\u014d. Obito was then 14 years old.\nObito remained the crown prince, heir to the new empress. Fujiwara no Fuhito, the most powerful courtier in Genmei's court, remained at his post until his death in 720. After his death, Prince Nagaya, a grandson of Tenmu and the Empress Gensh\u014d's cousin, seized power. This power shift was a background for later conflicts between Nagaya and Fuhito's four sons during the reign of Emperor Sh\u014dmu (formerly Prince Obito).\nUnder Gensh\u014d's reign, the \"Nihon Shoki\" was finished in 720. Organization of the law system known as the \"ritsury\u014d\" was continued under the initiatives of Fuhito until his death. These laws and codes were edited and enacted by Fujiwara no Nakamaro, a grandson of Fuhito, and published as \"Y\u014dr\u014d ritsury\u014d\" under the name of Fuhito. The taxation system which had been introduced by Empress Jit\u014d in the late 7th century began to malfunction. To compensate for the decreased tax revenue, the \"Act of possession in three generations\", an initiative of Prince Nagaya, was enacted in 723. Under this act, people were allowed to possess a newly cultivated field once every three generations. In the fourth generation, the right of possession would revert to the national government. This act was intended to motivate new cultivation, but it only remained in effect for about 20 years.\nEmpress Gensh\u014d reigned for nine years. Although there were seven other reigning empresses, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century. Empress Genmei, who was succeeded by her daughter, remains the sole exception to this conventional argument.\nIn 724, Gensh\u014d abdicated in favor of her nephew, who would be known as Emperor Sh\u014dmu. Gensh\u014d lived for 25 years after she stepped down from the throne. She never married and had no children. She died at age 65.\nEmpress Gensh\u014d's grave is located in Nara. This empress is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\"), also in Nara. The Imperial Household Agency has designated this location as Monmu's mausoleum, and has been formally named \"Nahoyama no nishi no misasagi\".

She was born to Crown Prince Obito (the future Emperor Sh\u014dmu) and his consort Fujiwara Asukabehime; seeking to protect the bloodline of Prince Kusakabe, her father proclaimed her the first crown princess in Japanese history in 738. She became the Empress Regnant in 749, after her father retired to become a Buddhist monk. With the backing of her mother (now Dowager Empress K\u014dmy\u014d) and her mother's nephew Fujiwara no Nakamaro, she was able to outmaneuver a largely hostile (Council of State). Her father died in 756, having named a cousin unrelated to the Fujiwara as her heir; this outraged Fujiwara supporters, and K\u014dken replaced him with Prince \u014ci, a close ally of her mother and Nakamaro. In 757, she headed off a conspiracy to overthrow her by Tachibana no Naramaro, and resigned the following year to serve as empress emerita (), while \u014ci reigned as Emperor Junnin.\nNakamaro slowly consolidated his political power with the backing of dowager empress K\u014dmy\u014d. After an illness, K\u014dken became close to a healer-monk named D\u014dky\u014d, who became one of her strongest allies, as well as potentially an intimate partner. After this, she became a bhikkhun\u012b (Buddhist nun) and shaved her head. After her mother's death in 760, K\u014dken began to oppose Nakamaro. She proclaimed superiority over Emperor Junnin in state matters in 762, and allied with anti-Nakamaro leaders, including her childhood tutor Kibi no Makibi. In 764, political conflict grew violent after she attempted to take control of the royal seals; Nakamaro fought a brief rebellion against her, naming Prince Shioyaki as emperor, but both were captured and executed, and K\u014dken returned to the throne as Empress Sh\u014dtoku.\nSh\u014dtoku's second reign was marked by the promotion of Buddhist ideals and religious institutions, as well as the advancement of D\u014dky\u014d (who was promoted to the rank of , 'Prince of the Law' or 'Buddhist King') to oversee religious matters. She oversaw land reform which placed limits on land ownership for all except Buddhist temples\u2014alienating aristocrats and courtisans, and ordered the foundation of a new capital. As part of her religious reforms, she placed monastic officials on the Council of State for the first time, and ordered the construction of one million miniature pagodas housing printed prayers; these were distributed to major temples around Nara. In 769, she was the subject of an incident where an oracle of the Usa Shrine stated that the deity Hachiman sought for D\u014dky\u014d to become emperor. This was disputed by an emissary named Wake no Kiyomaro, and D\u014dky\u014d lost his political standing following her death several months later.\nEarly life and background.\nPrincess Abe was born in 718 to Obito, the Crown Prince of Japan, and his consort Fujiwara Asukabehime. Obito, the son of Emperor Monmu and grandson of the powerful statesman Fujiwara no Fuhito had been considered as a candidate for emperor in his youth after the death of his father in 707. Instead, Monmu's mother Gemmei was selected; this was somewhat supported by Obito's proponents, as Gemmei wished for Obito to be her successor. Obito was declared crown prince in 713, but did not succeed his grandmother Gemmei when she resigned in 715. Instead, the throne first passed to Monmu's sister Gensh\u014d, who passed the throne to Obito in 724, who reigned as Emperor Sh\u014dmu.\nEmperor Sh\u014dmu and Asukabehime had a son, Motoi, in 727. To the frustration of some court members, Motoi was designated the crown prince soon after his birth, following the succession law promulgated in the Taih\u014d Code. However, Motoi died before the age of two, leaving the future succession unclear. Sh\u014dmu had another son, Prince Asaka (born to a mother from the Agata-Inukai family) whose potential succession greatly worried the Fujiwara clan and its supporters. Following the alleged coup attempt and resulting suicide of the potential throne claimant Prince Nagaya in 729, Sh\u014dmu declared Asukabehime queen consort. Taking the title Empress K\u014dmy\u014d, this appointment qualified her to become empress regent upon Sh\u014dmu's death, and privileged her descendants (including Abe) for future succession.\nCrown princess.\nIn the mid-730s, a smallpox epidemic broke out, devastating the western portions of Japan and killing all four of Empress K\u014dmy\u014d's brothers. Although the court was reorganized with significantly less Fujiwara influence in the aftermath of the epidemic, Sh\u014dmu declared K\u014dmy\u014d's twenty-one-year-old daughter Abe his heir in 738. A woman had never been declared as heir to the Japanese throne; prior empresses (such as Gemmei and Gensh\u014d) had only reigned temporarily during the minority of male heirs. Non-Fujiwara members of the court opposed Abe's heirship in favor of Asaka, but Sh\u014dmu resisted, seeing Asaka's Agata-Inukai relatives as less useful allies than the Fujiwara. The sixteen-year-old Asaka died in 744, leaving Abe as the only plausible heir. Writing in a later edict, Abe recounted how her \"mother revealed that the royal stem line [of Prince Kusakabe] would end. To prevent that, it was necessary that I succeed, even though a woman.\"\nAbe was educated by the scholar Kibi no Makibi, who was educated in China and taught her how to read Chinese classics such as the \"Book of Rites\" and the \"Book of Han\". Likely at Kibi's suggestion, she performed the dance for Emperor Sh\u014dmu and (empress emerita) Gensh\u014d in a filial ceremony in the early spring of 743. Abe never married; this may have been to preserve the bloodline of Prince Kusakabe, as any of her children would be considered part of her consort's family, and not a direct descendant of Kusakabe.\nGensh\u014d died in 748, leaving the office of vacant. Sh\u014dmu, purportedly in ill health and unable to fulfill his duties as emperor, issued an edict in 749, declaring \"reflecting upon the fact that only sons carry on the father's name, should daughters go unrewarded? It is fitting that both serve together.\" On the second day of the seventh month of 749, Sh\u014dmu resigned to become a Buddhist monk, and Abe took the throne as Empress K\u014dken. Sh\u014dmu's resignation speech appealed to concepts of divine kingship and the patrilineal succession that had been followed since the reign of Emperor Tenji, as well as to female deities and past female rulers.\nFirst reign.\nAt the beginning of her reign, Empress K\u014dken faced considerable political opposition from the , the Council of State. Only three members of the fifteen-member council were members of the Fujiwara clan. She chose a four-character era name (Tenpy\u014d-sh\u014dh\u014d) upon her ascension to the throne, possibly modeled after the unique four-character era names introduced by the influential Chinese empress regnant Wu Zetian. \nAs her lack of an heir proved a consistent source of political tension with the Council of State, K\u014dken sought to rule by decree and bypass the Council. Her mother, now the Dowager Empress K\u014dmy\u014d, transformed the ('Queen-consort's Household Agency') into a larger agency dubbed the . Taking a dual role both as a secretariat and a managing agency for the royal household, the agency expanded to include around a thousand officials, and performed similar duties to the Council of State. K\u014dmy\u014d appointed Fujiwara no Nakamaro (her nephew, the grandson of Fujiwara no Fuhito, and a member of the Council of State) to head the agency. He used it to transmit and enforce K\u014dken's edicts. This agency granted tremendous power to both K\u014dmy\u014d and Nakamaro, the latter of whom steadily gained influence over the course of K\u014dken's reign to become the dominant political figure of K\u014dken's court, representing a resurgence of Fujiwara power. Nakamaro suppressed the influence of K\u014dken's opponents, including his main political rival, Tachibana no Moroe\u2014the nominal head of government, formerly supported by Gensh\u014d.\nK\u014dken and Nakamaro also used the T\u014ddai-ji Construction Agency (), established by Sh\u014dmu to oversee the creation of the Nara Great Buddha, as a means to support their rule. The Great Buddha was completed in 752, and inaugurated in a grand ceremony in the fourth month; the monk Bodhisena painted in the eyes of the statue before K\u014dken, K\u014dmy\u014d, Sh\u014dmu, and a great number of monks. They installed a plaque declaring the temple the \"Realm-protecting temple of the golden light and the four heavenly kings\", the chief temple of the emerging Japanese temple system. That year, monastic governors were dispatched to each province to supplement the secular Kokushi and manage the temple in each.\nThe dowager emperor Sh\u014dmu died in the fifth month of 756, and his will assigned a cousin, Prince Funado (one of Emperor Tenmu's grandsons) to become K\u014dken's heir. Funado was not related to the Fujiwara, outraging their supporters, while the declaration of an heir by someone other than the sovereign themselves was seen as highly unusual. Several days later, Fujiwara officials retaliated by arresting two prominent opponent officials accused of disrespecting the empress. K\u014dken disavowed Funado as heir in an edict issued in the fourth month of 757, accusing him of failing to observe the mourning period for Sh\u014dmu. This edict also ordered copies of the Confucian \"Classic of Filial Piety\" to be distributed to local chieftains, likely echoing Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, who fourteen years earlier had ordered his commentary on the classic to be distributed across China. Later that year, K\u014dken appointed Prince \u014ci\u2014another of Tenmu's grandsons and a close ally of his father-in-law Nakamaro and K\u014dmy\u014d\u2014as crown prince.\nNaramaro conspiracy and resignation.\nAccording to the , Tachibana no Naramaro, the son of Moroe, attempted to organize a coup d'\u00e9tat against K\u014dken, K\u014dmy\u014d, and Nakamaro in the seventh month of 757, heading a conspiracy involving over four hundred officials and four princes. They allegedly sought to kill Nakamaro and overthrow the empress to install one of their own as emperor. Upon learning of Naramaro's plans, K\u014dken and K\u014dmy\u014d ordered royal guard units to crack down on the plotters. The punishment inflicted on the plotters varied: some of them were executed, including Funado (whose name was officially changed to Matohi, 'foolish', before his death). Some princes were reduced to the status of commoners before their executions. Some plotters were exiled or imprisoned until they were released in later amnesties, while others were pardoned immediately. The fate of Naramaro himself is unknown, but his family avoided the extermination prescribed for the families of those convicted of high treason. \nIn the eighth month of the same year, a commoner from Suruga Province is said to have presented the royal court with a cocoon on which sixteen characters had been woven by a silkworm. This miraculous sign prompted to issue an edict five days later, proclaiming the beginning of a new era, the Tenpy\u014d-h\u014dji. Later in 757, the government promulgated the Y\u014dr\u014d Code, a legal code first begun by Fujiwara no Fuhito prior to 720. The following year, Nakamaro founded frontier outposts in the remote northern provinces of Mutsu and Dewa and ordered the construction of a fleet of 500 ships for a planned invasion of the Korean kingdom of Silla. Later in 758, K\u014dken took control of the Imperial Guards from Nakamaro, but was pressured to resign in order to pass the throne to \u014ci, who took the throne as Emperor Junnin. K\u014dken, now , also became known by the name K\u014dya.\nInterregnum.\nUnusually for a new emperor, Junnin's accession to the throne was not accompanied by a new era name. At the outset of his reign, he presided over the imperial court alongside K\u014dken and K\u014dmy\u014d. Nakamaro's power grew under Junnin's reign; he became the leader of the Council of State, seeing an appointment both as the Minister of the Right and as the , 'Grand Protector'. Emperor Junnin was largely under K\u014dmy\u014d and Nakamaro's political influence; soon after taking office, Junnin granted Nakamaro land and a new name, Emi no Oshikatsu.\nIn mid-760, the death of K\u014dmy\u014d\u2014Nakamaro's most influential supporter\u2014threatened the balance of political power. After the death of her mother, K\u014dken began to assert herself politically against Nakamaro. Around 761, she fell ill and was cared for at a temporary palace near Lake Biwa by a Buddhist monk and healer named D\u014dky\u014d. He was among the most educated group of the Nara monks, well-versed in Sanskrit, meditation, and esoteric sutras. D\u014dky\u014d's religious practices appeared to cure her illnesses, and she returned to Nara in the fifth month of 762, where she took up residence at a Buddhist temple. She became initiated as a bhikkhun\u012b (Buddhist nun), shaved her head, and began to wear robes. K\u014dken and D\u014dky\u014d entered an intimate relationship, but to what extent is unknown; the (an early ninth-century collection of stories) states that they \"shared the same pillow\", while the merely states that he gained her favor or affection.\nK\u014dken expanded her political power after her return to Nara, despite her monastic initiation. In the sixth month of 762, she issued an edict reproaching Junnin as disloyal and failing to uphold filial piety. She transferred much of the emperor's power to herself, stating:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"For government, the sitting monarch will handle small matters. Matters of importance\u2014punishments and rewards\u2014will be mine to command.\"\u2014\u200a\nAlthough she was emulating the authority previously held by her mother K\u014dmy\u014d, the edict granted her powers unprecedented for a . She may have been inspired by Ruizong of Tang, who had passed the throne to his heir Xuanzong, while reserving power over the most important matters for himself. This greatly threatened Nakamaro, who consolidated his power; by the end of the year, three of his four sons had been appointed to the Council of State. K\u014dken held power over the royal palace, while Nakamaro held power over the Council of State and its ministries, resulting in significant political upheaval.\nPolitical figures opposed to Nakamaro began to gravitate towards K\u014dken and make their own appointments, including K\u014dken's childhood tutor Kibi no Makibi, who was brought out of exile to manage construction at T\u014ddai-ji. Two new guard units were created to protect the palace. In 763, K\u014dken removed the (the third rank in the monastic hierarchy) Jikun, a monastic ally of Nakamaro, from the ('Prelates Office'). She replaced him with D\u014dky\u014d, promoting him past several inferior ranks. To bypass Nakamaro's control of the Council of State, she created her own secretariat dubbed the .\nNakamaro's rebellion.\nOn New Years, 764, Emperor Junnin appointed two of Nakamaro's sons to be the governors of Echizen and Mino, wealthy neighboring provinces to his powerbase of \u014cmi. Nakamaro appointed himself the commander of military units near the capital, dispatched soldiers to regions under his control, and increased the size of provincial militias. Aware that Nakamaro was planning a coup d'\u00e9tat, K\u014dken dispatched an emissary to take control of state seals (used for promulgating state documents) and station bells from Nakamaro's palace. The emissary was killed, and Nakamaro and his forces were forced to flee Nara in the ensuing violence, taking with him the seals and bells. \nNakamaro fled to \u014cmi province. After Junnin refused to join the rebellion, Nakamaro declared the prince Shioyaki (the older brother of Funado) emperor under the name Kink\u014d. In \u014cmi, he was opposed by Kibi no Makibi, who organized provincial forces against the rebellion and seized control of crucial ports around Lake Biwa. Kibi also created a cavalry force composed of palace guardsmen and established a special guard unit to protect K\u014dken. Nakamaro faced serious opposition from other members of his clan outside of his own Southern House, and especially from the descendants of Fujiwara no Umakai. State agents refused to honor Nakamaro and Shioyaki's edicts, and both were surrounded and killed by imperial forces in Echizen.\nK\u014dken consolidated her political power in the aftermath of the rebellion. Although Junnin had refused to join the rebellion, he was accused of complicity, and he was captured and deposed by imperial troops about a month after Nakamaro's death. Junnin was exiled to the island of Awaji, while K\u014dken reascended to the throne under a new name, Empress Sh\u014dtoku.\nSecond reign.\nAfter reassuming the throne, Sh\u014dtoku issued an edict proclaiming herself a bodhisattva and stating that her father, Emperor Sh\u014dmu, had given her the authority to depose her successors and ensure the obedience of the princes and ministers. She recalled Nakamaro's brother Fujiwara no Toyonari (who had been exiled for opposing him) back to Nara, reappointing him as Minister of the Right and leader of the Council of State. She promoted D\u014dky\u014d to the third court rank and gave him a seat on the Council of State, granting him the title of ('Healer-monk and Grand Minister', a version of the rarely-held highest bureaucratic rank ), stating that an ordained ruler should be served by an ordained minister. She also expanded the size of the council, seating supporters such as Kibi no Makibi, members of different Fujiwara branches, members of rival houses, provincial leaders, and several imperial princes. The appointment of rival aristocrats was intended to balance the aristocrats against one another, but resulted in an inefficient bureaucracy and unrest on the council. However, her appointment policies did result in significantly more provincial representation within the capital, allowing for greater centralization.\nAmong Sh\u014dtoku's first acts upon reassuming the throne was to reverse Nakamaro's name changes to political posts, changing them back to Japanese from their Chinese equivalents. She expanded the imperial guard, which she placed under the command of Fujiwara no Kurajimaro, who had become her chief military commander. She organized a number of reforms favoring Buddhist temples; she restricted the amount of land aristocrats and non-Buddhist institutions could privately own, and established separate lines of command for secular and Buddhist affairs. These were organized under distinct and parallel hierarchies of ministers and advisors. She also instituted policies aimed at promoting economic stability; she granted amnesties from tribute for provinces experiencing poor harvests and famine conditions, confiscated and distributed rice paddies from aristocrats to resolve shortages of public farmland, and established systems for farmers to raise complaints against local governors. These reforms angered both courtiers and the provincial nobility, as land rents had become a major source of income for much of the aristocracy.\nSh\u014dtoku never appointed a crown prince during her second reign, publishing an edict in late 764 stating that she would take some time to select an heir, and would not follow the will of her courtiers in this matter.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Those who serve me\u2014whether of high, middle, or low rank\u2014often say, 'To stabilize the realm, decide upon a crown prince and everyone will be tranquil and harmonious.' However, I have not appointed anyone as yet because the one who people call worthy is not always so. If someone that Heaven will not accept is named, he will not succeed and will be destroyed. As I reflect on it, this office is not something to be decided by a human. Neither is it attainable by violence or coercion. I alone am Heaven's heir, and I will decide about a successor.\"\u2014\u200aThe political influence of the Fujiwara steadily grew during Sh\u014dtoku's second reign; by 769, they held six out of the seventeen seats on the Council of State, alongside the Ministry of the Treasury and the Ministry of Popular Affairs. They were countered by a group of Sh\u014dtoku's closest allies, such as Kibi no Makibi and Yuge Kiyobito (the brother of D\u014dky\u014d), which held positions in the imperial palace. Sh\u014dtoku ordered the construction of a new capital at Yuge in Kawachi Province, and in 769 conscripted thousands of workers to help build the city.\nD\u014dky\u014d incident.\nIn 766, Sh\u014dtoku further promoted D\u014dky\u014d to , a title alternatively translated as \"Prince of the Law\" or \"Buddhist King\", alongside a new palace adjacent to the existing royal palace. This title was similar to both those once granted to Prince Sh\u014dtoku and those granted to former emperors who took monastic vows. The exact extent of power and duties Sh\u014dtoku granted to D\u014dky\u014d is unclear, but he appeared to have not been given responsibilities outside of religious matters, which he controlled through the , a governing agency established for him that ran in parallel to the Department of Divinities (). He instituted reforms which brought Buddhist elements into the state ideology, including decrees banning hunting dogs and the serving of meat and fish to the emperor. Sh\u014dtoku reorganized her court, promoting monastic officials to the Council of State for the first time. Sh\u014dtoku and D\u014dky\u014d oversaw the continued construction of the provincial temples in the system (first initiated by Sh\u014dmu in 741) alongside the creation of new temples such as Saidai-ji in Nara. Sh\u014dtoku frequently made pilgrimages to the existing great temples of the Yamato Province, bestowing large donations and granting court ranks to their builders.\nBeginning in 764, Sh\u014dtoku ordered the creation of the , one million miniature wooden stupas, each containing a woodblock-printed prayer from the sutra. These were completed in 770, and distributed among the ten major temples around Nara, each receiving one hundred thousand stupas. After Sh\u014dtoku initiated a new era name in 765, the Tenpy\u014d-jingo, D\u014dky\u014d oversaw the construction of new temples around major regional shrines, such as the royal Ise Shrine. \nIn 769, a religious official from the Dazaifu regional government in Kyushu arrived in Nara. He stated that the oracle of the Usa Shrine, a temple of Hachiman (a syncretic Shinto-Buddhist deity) in Kyushu had received a divine message proclaiming that D\u014dky\u014d should be proclaimed as emperor in order to ensure the realm's prosperity. D\u014dky\u014d was enthusiastic about the news, but Sh\u014dtoku dispatched an emissary, Wake no Kiyomaro, to visit the shrine and consult with the deity. Wake returned to the court in Nara and proclaimed that Hachiman had ordered that no one outside of the imperial line should ascend to the throne. D\u014dky\u014d was outraged, and exiled Wake and his sister, changing both of their names to derogatory puns. The states that D\u014dky\u014d dispatched an assassin to kill Wake; after the assassin was delayed by a storm, Wake was pardoned.\nDeath and legacy.\nWhile overseeing construction at Yuge in 770, Sh\u014dtoku fell ill, and returned to Nara. She died soon after her return in the eighth month of that year, without having selected a successor. Fujiwara leaders such as Fujiwara no Nagate (the Minister of the Right) and Fujiwara no Momokawa forged an edict from Sh\u014dtoku proclaiming Prince Shirakabe (a great-grandson of Emperor Tenji and husband to one of Sh\u014dtoku's half-sisters, Princess Inoe), as her heir; he was enthroned in the tenth month as Emperor K\u014dnin. Sh\u014dtoku would have almost certainly opposed this choice, as the succession had been previously reserved for descendants of Emperor Tenmu since his death in 686. Following her death, work on the new capital was halted and D\u014dky\u014d was demoted to the steward of the Yakushi-ji temple in remote Shimotsuke Province.\nAs no empresses regnant followed in the centuries after her death, K\u014dken is sometimes dubbed the \"last empress\" or \"last classical empress\". It would not be until the Edo period, almost a millennium after K\u014dken's death, that two more empresses regnant (Meish\u014d and Go-Sakuramachi) reigned. By that point, imperial authority had long passed to the Shogunate. Traditional histories attribute the lack of succeeding empresses regnant to K\u014dken's relationship with D\u014dkyo. They generally depict D\u014dkyo's authority as possessing more authority than empress Sh\u014dtoku during her second reign, although modern scholars have disputed this interpretation; historian Joan Piggott described him as \"Sh\u014dtoku's primary lieutenant\", suggesting that (due to his background) he was more beholden to the Empress than Nakamaro had been.\nNotes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the seventh son of Prince Toneri, a son of Emperor Tenmu. And although his father died when he was three, he was not given any rank or office at the court.

Shortly afterwards, Emperor Junnin is said to have ascended to the throne (\"sokui\"). In 760 (\"Tenpy\u014d-h\u014dji 4\"), additional coins were put into circulation\u2014copper coins bearing the words \"Mannen Ten-h\u014d\", silver coins bearing the words \"Teihei Genh\u014d\", and gold coins bearing the words \"Kaiki Sh\u014dh\u014d\".\nThe years of Junnin's reign, 758\u2013765, are more specifically encompassed within a single era name or \"neng\u014d\",\"Tenpy\u014d-h\u014dji\".

The official cause of death was illness, but according to one theory, it was the assassination by the order of Emperor Sh\u014dtoku. The site of Junnin's actual grave is unknown, and he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Awaji. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Junnin's mausoleum: It is formally named \"Awaji no misasagi\".\nThough Junnin had, technically, been emperor, he was not featured on the official List of Japanese Emperors until the late nineteenth century.

At the time the retired Heizei had quarreled with his brother over the ideal location of the court, the latter preferring the Heian capital, while the former was convinced that a shift back to the Nara plain was necessary, and Heizei, exploiting Saga's weakened health, seized the opportunity to foment a rebellion, known historically as the Kusuko Incident; however, forces loyal to Emperor Saga, led by \"taish\u014dgun\" Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, quickly defeated the Heizei rebels which thus limited the adverse consequences which would have followed any broader conflict. This same Tamuramaro is remembered in Aomori's annual Nebuta Matsuri which feature a number of gigantic, specially-constructed, illuminated paper floats. These great lantern-structures are colorfully painted with mythical figures; and teams of men carry them through the streets as crowds shout encouragement. This early ninth century military leader is commemorated in this way because he is said to have ordered huge illuminated lanterns to be placed at the top of hills; and when the curious Emishi approached these bright lights to investigate, they were captured and subdued by Tamuramaro's men.\nEras of Saga's reign.\nThe years of Saga's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name (\"neng\u014d\").\nLegacy.\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the \"Gempeit\u014dkitsu\" (\u6e90\u5e73\u85e4\u6a58).

Very little is known about this Emperor due to a lack of material available for further verification and study. Suizei is known as a \"legendary emperor\" among historians as his actual existence is disputed. A legendary account from the \"Kojiki\" states that Suizei became emperor after receiving the title of crown prince by his half brother due to his bravery regarding a murder plot. Suizei's reign started in 581 BC, he had one wife and a sole son who supposedly became the next emperor upon his death in 549 BC.\nLegendary narrative.\nWhile the \"Kojiki\" provides little information about Suizei, it does state his name, genealogy, and a record about his accession to the throne. He was born sometime in 632 BC, and was one of the sons of Emperor Jimmu and his chief wife Himetataraisuzu-hime. The account in the Kojiki states that Suizei's older brother Kamuyaimimi was originally the Crown-prince. When Jimmu died, another of his sons named Tagishimimi attempted to seize the throne by murdering those in his way. Tagishimimi was given birth to by a lesser wife named Ahiratsu-hime, and was older than Jimmu's legitimate heir. When Himetataraisuzu-hime learned of the plot she tried in vain to warn her sons by way of songs and poems. While Suizei encouraged Kamuyaimimi to slay Tagishimimi, he could not find it in him to murder his own half brother. Suizei pleaded with his older brother for the weapon he was going to use, and upon receiving it accomplished the deed for him. Kamuyaimimi ceded his rights as crown prince shortly after to Suizei as he believed his braver younger brother should be the new Emperor.\nEmperor Suizei's pre-ascension name remains unknown, but the \"Kojiki\" records that he ruled from the palace of at Katsuragi in what would come to be known as Yamato Province. While another more expansive account exists in the \"Nihon Shoki\", the section is more steeped in myth. Suizei is conventionally considered to have reigned from 581 to 549 BC. He wed Isuzuyori-hime at an unknown date, and the two had one son. Emperor Suizei allegedly died in 549 BC and his gravesite is formally named \"Tsukida no oka no e no misasagi\". He was succeeded by his only son, \"Prince Shikitsuhikotamatemi\" who became Emperor Annei.\nKnown information.\nThe existence of at least the first nine Emperors is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Suizei is thus regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\", and is ranked as the first of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them. The name Suizei\"-tenn\u014d\" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations, and literally means \"joyfully healthy peace\". His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Suizei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\". While the actual site of his grave is not known, an Imperial \"misasagi\" or tomb for Suizei is currently maintained in Kashihara. The first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is Emperor Sujin, the 10th emperor of Japan. Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c.\u2009509\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates.

While Sujin is the first emperor whose existence historians widely accept, he is still referred to as a \"legendary emperor\" due to a lack of information available and because dates for his reign vary. Both the , and the (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during Sujin's alleged lifetime. This legendary narrative tells how he set up a new shrine outside of the Imperial palace to enshrine Amaterasu. He is also credited with initiating the worship of \u014cmononushi (equated with the deity of Mount Miwa), and expanding his empire by sending generals to four regions of Japan in what became known as the legend of \"Shid\u014d shogun\".\nThis Emperor's reign is conventionally assigned the years of 97 BC\u00a0\u2013 30 BC. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered twelve children with a chief wife (empress) and two consorts. Sujin chose his future heir based on dreams two of his sons had; in this case, his younger son became Emperor Suinin upon Sujin's death in 30 BC. Like other emperors of this period, the location of Sujin's grave if it exists is unknown. He is traditionally venerated at the Andonyama kofun in Tenri, Nara.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a kofun (tumulus) for Sujin is currently maintained. There remains no conclusive evidence though that supports this historical figure actually reigning. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical and , which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Sujin was born sometime in 148 BC, and was the second son of Emperor Kaika. Sujin's mother was \"Ikagashikome no Mikoto\", who was also a concubine of Sujin's grandfather Emperor K\u014dgen. Before he was enthroned sometime in 97 BC, his pre-ascension name was either Prince \"Mimakiirihikoinie no Mikoto\", \"Mimakiiribikoinie no Sumeramikoto\", or \"Hatsukunishirasu Sumeramikoto\". The former name is used in the , while the latter two are found in the . Sujin was enthroned sometime in 97 BC, and during the 3rd year of his reign it is the recorded that he moved the capital to , naming it the \"Palace of Mizu-gaki\" or .\nEnshrining \u014cmononushi (Miwa My\u014djin).\nThe \"Kiki\" records that pestilence struck during the 5th year of Sujin's rule, killing half the Japanese population. The following year peasants abandoned their fields and rebellion became rampant. To help relieve the suffering of his people, the Emperor turned his attention towards the gods. At the time, both the sun goddess Amaterasu and the god were enshrined at the Imperial Residence. Sujin became overwhelmed with having to cohabit with these two powerful deities and set up separate enshrinements to house them. Amaterasu was moved to in Yamato Province (Nara), where a Himorogi altar was built out of solid stone. Sujin placed his daughter in charge of the new shrine, and she would become the first Sai\u014d. Yamato-no-Okunitama (the other god) was entrusted to another daughter named Nunakiirihime, but her health began to fail shortly afterward. It is recorded that Nunakiiri-hime became emaciated after losing all of her hair, which rendered her unable to perform her duties. These events still did not alleviate the ongoing plague sweeping the empire, so Sujin decreed a divination to be performed sometime during the 7th year of his reign. The divination involved him making a trip to the plain of Kami-asaji or , and invoking the eight hundred myriad deities.\nSujin's aunt (daughter of 7th Emperor Emperor K\u014drei) acted as a \"miko\", and was possessed by a god who identified himself as \u014cmononushi. This god claimed responsibility for the plague, announcing that it would not stop until he was venerated. Although the Emperor propitiated to the god, the effects were not immediate. Sujin was later given guidance in the form of a dream to seek out a man named and appoint him as head priest. When he was found and installed, the pestilence eventually subsided, allowing five cereal crops to ripen. Out of an abundance of caution, the Emperor also appointed as , or one who sorts the offerings to the gods. To this day the Miwa sect of the Kamo clan claim to be descents from \u014ctataneko, while Ikagashikoo was a claimed ancestor of the now extinct Mononobe clan.\nFour Cardinal Quarters (Shid\u014d shogun).\nIn his 10th year of rule, Sujin instituted four of his Generals to the \"Four Cardinal Quarters\" in what would be known as the \"Shid\u014d shogun\". These areas (west, north/northwest, northeast, and east) were all centered around the capital in Yamato Province. Sujin instructed his generals (shogun) to quell those who would not submit to their rule. One of the four shoguns who had been sent to the northern region was named , who was also Emperor K\u014dgen's first son. One day a certain maiden approached \u014chiko and sang him a cryptic song, only to disappear afterwards. Sujin's aunt , who was skilled at clairvoyance, interpreted this to mean that Take-hani-yasu-hiko (\u014chiko's half brother) was plotting an insurrection. Yamatototohimomoso-hime pieced it together from overhearing news that Take-hani-yasu-hiko's wife (Ata-bime) came to , and took a clump of earth in the corner of her neckerchief.\nEmperor Sujin gathered his generals in a meeting upon hearing the news, but the couple had already mustered troops to the west who were ready to attack the capital. The Emperor responded by sending an army under the command of general \"Isaseri-hiko no Mikoto\" to fight a battle that ended with a decisive Imperial victory. Ata-bime was killed in combat, and her husband fled back north. Sujin then sent general north to Yamashiro Province to punish the rebel prince. There was ultimately an exchange of bowshots that resulted in Take-hani-yasu-hiko's death by an arrow through the chest. Eventually the Emperor would appoint 137 governors for the provinces under his Imperial rule as the empire expanded. In his 12th year of rule, the Emperor decreed that a census be taken of the populace \"with grades of seniority, and the order of forced labour\". The tax system meanwhile was set up so taxes imposed were in the form of mandatory labor. These taxes were known as for men and for women. During this period peace and prosperity ensued, and the Emperor received the title .\nChoosing an heir and Divine treasures.\nDuring the 48th year of Sujin's reign (50 BC), he summoned two of his sons saying that he loved them equally and could not make up his mind which to make his heir. He then asked his sons to describe the dreams they had recently, so he could divine their lot by interpreting them. The elder son's name was , and explained to his father that he dreamt of climbing Mt. Mimoro (Mount Miwa). While facing east, he said that he thrust his spear eight times and then waved his sword eight times skywards. The younger prince, whose name was dreamt of climbing Mimoro and spanning ropes on four sides. He went on to say how he chased the sparrows that ate the millet. Sujin accordingly chose his younger son Ikume to become the next Crown prince, while his older son Toyoki was chosen to govern the east. Toyoki ultimately became the ancestor of the Kamitsuke and Shimotsuke clans.\nIn the 60th year of Sujin's reign (38 BC), Sujin told his ministers that he wanted to look at divine treasures brought from the heavens by which were housed in the Izumo Shrine. was the keeper of the treasures, but at the time was away on business in Tsukushi Province. Furune's younger brother , accommodated the Imperial Edict on his behalf by sending his two younger brothers as carriers of these treasures to show the Emperor. When Furune returned, he was furious at Iiirine for parting with the treasures. He invited his younger brother to wade in a pool (named Yamuya) with him, where he used a sword-swapping intrigue. Furune exchanged his own wooden sword with his brother's real sword and commenced a battle which ended with Iiirine's death. When the Imperial court received news of the event, they dispatched two generals to slay Izumo Furune.\nLater reign and death.\nTowards the end of his reign in (36 BC), both the and records indicate that Sujin started to encourage the building of artificial ponds and canals. During this time, was built near in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka. Sujin is also credited with building which was said to be located in \"Karu\" (Kashihara, Nara). During his alleged lifetime, Sujin fathered twelve children with a chief wife (empress) and two consorts. When he died in 30 BC, his son \"Prince Ikumeirihikoisachi\" became the next emperor per Sujin's choice. Sujin's actual burial site is unknown, but is said to be at Mount Miwa.\nHistorical figure.\nWhile Emperor Sujin is the first emperor whom historians state might have actually existed, he is not confirmed as an actual historical figure. Like his predecessors, his reign is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Sujin's possible lifespan has been suggested to be as early as the 1st century AD, to as late as the fourth century AD, this is well past his conventionally assigned reign of 97 BC\u00a0\u2013 30 BC. Like Emperor K\u014dsh\u014d, Emperor K\u014drei, and Emperor Kaika, historian Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric notes an idea in his book \"Japan Encyclopedia\" that Sujin could have lived in the 1st century (AD). This remains disputed though, especially among researchers who have been critical of his book. If Sujin did in fact exist, then he may have been the founder of the imperial dynasty. Historian Richard Ponsonby-Fane suggests that Sujin may have been the first emperor to perform a census and establish and regularize a system of taxation.\nIn either case (fictional or not), the name Sujin\"-tenn\u014d\" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Sujin, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the . Sujin's longevity was also written down by later compilers, who may have unrealistically extended his age to fill in time gaps. While the actual site of Sujin's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at the \"Andonyama kofun\" in Tenri, Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as the kofun (tumulus), and its formal name is \"\"Yamanobe no michi no Magari no oka no e no misasagi\". Sujin's kofun is one of six that are present in the area; the mounds are thought to have built sometime between 250 and 350 AD.\nOutside of the , the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c.\u2009509\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD. The lineal ancestor of the current reigning emperor can be traced back to Emperor K\u014dkaku, who lived a thousand years later.\nConsorts and children.\nEmpress: , Prince \u014chiko's daughter\nConsort: , Kii no Arakahatobe's daughter\nConsort: , Prince Tatehiroshinabi's daughter\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2192See under for fuller bibliography."}

This legendary narrative tells how he ordered his daughter Yamatohime-no-mikoto to establish a new permanent shrine for Amaterasu (the Sun Goddess), which eventually became known as the Ise Grand Shrine. Other events that were recorded concurrently with his reign include the origins of Sumo wrestling in the form of a wrestling match involving Nomi no Sukune.\nSuinin's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 29 BC to AD 70. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered seventeen children with two chief wives (empress) and six consorts. One of his sons became the next emperor upon his death in 70 AD, but the location of his father's grave (if any) is unknown. Suinin is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb (\"misasagi\") at Nishi-machi, Amagatsuji, Nara City.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Suinin is currently maintained.

The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Suinin was born sometime in 69 BC, and was the third son of Emperor Sujin. Suinin's empress mother was named Mimaki-hime, who is also former Emperor K\u014dgen's daughter. Before he was enthroned sometime in 29 BC, his pre-ascension name was Prince \"Ikumeiribikoisachi no Sumeramikoto\". He appears to have ascended the throne a year before his father's death in 30 BC, and ruled from the palace of at Makimuku in what later became Yamato Province.\nSuinin is best known for events that surround the founding of the Ise Grand Shrine. The \"Nihon Shoki\" states that around 2,000 years ago the Emperor ordered his daughter Yamatohime-no-mikoto, to find a permanent location to worship the goddess Amaterasu-\u014dmikami (the Sun Goddess). Yamatohime searched for 20 years before settling on a location in Ise, where she established Naiku, the Inner Shrine. She is said to have chosen the location after she heard the voice of Amaterasu say; \"(Ise) is a secluded and pleasant land. In this land I wish to dwell.\" Amaterasu had previously been enshrined and worshipped in Kasanui, which was set up by Suinin's father in an attempt to alleviate a devastating plaque. The \"Kojiki\" records that during the reign of Emperor Suinin, the first \"Sai\u014d\" (High Priestess) was appointed for Ise Grand Shrine. This recording is also noted by \"Jien\", who was a 13th-century historian and poet. This remains disputed though, as the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b (The Anthology of Ten Thousand Leaves) states that the first Sai\u014d to serve at Ise was Princess \u014cku. If the latter is true then it would date the Sai\u014d appointments to the reign of Emperor Tenmu (c.\u2009673\u00a0\u2013 686 AD).\nThere were other events during Suinin's reign as well that include an Asama Shrine tradition regarding Mount Fuji. The earliest veneration of Konohanasakuya-hime at the base of the mountain was said to be during the 3rd year of Emperor Suinin's reign. The \"Nihon Shoki\" also records a wrestling match in which \"Nomi no Sukune\" and \"Taima no Kehaya\" held during his era, as the origin of \"Sumai\" (Sumo wrestling). Meanwhile, Emperor Suinin's family grew to consist of 17 children with eight variously ranked wives. One of his consorts named \"Kaguya-hime-no-Mikoto\", is mentioned in the \"Kojiki\" as a possible basis for the legend of Kaguya-hime regarding the couple's love story. Emperor Suinin died in 70 AD at the age of 138, and his son Prince \"Ootarashihikoosirowake\" was enthroned as the next emperor the following year.\nKnown information.\nEmperor Suinin is regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. Unlike Emperor Sujin, there is less known about Suinin to possibly support his existence. In either case (fictional or not), the name Suinin\"-tenn\u014d\" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Suinin, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\". Suinin's longevity was also written down by later compilers, who may have unrealistically extended his age to fill in time gaps. While the actual site of Suinin's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nishi-machi, Amagatsuji, Nara City. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Suinin's mausoleum, and is formally named \"Sugawara no Fushimi no higashi no misasagi\".\nWhile the Ise Grand Shrine is traditionally said to have been established in the 1st century BC, other dates in the 3rd and 4th centuries have also been put forward for the establishment of Naik\u016b and Gek\u016b respectively. The first shrine building at Naik\u016b was allegedly erected by Emperor Tenmu (678\u2013686), with the first ceremonial rebuilding being carried out by his wife, Empress Jit\u014d, in 692. Outside of the Kiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c.\u2009509\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nConsorts and children.\nEmperor Suinin had two chief wives (aka Empress), it is recorded in the Kiki that the first empress was named Saho. Not much is known about her other than that her father was Emperor Kaika's son and she allegedly died sometime in 34 AD. As with the first empress there is also not much known about Suinin's second chief wife Hibasu. She was the daughter Prince Tanba-no-Michinoushi, who was Prince Hikoimasu's son and Emperor Kaika's grandson. Hibasu's third son later became known as Emperor Keik\u014d (the next emperor), she allegedly died sometime in 61 AD. Suinin also had six named consorts with an additional one remaining unknown. Prince Tanba-no-Michinoushi (previously mentioned), was also the father to three of Suinin's consorts. In all the Emperor's family consisted of 17 children with these variously ranked wives.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during Keik\u014d's alleged lifetime. Keik\u014d was recorded as being an exceptionally tall emperor who had a very large family. During his reign he sought to expand territorial control through conquest of local tribes. He had a very important son named \"Prince \u014csu\" (Yamato Takeru), who was in possession of the Kusanagi when he died. This treasure was later moved to Atsuta Shrine, and is now a part of the Imperial Regalia of Japan. There is a possibility that Keik\u014d actually lived or reigned in the 4th century AD rather than the 1st, but more information is needed to confirm this view.\nKeik\u014d's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 71 to 130 AD. During his alleged lifetime, he fathered at least 80 children with two chief wives (empress) and nine consorts. One of his sons became the next emperor upon his death in 130 AD, but the location of Keik\u014d's grave (if any) is unknown.

These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Keik\u014d was born sometime in 13 BC, and was given the name \"Otarashihiko-no-mikoto\". He was the 3rd son of Emperor Suinin, and his second empress wife \"Hibasu-hime\". Otarashihiko-no-mikoto was allegedly chosen as crown prince over his elder brother based on a casual question on what they both had wished for. In the former's case he said \"The Empire\" while his elder brother said \"Bow and arrows\". Otarashihiko-no-mikoto later ascended to the throne in 71 AD, coming a year after his father's death.\nAccounts in the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\" are split when it comes to initial territorial expansion during Emperor Keik\u014d's reign. In the \"Kojiki\", the Emperor is said to have sent his son \"Prince \u014csu\" (Yamato Takeru) to Ky\u016bsh\u016b to conquer local tribes. Alternatively, the \"Nihon Shoki\" records that he went there himself and won battles against local tribes. Both sources agree that Keik\u014d later sent Yamato Takeru to Izumo Province, and eastern provinces to conquer the area and spread his territory. According to traditional sources, Yamato Takeru died in the . The possessions of the dead prince were gathered together along with the sword Kusanagi; and his widow venerated his memory in a shrine at her home. Sometime later, these relics and the sacred sword were moved to the current location of the Atsuta Shrine.\nEmperor Keik\u014d was recorded as , who had at least 80 children from multiple wives. This claim would put him into the category of gigantism if verified, although as with other aspects it was more than likely exaggerated. Other than Yamato Takeru, at least three of Keik\u014d's children were ancestors of notable clans. According to tradition, emperor Keik\u014d died in 130 AD at the age of 143, and his son Prince \"Wakatarashihiko\" was enthroned as the next emperor the following year.\nKnown information.\nEmperor Keik\u014d is regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. The name Keik\u014d\"-tenn\u014d\" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Keik\u014d, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\". There is a possibility that Keik\u014d's era was in the 4th century AD rather than the 1st. This period is concurrent with the Kentoshi having an audience with the Tang Emperor, though more evidence is needed to make any conclusions. Like his father before him, Keik\u014d is also known to have an exaggerated lifespan which is unlikely to be factual. The consecutive reigns of the emperors began to be compiled in the 8th century, and it is thought that age gaps were \"filled up\" as many lacunae were present. For comparison, verified ages in the 110s have since been documented and recorded as the \"oldest in the world\".\nWhile the actual site of Keik\u014d's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Keik\u014d's mausoleum, and it is formally named \"Yamanobe no michi no e no misasagi\".

This legendary Emperor is best known for organizing his local governments by making the first appointments of their kind to provinces under his rule. Seimu had only one recorded wife who bore him a single child; he also had a concubine but she had no children. This is in stark contrast to his father, who is said to have had at least 80 children with multiple wives.\nSeimu's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 131 to 190 AD. An issue ultimately occurred when his only son allegedly died at a young age. Seimu appointed one of his nephews to be crown prince before his death in 190 AD, marking the first of later generations which would cede the throne to a non-direct successor. While the location of Seimu's grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb. Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"Seimu\" was used by later generations to describe this legendary Emperor. It has also been proposed that Seimu actually reigned much later than he is attested.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Seimu is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Seimu was born to Yasakairi-hime sometime in 84 AD, and was given the name . It is unknown how he was chosen as crown prince, but Wakatarashihiko later ascended to the throne in 131 AD. Seimu is best known for organizing his local governments by appointing the first provincial governors and district officials. While the details of his system of governing remain elusive, at the time Imperial princes were sent to important places in the provinces. These members are designated as \"wake\", which represented their status as a branch of the Imperial family. It has been theorized by Brinkley and Kikuchi that these appointments of local governors were designed to extend the \"prestige of the Court\". Those that were eligible included \"men of merit\", Imperial princes, or chiefs of aboriginal tribes.\nThe records state that Seimu had a wife named , who was the daughter of \"Take-oshiyama-tari-ne\". Oho-takara bore the Emperor one child, named . Seimu's only son appears to have died at a young age as the Emperor appointed Yamato Takeru's son as Crown Prince, before his own death in 190 AD at the age 107 years old. His nephew \"Tarashinakatsuhiko\" was later enthroned as the next emperor in 192 AD. Seimu's death marked an end of direct lineage from legendary Emperor Jimmu, and was the first split branch of others that later followed.\nKnown information.\nEmperor Seimu is regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. His existence is open to debate given this lack of information. If Seimu did exist, there is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time period to which his reign has been assigned. It is much more likely that he was a chieftain, or local clan leader, and the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Seimu\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Seimu, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".

Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") record events that took place during Ch\u016bai's alleged lifetime. Ch\u016bai is the first monarch to ascend the throne who was not a son of the previous Emperor as the latter's only child died young. He is also noted for having his capital in Kyushu, rather than Yamato like his predecessors. The records state that Ch\u016bai had a wife named \"Okinagatarashihime-no-Mikoto\" (later Jing\u016b), and 2 consorts that all bore him 4 children.\nCh\u016bai's reign is conventionally considered to have been from 192 to 200 AD. The events leading up to the Emperor's death have been subject to interpretation as they involve a vengeful Kami (spirit) indirectly killing Ch\u016bai. This event allegedly occurred after the Emperor disrespectfully scoffed at the Kami's request. His wife Jing\u016b carried out the Kami's request which was to invade Korea, but this has since been considered legendary rather than factual. While the location of Ch\u016bai's grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb, and at a Hachiman shrine.\nModern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"Ch\u016bai\" were used by later generations to describe this legendary Emperor. It has also been proposed that Ch\u016bai actually reigned much later than he is attested. Emperor Ch\u016bai is traditionally listed as the last Emperor of the Yayoi period.\nLegendary narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Ch\u016bai is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The records state that Ch\u016bai was born to Futaji no Iri Hime sometime in 149 AD, and was given the name . Ch\u016bai's father was allegedly the legendary prince, Yamato Takeru. He was the first Emperor who was not the child of the previous Emperor, being instead the nephew of his predecessor Emperor Seimu. The title of \"Crown Prince\" was given to him by his uncle before his death in 190 AD, two years later Ch\u016bai became the next Emperor. Unlike his predecessors who had maintained their capitals in Yamato Province, the records state his palace was first located on the northern shores of Shimonoseki Strait, then south of that in Kyushu.\nEmperor Ch\u016bai is described in the \"Kiki\" as having been ten feet tall, with \"a countenance of perfect beauty\". He had one wife who was named \" Okinagatarashi\" (aka Jing\u016b), and two consorts who all bore him four children. During the start of his reign, he made progress to modern day Tsuruga, and led an expedition to Kii where he heard news of a revolt. Jing\u016b accompanied him to the west to fight against a tribe in Tsukushi (located in modern-day Fukuoka Prefecture) called \"Kumaso\". On the eve of battle though, his wife was suddenly possessed by some unknown kami who advised Ch\u016bai to invade and conquer Korea. The Kami gave the reasoning that the \"Kumaso\" were not worthy of \"his steel\". Ch\u016bai refused with scorn for a number of reasons which included giving up a military campaign, and doubting that such a land even existed. It is said that the Kami was so enraged by this disrespect, that Emperor Ch\u016bai was later killed in a battle that beat down his troops.\nThe death of the Emperor was kept quiet by Jing\u016b, who vanquished the \"Kumaso\" soon afterwards in a fit of revenge. Jing\u016b then respected the wishes of the Kami by invading Korea, and subjugated the eastern Korean kingdom of Shiragi. The other two Korean kingdoms at the time voluntarily submitted, and Jing\u016b ascended to the throne as Empress. Jing\u016b's occupation of the Korean Peninsula, and reign as Empress are now considered to be legendary rather than factual. The modern traditional view is that Ch\u016bai's son (\"Homutawake\") became the next Emperor after Jing\u016b acted as a regent. She would have been de facto ruler in the interim.\nKnown information.\nEmperor Ch\u016bai is regarded by historians as a \"legendary Emperor\" as there is insufficient material available for further verification and study. The lack of this information has made his very existence open to debate. There is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Ch\u016bai's reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. The name Ch\u016bai\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Ch\u016bai, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nThe manner in which Ch\u016bai died has since been broken down to at least two theories. In his book \"Confucianism O - Z\", professor Xinzhong Yao notes that it is possible the late Emperor could have succumbed to illness rather than death on the battlefield. Sources which include Yao, Francis Brinkley, and Kikuchi Dairoku also cite the enemy arrow scenario. While the actual site of Ch\u016bai's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Nara. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ch\u016bai's mausoleum, and is formally named \"Ega no Naganu no nishi no misasagi\". The Kami (spirit) of Ch\u016bai is also enshrined at the Tamukeyama Hachiman Shrine in Nara. Ch\u016bai is traditionally listed as the last Emperor of the Yayoi period, who could have in reality ruled in the 4th century. The next era is known as the Kofun period, where more is known about the Emperors based on modern day archaeological evidence.\nOutside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c.\u2009509\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates.

These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. The circumstances surrounding the future emperor's birth are controversial as they involve a supposed invasion of the Korean Peninsula as well as a biologically impossible gestation period (3 years). It is said by the Kiki that \u014cjin was conceived but unborn when his father Emperor Ch\u016bai died. Empress Jing\u016b then became a de facto ruler who allegedly invaded a \"promised land\" (Korea) out of revenge, then returned three years later to the Japanese mainland to give birth. The records state that \u014cjin was born to Empress Jing\u016b in Tsukushi Province sometime in 201 AD, and was given the name . He became the crown prince at the age of four, but was not crowned Emperor until 270 AD at the age of 70. Emperor \u014cjin supposedly lived in two palaces which are now located in present-day Osaka. His reign lasted 40 years until his death in 310 AD, in all he fathered 28 children with one spouse and ten consorts. His fourth son \" \u014cosazaki\" was later enthroned as the next emperor in 313 AD.\nKnown information.\nWhile the historical existence of Emperor \u014cjin is debated among historians, there is a general consensus that he was \"probably real\". There is also an agreement that Ojin's three year conception period is mythical and symbolic, rather than realistic. William George Aston has suggested that this can be interpreted as a period of less than nine months containing three \"years\" (some seasons), e.g. three harvests. If \u014cjin was an actual historical figure then historians have proposed that he ruled later than attested. Dates of his actual reign have been proposed to be as early as 370 to 390 AD, to as late as the early 5th century AD. At least one Japanese historian has cast doubt on this theory though, by revising a supporting statement given in 1972. In this new narrative Louis Perez states: \"only kings and emperors after the reign of Ojin... ...are seen as historical figures\". In either case there is also no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which \u014cjin's reign has been assigned.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as \u014cjin's mausoleum, and is formally named \"Eega no Mofushi no oka no misasagi\".

This emperor is best known for an assassination attempt on his life by his brother \"Suminoe\" after the death of their father Emperor Nintoku. Although no firm dates can be assigned to his life, Rich\u016b's brief reign is conventionally considered to have been from 400 to 405.\nDuring his reign local recorders were allegedly appointed for the first time in various provinces, a royal treasury was established, and court waitresses (Uneme) first appeared. Rich\u016b had both a wife and a concubine during his lifetime which bore him 4 children (2 boys and 2 girls).

These records state that Rich\u016b was born to sometime in 336 AD, and was given the name . He was the eldest son of Emperor Nintoku, and was later appointed crown prince by his father during the 31st year of his father's reign. (343 AD). When Nintoku died in 399 AD, a period of mourning was followed by a scandal that almost took the Crown Prince's life.\nAssassination attempt.\nSometime during the interval before Rich\u016b assumed the throne, he sent his younger brother, to make marriage arrangements for his consort . Prince Nakatsu instead passed himself off as his older brother Rich\u016b, and seduced Kuro-hime. When the act was done he carelessly left his wrist-bells behind at Kuro-hime's house. Rich\u016b later discovered these during his first visit to her house, assumed what his brother had done, but decided to take no action against him. Nakatsu on the other hand was fearful of his scandalous actions and plotted to kill his brother that night. He secretly raised a small group of people who surrounded his brother's palace. Luckily for Rich\u016b, some of his loyal retainers intervened by rescuing the heir and carrying him off to Isonokami Shrine in Yamoto. Nakatsu meanwhile set fire to the besieged palace not knowing of his brother's escape.\nRich\u016b's other younger brother (later Emperor Hanzei) followed him to Yamoto. He was told by Rich\u016b though, that unless he proved his loyalty by killing Nakatsu he could not be trusted. Mizuhawake returned to Naniwa and bribed one of Nakatsu's retainers to kill him. Nakatsu was utterly defenseless and unprepared as he assumed his brother had fled and disappeared. He was subsequently stabbed to death by his retainer, and Mizuhawake made his way back to Yamoto to report his death. Rich\u016b in turn gratefully granted his younger brother \"Mura-ahase granaries.\nReign.\nRich\u016b was crowned emperor after his brother's failed rebellion had been put to rest in the following year (400 AD). During this time, those who were not executed for their participation in the rebellion were forced to undergo tattooing as a punishment. Kurohime was also officially appointed as a concubine later in that year. Although the two had two sons and a daughter, Rich\u016b appointed the title of \"Crown Prince\" to his brother Prince Mizuhawake (later Emperor Hanzei) in 401 AD. In the year 403 AD, \"local recorders were appointed for the first time in various provinces, who noted down statements and communicated writings of the four quarters.\" Kurohime died sometime in the following year (404 AD) under unclear circumstances. Its said that the Emperor heard a voice in the wind utter mysterious words in the \"great void\" before a messenger announced of her death. Rich\u016b attributed the cause to an offended deity due to the misconduct of an official regarding a shrine. Princess Kusakanohatabino-hime was appointed empress in the following year (405 AD), and the two gave birth to a daughter (Princess Nakashi). A royal treasury was also established in that year which was managed by two appointed Koreans. Emperor Rich\u016b's reign ended during its sixth year, when he fell ill and succumbed to disease at the age of 64 or 70. The \"kiki\" states that Rich\u016b was buried in the misasagi on the \"Plain of Mozo no Mimi\". His brother \"Mizuhawake\" was enthroned as the next emperor in the following year (406 AD).\nHistorical assessment.\nRich\u016b is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Orientalist scholar James Murdoch includes Emperor Rich\u016b in the \"earliest non-legendary\" sovereigns of Japan, while academic Richard Ponsonby-Fane stated that this \"may be termed the semi-historical period\". Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Rich\u016b under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\", and notes that rulers from this point forward no longer have reigns of \"incredible length\". Others such as author \"Joshua Frydman\" cite Emperor Rich\u016b's lifespan as being realistic in length. Rich\u016b has also been possibly identified with King San in the \"Book of Song\" by Confucian scholars and Arai Hakuseki. According to Chinese records, King San sent messengers to the Liu Song dynasty at least twice in 421 and 425.\nScholars William George Aston and Brinkley disagree on the introduction of local recorders. Aston states in his reasoning that the arrival of the Korean scholar Wani did not take place until 405 AD, and \"[historians] have not yet got down to time of accurate chronologically\". Brinkley counters this by saying that Wani's innovation was \"not the art of writing, but, in all probability, a knowledge of the Chinese classics\". Academic Delmer Brown wrote that during Rich\u016b's reign, court waitresses (Uneme) appeared. There were also storehouses (Kura) built in various provinces, and an \"Administrator of State Affairs\" from his reign on. It is commonly accepted among historians that Emperor Rich\u016b was in his late 60s if not 70 when he died.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Rich\u016b's reign has been assigned. It is certainly possible that he was a chieftain or local clan leader, and that the polity he ruled would have only encompassed a small portion of modern-day Japan. It's also possible he could have had the title of , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\", or \"Great King of Yamato\".

It's recorded in the \"Kiki\" that Hanzei was born to sometime in 352 AD, and was given the name . He was the third son of Emperor Nintoku, and a younger brother of Emperor Rich\u016b. The phrase \"Mizu ha\" in the name \"Mizuhawake\" translates to \"beautiful teeth\", as he was said to have beautiful \"exceptionally large\" \"teeth like one bone\" all of the same size. Only the \"Kojiki\" mentions the alleged full grown height of Emperor Hanzei which is said to have been . Shortly after Nintoku died, his elder brother attempted to assassinate his eldest brother (Rich\u016b). \"Mizuhawake\" was able to bribe one of Nakatsu's retainers into killing Nakatsu in order to prove his loyalty to the future emperor.\nAccording to the \"Nihon Shoki\", Rich\u016b bypassed his own children to make his younger brother Mizuhawake crown prince in 401 AD. The given reason is that a \"Tajihi\" flower fell into a well which gave the name of \"Mizuhawake\" as the next heir to be. Mizuhawake was proclaimed as \"Emperor Hanzei\" upon Rich\u016b's death in 405 AD, and was enthroned sometime in the following year. Shortly after his enthronement Hanzei took as an \"Imperial concubine\", and eventually her younger sister as a consort. The two Empresses bore him 4 children which consisted of 2 sons and 2 daughters. During Emperor Hanzei's reign, he ruled from the palace Shibagaki no Miya at \"Tajihi\" in the province of Kawachi (present-day Matsubara, Osaka). During his five-year reign the country enjoyed a time of peace. Emperor Hanzei died peacefully in his palace sometime in 410 AD without naming an heir (crown prince). This issue was later settled by Imperial ministers who selected Emperor Nintoku's youngest son Ingy\u014d as the next emperor.\nHistorical assessment.\nHanzei is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Hanzei under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\", but notes that his short reign was \"not remarkable for anything\" except for indirect evidence that Chinese customs were beginning to be adopted by the Japanese court. Scholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that \"three ranks of concubines are mentioned\", which at the time were of Chinese origin (ranked concubines). Others such as author Ryoichi Maenosono (Kokushi Daijiten) identify Emperor Hanzei with \"King Chin of the Five kings of Wa. According to Chinese records, King Chin sent a tribute to the Liu Song dynasty in 438 AD.\nBritish academic and Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain notes in his translation of the Kojiki that no accurate information exists regarding the ancient Japanese measures used to get Hanzei's alleged height of . He went on to say that \"the English equivalents used in this passage correspond but approximately to the modern Japanese standards\". As for Hanzei's ascension, the \"Nihon Shoki\" mentions that \"Tajihi\" is now known as the itadori flower. Aston notes though, that the story of a \"Tajihi\" flower falling into a well is inconsistent with a later passage in the Nihon Shoki which refers to \"Tajihi\" as a location (not a flower).\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Hanzei's reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". An alternate title could have also been \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Hanzei\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Hanzei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nWhile the actual site of Hanzei's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a \"kofun\"-type Imperial tomb in Sakai, Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Hanzei's mausoleum, and is formally named formally named .

Both the \"Kojiki\", and the \"Nihon Shoki\" (collectively known as the \"Kiki\") recorded events that took place during Ingy\u014d's alleged lifetime. No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 410 to 453.\nWhile the location of Ingy\u014d's grave (if any) is unknown, he is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto tomb.\nProtohistoric narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Ingy\u014d is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It's recorded in the \"Kiki\" that Ingy\u014d was born to somewhere between 373 and 375 AD and was given the name . He was the fourth son of Emperor Nintoku, making him the youngest brother of Rich\u016b and Hanzei. After the death of his brother Hanzei in 410 AD Oasazuma was approached by ministers who had unanimously chosen him as the next Emperor. Oasazuma declined the offer stating that his brothers had \"despised him as a fool\". He also called himself \"unlucky\" as he claimed to be suffering from an unmentioned paralyzing illness.\nAfter more than two years had passed, Oasazuma was finally persuaded by his favorite concubine Oshisaka no \u014cnakatsuhime to accept the throne. Oasazuma was formally enthroned as Emperor Ingy\u014d and his concubine became the next K\u014dg\u014d. Sometime in early 414 an envoy was sent to Silla and procured a physician for the ailing Emperor. The physician attributed the problem to Ingy\u014d's legs and was able to cure him in August of that year. In 415 AD, Ingy\u014d reformed the system of family and clan names. This had been an ongoing issue as many families either gave false names or used a clan title with a ranking they hadn't earned. In the middle of 416 AD, an earthquake hit Japan which disrupted the \"temporary\" burial process of Emperor Hanzei.\nSometime in the winter of 418 AD, empress Oshisaka no \u014cnakatsuhime unintentionally introduced her husband to her younger sister at a banquet. Emperor Ingy\u014d fell deeply in love and sent a messenger afterwards to summon her. He learned that the woman's name was \"Otohime\" (\"youngest princess\"), but was given the designation of \"Sotohori Iratsume\" (\"clothing pass maiden\") by local men for her beauty. Otohime initially refused to comply as she didn't want to hurt her sister's feelings. Not wanting to face punishment for disobeying, the messenger stayed with Otohime until she agreed to come. Oshisaka was not pleased by this and refused to let Otohime into the Imperial palace. Ingy\u014d thus built Otohime a separate residence nearby where he often sneaked off to.\nEmpress Oshisaka no \u014cnakatsuhime bore Ingy\u014d a total of nine children (5 sons and 4 daughters). In 434 AD Ingy\u014d chose to name his first son Kinashi no Karu as Crown Prince. This was unknowingly a controversial choice as Kinashi was later accused of an incestuous relationship with his sister, Princess Karu no \u014ciratsume. Ingy\u014d couldn't punish his son due to the title he had bestowed upon him, so instead chose an indirect approach by banishing his daughter Karu no \u014ciratsume to Iyo. When Emperor Ingy\u014d died sometime in 453 AD, the king of Silla grieved so much that he presented Japan with 80 musicians to comfort Ingyo's soul. Kinashi no Karu meanwhile faced a challenge as his younger brother Anaho was favored to be heir apparent.\nHistorical assessment.\nIngy\u014d is regarded by historians as a ruler during the early 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Ingy\u014d under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\" whose reign was overshadowed by an affair and scandal regarding his son. Other scholars identify Ingy\u014d with King Sai in the \"Book of Song\". This would have been a king of Japan (referred to as \"Wa\" by contemporary Chinese scholars) who is said to have sent messengers to the Liu Song dynasty at least twice, in 443 and 451. However, there is no record in the \"Kiki\" of messengers being sent.\nTitles and dating.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Ingy\u014d's reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". An alternate title could have also been \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Ingy\u014d\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Ingy\u014d, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nOutside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c.\u2009509\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nEvents during reign.\nEarly on in his reign, Emperor Ingy\u014d chose to send envoys to Korea for medical assistance. Brinkley took note of this and stated that Korea was evidently regarded as the \"home of healing science\". He also attributed the \"many other\" arts which were borrowed from China. In regard to reforms, Sholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that when Ingy\u014d reformed the system of family and clan names, it would have only applied to dominant caste. At the time the general populace of Japan kept their personal names and \"cared little for geopolitics\". Emperor Ingy\u014d's later affair with \"Otohime\" is regarded as important by Brinkley as it illustrates the manners and customs at the time. He also suggests that the \"atmosphere of loose morality\" was in part responsible for Kinashi no Karu's incestuous relationship.\nIt is agreed upon by Basil Hall Chamberlain's translation of the Kojiki, and Aston's translation of the Nihon Shoki that Prince Kinashi no Karu was probably appointed crown prince during his father's lifetime. At the time, marriage between children of the same father had always been allowed as long as the mothers involved were different. Marriage of children of the same mother of whom Kinashi no Karu was guilty of was considered incest. Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that it's doubtful Karu no \u014ciratsume was banished by her father. Historically women have always been more lightly punished than men for the same offense, and \"the particular character of the fault in this case makes such a discrimination all the more reasonable\".\nFrancis Brinkley comments that four facts present themselves during Emperor Ingy\u014d's reign: \"Men wore wristbands and garters to which grelots were attached, that a high value was set for pearls, that metal was used for the construction of great man's gates, and the first earthquake is said to have been experienced in 416 AD\". The latter of these things allegedly leveled the Imperial Palace at Kyoto from the severity of the Earth's tremors. Modern sources have since questioned the reliability of this \"first earthquake\", opting instead to recognize another that took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of Empress Suiko.\nGravesite.\nWhile the actual site of Ingy\u014d's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine in Fujiidera Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ingy\u014d's mausoleum/\"kofun\"-type Imperial tomb. Formally, this tomb is called , but is also given the name . Another burial candidate for Emperor Ingy\u014d's is the , which is also located in Fujiidera. Ingy\u014d is also enshrined at the Imperial Palace along with other emperors and members of the Imperial Family at the Three Palace Sanctuaries.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It's recorded in the \"Kiki\" that Ingy\u014d was born to somewhere in 400 AD, and was given the name . While he was the third son of Emperor Ingy\u014d, the title of \"Crown Prince\" was not bestowed upon him in his father's lifetime. For this particular sovereign, the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki tell different versions of what allegedly happened in regard to Emperor Ank\u014d's older brother \"Prince Kinashi no Karu\".\nWar between Anaho and Kinashi.\nAfter Emperor Ingy\u014d's death in 453 AD, Crown Prince \"Kinashi no Karu\" faced a mounting problem. The incestuous relationship with his sister, Princess Karu no \u014ciratsume had caused the public to shun him and his retainers refused to follow. Karu chose to take up arms against his younger brother as his retainers had instead given their allegiance to him. Prince responded with a force of his own which prompted Karu to flee and take refuge at a noble family's residence. From this point on, the \"Kiki\" splits narratives that converge again with the same fatal outcome. In the \"Nihon Shoki's\" version of events, \"Kinashi no Karu\" takes his final stand at the residence where he commits an honorary suicide. The Nihon Shoki does not say what happened to Princess Karu no \u014ciratsume other than her being banished to Iyo by Emperor Ingy\u014d during his lifetime for incest. In the \"Kojikis\" version of events, \"Kinashi no Karu\" surrenders to his younger brother and is banished to Iyo. Karu no \u014ciratsume follows him to Iyo afterwards and the two commit suicide together.\nReign.\nPrince was enthroned as \"Emperor Ank\u014d\" towards the end of 453 AD. During this time the capital was moved to \"Isonokami\" (located in Yamoto) where the new emperor had his palace. One of Ank\u014d's first decisions in the following year was to arrange a marriage between his younger brother, , and Hatahihime, who was a sister of his uncle . Ank\u014d dispatched his servant to negotiate with Ookusaka, and he happily consented to the marriage. As a token of approval, he entrusted Ne-no-omi with a richly jeweled coronet to be presented to the Emperor. Unbeknownst to Ank\u014d, his servant chose to keep the coronet for himself and lied to him by saying Ookusaka refused to comply. Ank\u014d believed Ne-no-omi's words and infuriated with rage sent his soldiers to kill Ookusaka and take his wife Nakashi (Emperor Rich\u016b\u2019s daughter) as his Kogo. Hatahihime was then married to \u014chatuse in accordance with the Emperor's wishes. Aside from his eventual demise, there aren't any other noteworthy events during Ank\u014d's reign.\nDeath.\nAnk\u014d married Nakashi whom he \"loved deeply\" in 455 AD, but before this time she already had a son named Mayowa no \u014ckimi (Prince Mayowa). The young prince (6 years old at the time) was able to escape punishment on \"his mother's account\" and was brought up in the royal palace. Sometime in the Autumn of 456 AD, Emperor Ank\u014d confided to Nakashi that he was worried one day Mayowa may seek to avenge his father's death. Mayowa overheard this remark and crept to the side of his step-father who was asleep in Nakashi's lap. He then proceeded to cut off Ank\u014d's head with his own sword. At the time of his death Ank\u014d was 56 years old, had no children of his own, and according to the Nihon Shoki was buried sometime in 459 AD. Prince \u014chatuse no Wakatakeru (Emperor Ingy\u014d's youngest son) became the next Emperor towards the end of 456 AD after killing Prince Mayowa and the rest of his competition.\nHistorical assessment.\nAnk\u014d is regarded by historians as a ruler during the mid 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Ank\u014d under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\" whose reign was \"a discreditable page of Japanese History\". Other scholars identify Ank\u014d with King K\u014d in the \"Book of Song\". This would have been a king of Japan (referred to as \"Wa\" by contemporary Chinese scholars) who is said to have sent tribute to the Southern Dynasty of China in 462, during the reign of Emperor Taiwu of the Northern Wei. It also mentions that King K\u014d was appointed as the \"General of the East\". However, there is no record in the \"Kiki\" of any tribute being sent during this time.\nTitles and dating.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" was used during the time to which Ank\u014d's reign has been assigned. Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". An alternate title could have also been \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Ank\u014d\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Ank\u014d, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nOutside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c.\u2009509\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nEvents during reign.\nEmperor Ank\u014d's short 3-year reign is largely confined to an event that had deadly consequences. Scholar William George Aston notes in his translation of the Nihon Shoki that Hatahihime and are implied in the Shukai as grandchildren rather than children of Emperor Nintoku. He states that the \"obvious explanation\" is that the \"chronicle is entirely untrustworthy\". At the point where Emperor Ank\u014d's servant relays false information regarding Prince Ookusaka's alleged rejection, the emperor had no reason to doubt him. Frank Brinkley notes that it was \"not customary in those days\" to conduct investigations (in this case a servant).\nThe exact account of Emperor Ank\u014d's death is also questionable given that a child could conceive or commit such a thing. Scholar Francis Brinkley suggests that Empress Nakashi played a role in her husband's death. He also suggests that answer might lie with who later became Emperor Y\u016bryaku. Brinkley argues that if \u014chatuse had no issue with killing several of his family members to obtain the throne, then there is no reason why he wouldn't have started with the reigning emperor.\nGravesite.\nWhile the actual site of Ank\u014d's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine at the ruins of Horai Castle in Nara City. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Ank\u014d's mausoleum/\"kofun\"-type Imperial tomb. Formally, this tomb is called , but is also given the name . Another possible burial theory involves the , whose owner remains unknown.

According to the \"Kojiki\", this Emperor is said to have ruled from the Thirteenth Day of the Eleventh Month of 456 (Heishin) until his death on the Seventh Day of the Eight Month of 479 (Kibi). He is the first archaeologically verifiable Japanese emperor.\nProtohistoric narrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Y\u016bryaku is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It is recorded in the \"Kiki\" that Y\u016bryaku was born to sometime in 417 or 418 AD, and was given the name . As the fifth and youngest son of Emperor Ingy\u014d he was never given the title of \"Crown Prince\" due to his two older living brothers.\nAscension.\n\u014chatsuse was thrown into a fit of rage when he learned that his brother Emperor Ank\u014d was assassinated in 456 AD. He then immediately became suspicious of his two elder brothers as conspirers. \u014chatsuse's first action was to question Prince Shirahiko regarding what could have happened. Shirahiko allegedly knew \u014chatsuse was up to no good, so he sat silently which prompted \u014chatsuse to kill them both individually with a sword. He then turned his rage towards the boy assassin Mayowa no \u014ckimi (Prince Mayowa), and his other brother Kurohiko by burning him to death. This just left Emperor Rich\u016b's eldest son Prince Ichinobe no Oshiwa in contention for the throne. \n\u014chatsuse was resentful that Ank\u014d had formally wished to transfer the kingdom to Ichinobe. Both the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki describe how \u014chatsuse took Prince Ichinobe and his younger brother Prince Mima out hunting and \"treacherously\" killed them. The sons of Prince Ichinobe fled to Harima and went into hiding, later becoming Emperor Kenz\u014d and Emperor Ninken. \u014chatsuse (later known as Emperor Y\u016bryaku) was then enthroned sometime afterwards in November 456. The new emperor subsequently made \"Asakura no Miya\" at Sakurai, Nara the location of his imperial palace. Emperor Rich\u016b's widow Kusaka no Hatabi no hime was appointed Empress with three concubines in March 457.\nReign.\nAccording to the \"Kiki\", Emperor Y\u016bryaku's reign was full of tyranny and cruelty. He allegedly ordered a girl to \"have her four limbs stretched on a tree and be roasted to death\" due to misplaced affection. Another account states that he killed one of his servants during a hunt because his servant did not understand how to cut up animal meat. Y\u016bryaku also allegedly removed a high official to a distant post so he could help himself to the man's wife. The Emperor arbitrary and capriciously killed so many men and women that he was referred to as Emperor of Great Wickedness by the public. However, it is noted that Y\u016bryaku improved his behavior after being admonished by the empress. On a more positive side, Y\u016bryaku greatly encouraged agriculture during his reign and had his consort plant mulberry trees and cultivate silkworms. The Emperor was also known as a poet, and someone who enjoyed arts and crafts as expert handicraftsmen were commissioned from Baekje (Korea). While the Empress herself never bore Y\u016bryaku any children, he had three sons and two daughters with his concubines.\nIn the 22nd year of his reign (477 AD) Y\u016bryaku moved a shrine dedicated to Toyouke-hime from Tanba to Ise (modern day Ise, Mie). This newly founded shrine named is now a part of the Ise Shrine complex. According to \"\" (written in 884 AD), the goddess Toyouke originally came from Tamba. It records that Emperor Y\u016bryaku was told by Amaterasu in his dream that she alone was not able to supply enough food, so that Y\u016bryaku needed to bring , or the goddess of divine meals, from Hijino Manai in ancient Tanba Province.\nY\u016bryaku appointed his son as heir apparent in 478 AD before dying in the following year. The \"Nihon Shoki\" mentions that Y\u016bryaku lived to be 104, while the Kojiki gives his age as 124. His son Shiraka was later enthroned as Emperor Seinei in 480 AD.\nFolklore.\nIn Shinto folklore, events during Y\u016bryaku's reign include meeting the Kami \"Hitokotonushi\" while hunting on Mount Katsuraki in 460 AD. The Kami appeared to him as a tall man whose face and demeanor resembled the Emperor's. After introductions Hitokotonushi joined Y\u016bryaku as the two hunted deer until sunset. He then escorted the Emperor \"as far as the waters of Kume.\" Another encounter with a Kami occurred in 463 AD through an invitation to the thunder god of to the Imperial Palace. The Emperor sent his royal messenger Chiisakobe no muraji Sugaru, who carried a halberd with a red banner that symbolized his authority. Sugaru enlisted the help of priests to enshrine the kami into a portable carriage, to be brought in the Emperor's presence, as a great serpent. Things took a turn for the worse as Y\u016bryaku had neglected beforehand to practice proper ritual purification and religious abstinence. The thunder kami showed his displeasure through a thundering menacing appearance which caused the Emperor to flee into the interior of his palace. The great serpent was returned to Mimuro, and the Emperor made many offerings to appease the angry deity.\nHistorical assessment.\nY\u016bryaku is regarded by historians as a ruler during the 5th century whose existence is generally accepted as fact. Scholar Francis Brinkley lists Emperor Y\u016bryaku under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\" where he remarks that while some historians have described him as an \"austere\" man, \"few readers of his annals will be disposed to endure such a lenient verdict.\" He also added that the year 475 AD marks the first \"absolute agreement between the dates given in Japanese history and those given in Korean\u2026\u201c This in turn has caused critics to admit the trustworthiness of Japanese history in the late 5th century. Scottish Orientalist scholar and journalist James Murdoch regards Y\u016bryaku as a \"much maligned person who was a strong if somewhat ferocious ruler.\" British academic and author Richard Ponsonby-Fane noted that the Emperor is described as a \"mighty hunter\", as it is recorded that the God \"Hitokotonushi\" accompanied him in the chase.\nThe Emperor's interest in poetry is amongst the more well-documented aspects of his character and reign. Poems attributed to him are included in the \"Man'y\u014dsh\u016b\", and a number of his verses are preserved in the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihonshoki\". Archaeological research has also confirmed that large keyhole-shaped tombs belonging to the chiefs of local ruling families disappeared from around the end of the 5th century when Y\u016bryaku reigned.\nA modern-day cognitive analysis, \"as deciphered in the Nihon shoki\", was conducted in 2024 by the National Institute of Japanese Literature. In this analysis, Emperor Y\u016bryaku was included as an example of \"impulsive murder and the tendency to become enraged.\" Factors such as \"the disproportion between the triggering events\", \"the violence expressed by the emperor on such occasions (quite extreme in degree)\", and the \"frequent occurrence of such descriptions\" were then considered for a conclusion. It is suggested that Emperor Y\u016bryaku may have had an \"intermittent explosive disorder, a type of Impulse-control disorder.\"\nOutside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c.\u2009509\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nGreat King of Yamato.\nDuring this moment in history, the calendar system of the Nihon Shoki changes from before and after Y\u016bryaku's reign. As his name is mentioned at the beginning of the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b and Nihon Ry\u014diki, this is seen as a historical turning point. Previously the Japanese archipelago had been a confederation of powerful ruling families from various regions. This appeared to have changed with the appearance of Emperor Yuryaku as the autocratic rule of the Great King was established and a centralized system centered on the Great King began. This is further supported by a major discovery that occurred in 1968 when the iron Inariyama burial-mound sword was extracted from a tomb. In 1978, X-ray analysis revealed a gold-inlaid inscription that comprises at least 115 Chinese characters. The given year on the sword is denoted as \"xin-hai\" (\"Year of the Metal Pig\") according to the Chinese sexagenary cycle, in which the name of the year is recycled every 60 years. While this year is generally regarded in Japan to correspond to 471 AD, at least one historian suggests that 531 is a more likely date. \nThe person buried in the tomb is given the name \"Wowake\", who was thought to be an influential warrior in the region. King Waka Takiru in the transcription is thought to be the same person as \u014chatsuse-wakatakeru-no-mikoto as mentioned in the \"Nihon Shoki\", an alias of Emperor Y\u016bryaku. As each inscription contains the name of an official position, this suggests that a system similar to the Bemin was already in place. While the Eta Funayama Sword also apparently mentions the name \"Waka Takiru\", many characters on that sword are illegible possibly due to polishing by a Japanese sword sharpener at the end of the Taisho period. If Y\u016bryaku's name can be corroborated to this sword then it can be interpreted that the power of the Great King had already extended from Kyushu to Togoku by the latter half of the 5th century.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" (meaning \"emperor\") was used during the time to which Y\u016bryaku's reign has been assigned. Instead, his title could have possibly been , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\", or \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Y\u016bryaku\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Y\u016bryaku, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nKing Bu.\nIt's theorized that Emperor Y\u016bryaku may be synonymous with King Bu (\u6b66) as written in the Chinese records. According to the Book of Song, Bu dispatched envoys to Emperor Shun of Song (a Southern Chinese dynasty) in both 477 and 478 AD. The first envoy was to inform the Chinese emperor that King K\u014d (Emperor Ank\u014d) had died, and his older brother had become king. It is written that he called himself \"King of Wa\", and the military commander of several different Kingdoms. Its written that in the following year Emperor Shun appointed Bu the title of \"Grand\" \"Peacekeeper-General of the East\". The full context of this latter passage describes how Bu's ancestors conquered countries, and expanded their power to the east and west. It describes how they crossed the sea to the north and reached the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. Although the kings of Wa repeatedly requested that the Emperors of the Song dynasty recognize their military control over Baekje, their efforts were denied. The reason for this is thought to be that the Song dynasty placed importance on Baekje, which was located in a strategically important area. By not offering recognition the Song Emperors could put the Northern Wei in check, and avoid opposition from Goguryeo which was in conflict with Wa. Scholar Francis Brinkley notes that the power of the Koma clan (supported by the Liu Song dynasty) in Goguryeo increased steadily during this time. Brinkley suggests that Emperor Y\u016bryaku's attempts to establish close relations with the Chinese Emperor seem to be from a desire to isolate Korea, which ended in failure.\nThe other two recorded instances regarding King Bu are mentioned in the books of Qi, and Liang. As compared to the former mention in 478 AD, these are not considered to be reliable. Japanese historian Mori Kimiaki points out that both of these appointments coincide with the founding year of their respective dynasties. This is thought to be an administrative matter, and it is not clear whether King Bu (Y\u016bryaku) himself requested it or not. There is at least one theory that supports the envoy being sent to Southern Qi in 479 as being factual. This is solely based on the description in the title of included in . The fourth and final appointment allegedly made by King Bu (Y\u016bryaku) falls outside of his recorded lifetime. As the \"Kiki\" states that Emperor Y\u016bryaku died in 479, the last given year of 502 AD would be implausible.\nGravesite.\nWhile the actual site of Y\u016bryaku's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") in Habikino, Osaka. As designated by the Imperial Household Agency as Y\u016bryaku's mausoleum, its formal name is \"Tajihi no Takawashi-no-hara no misasagi\". Aside from this shrine in Osaka, there is another burial site named where Y\u016bryaku is a possible burial candidate. Those in doubt of this theory, though, point to the construction style of the Kofun which may have begun several decades after Emperor Y\u016bryaku's death. This has led some researchers to add Emperor Ankan as a burial candidate for the Kofun. Y\u016bryaku is also enshrined at the Imperial Palace along with other emperors and members of the Imperial Family at the Three Palace Sanctuaries. He is additionally deified at the in Gose, Nara.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best known for events that took place before and after his reign with a void in between. These include a rebellion which was quickly put down, and a succession crisis as the Emperor had no children. Because Seinei had such a low profile, historians have questioned his existence and whether he ever ascended to the throne.\nNo firm dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 480 to 484. Dates confirmed as \"traditional\" did not appear until the reign of Emperor Kanmu (the 50th emperor). Modern historians have come to the conclusion that the title of \"Emperor\" and the name \"Seinei\" were used by later generations to describe him.\nNarrative.\nThe Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and a mausoleum (misasagi) for Seinei is currently maintained. The following information available is taken from the pseudo-historical \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", which are collectively known as or \"Japanese chronicles\". These chronicles include legends and myths, as well as potential historical facts that have since been exaggerated and/or distorted over time. It is recorded in the \"Nihon Shoki\" that Seinei was born to sometime in 444 AD, and was given the name . Prince Shiraka was the third and favorite son of Emperor Y\u016bryaku, and was made heir apparent a year before his father's death. Y\u016bryaku had taken notice at how Shiraka was born with white hair as meaning something significant.\nDuring the transition period, Y\u016bryaku's other consort convinced her younger son Prince Hoshikawa to assert his claim to the throne. While Hoshikawa was Prince Shiraka's older brother, the eldest sibling in the household () advised against it. In the rebellion that followed Hoshikawa and his followers sieged the Imperial treasury. They were then surrounded by court troops who burned the building to the ground, roasting to death all but one surviving minor official (who was given mercy). With the rebellion put down, Prince Shiraka assumed the throne as Emperor Seinei in 480 AD. Although the Emperor appointed a woman named Katsuraki Kara-hime as \"Grand Consort\", she was never made an Empress. \nSeinei grew distressed in the second year of his reign as he had no children to succeed him. His father Emperor Y\u016bryaku had done away with all of his male relations in his obsessive conquest for the throne, his older brother Prince Hoshikawa had been burnt to death, and Prince Iwaki died sometime in 481 AD. Seinei lucked out when two grandsons (Woke and Oke) of Emperor Rich\u016b were discovered by chance while the governor of Harima was out for an inspection. The two princes had fled to the countryside after their father, Ichinobe no Oshiwa was killed by Emperor Y\u016bryaku. These events regarding succession were also later recorded in the Kojiki.\nWhen word got to the Emperor about the two Princes, he was delighted and formerly adopted them as his heirs. Sometime in 482 AD, Prince Oke was appointed as Crown Prince. Seinei's death sometime in 484 AD (possibly January) came with a problem as his two adopted sons were very courteous towards each other. Although Prince Oke had been appointed heir, he ceded the throne to his brother Prince Woke, who in turn ceded it back. The two debated the issue for about a year while Princess Iitoyo, a daughter of Emperor Rich\u016b was allegedly made regent. Her death in late 484 AD resolved the debate and Prince Woke ascended to the throne as Emperor Kenz\u014d in the following year.\nHistorical assessment.\nThe actual existence of Emperor Seinei is debated among historians due to a lack of available information.British academic and author Richard Ponsonby-Fane notes that the Kojiki gives no details about Seinei and some lists omit his name altogether. Scholar Francis Brinkley though, still lists Emperor Seinei under \"Protohistoric sovereigns\". He mentioned there that Emperor Y\u016bryaku's \"evil act\" of stealing Tasa's wife (Kibi no Wakahime) led to serious consequences. While Wakahime and her companions conspired to place her own son on the throne, Brinkley stated that they underestimated the power of the Katsuragi family. In regard to the Emperor's hair, Dutch historian and Japanologist Isaac Titsingh mentioned that \"there is speculation that this [Seisei's] unusual hair color suggests albinism.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the title \"tenn\u014d\" (meaning \"emperor\") was used during the time to which Seinei's reign has been assigned. Instead, his title could have possibly been , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\", or \"Great King of Yamato\". The name Seinei\"-tenn\u014d\" was more than likely assigned to him posthumously by later generations. His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Seinei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the imperial dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the \"Kojiki\".\nOutside of the \"Kiki\", the reign of Emperor Kinmei (c.\u2009509\u00a0\u2013 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography has been able to assign verifiable dates. The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as \"traditional\" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.\nWhile the actual site of Seinei's grave is not known, this regent is traditionally venerated at a \"kofun\"-type Imperial tomb in Habikino, Osaka. The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Seinei's mausoleum and is formally named . Seinei is also enshrined at the Tokyo Imperial Palace in the Three Palace Sanctuaries.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to Harima no Kuni Fudoki, they found refuge at Akashi in Harima Province where they hid by living in obscurity. Histories from that period explained that the two brothers sought to blend into this rural community by posing as common herdsmen.\nIt is said that the Oke came by chance to Akashi; and at that time, Prince Oke revealed his true identity. This intermediary re-introduced the lost cousins to Emperor Seinei, who had by this time ascended to the throne after the death of his father, the former Emperor Y\u016bryaku. Seinei invited both brothers to return the court; and he adopted both of them as sons and heirs.\nAt Seinei's death, he had no other heirs than Prince Oke and Prince Woke, whose father had been killed by Y\u016braku.

The great men of the court insisted that one or the other of the brothers must accept the throne; but in the end, Woke proved to be more adamant.

There is insufficient material available for further verification and study. Significant differences exist in the records of the \"Kojiki\" and the \"Nihon Shoki\".\nThe \"Kojiki\" puts this emperor's birth year at 485; and his date of death is said to have been April 9, 527. In the extant account, he is called .\nThe \"Nihon Shoki\" gives his birth year at 450; and he is said to have died on February 7, 531 or 534. In this historical record, he is said to have been called and .\nIn other historical records, he is said to have originally been King of Koshi, a smaller tribal entity, apparently in northern parts of central Japan, perhaps as far as the coast of Sea of Japan.

Rather, it was presumably , meaning \"the great king who rules all under heaven\". Alternatively, Keitai might have been referred to as or the \"Great King of Yamato\".\nGenealogy.\nKeitai was not the son of the immediate previous monarch. According to the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", Buretsu died without a successor, at which time a fifth generation grandson of Emperor \u014cjin, Keitai, came and ascended the throne.\nIf Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as some historians believe, then Emperor Buretsu would have been the last monarch of the first recorded dynasty of Japan.\nAccording to the \"Kojiki\" and \"Nihon Shoki\", his father was and his mother was . When Buretsu died, Kanamura recommended Keitai (at the age of 58) as a possible heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne. His mother, Furihime, was a seventh generation descendant of Emperor Suinin by his son, Prince Iwatsukuwake. His father was a fourth generation descendant of Emperor \u014cjin by his son, Prince Wakanuke no Futamata.\nGenealogy information is supplemented in \"Shaku Nihongi\" which quotes from the now lost text \"J\u014dg\u016bki\" (7th century). It says he was a son of Ushi no \u014ckimi (believed to be equivalent to Hikoushi no \u014ckimi), a grandson of Ohi no \u014ckimi, a great-grandson of Ohohoto no \u014ckimi (brother to Emperor Ingy\u014d's consort), a great-great-grandson of Prince Wakanuke no Futamata, and a great-great-great-grandson of Emperor \u014cjin.\nThe genealogical trees of the \"Nihon Shoki\" have been lost, and the accuracy of its account of events remains unknown. This uncertainty raises arguable doubts about this emperor's genealogy.\nAlthough genealogical information in the \"Shaku Nihongi\" leaves room for discussion, many scholars acknowledge the blood relationship with the Okinaga clan, a powerful local ruling family or the collateral line of the Imperial family-governed \u014cmi region (a part of present-day Shiga Prefecture). This family produced many empresses and consorts throughout history. According to the \"Nihon Shoki\", Ohohoto no \u014ckimi, the great-grandfather of Emperor Keitai, married into the Okinaga clan. Keitai's mother, Furihime, was from a local ruling family in Koshi (Echizen Province), so his mother brought him to her home after his father's death. Abundant traditions relating to the family have been passed down by shrines and old-established families in both regions.\nRegardless of speculation about Keitai's genealogy, it is well settled that there was an extended period of disputes over the succession which developed after Keitai's death. A confrontation arose between adherents of two branches of the Yamato, pitting the supporters of sons who would become known as Emperor Ankan and Emperor Senka against those who were backers of the son who would become known as Emperor Kinmei.\nKeitai's reign.\nKeitai declared his ascension in Kuzuha, in the northern part of Kawachi Province (present day Hirakata, Osaka), and married a younger sister of Emperor Buretsu, Princess Tashiraka. It is supposed that his succession was not welcomed by everyone, and it took about 20 years for Keitai to enter Yamato Province, near Kawachi and the political center of Japan at the time.\nIn Keitai's later years, 527 or 528, the Iwai Rebellion broke out in Tsukushi province, Ky\u016bsh\u016b. Keitai assigned Mononobe no Arakabi as Sh\u014dgun and sent him to Ky\u016bsh\u016b to put down the rebellion.\nAmong his sons, Emperor Ankan, Emperor Senka and Emperor Kinmei ascended to the throne.\nThe actual site of Keitai's grave is not known.

As of February 17, 675 of the more than 1,000 required objections had been received.\nIn April 2018, four separate home owners split their property ownership among hundreds of trusts; these owners filed more than 5,000 formal objections to the historic district proposal, possibly blocking the nomination using a technical tactic. 952 additional objections were submitted by owners not associated with the hundreds of trusts. According to \"The Oregonian\", \"Without the trusts, the number of objections appears to have fallen short of a majority\". The neighborhood association's president described the maneuver as \"undemocratic\" and said, \"If this was an election, it would be called voter fraud.\" The Oregon State Historic Preservation Office said, \"According to federal rules, if more than 50% of the owners in a district submit objections, the property cannot be listed.\"\nTrust owners' being counted as eligible owners was challenged in court and a new rule for counting objections was established in 2022. A new application was submitted to the National Park Service. The Eastmoreland Historic District was added to the National Register on December 7, 2022.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Among his many accomplishments are the introduction and promotion of aseptic surgery and scientific methods in surgery, specifically reducing the mortality of thyroidectomies below 1% in his operations.\nKocher was the first Swiss citizen and first surgeon to ever receive a Nobel Prize in Medicine. He was considered a pioneer and leader in the field of surgery in his time.\nEarly life and personal life.\nChildhood.\nKocher's father was Jakob Alexander Kocher (1814\u20131893), the sixth of seven children to Samuel Kocher (1771\u20131842), a carpenter, and Barbara Sutter (1772\u20131849). Jakob Alexander Kocher was a railway engineer and he moved in 1845 to Burgdorf, Switzerland (near Bern), because of his job as regional engineer of Emmental (\"Bezirksingenieur\"). He was named chief engineer for street and water in the canton of Bern at the age of 34 years and he moved with his family to the capital, the city of Bern. In 1858 he left the states service and managed several engineering projects around Bern.\nTheodor Kocher's mother was Maria Kocher (n\u00e9e Wermuth) living from 1820 to 1900. She was a very religious woman and part of the Moravian Church; together with Jakob Alexander, she raised a family of five sons and one daughter (Theodor Kocher was the second son).\nTheodor Kocher was born on 25 August 1841 in Bern and baptized in the local Bern Minster on 16 September 1841. Together with the family, he moved to Burgdorf in 1845 where he started school. Later his family moved back to Bern where he went to middle and high school (\"Realschule\" and \"Literaturgymnasium\") where he was the first of his class. During high school, Theodor was interested in many subjects and was specifically drawn to art and classical philology but finally decided to become a doctor.\nStudies.\nHe started his studies after obtaining the Swiss Matura in 1858 at the University of Bern where Anton Biermer and Hermann Askan Demme were teaching, two professors that impressed him most. He was a studious and dedicated student but still became a member of the Schweizerischer Zofingerverein, a Swiss fraternity.\nHe obtained his doctorate in Bern in 1865 (March 1865) or 1866 with his dissertation about \"Behandlung der croup\u00f6sen Pneumonie mit Veratrum-Pr\u00e4paraten\" (literal English translation: \"The treatment of croupous pneumonia with Veratrum preparations.\") under professor Biermer with the predicate \"summa cum laude unamimiter\".\nIn spring 1865, Kocher followed his teacher Biermer to Z\u00fcrich, where Theodor Billroth was director of the hospital and influenced Kocher significantly. Kocher then proceeded to start a journey through Europe to meet several of the most famous surgeons of the time. It is not clear how Kocher financed his trip but according to Bonjour (1981) he received money from an unknown female Suisse romande philanthropist who also supported his friend Marc Dufour and was probably a member of the Moravian Church. In October 1865, he traveled to Berlin, passing through Leipzig and visiting an old friend from high school, Hans Blum. In Berlin, he studied under Bernhard von Langenbeck and applied for an assistant position with Langenbeck and Rudolf Virchow. Since there was no position available, in April 1867 Kocher moved on to London where he first met Jonathan Hutchinson and then worked for Henry Thompson and John Erichsen. Furthermore, he was interested in the work of Isaac Baker Brown and Thomas Spencer Wells, who also invited Kocher to go to the opera with his family. In July 1867, he traveled on to Paris to meet Auguste N\u00e9laton, Auguste Verneuil and Louis Pasteur. During his travels, he did not only learn novel techniques but also got to know leading surgeons in person and learned to speak English fluently which allowed him later on to follow the scientific progress in the English speaking world with ease.\nOnce returned to Bern, Kocher prepared for his habilitation and on 12 October 1867, he wrote a petition to the ministry of education to award him the \"venia docendi\" (Latin: \"to instruct\") which was granted to him. He became assistant to Georg L\u00fccke who left Bern in 1872 to become professor in Strasbourg. Kocher was hoping to get his position, but at the time it was customary to appoint German professors to positions at Swiss universities. Accordingly, the faculty suggested Franz K\u00f6nig before Kocher to follow L\u00fccke. However, the students and assistants as well as many doctors preferred Kocher and started a petition to the Bernese government to choose Kocher. Also the press was in favor of Kocher and several famous foreign surgeons, such as Langenbeck from Berlin and Billroth from Vienna, wrote letters in support of Kocher. Under this public pressure, the Bernese government (\"Regierungsrat\") chose Kocher as the successor of L\u00fccke as Ordinary Professor of Surgery and Director of the University Surgical Clinic at the \"Inselspital\" on 16 March 1872, despite a different proposal by the faculty.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1869, Kocher married Marie Witschi-Courant (1841\u20131921) or (1850\u20131925). She was the daughter of Johannes Witschi, who was a merchant, and she had three sons together with Kocher. The Kochers first lived at the Marktgasse in Bern and moved in 1875 to a bigger house in the Villette. The house became a place for friends, colleagues and guests to gather and many patients from Kocher's clinic were invited to dine at the Villette.\nLike his mother, Kocher was a deeply religious man and also part of the Moravian Church. This was an uncommon trait that not many colleagues and co-workers shared and until his death, Kocher attributed all his successes and failures to God. He thought that the rise of materialism (especially in science) was a great evil, and he attributed the outbreak of the First World War.\nKocher was involved in the education of his three sons and played tennis with them and went horseback riding with them. The eldest son Albert (1872\u20131941) would follow him to the surgical clinic in Bern and become Assistant Professor of Surgery.\nOn the evening of 23 July 1917, he was called into the Inselspital for an emergency. Kocher executed the surgery but afterwards felt unwell and went to bed, working on scientific notes. He then fell unconscious and died on 27 July 1917.\nCareer.\nThe call for an ordinary professorship at the University of Bern at the age of 30 was the first big career step for Theodor Kocher. In the 45 years he served as professor at the university, he oversaw the re-building of the famous Bernese Inselspital, published 249 scholarly articles and books, trained numerous medical doctors and treated thousands of patients. He made major contributions to the fields of applied surgery, neurosurgery and, especially, thyroid surgery and endocrinology. For his work he received, among other honors, the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. According to Asher, the field of surgery has transformed radically during the time of Theodore Kocher and later generations will build on the foundations created by Kocher \u2013 if a future historian wanted to describe the state of surgery at the beginning of the 20th century, he only need mention Kocher's \"Text-Book of Operative Surgery\". \nThree main factors contributed to Kocher's success as a surgeon, according to Bonjour (1981). The first factor was his consequent implementation of antiseptic wound treatment which prevented infection and later death of the patients. The second factor, according to Erich Hintzsche, was his monitoring of the anesthesia where he used special masks and later used local anesthesia for goitre surgery which decreased or removed the dangers of anesthesia. As a third factor, Hintzsche mentions the minimal blood loss which Kocher achieved. Even the smallest source of blood during surgery was precisely controlled and inhibited by Kocher, initially because he thought that decomposing blood would constitute an infection risk for the patient. \nEarly career.\nKocher first attained international recognition with his method to reset a dislocated shoulder published in 1870. The new procedure was much less painful and safer than the traditionally used procedure and could be performed by a single physician. Kocher developed the procedure through his knowledge of anatomy. In the same period, Kocher also studied the phenomena of bullet wounds and how they can cause bone fractures. From these studies resulted one public lecture in 1874 \"Die Verbesserung der Geschosse vom Standpunkt der Humanitaet\" (English: \"The improvement of the bullets from the standpoint of humanity.\") and an 1875 manuscript \"Ueber die Sprengwirkung der modernen Kriegsgewehrgeschosse\" (English: \"Over the explosive effect of modern war rifle bullets.\") He showed that small caliber bullets were less harmful and recommended to use bullets with slower speed.\nRelocation of Inselspital and call to Prague.\nAs soon as Kocher became professor, he wanted to modernize the practices at the Bernese Inselspital. He noticed that the old building did not suffice the modern standards and was too small \u2013 half of the patients seeking medical attention had to be turned away. In spring 1878, he visited several institutions around Europe to evaluate novel innovations for hospitals and implement them if possible in Bern. He wrote down his observations in a lengthy report for the Bernese government, giving instructions even for architectonic details. In a speech on 15 November 1878, he informed the general public about the pressing needs of a new hospital building. Finally, he used his call to Prague to pressure the government: He would only stay in Bern if he was either granted 75 beds in the new building or would get money to increase his facilities in the old building. Finally, in the winter of 1884/1885 the new building was finished and the Inselspital could be moved.\nAt the time, Prague had the third largest university clinic in the German speaking world and it was a great honor for Kocher when he received a call as a professor to Prague in spring 1880. Many colleagues, especially international ones, urged Kocher to accept while Bernese doctors and colleagues begged him to stay. Kocher used this call, to demand certain improvements for the university clinic from the Bernese government. They accepted all his demands, the government promised him to begin building the new Inselspital building the next year, increased his credit for surgical equipment and books to 1000 franks and increased the number of beds for Kocher in the new Inselspital. Thus, Kocher decided to stay and many Bernese and Swiss students and professionals thanked him for it. He cited the affection of his students as one of his main reasons for staying. The university students organized a torchlight procession on 8 June 1880 in his honor.\nAseptic surgery.\nIt is unclear whether Kocher directly knew Joseph Lister, who pioneered the antiseptic (using chemical means to kill bacteria) method, but Kocher was in correspondence with him. Kocher had recognized the importance of aseptic techniques early on, introducing them to his peers at a time when this was considered revolutionary. In a hospital report from 1868, he attributed the lower mortality directly to the \"antiseptic Lister's wound bandaging method\" and he could later as director of the clinic order strict adherence to the antiseptic method. Bonjour (1981) describes how his assistants were worried about wound infection for fear of having to explain their failure to Kocher himself. Kocher made it a matter of principle to investigate the cause of every wound infection and remove every potential source of infection, he also banned visitors from his surgeries for this reason.\nHe published multiple works on aseptic treatment and surgery.\nContributions to Neurosurgery.\nKocher also contributed significantly to the field of neurology and neurosurgery. In this area, his research was pioneering and covered the areas of concussion, neurosurgery and intracranial pressure (ICP). Furthermore, he investigated the surgical treatment of epilepsy and spinal and cranial trauma. He found that in some cases, the epilepsy patients had a brain tumor which could be surgically removed. He hypothesized that epilepsy was caused by an increase in ICP and believed that drainage of cerebrospinal fluid could cure epilepsy.\nThe Japanese surgeon Hayazo Ito came to Bern in 1896 in order to perform experimental research on epilepsy. Kocher was especially interested in the ICP during experimentally induced epilepsy and after Ito returned to Japan, he performed over 100 surgeries in epilepsy patients.\nThe American surgeon Harvey Cushing spent several months in the lab of Kocher in 1900, performing cerebral surgery and first encountering the Cushing reflex which describes the relationship between blood pressure and intracranial pressure. Kocher later also found that decompressive craniectomy was an effective method to lower ICP.\nIn his surgery textbook \"Chirurgische Operationslehre\", Kocher dedicated 141 pages of 1060 pages to surgery of the nervous system. It included methods of exploration and decompression of the brain.\nContributions to Thyroid surgery.\nThyroid surgery, which was mostly performed as treatment of goitre with a complete thyroidectomy when possible, was considered a risky procedure when Kocher started his work. Some estimates put the mortality of thyroidectomy as high as 75% in 1872. Indeed, the operation was believed to be one of the most dangerous operations and in France it was prohibited by the Academy of Medicine at the time. Through application of modern surgical methods, such as antiseptic wound treatment and minimizing blood loss, and the famous slow and precise style of Kocher, he managed to reduce the mortality of this operation from an already low 18% (compared to contemporary standards) to less than 0.5% by 1912. By then, Kocher had performed over 5000 thyroid excisions. The success of Kocher's methods, especially when compared to operations performed by Theodor Billroth who was also performing thyroidectomies at that time, was described by William Stewart Halsted as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have pondered the question for many years and conclude that the explanation probably lies in the operative methods of the two illustrious surgeons. Kocher, neat and precise, operating in a relatively bloodless manner, scrupulously removed the entire thyroid gland doing little damage outside its capsule. Billroth, operating more rapidly and, as I recall, with less regard for the tissues and less concern for hemorrhage, might easily have removed the parathyroids or at least have interfered with their blood supply, and have left fragments of the thyroid.\u2014\u200a\nKocher and others later discovered that the complete removal of the thyroid could lead to cretinism (termed \"cachexia strumipriva\" by Kocher) caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormones. The phenomena was reported to Kocher first in 1874 by the general practitioner August Fetscherin and later in 1882 by Jacques-Louis Reverdin together with his assistant Auguste Reverdin (1848\u20131908). Reverdin met Kocher on 7 September in Geneva at the international hygienic congress (\"internationaler Hygienekongress\") and expressed his concerns about complete removal of the thyroid to Kocher. Kocher then tried to contact 77 of his 102 former patients and found signs of a physical and mental decay in those cases where he had removed the thyroid gland completely. Ironically, it was his precise surgery that allowed Kocher to remove the thyroid gland almost completely and led to the severe side effects of cretinism.\nKocher came to the conclusion that a complete removal of the thyroid (as it was common to perform at the time because the function of the thyroid was not yet clear) was not advisable, a finding that he made public on 4 April 1883 in a lecture to the German Society of Surgery and also published in 1883 under the title \"Ueber Kropfexstirpation und ihre Folgen\" (English: \"About Thyroidectomies and their consequences\"). Reverdin had already made his findings public on 13 September 1882 and published further articles on this topic in 1883; yet still Kocher never acknowledged Reverdin's priority in this discovery. At the time, the reactions to Kocher's lecture were mixed, some people asserted that goitre and cretinism were different stages of same disease and that cretinism would have occurred independently of the removal of the thyroid in the cases which Kocher described. In the long run however, these observations contributed to a more complete understanding of thyroid function and were one of the early hints of a connection between the thyroid and congenital cretinism. These findings finally enabled thyroid hormone replacement therapies for a variety of thyroid related diseases.\nFurther contributions to science.\nKocher published works on a number of subjects other than the thyroid gland, including hemostasis, antiseptic treatments, surgical infectious diseases, on gunshot wounds, acute osteomyelitis, the theory of strangulated hernia, and abdominal surgery. The Nobel Prize money he received helped him establish the Kocher Institute in Bern. \nA number of instruments (for example the craniometer) and surgical techniques (for example, the Kocher manoeuvre, and kocher incision) are named after him, as well as the Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome. The Kocher manoeuvre is still a standard practice in orthopaedics. Kocher is also credited for the invention in 1882 of the Kocher's Surgical Clamp, which he used to prevent blood loss during surgery.\nOne of his main works, \"Chirurgische Operationslehre\" (Text-Book of Operative Surgery ), was published through six editions and translated into many languages.\nDuring his life, Kocher published 249 articles and books and supervised more than 130 doctoral candidates. He was rector of the university in 1878 and 1903. He was president of the Bernese and the Swiss physicians association and co-founded the Swiss society for surgery in 1913 and became its first president.\nIn 1904 or 1905 he built a private clinic called \"Ulmenhof\" which had space for 25 patients. Here Kocher catered to the wealthier patients, which in many cases were international. He also treated the wife of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya and operated on her in Bern (in 1913).\nLegacy.\nKocher was also a famous and loved teacher. During nearly 100 semesters he taught his knowledge to about 10 000 students of the University of Bern. He was able to inspire students and taught them to think clearly and logically. Specifically, Kocher also taught a generation of Jewish-Russian students who could not study in Russia. This association with Russia has also led the Russian Geographical Society to name a volcano after him (in the area of Ujun-Choldongi in Manchuria).\nAmong his many local and international students were\nCarl Arend (Bern),\nOscar Bernhard (St. Moritz), \nAndrea Crotti (Ohio),\nGustave Dardel (Bern),\nCarl Garr\u00e9 (Bonn),\nGottlieb and Max Feurer (St. Gallen),\nAnton Fonio (Langnau), \nWalter Gr\u00f6bly (Arbon),\nCarl Kaufmann (Z\u00fcrich),\nAlbert Kocher (Bern),\nJoseph Kopp (Luzern),\nErnst Kummer (Geneva),\nOtto Lanz (Amsterdam), \nEdmond Lardy (Geneva) \nJakob Lauper (Interlaken),\nAlbert L\u00fcthi (Thun),\nHermann Matti (Bern),\nCharles Pettavel (Neuenburg),\nPaul Pf\u00e4hler (Olten),\nFritz de Quervain (La Chaux de Fonds / Basel / Bern),\nAugust Rickli (Langenthal),\nErnst Rieben (Interlaken),\nAugust Rollier (Leysin), \nC\u00e9sar Roux (Lausanne),\nKarl Schuler (Rorschach), \nFritz Steinmann (Bern),\nAlbert Vogel (Luzern),\nHans Wildbolz (Bern) as well as \nthe American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing. Other notable students of his include Hayazo Ito (1865\u20131929) and S. Berezowsky which also spread his techniques in their respective home-countries (Japan and Russia).\nKocher's name is living on with the Theodor Kocher Institute, the Kochergasse and the Kocher Park in Bern. In the Inselspital, there is a bust of Kocher, created by in 1927. In the Kocher Park there is another bust, created by .\nIn 1950, the Swiss historian Edgar Bonjour (1898\u20131991) who was married to Dora Kocher wrote a 136-page monograph on Kocher's life that was extended again in 1981.\nWorks.\nDuring his life, Kocher published 249 articles and books and supervised more than 130 doctoral candidates. The following is an incomplete list of his most important works:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century. In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques.\nThe eight queens puzzle is a special case of the more general \"n\" queens problem of placing \"n\" non-attacking queens on an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" chessboard. Solutions exist for all natural numbers \"n\" with the exception of \"n\" = 2 and \"n\" = 3. Although the exact number of solutions is only known for \"n\" \u2264 27, the asymptotic growth rate of the number of solutions is approximately (0.143 \"n\")\"n\".\nHistory.\nChess composer Max Bezzel published the eight queens puzzle in 1848. Franz Nauck published the first solutions in 1850. Nauck also extended the puzzle to the \"n\" queens problem, with \"n\" queens on a chessboard of \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" squares.\nSince then, many mathematicians, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, have worked on both the eight queens puzzle and its generalized \"n\"-queens version. In 1874, S. G\u00fcnther proposed a method using determinants to find solutions. J.W.L. Glaisher refined Gunther's approach.\nIn 1972, Edsger Dijkstra used this problem to illustrate the power of what he called structured programming. He published a highly detailed description of a depth-first backtracking algorithm.\nConstructing and counting solutions when \"n\" = 8.\nThe problem of finding all solutions to the 8-queens problem can be quite computationally expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8\u00d78 board, but only 92 solutions. It is possible to use shortcuts that reduce computational requirements or rules of thumb that avoids brute-force computational techniques. For example, by applying a simple rule that chooses one queen from each column, it is possible to reduce the number of possibilities to 16,777,216 (that is, 88) possible combinations. Generating permutations further reduces the possibilities to just 40,320 (that is, 8!), which can then be checked for diagonal attacks.\nThe eight queens puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. If solutions that differ only by the symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of the board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 solutions. These are called \"fundamental\" solutions; representatives of each are shown below.\nA fundamental solution usually has eight variants (including its original form) obtained by rotating 90, 180, or 270\u00b0 and then reflecting each of the four rotational variants in a mirror in a fixed position. However, one of the 12 fundamental solutions (solution 12 below) is identical to its own 180\u00b0 rotation, so has only four variants (itself and its reflection, its 90\u00b0 rotation and the reflection of that). Thus, the total number of distinct solutions is 11\u00d78 + 1\u00d74 = 92.\nAll fundamental solutions are presented below:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSolution 10 has the additional property that no three queens are in a straight line.\nExistence of solutions.\nBrute-force algorithms to count the number of solutions are computationally manageable for \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a08, but would be intractable for problems of \"n\"\u00a0\u2265\u00a020, as 20! = 2.433 \u00d7 1018. If the goal is to find a single solution, one can show solutions exist for all \"n\" \u2265 4 with no search whatsoever.\nThese solutions exhibit stair-stepped patterns, as in the following examples for \"n\" = 8, 9 and 10:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe examples above can be obtained with the following formulas. Let (\"i\", \"j\") be the square in column \"i\" and row \"j\" on the \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" chessboard, \"k\" an integer.\nOne approach is\nFor \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a08 this results in fundamental solution 1 above. A few more examples follow.\nCounting solutions for other sizes \"n\".\nExact enumeration.\nThere is no known formula for the exact number of solutions for placing \"n\" queens on an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" board i.e. the number of independent sets of size \"n\" in an \"n\" \u00d7 \"n\" queen's graph. The 27\u00d727 board is the highest-order board that has been completely enumerated. The following tables give the number of solutions to the \"n\" queens problem, both fundamental (sequence in the OEIS) and all (sequence in the OEIS), for all known cases.\nThe number of placements in which furthermore no three queens lie on any straight line is known for formula_1 (sequence in the OEIS).\nAsymptotic enumeration.\nIn 2021, Michael Simkin proved that for large numbers \"n\", the number of solutions of the \"n\" queens problem is approximately formula_2. More precisely, the number formula_3 of solutions has asymptotic growth\nformula_4\nwhere formula_5 is a constant that lies between 1.939 and 1.945. (Here \"o\"(1) represents little o notation.)\nIf one instead considers a toroidal chessboard (where diagonals \"wrap around\" from the top edge to the bottom and from the left edge to the right), it is only possible to place \"n\" queens on an formula_6 board if formula_7 In this case, the asymptotic number of solutions is\nformula_8\nFind the number of non-attacking queens that can be placed in a \"d\"-dimensional chess &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;space&lt;/dfn&gt; of size \"n\". More than \"n\" queens can be placed in some higher dimensions (the smallest example is four non-attacking queens in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 chess space), and it is in fact known that for any \"k\", there are higher dimensions where \"n\"\"k\" queens do not suffice to attack all spaces.\nOn an 8\u00d78 board one can place 32 knights, or 14 bishops, 16 kings or 8 rooks, so that no two pieces attack each other. In the case of knights, an easy solution is to place one on each square of a given color, since they move only to the opposite color. The solution is also easy for rooks and kings. Sixteen kings can be placed on the board by dividing it into 2-by-2 squares and placing the kings at equivalent points on each square. Placements of \"n\" rooks on an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" board are in direct correspondence with order-\"n\" permutation matrices.\nRelated problems can be asked for chess variations such as shogi. For instance, the \"n\"+\"k\" dragon kings problem asks to place \"k\" shogi pawns and \"n\"+\"k\" mutually nonattacking dragon kings on an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" shogi board.\nP\u00f3lya studied the \"n\" queens problem on a toroidal (\"donut-shaped\") board and showed that there is a solution on an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" board if and only if \"n\" is not divisible by 2 or 3.\nGiven an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" board, the domination number is the minimum number of queens (or other pieces) needed to attack or occupy every square. For \"n\" = 8 the queen's domination number is 5.\nVariants include mixing queens with other pieces; for example, placing \"m\" queens and \"m\" knights on an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" board so that no piece attacks another or placing queens and pawns so that no two queens attack each other.\nIn 1992, Demir\u00f6rs, Rafraf, and Tanik published a method for converting some magic squares into \"n\"-queens solutions, and vice versa.\nIn an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" matrix, place each digit 1 through \"n\" in \"n\" locations in the matrix so that no two instances of the same digit are in the same row or column.\nConsider a matrix with one primary column for each of the \"n\" ranks of the board, one primary column for each of the \"n\" files, and one secondary column for each of the 4\"n\" \u2212 6 nontrivial diagonals of the board. The matrix has \"n\"2 rows: one for each possible queen placement, and each row has a 1 in the columns corresponding to that square's rank, file, and diagonals and a 0 in all the other columns. Then the \"n\" queens problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of the rows of this matrix such that every primary column has a 1 in precisely one of the chosen rows and every secondary column has a 1 in at most one of the chosen rows; this is an example of a generalized exact cover problem, of which sudoku is another example.\nThe completion problem asks whether, given an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" chessboard on which some queens are already placed, it is possible to place a queen in every remaining row so that no two queens attack each other. This and related questions are NP-complete and #P-complete. Any placement of at most \"n\"/60 queens can be completed, while there are partial configurations of roughly \"n\"/4 queens that cannot be completed.\nExercise in algorithm design.\nFinding all solutions to the eight queens puzzle is a good example of a simple but nontrivial problem. For this reason, it is often used as an example problem for various programming techniques, including nontraditional approaches such as constraint programming, logic programming or genetic algorithms. Most often, it is used as an example of a problem that can be solved with a recursive algorithm, by phrasing the \"n\" queens problem inductively in terms of adding a single queen to any solution to the problem of placing \"n\"\u22121 queens on an \"n\"\u00d7\"n\" chessboard. The induction bottoms out with the solution to the 'problem' of placing 0 queens on the chessboard, which is the empty chessboard. This process can be made more efficient by applying the observation that each column of the chessboard must contain exactly one queen, and restricting the positions at which the algorithm tries adding the \"i\"th queen to the \"i\"th row of the chessboard, in columns that are not already attacked by other queens. These choices significantly reduce the number of placements that need to be tried, allowing the algorithm to find all solutions on an formula_9 chessboard in a time so short as to appear instantaneous.\nAn alternative to exhaustive search is an 'iterative repair' algorithm, which typically starts with all queens on the board, for example with one queen per column. It then counts the number of conflicts (attacks), and uses a heuristic to determine how to improve the placement of the queens. The 'minimum-conflicts' heuristic \u2013 moving the piece with the largest number of conflicts to the square in the same column where the number of conflicts is smallest \u2013 is particularly effective: it easily finds a solution to even the 1,000,000 queens problem.\nUnlike the backtracking search outlined above, iterative repair does not guarantee a solution: like all greedy procedures, it may get stuck on a local optimum. (In such a case, the algorithm may be restarted with a different initial configuration.) On the other hand, it can solve problem sizes that are several orders of magnitude beyond the scope of a depth-first search.\nAs an alternative to backtracking, solutions can be counted by recursively enumerating valid partial solutions, one row at a time. Rather than constructing entire board positions, blocked diagonals and columns are tracked with bitwise operations. This does not allow the recovery of individual solutions.\nSample program.\nThe following program is a translation of Niklaus Wirth's solution into the Python programming language, but does without the index arithmetic found in the original and instead uses lists to keep the program code as simple as possible. By using a coroutine in the form of a generator function, both versions of the original can be unified to compute either one or all of the solutions. Only 15,720 possible queen placements are examined.\ndef queens(n: int, i: int, a: list, b: list, c: list):\n if i &lt; n:\n for j in range(n):\n if j not in a and i + j not in b and i - j not in c:\n yield from queens(n, i + 1, a + [j], b + [i + j], c + [i - j])\n else:\n yield a\nfor solution in queens(8, 0, [], [], []):\n print(solution)\nThe following program is an implementation of Donald Knuth's informal description of the solution on Page 31, Section 7.2.2 \"Backtrack Programming\" from The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4B into the Python programming language.\ndef property(perm: list) -&gt; bool:\n for k in range(0, len(perm)):\n for j in range(0, len(perm)):\n if j &lt; k:\n if perm[k] == perm[j]:\n return False\n elif abs(perm[k] - perm[j]) == k - j:\n return False\n return True\ndef extend(perm: list, n: int):\n new_perm = []\n for p in perm:\n for i in range(0, n):\n new_perm.append(p + [i])\n return new_perm\ndef n_queens(n: int) -&gt; int:\n domain = list(range(0, n))\n perm = \n for i in range(n):\n new_perm = list(filter(property, extend(perm, n)))\n perm = new_perm\n return len(perm)\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bombieri is currently professor emeritus in the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Bombieri won the Fields Medal in 1974 for his work on the large sieve and its application to the distribution of prime numbers.\nCareer.\nBombieri published his first mathematical paper in 1957, when he was 16 years old. In 1963, at age 22, he earned his first degree (Laurea) in mathematics from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano under the supervision of Giovanni Ricci and then studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, with Harold Davenport.\nBombieri was an assistant professor (1963\u20131965) and then a full professor (1965\u20131966) at the Universit\u00e0 di Cagliari, at the Universit\u00e0 di Pisa in 1966\u20131974, and then at the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in 1974\u20131977. From Pisa, he emigrated in 1977 to the United States, where he became a professor at the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 2011, he became professor emeritus.\nBombieri is also known for his \"pro bono\" service on behalf of the mathematics profession, e.g. for serving on external review boards and for peer-reviewing extraordinarily complicated manuscripts (like the paper of Per Enflo on the invariant subspace problem).\nResearch.\nThe Bombieri\u2013Vinogradov theorem is one of the major applications of the large sieve method. It improves Dirichlet's theorem on prime numbers in arithmetic progressions, by showing that by averaging over the modulus over a range, the mean error is much less than can be proved in a given case. This result can sometimes substitute for the still-unproved generalized Riemann hypothesis.\nIn 1969, Bombieri, De Giorgi, and Giusti solved Bernstein's problem on minimal surfaces in dimensions above eight.\nIn 1976, Bombieri developed the technique known as the \"asymptotic sieve\". In 1980, he supplied the completion of the proof of the uniqueness of finite groups of Ree type in characteristic 3; at the time of its publication, it was one of the missing steps in the classification of finite simple groups.\nAwards.\nBombieri's research in number theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical analysis has earned him many international prizes \u2014 a Fields Medal in 1974 and the Balzan Prize in 1980. He was a plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians, which took place in 1974 in Vancouver.

{"id": "10477", "revid": "50955889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10477", "title": "Eos", "text": "Greek goddess of the dawn\nIn ancient Greek mythology and religion, Eos (; Ionic and Homeric Greek \"\u0112\u1e53s\", Attic \"H\u00e9\u014ds\", \"dawn\", or ; Aeolic \"A\u00fa\u014ds\", Doric \"\u0100\u1e53s\") is the goddess and personification of the dawn, who rose each morning from her home at the edge of the river Oceanus to deliver light and disperse the night. In Greek tradition and poetry, she is characterized as a goddess with a great sexual appetite, who took numerous human lovers for her own satisfaction and bore them several children. Like her Roman counterpart Aurora and Rigvedic Ushas, Eos continues the name of an earlier Indo-European dawn goddess, Hausos. Eos, or her earlier Proto-Indo-European (PIE) ancestor, also shares several elements with the love goddess Aphrodite, perhaps signifying Eos's influence on her or otherwise a common origin for the two goddesses. In surviving tradition, Aphrodite is the culprit behind Eos's numerous love affairs, having cursed the goddess with insatiable lust for mortal men.\nIn Greek literature, Eos is presented as a daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, the sister of the sun god Helios and the moon goddess Selene. In rarer traditions, she is the daughter of the Titan Pallas. Each day she drives her two-horse chariot, heralding the breaking of the new day and her brother's arrival. Thus, her most common epithet of the goddess in the Homeric epics is Rhododactylos, or \"rosy-fingered\", a reference to the sky's colours at dawn, and Erigeneia, \"early-born\". Although primarily associated with the dawn and early morning, sometimes Eos would accompany Helios for the entire duration of his journey, and thus she is even seen during dusk.\nEos fell in love with mortal men several times, and would abduct them in similar manner to how male gods did mortal women. Her most notable mortal lover is the Trojan prince Tithonus, for whom she ensured the gift of immortality, but not eternal youth, leading to him aging without dying for an eternity. In another story, she carried off the Athenian Cephalus against his will, but eventually let him go for he ardently wished to be returned to his wife, though not before she denigrated her to him, leading to the couple parting ways. Several other lovers and romances with both mortal men and gods were attributed to the goddess by various poets throughout the centuries.\nEos figures in many works of ancient literature and poetry, but despite her Proto-Indo-European origins, there is little evidence of Eos having received any cult or being the centre of worship during classical times.\nEtymology.\nThe Proto-Greek form of \"\u1f28\u03ce\u03c2\" / \"\u0112\u1e53s\" has been reconstructed as \"*\u1f00\u03c5h\u03ce\u03c2 / auh\u1e53s\". It is cognate to the Vedic goddess \"Ushas\", Lithuanian goddess \"Au\u0161rin\u0117\", and Roman goddess \"Aurora\" (Old Latin \"Ausosa\"), all three of whom are also goddesses of the dawn. Meissner (2006) suggested an \"\u00e1ww\u0254\u0304s\" &gt; /a\u1e77w\u0254\u0304s/ &gt; lengthening for Aeolic and */a\u1e77w\u0254\u0304s/ &gt; \"*\u0101w\u0254\u0304s\" &gt; \"*\u01e3w\u0254\u0304s\" &gt; /\u01e3\u0254\u0304s/ for Attic-Ionic Greek.\nIn Greek dialects.\nIn Mycenaean Greek her name is also attested in the form in Linear B, \"a-wo-i-jo\" (\"\u0100w(\u02b0)o\u02b0ios\"; \u1f08\u03ddoh\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), found in a tablet from Pylos; it has been interpreted as a shepherd's personal name related to \"dawn\", or dative form \"\u0100w\u014di\u014di\".\nFormer proposals.\nHeinrich Wilhelm Stoll offered a different (now rejected) etymology for \"\", linking it to the verb , meaning \"to blow\", \"to breathe.\"\nLycophron calls her by an archaic name, \"Tito\", meaning \"day\" and perhaps etymologically linked to \"Titan\". Karl Kerenyi observes that Tito shares a linguistic origin with Eos's lover Tithonus, which belonged to an older, pre-Greek language.\nOrigins.\nProto-Indo-European dawn goddess.\nAll four of the aforementioned goddesses sharing a linguistic connection with Eos are considered derivatives of the Proto-Indo-European stem \"*h\u2082ews\u1e53s\" (later \"*Aus\u1e53s\"), \"dawn\". The root also gave rise to Proto-Germanic \"*Austr\u014d\", Old High German \"*\u014cstara\" and Old English \"\u0112ostre / \u0112astre\". These and other cognates led to the reconstruction of a Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess, \"*h\u2082\u00e9ws\u014ds\".\nIn the Greek pantheon, Eos, Helios and Zeus are the three gods that are of impeccable Indo-European lineage in both etymology and status, although the former two were sidelined in the pantheon by non-PIE newcomers. A common epithet associated with this dawn goddess is *\"Diw\u00f3s Dhu\u01f5h2t\u1e17r\", the 'Daughter of Dy\u0113us', the sky god. In Homeric tradition however, Eos is never stated to be the daughter of Zeus (, ), as she is instead the daughter of the Titan Hyperion, who plays little role in mythology or religion. Rather, a commonly occurring epithet of hers is , \"d\u00eea\", meaning \"divine\", from earlier \"*d\u00edw-ya\", which would have translated into \"belonging to Zeus\" or \"heavenly\".\nEos's characterization as a lovestruck, sexual being who took many lovers is directly inherited from her PIE precursor. A common and widespread theme among Hausos's descendants is their reluctance to bring the light of the new day. Eos (and Aurora) is sometimes seen as unwilling to leave her bed in the morning, while U\u1e63as is punished by Indra for attempting to forestall the day, and the Latvian Auseklis was said to be locked up in a golden chamber so she could not always rise in the morning.\nThis Indo-European goddess of the dawn was often conflated and equated with Hemera, the goddess of the day and daylight. Eos might have also played a role in Proto-Indo-European poetry.\nConnection to Aphrodite.\nEos also shares some characteristics with the love goddess Aphrodite connoting perhaps a semi-shared origin or influence of Eos/\"*Ha\u00e9us\u014ds\" on Aphrodite, who otherwise has a Near Eastern origin; both goddesses were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality, both had relationships with mortal lovers, and both were associated with the colors red, white, and gold. Michael Janda etymologizes Aphrodite's name as an epithet of Eos meaning \"she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]\" and points to Hesiod's \"Theogony\" account of Aphrodite's birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth. On the other hand, however, it is generally accepted that Aphrodite's name etymology is Semitic in origin, and its exact meaning and derivation cannot be determined. Evidence is also provided by an Italic red-figure krater in which Aphrodite is shown holding a mirror beneath a solar disc while the Theban hero Cadmus slays the dragon, with a female figure nearly identical to Aphrodite being depicted on another krater labelled \"\", or \"A\u1e53s\", the dawn; this shows that although Aphrodite is assimilated to Astarte/Inanna, in Greek artistic tradition she is sometimes presented in a similar matter to Eos.\nLike Eos, no tales of men assaulting Aphrodite exist, but there are many where she abducts mortal men reversing the traditional theme of gods and men pursuing maidens, in the same fashion as Eos. Not only does Aphrodite abduct or seduce mortal men as Eos does, but even cites Eos's own adventures with Tithonus when she seduces Anchises. The two goddesses are presented as both maleficent and beneficent abductors, as they confer both death (maleficent) and preservation (beneficent) to their mortal lovers. The two goddesses exist almost side by side in the myth of Phaethon of Syria, with Eos as his mother and Aphrodite as his lover and abductor. Moreover, another telling point is how the name \u201cAoos\u201d is recorded as both a name for Adonis, Aphrodite's East-originating lover, and a son of Eos by Cephalus (like Phaethon) who became king of Cyprus, an island that was regarded as Aphrodite's birthplace. This suggest a mixture of Mycenaean and Phoenician religions on the island; it is possible that Aoos was originally a generic name used for Eos's son or lover, which was then attached to Aphrodite in the form of a consort of the same name as she developed from Eos.\nDescription.\nEos is usually described with rosy fingers or rosy forearms as she opened the gates of heaven for the Sun to rise: the singer in the \"Homeric Hymn to Helios\" calls her (ACC), \"rosy-armed\", as does Sappho, who also describes her as having golden arms and golden sandals; vases depict her rosy-fingered, with golden arms.\nShe is pictured on Attic vases as a beautiful woman, crowned with a tiara or diadem and with the large white-feathered wings of a bird. In Homer, her saffron-colored robe is embroidered or woven with flowers. Mesomedes of Crete used for her, \"she who has snow-white eyelids\", while Ovid described her as \"golden\". The delicate and fragile beauty of her appearance seems to be in total contrast with the carnal nature that was often attributed to her in myth and literature.\nFamily.\nParents.\nAccording to Greek cosmogony, Eos is the daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia: Hyperion, a bringer of light, the \"One Above, Who Travels High Above the Earth\" and Theia, \"The Divine,\" also called Euryphaessa, \"wide-shining\" and Aethra, \"bright sky\". Eos is the sister of Helios, the god of the sun, and Selene, the goddess of the moon, \"who shine upon all that are on earth and upon the deathless gods who live in the wide heaven\". Out of the four authors that give her and her siblings a birth order, two make her the oldest child, the other two the youngest. In some accounts, Eos's father was called Pallas, who is also confirmed to be the father of Eos's sister Selene in some rare traditions. Even though the two goddesses are still connected as sisters in the traditions going with lineage from Pallas, their brother Helios is never included with them in those versions, being consistently the son of Hyperion. Mesomedes made her the daughter of Helios, who is usually her brother, by an unnamed mother. Some authors made her the child of Nyx, the personification of the night, who is the mother of Hemera in the \"Theogony\".\nOffspring.\nEos married the Titan Astraeus (\"of the stars\") and became the mother of the Anemoi (\"winds\") namely Zephyrus, Boreas, Notus and Eurus; of the Morning Star, Eosphoros (Venus); of the stars; and of the virgin goddess of justice, Astraea (\"starry one\"). Her other notable offspring were Memnon and Emathion by the Trojan prince, Tithonus. Sometimes, Hesperus, Phaethon and Tithonus (different from her lover), were said to be the children of Eos by Prince Cephalus of Athens.\nMythology.\nGoddess of the dawn.\nEach morning, the dawn goddess Eos gets up and opens the gates for her brother, Helios, to pass through and rise, ushering in the new day. Although often her job seems to be done once she announces Helios's coming, in the Homeric epics she accompanies him throughout the whole day, and does not leave him until the sunset; hence \"Eos\" might be used in texts where one would have expected to see \"Helios\" instead. In Musaeus's rendition of the story of Hero and Leander in the sixth century AD, Eos is mentioned during both sunrise and sunset.\nHomer and Hesiod.\nFrom the \"Iliad\":\nNow when Dawn in robe of saffron was hastening from the streams of Oceanus, to bring light to mortals and immortals, Thetis reached the ships with the armor that the god had given her.\nBut soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, then gathered the folk about the pyre of glorious Hector.\nShe is most often associated with her Homeric epithet \"rosy-fingered\" Eos Rhododactylos (), but Homer also calls her Eos Erigeneia:\nThat brightest of stars appeared, Eosphoros, that most often heralds the light of early-rising Dawn (Eos Erigeneia).\nNear the end of the \"Odyssey\", Athena, wanting to buy Odysseus some time with his wife Penelope after they have reunited with each other, orders Eos not to yoke her two horses, thus delaying the coming of the new day:\nAnd rose-fingered Dawn would have shone for the weepers had not bright-eyed goddess Athena thought of other things. She checked the long night in its passage, and further, held golden-throned Dawn over Ocean and didn't let her yoke her swift-footed horses, that bring daylight to men, Lampus and Phaethon, the colts that carry Dawn.\nIn the \"Theogony\", Hesiod wrote \"[a]nd after these Erigeneia [\"Early-born\"] bore the star Eosphoros (\"Dawn-bringer\"), and the gleaming stars with which heaven is crowned\". Thus Eos is preceded by the Morning Star, and is thus seen as the genetrix of all the stars and planets; her tears are considered to have created the morning dew, personified as Ersa or Herse, who is otherwise the daughter of her sister Selene by Zeus.\nOrphic literature.\nEos is addressed by the singer in one of the \"Orphic Hymns\", as the bringer of the new day:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHear, O goddess, you bring the light of day to mortals&lt;br&gt;\nresplendent Dawn, you blush throughout the world&lt;br&gt;\nmessenger of the great, the illustrious Titan.\nThe position of the hymn in the collection at number 78 is odd, far from the Hymns to the Night (3), the Sun (8) and the Moon (9), where it would be expected to be grouped. While many of the \"Orphic Hymns\" describe the divinities in terms on light, the hymn to Eos is the only one that calls upon the divinity to provide light to the initiates.\nDivine horses.\nEos's team of horses pull her chariot across the sky and are named in the \"Odyssey\" as \"Firebright\" and \"Daybright\". Quintus described her exulting in her heart over the radiant horses (Lampus and Pha\u00ebton) that drew her chariot, amidst the bright-haired Horae, the feminine Hours, the daughters of Zeus and Themis who are responsible for the changing of the seasons, climbing the arc of heaven and scattering sparks of fire.\nLovers.\nIn spite of the goddess already having a husband in the face of her first cousin Astraeus, Eos is presented as a goddess who fell in love several times. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus, it was the jealous Aphrodite who cursed her to be perpetually in love and have an insatiable sexual desire because Eos had once lain with Aphrodite's sweetheart Ares, the god of war. The curse caused her to abduct a number of handsome young men. This explanatory myth was the reason offered for Eos's ravenous sexual desires, as this pattern of behavior of hers was noticed by the ancient Greeks.\nIn the Odyssey, Calypso complains to Hermes about the male gods taking many mortal women as lovers, but not allowing goddesses to do the same. She brings up as example Eos's love for the hunter Orion, who was killed by Artemis on the island of Ortygia. Apollodorus also mentions Eos's love for Orion, and adds that she brought him to Delos, where he met Artemis and was subsequently slain by her. The good-looking Cleitus was snatched and made immortal by her.\nEos fell in love and abducted Cephalus, a son of Hermes, who is sometimes the same as or distinct from the Cephalus that was the husband of Procris, whom she also abducted. Some other versions suggest that Eos also was the abductor of Ganymede (mythology).\nTithonus.\nThe myth about the love of Eos and Tithonus is very old, known as early as Homer, who in the \"Odyssey\" described the coming of the new morning as Eos rising from the bed she shares with Tithonus to bring her light to the world. The earliest (and fullest) account survives in the \"Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite\", where Aphrodite herself narrates the story to her own lover Anchises. Additionally, the myth is also the subject of one of the very few substantially complete works of Sappho, pieced together from different fragments discovered over a period of more than a hundred years, known as the Tithonus poem or the Old Age poem:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...old age already (withers?) all (my) skin, and&lt;br&gt;\n (my) hair (turned white) from black&lt;br&gt;\n] (my) knees do not carry (me)&lt;br&gt;\n] (to dance) like young fawns&lt;br&gt;\n] but what could I do?&lt;br&gt;\n] not possible to become (ageless?)&lt;br&gt;\n] rosy-armed Dawn [...]&lt;br&gt;\ncarrying (to) the ends of the earth&lt;br&gt;\n] yet (age) seized (him)&lt;br&gt;\n] (immortal?) wife.\nThe myth goes that Eos fell in love with and abducted Tithonus, a handsome prince from Troy, either the brother or the son of King Laomedon (the father of Priam). She went with a request to Zeus, asking him to make Tithonus immortal for her sake. Zeus agreed and granted her wish, but Eos foolishly forgot to ask for eternal youth as well for her beloved. So for a while the two lived happily in her palace, but their happiness eventually came to an end when Tithonus's hair started turning grey as he aged, and Eos ceased to visit him in their bed. Despite that, the goddess kept him around and nourished him with food and ambrosia; Tithonus never died as he had gained immortality as Zeus promised, but he kept aging and shrivelling, and was soon unable to even move. In the end, Eos locked him up in a chamber, where he withered away alone, forever a helpless old man. Out of pity, she turned him into a small bug, a cicada (Greek , \"tettix\").\nIn the account of Hieronymus of Rhodes from the third century BC, the blame is shifted from Eos and onto Tithonus, who asked for immortality but not agelessness from his lover, who was then unable to help him otherwise and turned him into a cicada. Propertius wrote that Eos did not forsake Tithonus, old and aged as he was, and would still embrace him and hold him in her arms rather than leaving him deserted in his cold chamber, while cursing the gods for his cruel fate.\nThis myth might have been used to explain why cicadas were particularly noisy during the early hours of the morning, when the dawn appears in the sky. Sir James George Frazer notes that there was a widespread notion among the ancient Greeks and other ancient peoples that the creatures that shed their skin renew their youth and get to live forever. It could also be a reference to the fact that the high-pitched talk of old men was compared to a cicada's singing, as evidenced in a passage from the \"Iliad\". The ancient Greeks would use a cicada, the most musical of insects, sitting on a harp as an emblem of music. Cicadas were also believed to be able to survive off of dew alone, a substance closely associated with Eos.\nCephalus.\nThe abduction of Cephalus had special appeal for an Athenian audience because Cephalus was a local boy, and so this myth element appeared frequently in Attic vase-paintings and was exported with them. In the literary myths, Eos snatched Cephalus against his will when he was hunting and took him to Syria. Although Cephalus was already married to Procris, Eos bore him three sons, including Phaethon and Hesperus, and in some versions the little-attested Aoos who went on to become king of Cyprus, but he then began pining for Procris, causing a disgruntled Eos to return him to Procris, but not before sowing the seeds of doubt in his mind, telling him that it was highly unlikely that Procris had stayed faithful to him this entire time.\nCephalus, troubled by her words, asked Eos to change his form into that of a stranger's, in order to secretly put Procris's love for him to the test. Cephalus, now disguised, propositioned Procris, who at first declined but eventually gave in when he offered her money. He was hurt by her betrayal, and she left him in shame, but eventually they got back together. This time however it was Procris's turn to doubt her husband's fidelity; while hunting, he would often call upon the breeze ('Aura' in Latin, sounding similar to Eos's Roman equivalent Aurora) to refresh his body. Upon hearing that, Procris followed and spied on him. Cephalus, mistaking her for some wild animal, threw his spear at her, killing his wife. The second-century CE traveller Pausanias knew of the story of Cephalus's abduction too, though he calls Eos by the name of Hemera, goddess of day.\nHyginus omits the kidnapping from the story, and has Cephalus reject Eos out of fidelity to Procris when she begs him to have sex with her. Eos then says to Cephalus that she would not want him to break his vows if Procris herself has not either, and alters his appearance and gives him gifts to trick Procris. Cephalus then goes to Procris as a stranger, and she agrees to lay with him, thereupon Eos removes the enchantment from Cephalus, revealing his identity. Procris, knowing she has been deceived by Eos, flees; she is eventually reunited with Cephalus, but still fearful of Eos, follows him when he goes out hunting, and ends up being accidentally killed by him.\nAntoninus Liberalis also largely follows the same tradition in his rendition of the myth, though his text contains a lacuna, jumping from Eos's abduction of Cephalus to him having doubts over Procris. The oldest extant account of the myth is attributed to Pherecydes, and the elements it contains were all kept by later poets; in his account however Eos plays no role in the myth. That being said, artistic evidence of Eos abducting a man that can be identified as Cephalus go as back as the early fifth century BC.\nRole in wars.\nGigantomachy.\nEos played a small role in the battle of the earthborn Giants against the gods, known as the Gigantomachy, who rose in rebellion. When their mother, the earth goddess Gaia learned of a prophecy that the giants would perish at the hand of a mortal, Gaia sought to find a herb that would protect them from all harm; thus Zeus ordered Eos, as well as her siblings Selene (Moon) and Helios (Sun) not to shine so that she would not be able to seek for it, and harvested all of the plant for himself, denying Gaia the chance to make the Giants indestructible. Moreover, Eos is seen fighting against the Giants in the south frieze of the Pergamon Altar, which depicts the Gigantomachy, where she rides hither on either a horse or a mule right ahead of Helios, swinging herself on the back of her mount while a Giant already lies on the ground underneath her; a robe wound around her hips serves as her saddle-cloth. She is joined in fight against the Giants by her siblings, her mother Theia, and possibly, conjectured due to the disembodied wing to the right of Eos's shoulder, the goddess Hemera.\nTrojan War.\nAccording to Hesiod, by her lover Tithonus, Eos had two sons, Memnon and Emathion. Memnon, king of Aethiopia, joined the Trojans in the Trojan War and fought against Achilles in battle. Much like Thetis, the mother of Achilles, did before her, Eos asked the smithing god Hephaestus with tears in her eyes to forge an armor for Memnon, and he, moved, did as told. Pausanias mentions images of Thetis and Eos both begging Zeus on behalf of their sons. In the end, it was Achilles who triumphed and slew Memnon in battle. Mourning greatly over the death of her son, Eos made the light of her brother, Helios the god of the sun, to fade, and begged Nyx, the goddess of the night, to come out earlier, so she could be able to freely steal her son's body undetected by the armies. After his death, Eos, perhaps with the help of Hypnos (Sleep) and Thanatos (Death), transported Memnon's dead body back to Aethiopia; she also asked Zeus to make her son immortal, and he granted her wish. Eos's role in the Trojan War saga mirrors that of Thetis herself; both are goddesses married to aging old men, both see their mortal sons die on the battlefield, and both arrange an afterlife/immortality of sorts for said sons.\nIconography.\nEos was imagined as a woman wearing a saffron mantle as she spread dew from an upturned urn, or with a torch in hand, riding a chariot. Greek and Italian vases show Eos/Aurora on a chariot preceding Helios, as the morning star Eosphorus flies with her; she is winged, wearing a fine pleated tunic and mantle. Eos is not an uncommon figure, especially on red-figure vases; as a single figure she appears rising from the sea in, or driving, a four-horse chariot like her brother Helios, sometimes carrying two hydriae from which she pours morning dew. Because Hermes's rod had the power to both induce sleep to mortals and wake them up, some times he is seen preceding the chariot of Eos (and that of Helios) as the new day breaks.\nAlthough the romantic adventures of Eos is a common subject in pottery, so far as it is known, no vase depicts her with Orion or Cleitus, known lovers of hers, instead those vases fall into groups; those that depict Eos with a young hunter identified as Cephalus, and those that depict Eos with a youth holding a lyre, identified as Tithonus. Sometimes those vases bear inscriptions, and on a few the hunter is identified as Tithonus, while the lyre-player is Cephalus. Perhaps the earliest representation of this theme is found on a red-figure \"rhyton\", a statuette-vase, from circa 480-470 BC in which Eos is depicted carrying of a naked boy, perhaps Cephalus, her wings spread and her feet barely touching the ground. The image of Eos pursuing Tithonus was eerily repetitive in ancient art, as was that of erotic pursuit in general; Tithonus was drawn running off to the right in terror, or trying to clobber with a lyre or a spear the pursuing Eos, indicating the terrifying aspect of a mortal man being taken by a goddess. The image of Zeus, the active \"erastes\", pursuing Ganymede, the passive \"eromenos\", was also common, but in the case of Eos, the female figure was put in the dominant position.\nOther depictions of mythological scenes that include Eos are Memnon's battle with Achilles and Eos's pleading of Zeus for his safety, her seizing of Memnon's dead body, and the \"apotheosis\" of Alcmene (the mother of Heracles). Among Theia and Hyperion's children, she is the only one depicted with wings, as neither her brother nor her sister ever sport some in art.\nCult and temples.\nEos, along with her brother and sister, is an Indo-European deity, side-lined by the non-IE newcomers to the pantheon; James Davidson argues that apparently persisting on the sidelines was a primary function for them, to be the minor gods that the major gods were juxtaposed to, thus helping to keep the Greek religion Greek. However, whereas her brother and sister did receive minor cults, and in Helios's case even major ones, Eos does not seem to have been the focus of any worship at all. Thus there are no known temples, shrines, or altars to Eos. That being said, Ovid seems to allude to the existence of at least two shrines of Eos, as he describes them in plural, albeit few, in the lines:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2018Least I may be of all the goddesses the golden heavens hold \u2013 in all the world my shrines are rarest.\u2019\u2014\u200a\nAlthough this could simply be an understated way for Eos to say that she has no temples or shrines whatsoever, nevertheless Ovid may therefore have known of at least two such shrines. However, if Eos did indeed have a handful of shrines and altars in ancient Greece or Rome, no knowledge of them remains.\nThe only traces of the goddess's worship can be found at Athens, where wineless offerings (or \"nephalia\") were made to Eos, along with other celestial gods and goddesses, including Eos's siblings Helios and Selene, as well as Aphrodite Urania, Mnemosyne, the Muses, and the nymphs. It is possible that the goddess addressed as Orthria and Aotis in a fragment by Alcman is Eos; this is highly debated, but if true, it could mean that Eos was worshipped in some capacity in Sparta during the Archaic period.\nIdentifications.\nEtruscan.\nAmong the Etruscans, the generative dawn-goddess was Thesan. Depictions of the dawn-goddess with a young lover became popular in Etruria in the fifth century, probably inspired by imported Greek vase-painting. Though Etruscans preferred to show the goddess as a nurturer (\"Kourotrophos\") rather than an abductor of young men, the late Archaic sculptural acroterion from Etruscan C\u00e6re, now in Berlin, showing the goddess in archaic running pose adapted from the Greeks, and bearing a boy in her arms, has commonly been identified as Eos and Cephalus. On an Etruscan mirror Thesan is shown carrying off a young man, whose name is inscribed as Tinthu.\nRoman.\nThe Roman equivalent of Eos is Aurora, also a cognate showing the characteristic Latin rhotacism. Dawn became associated in Roman cult with Matuta, later known as Mater Matuta. She was also associated with the sea harbors and ports, and had a temple on the Forum Boarium. On June 11, the Matralia was celebrated at that temple in honor of Mater Matuta; this festival was only for women during their first marriage.\nHemera.\nAlthough distinct deities in early works such as Hesiod's \"Theogony\", later the tragic poets completely identified Eos with Hemera, the primordial goddess of the day; each of the three great Athenian tragedians, Euripides, Aeschylus and Sophocles, used \"Hemera\" for the goddess who abducts Tithonus or drives a chariot drawn by white horses at daybreak in some work.\nBoth goddesses were said to be daughters of Nyx (Night), albeit Eos was much more commonly the daughter of Hyperion by his wife. Pausanias, when describing depictions of Eos's myths at Athens and Amyclae, he calls Eos by the name of Hemera. A scholion on the \"Odyssey\" mentions the abduction of the hunter Orion by \"Hemera\" (Eos in Homer). Eos, in contrast to Helios and Selene and more similarly to Hemera and Hemera's mother Nyx, embodies a part of the day and night cycle, instead of a celestial body. The Greek word \"eos\", meaning dawn, was some times used by writers to refer to the entire duration of the day, not just the morning.\nLikewise, Eos was often referred to as \"Tito\", another archaic word meaning day, and feminine equivalent to \"Titan\", which is a common epithet of her brother Helios denoting his role as the creator of the day. Unlike Eos however, Hemera is little more than a name in Greek literature, with few and far between references about her and with no unique mythology outside of her parentage and the few stories appropriated from Eos.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "10479", "revid": "5957417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10479", "title": "Elba", "text": "Mediterranean island in Tuscany, Italy\nElba (, ; ) is a Mediterranean island in Tuscany, Italy, from the coastal town of Piombino on the Italian mainland, and the largest island of the Tuscan Archipelago. It is also part of the Arcipelago Toscano National Park, and the third largest island in Italy, after Sicily and Sardinia. It is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea about east of the French island of Corsica.\nThe island is part of the province of Livorno and is divided into seven municipalities, with a total population of about 30,000 inhabitants which increases considerably during the summer. The municipalities are Portoferraio (which is also the island's principal town), Campo nell'Elba, Capoliveri, Marciana, Marciana Marina, Porto Azzurro, and Rio.\nIt is famous for being the site of Napoleon's first exile, from 1814 to 1815.\nGeography.\nElba is the largest remaining stretch of land from the ancient tract that once connected the Italian peninsula to Corsica. The northern coast faces the Ligurian Sea, the eastern coast the Piombino Channel, the southern coast the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Corsica Channel divides the western tip of the island from neighbouring Corsica.\nGeology.\nThe island itself is made up of slices of rocks which once formed part of the ancient Tethyan seafloor. These rocks have been through at least two orogenies, the Alpine orogeny and the Apennine orogeny. The second of these two events was associated with subduction of the Tethyan oceanic crust underneath Italy and the obduction of parts of the ancient seafloor onto the continents. Later extension within the stretched inner part of the Apennine Mountains caused adiabatic melting and the intrusion of the Mount Capanne and the La Serra-Porto Azzuro granitoids. These igneous bodies brought with them skarn fluids which dissolved and replaced some of the carbonate units, precipitating iron-rich minerals in their place. One of the iron-rich minerals, ilvaite, was first identified on the island and takes its name from the Latin word for Elba. More recently, high-angle faults formed within the tectonic pile, allowing for the migration of iron-rich fluids through the crust. The deposits left behind by these fluids formed the island's rich seams of iron ore.\nThe terrain is quite varied and is thus divided into several areas based on geomorphology. The mountainous and most recent part of the island can be found to the west, the centre of which is dominated by Mount Capanne (at a height of 1,018 metres, or 3,340 feet), also called the \"roof of the Tuscan Archipelago\". The mountain is home to many animal species including the mouflon and wild boar, two species that flourish despite the continuous influx of tourists. The central part of the island is a mostly flat section with the width being reduced to just four kilometres (). It is where the major centres can be found: Portoferraio, Campo nell'Elba. To the east is the oldest part of the island, formed over 3 million years ago. In the hilly area, dominated by Monte Calamita, are the deposits of iron that made Elba famous.\nHydrography.\nRivers rarely exceed in length, and it is common for the shorter ones to dry up during the summer. The largest rivers, sorted by length, are:\nBetween Poggio and Marciana, at the foot of Mount Capanne, is a spring called Fonte Napoleone, known for its quality.\nClimate.\nThe climate of the island is predominantly Mediterranean, except for Mount Capanne, where winters tend to be moderately cold. Precipitation is concentrated in autumn and comprises a normal rainfall. The island lies in the rain shadow of the large and mountainous island of Corsica, so precipitation totals are somewhat reduced from the mainland (most of the island receives less than 750\u00a0mm (30 inches) annually). Snowfall in winter is rare in the lowlands and melts quickly. The table below shows the average temperatures for the islands by month.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe island was originally inhabited by Ligures Ilvates and was called Ilva (\u1f38\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03b1). It was well known from very ancient times for its iron resources and valued mines. The Greeks also called it Aethalia (\u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 or \u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) and Aethale (\u0391\u1f30\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7) from \"smoky\" (\u03b1\u1f30\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7), after the fumes of the metal producing furnaces.\nApollonius of Rhodes mentions it in his epic poem \"Argonautica\", describing that the Argonauts rested here during their travels. He writes that signs of their visit were still visible in his day, including skin-coloured pebbles that they dried their hands on and large stones which they used at discus. Strabo (5.2.6) presents a slightly different account: \"because the scrapings, which the Argonauts formed when they used their strigils, became congealed, the pebbles on the shore remain variegated still to this day.\" The port which is now called Porto Ferraio, was known in ancient times as the portus Argous (\u1f08\u03c1\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd), because it was believed that the Argonauts landed there on their return voyage.\nThe island was then settled by the Etruscans, who started mining iron at Elba, and later (after 480 BC) by the Romans, who called the island Ilva.\nMiddle Ages and early modern.\nIn the early medieval period, Elba was invaded by the Ostrogoths and the Lombards, and later it became a possession of the Republic of Pisa. After the battle of Meloria, the Republic of Genoa took possession of Elba, but it was regained by Pisa in 1292. The island was retained for two centuries by the Appiani family, Lords of Piombino, when they sold Pisa to the house of Visconti of Milan in 1399.\nIn 1544, the Barbary pirates from North Africa devastated Elba and the coasts of Tuscany. In 1546, part of the island was handed over to Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who fortified Portoferraio and renamed it \"Cosmopoli\", while the rest of the island was returned to the Appiani in 1577. In 1596, Philip II of Spain captured Porto Longone and had two fortresses built there. This part of Elba came into the direct power of Spain through the State of the Presidi, including Porto Longone. In 1736, the sovereignty of this part of Elba was claimed by the Kingdom of Naples but remained abandoned.\nLate modern and contemporary.\nThe British landed on the island of Elba in 1796, after the occupation of Livorno by the French Republican troops, to protect the 4,000 French royalists who had found asylum in Portoferraio two years earlier. In 1801, the Peace of Luneville gave Elba to the Kingdom of Etruria, and it was transferred to France in 1802 by the Peace of Amiens.\nThe French Emperor Napoleon was exiled to Elba, after his forced abdication following the Treaty of Fontainebleau, and conveyed to the island on HMS \"Undaunted\" by Captain Thomas Ussher; he arrived at Portoferraio on 4 May 1814. He was allowed to keep a personal guard of 400 men and was nominally sovereign of Elba, a step down from Emperor of the French. However, the nearby sea was patrolled by the French and British navies to ensure he could not escape. During the months that he stayed on the island, Napoleon carried out a series of economic and social reforms to improve the quality of life. After staying for almost ten months, he managed to escape back to France on 26 February 1815 with about 1,000 men.\nAt the Congress of Vienna, Elba was given to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1860, it became part of the new unified Kingdom of Italy.\nDuring the Second World War, the island was liberated from German occupation by the French \"1er Corps d'Arm\u00e9e\" supported by British forces including Royal Naval Commandos on 17 June 1944, in \"Op\u00e9ration Brassard\". Faulty intelligence and strong defences made the battle more difficult than expected.\nIn 1954, BOAC Flight 781 crashed in the waters off the coast of Elba.\nIn recent decades, thanks to its rich cultural heritage, cuisine and nature, the island has become an important international tourist destination.\nTransportation.\nThe island is connected to the mainland via the four ferry companies, Toremar, Moby Lines, Blunavy and Sardinia Ferries, all offering routes between Piombino and Portoferraio, the capital located in the north, Cavo, Rio Marina and Porto Azzurro, on the east coast of the island.\nThere is an airport on the island, Marina di Campo Airport. It is served by Silver Air with flights to the Italian mainland.\nCycling.\nThe island has a network of trails for road racers looking for more technical routes for their training, trails and dirt roads for bikers to have fun on, and accessible routes for families with children who need safe and relaxing routes. On the road from Rio nell'Elba going to Porto Azzurro is the \"Fonte di Coppi\". Towards the end of his career, Fausto Coppi, the \"campionissimo\", came here to train on the roads of Elba. He still retained a celebrity status but was no longer at the peak of his career that ended with his death a few years later. The plaque on the fountain reads: \"1960\u20132010, here the champion quenched his thirst, after fifty years on the run\".\nSport.\nThe Elba football team represents the island. They were approved as a ConIFA member at the Annual General Meeting 2020. It is not affiliated with FIFA or UEFA, and therefore cannot compete for the FIFA World Cup or in the UEFA European Championship. It is, however, affiliated to ConIFA, and play in the ConIFA European Football Cup.\nElba Island played their first game as a ConIFA member on 11 September 2021 against the Sicily Football Team scoring a 4\u20134 tie against them.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "10481", "revid": "51049022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10481", "title": "Enki", "text": "God in Sumerian mythology\nEnki (Sumerian: \ud808\udc2d\ud808\udc97\ud808\udda0 \"d\"EN-KI), also known as Ea (Akkadian: \ud808\udc2d\ud808\udc8d\ud808\udc00 \"d\"E\u2082-A) was the Mesopotamian god of wisdom, crafts, fresh subterranean waters, magic, and incantations. He was believed to rule the Abz\u00fb. In Mesopotamian astronomy, he was associated with the stars of the southern band of the sky. Enki\u2019s wife was Damgalnuna, and their children included Nanshe, Asalluhi, Marduk and Enbilulu. His sukkal (attendant deity) was Isimud. Servants of the god included lahmu, kulull\u00fb, and the Seven Sages.\nEnki was first worshipped by the Sumerians of Southern Mesopotamia. The earliest sources associate him with the city of Eridu, which was his main cult center, and regarded as his home. His temple there was the E-Abz\u00fb. Enki was already a major deity in Sumer at the time of the earliest written sources, and the influence of his cult spread outside of Southern Mesopotamia early on. It is uncertain when Enki was assimilated to Ea, a god whose name is of unknown, but possibly semitic origin. Under the name Ea, Enki was worshipped by the Akkadians, Babylonians and Assyrians. His cult was particularly influential in the Ur III and Old Babylonian Periods, where he became part of a triad at the top of the pantheon consisting of Anu, Enlil and himself. He was incorporated into Hurrian religion as a major god, with identical character and functions as in Mesopotamia. His cult spread into Anatolia, possibly as early as the third millennium BCE, and he became part of the Hittite pantheon. With the rise of Babylon and its patron god Marduk, Ea\u2019s cult gradually lost importance, though he still remained a major god in first millennium BCE Mesopotamia.\nEnki\u2019s primary symbols included the goat-fish, the ram-headed staff and the turtle. In art, he was commonly depicted with water streams flowing from his body, or holding a vase from which water flows. \nEnki frequently appears in Mesopotamian myths in the role of a crafty counsellor who finds solutions to difficult problems. Mesopotamian tradition regarded him as the creator of mankind from clay. Several Mesopotamian myths deal with the story of the creation of mankind. In Enki and Ninmah, Enki comes up with the plan to fashion the new being, meant to take over the labour of the gods. In Atra-hasis, Enki works with Belet-ili to create man from clay and divine blood. The advice he gives to his human protegee later allow humanity to survive Enlil\u2019s attempts to wipe it out, which culminate in the sending of the flood. \nThe names Enki and Ea.\nThe meaning of the names Enki and Ea is uncertain. It is agreed that they were originally separate deities, though it is unclear when they were fully equated with each other. Alfonso Archi argues that syncretism between them likely already existed at least from the mid third millennium BCE in parts of Babylonia.\nEnki.\nThe name Enki is usually translated as \u201cLord of the Earth\u201d in Sumerian. This explanation is not universally accepted. Some scholars argue that it does not seemingly fit the functions of the god, and have proposed that Enki could have been an epithet of the deity that eventually replaced his original name. Despite the similarity between their names, Enki of Eridu and the primordial god Enki were separate figures. Jacobsen proposed that their names had slightly different meanings and he translated the name of the primordial god as \u201cLord Earth\u201d.The forms of their names in the Emesal dialect are different; the name of Enki of Eridu is written Amanki, while the name of the primordial god is written Umunki.\nEdmond Sollberger and Wilfred G. Lambert have proposed a different translation for the name of Enki of Eridu. It has been remarked that an omissible g appears at the end of the second element of his name, which does not appear in the name of the primordial god.For this reason they interpret this second element not as ki, \u2018\u2019earth\u2019\u2019, but as ki(g) of unknown meaning. Sollberger understood an element ki(g) meaning \u2018\u2019favour, benevolence, love\u2019\u2019 in Sumerian. Therefore he translated Enki(g) as \u2018\u2019Lord Love\u2019\u2019,or \u2018\u2019Lord Benevolence\u2019\u2019. He argues that this translation reflects Enki\u2019s well attested role in myths as a friend of mankind. However, this explanation is not generally accepted. It has been remarked that it is possible that the omissible g developed via dissimilation, though similar examples of dissimilation are so far not attested in Sumerian.\nEa.\nThe name Ea first occurs in personal names from the Old Akkadian period. Earlier translations interpreting Ea as a Sumerian name meaning \u2018\u2019House of Water\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019House of the Moon\u2019\u2019 are regarded as implausible by modern scholarship. In a few modern publications, the interpretation \u2018\u2019House of Water\u2019\u2019 is sometimes presented as a scribal popular etymology. However, according to Lambert, there is no evidence for such a reinterpretation.\nDue to the fact that the name appears associated with Semitic elements in the sources of the Old Akkadian Period, it has been suggested that Ea is most likely a Semitic name. It has been proposed that the etymology of the name is connected to the Semitic root \"\u1e25yy\", \u2018\u2019to live\u2019\u2019. This explanation has not been proved with certainty, though it is considered plausible. Miguel Civil proposed that the name of the god Haya was originally an alternative spelling of Ea. Margaret W. Green proposed that the names Ea and Haya were both derived from the name of a pre Sumerian deity that was integrated into the pantheons of the Sumerians and of the Semitic peoples, and that Haya persisted as a separate deity after Ea was syncretized with Enki. The hypothesis of a connection between the names Ea and Haya is considered to be credible, but it is not proved, and it is not accepted by all scholars.\nAlternative names and epithets.\nNudimmud.\nNudimmud, one of the most frequently attested alternative names and epithets of Enki/Ea, was almost exclusively used in literary texts. In akkadian sources, it could also appear in royal inscriptions, prayers, and incantations. It already appears in the Zame Hymns under the form \"d\"en-nu-te-mud. The standard writing was \"d\"nu-d\u00edm-mud. Earlier spellings include nu-te-me-nud from the F\u0101ra period or nu-da-mud from the Ur III period. The verbal elements d\u00edm and mud in the standard orthography respectively mean \u2018\u2019to build, create\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2019to bring forth\u2019\u2019. The god list An=Anum \u0161a ameli explains Nudimmud as Ea in his aspect as the god of creation. Thorkild Jacobsen interpreted the name as \u2018\u2019Image fashioner\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019God of shaping\u2019\u2019, reflecting Ea\u2019s role as the god of crafts and as the god who creates figures from clay. The meaning of Nudimmud in the older periods is unclear. Antoine Cavigneaux and Manfred Krebernik remark that the standard orthography with d\u00edm and it's translation likely reflect a later etymological reinterpretation of the name.\nNagbu.\nNagbu, \u2018\u2019Source, spring\u2019\u2019, was an alternative name of Enki/Ea which reflected his role as the lord of the springs and subterranean waters. In this aspect he was not only connected to irrigation and fertility, but he was also associated with the art of incantation, as subterranean water played an important role in Mesopotamian magic and incantation rituals. Nagbu is attested chiefly in sources from Babylonia, and in the Neo Babylonian period, the name often appears in incantation texts. It was written with the logogram \"d\"IDIM. This logogram already appears as a theophoric element in Akkadian and Neo Sumerian names.Starting from the second millennium BC it often appears in Babylonian personal names. In the god list An=Anum, Nagbu is equated with Ea. It is unclear whether Nagbu was originally an independent deity or an aspect of Ea.\nNi\u0161\u0161\u012bku.\nNi\u0161\u0161\u012bku was an alternative name and epithet of Enki/Ea of uncertain meaning. It is first attested in literary texts of the Old Babylonian period. Wilfred G. Lambert and Alan R. Millard propose that the name was derived from the Semitic element \"nas\u012bku\" ,\u2019\u2019chieftain\u2019\u2019, reflecting Enki\u2019s sumerian epithet \"nun\", \"prince\", \"leader\". Hannes D. Galter considers that a connection between an Old Babylonian expression and a loanword from Aramaic is implausible.Alternative spellings of the name include Na\u0161\u0161\u012bku and Nin\u0161\u012bku. Nin\u0161\u012bku is likely a later folk etymology from Sumerian. It is attested from the Middle Babylonian period onwards. One god list explains Nin\u0161\u012bku as Ea in his aspect as god of wisdom. In this interpretation, -\u0161iku was likely equated with Sumerian \"k\u00f9-zu\", \u2018\u2019wise\u2019\u2019.\nDI\u0160.\nThe logogram DI\u0160 often designates Enki/Ea in Assyrian texts. In Neo Assyrian sources, it chiefly appears in royal inscriptions and incantation literature. It is sometimes attested as a theophoric element in personal names of the first millennium. In Neo Babylonian Uruk it designates Anu instead. The reading of DI\u0160 in akkadian is unknown. Galter suggests that DI\u0160 was possibly a numeral symbolizing the number 60, a number associated with Anu, and that its use for Ea could have been a way to equate him with the supreme god of the pantheon.\nOther names and epithets.\nEnki/Ea had a variety of other names and epithets reflecting his different functions and his association with his abode, Abz\u00fb, and his cult center, Eridu. Galter remarks that the majority of other names of Ea are only documented from sources from the late second millennium, and therefore he presumes that they represent an effort to fully encompass and describe all of the aspects of the god. Craftsmanship deities such as Uttu and Ninagal could be regarded as alternative names of Ea in late sources.\nThe majority of akkadian epithets of Ea reflect his role as the god of wisdom. Such epithets include for example, \"b\u0113l n\u0113meqi\" (\u2018\u2019Lord of wisdom\u2019\u2019), \"b\u0113l ta\u0161\u012bmti\" (\u2018\u2019Lord of understanding\u2019\u2019), and \"apkal il\u012b.\"(\u2018\u2019Sage of the gods\u2019\u2019). \"B\u0113l nagbi,\" (\u2018\u2019Lord of the subterranean waters\u2019\u2019) was a frequently attested epithet of Ea in his aspect as a water god. He could be referred to as \"b\u0113l ten\u0113\u0161\u0113ti\", \u2018\u2019Lord of mankind\u2019\u2019. His association to the arts of incantation was reflected in his epithets \"ma\u0161ma\u0161 il\u012b\", \u2018\u2019Exorcist of the gods\u2019\u2019, and \"b\u0113l i\u0161\u012bputti\" (\u2018\u2019Lord of the purification rites\u2019\u2019).\nEa could be referred to as Ea-\u0161arru in some akkadian texts. According to Galter, it is unclear whether Ea-\u0161arru was simply an epithet of Ea or if a foreign deity was identified with Ea and \"\u0161arru\",\u2018\u2019king\u2019\u2019, was added to distinguish them. He remarks that the earliest attestations of this name occur outside of Mesopotamia, which could indicate that the name did not originate in the region.\nA common epithet of Enki/Ea in literary texts was Enlil-banda, \u2018\u2019the junior Enlil\u2019\u2019. An early attestation of this epithet dates to the Old Babylonian Period. Several possible interpretations of this name have been suggested by scholars. It could indicate that Ea was regarded as a younger brother of Enlil, it could have been a way to equate Ea with Enlil, it could have been a way to assert that he is \u2018\u2019like Enlil\u2019' in his domain, or it could mean that he received his functions and abode from Enlil.\nThe god could be referred to as the king of the Abz\u00fb and the king of Eridu. Another of his epithets was \"d\u00e0ra-abzu\", translated as Ibex or Stag of the Abz\u00fb. An early attestation of this byname is found in an Old Babylonian hymn. Several compound bynames of Enki/Ea formed with the element \"d\u00e0ra\" appear in a later god list.\nCharacter and attributes.\nEnki/Ea was worshipped as the god of wisdom, arts, crafts, fresh subterranean waters, springs, and by extension incantations and magic. He also had the function of a creator god. He was believed to reside in the Abz\u00fb, imagined as an under-earth fresh water region.\nEnki/Ea\u2019s association with wisdom is already attested from sumerian sources of the pre-sargonic period. He was believed to be able to grant it to both humans and gods. Curse formulas invoking him could similarly ask him to take away the wisdom and intellect of an enemy. He was also connected to the determination of fate. A Neo Babylonian text refers to him as the king of destinies. The nature of the wisdom connected to Enki/Ea has been described by modern scholars as practical skill, cunning or craftiness. In Mesopotamian mythology, he often uses guile or magic to turn situations to his advantage, and gives his advice to both gods and men. He could be referred to as the one \u2018\u2019who knows the hearts of the great gods\u2019\u2019. Though he is the protagonist of only a few of the preserved Mesopotamian myths, he is one of the deities that intervenes most often in them. In the Agushaya hymn, he devises a plan to calm the heart of the warlike Ishtar, crafting a double of her from clay to be her adversary. In Ninurta and the turtle, he outwits the warrior god who was plotting against him. In the Adapa myth, his instructions allow Adapa to ingratiate himself with three gods. Some scholars have described the god's behaviour in some myths as similar to that of a trickster figure. In one of these myths, Enki is bound by an oath not to reveal to humanity the gods plan to wipe them out with a flood, but he warns his human protege by pretending to speak to a reed wall.\nAs the god of arts and crafts Enki/Ea could be invoked to assist with building projects. In later periods, through his assimilation of initially distinct minor craftsmanship deities, he was identified as the patron of craft professions such as weavers, blacksmiths, and builders, but also of agricultural professions such as goatherds and gardeners, as well as professions such as musicians, lamentation priests (kal\u00fb) and scribes.\nEnki/Ea was believed to be typically a benevolent deity. Mesopotamian tradition regarded him as the god responsible for the creation of humans from clay. In the \u0160urpu incantation series, he is referred to as the god \u2018\u2019whose hands created mankind\u2019\u2019. This process of creation has been compared to the work of a craftsman. In myths predating the Enuma Elish, Enki works together with a mother goddess (Ninmah, Belet-ili) to fashion the new being, and in the Enuma Elish, its creation is the product of Ea\u2019s collaboration with his son Marduk. In the Mesopotamian Flood myth, he gives advice to his mortal protege which allows humanity to survive Enlil\u2019s attempts to wipe it out. In sumerian texts, such as the myth Enki and the World Order, he is depicted as the god responsible for the organization of the earth. In the myth Inanna and Enki, he is depicted as the guardian of the me-s, fundamental powers and decrees of the gods which enable the functioning of human civilization.\nAs the god of the underground sweet waters and springs, Enki/Ea was believed to ensure the prosperity of the land by allowing sufficient irrigation. He was also believed to be able to deny access to fresh water, and could be invoked for that purpose in curses. Ea could be also connected to river water, though the river itself was worshipped as a separate deity, Id. He was one of the deities that could be invoked in relation to the river ordeal. In sumerian, the same sign was used to designate water and semen. Sumerian literature about Enki could be explicit; the myth Enki and Ninhursag features sexual encounters between the god and several goddesses, and in Enki and the World Order he creates the waters of the Tigris by filling the river with his semen. This portrayal of the god has been contrasted with the one of akkadian texts where Ea chiefly appears in his role as a crafty counsellor.\nEnki/Ea also appears as one of the most important gods in incantation texts. Groundwater was believed to have purifying and healing properties, and because of this it played a major role in incantations and magic. Enki/Ea was invoked for a broad variety of purposes, including exorcism, purification, curing physical ailments, house building, and appeasing gods and demons. A common Mesopotamian incantation narrative, dubbed the Asalluhi-Enki or Marduk-Ea formula, describes a dialogue between Enki and his son Asalluhi ( Marduk in the akkadian version). Asalluhi comes across a problem that he cannot solve, and asks Enki for help. Enki tells Asalluhi that he knows everything that his father knows, but still proceeds to instruct him in the course of action to take. This formula already existed in the Early Dynastic Period, as attested by an incantation to counter snake bite.\nThe Mesopotamians divided the sky into three zones assigned to the gods Anu, Enlil, and Ea. They associated Ea with the stars nearest to the equator, while those near the poles were assigned to Enlil, and the central stars to Anu. This division of the sky is first attested in the thirteenth century BCE. \nSymbols and iconography.\nEnki/Ea is considered one of the few Mesopotamian deities with a recognizable iconography. His most distinguishing features are water streams flowing from his body, often accompanied by fish swimming in the water. These features are first attested in the Old Akkadian Period. Enki\u2019s iconography in the older periods is uncertain. It has been proposed that he is depicted on an Early Dynastic seal representing a sitting god with two fish beneath his feet, though this identification is not universally accepted. Enki/Ea\u2019s water streams could be depicted as coming from his shoulders or his hips, or he could be depicted sitting within his shrine or abode, with the streams surrounding it in the shape of a rectangle. Additionally, he could often be depicted with water sprouting vessels, carrying them either on his shoulders, in his hand or above his hand.His emblems include the goat-fish and the ram-headed staff. They were often depicted together, for example on kudurrus. The kudurru of Nazi-Maruttash refers to them as \u2018\u2019the great emblems of Ea\u2019\u2019. The ram-headed staff is attested in art from the Old Babylonian period until the Achaemenid period. In Neo Assyrian seals, Ea is sometimes represented carrying a crook, which Jeremy Black and Anthony Green suggest may be a symbolic representation of the staff. The goat-fish is attested in mesopotamian art from the Neo Sumerian period until Hellenistic times, and it was later adopted into roman art. It is at the origin of the zodiacal constellation Capricorn. Ea could often be represented sitting or standing on it. While the goat-fish\u2019s connection to Ea is well attested, it could also be depicted as a general apotropaic figure, not attached to any god. Clay figurines of goat-fishes could be used in apotropaic magic.\nAnother symbol of Ea was the turtle. It was associated with him since the Old Akkadian period. On kudurrus it could be used as his symbol instead of the goat-fish with the ram-headed staff, or it could be represented on the back of the goat-fish.\nEa was often depicted alongside his two faced vizier Isimud. Since the Old Akkadian period he could also be depicted alongside his Lahmu servants, divinities represented as naked or kilted male figures with abundant facial hair and locks of hair on each side of their face. On cylinder seals they could be represented as his doorkeepers, holding a gate-post, or in later periods a spade. Another figure closely associated with Ea in pictorial representations is the fish-man, who has the upper body of a man and the lower body of a fish. It was depicted next to symbols of Ea. It is attested in pictorial representations from the Neo Sumerian period up until Hellenistic times, and might have been the precursor of the merman in Greek and Medieval European art and literature.\nIn Akkadian period seals, Ea was depicted in various scenes, some of which likely have a mythological background. A well known example is the seal of Adda. There he is depicted with one foot on a mountain, with water streams coming out of his shoulders, and fish swimming in them. An ibex or a bull is seated beneath his right foot. An eagle descends from above to the center of the scene. Ea\u2019s two faced vizier stands behind him. The god rising from the mountain is most often interpreted as Shamash, and the armed goddess as Ishtar. Another well attested example is a motif where a half man, half bird creature is presented before an enthroned Ea by one or two gods, one of which is generally Isimud. Various interpretations of these scenes have been proposed by scholars. Pierre Amiet proposed that the scene on the Adda cylinder may represent the revelation of the forces of nature in early spring. Kramer and Maier proposed that the scene of the \u2018\u2019bird-man\u2019\u2019 led before the god of streams could be derived from the Anz\u00fb myth, representing the return of the tablets of destinies to Enki after the defeat of the Anz\u00fb bird who had stolen them, as in the sumerian version of the myth he was their guardian, while in the akkadian version they were stolen from Enlil instead. However, since only a few, difficult to understand myths are preserved from this period, the narrative behind the scenes remains uncertain. Ea could also be depicted travelling on his boat. According to one text, the name of the boat was \u2018\u2019Ibex of the Abz\u00fb\u2019\u2019. Enki\u2019s association with the ibex dates to the second half of the third millennium.\nThe little owl is called the bird of Ea in the Bird Call Text.\nRelations with other deities.\nParents.\nThe sky god An is named as the father of Enki in multiple sources, including the myth Enki and the World order and Enuma Elish. In a balbale to Enki by Ishme-Dagan, the parents of Enki are An and a commonly attested wife of his, Urash.\nThe creator goddess Nammu was regarded as the mother of Enki in the tradition of Eridu. She is attested in this role in the myth Enki and Ninmah, the god list An=Anum, and late incantations. In Enki and Ninmah, she provides the incentive for her son to devise the creation of mankind. It has been remarked that Nammu and An do not appear together in Sumerian or Akkadian literature, and only a single inscription refers to them as a couple. Galter points out that this might indicate two separate traditions for Enki\u2019s lineage. While Leick presumes An and Nammu together are Enki\u2019s parents, Black, Green and Lambert keep the traditions separate. Lambert remarks that mentions of An as Enki\u2019s father are more common than the tradition where Nammu is his mother, and presumes that Enki\u2019s birth in this second tradition was imagined as a result of parthenogenesis.\nSiblings.\nIn the myth Enki and the World Order, Enki names Enlil as his older brother. It has been further proposed that Enki\u2019s well attested epithet Enlil-banda, \u2018\u2019Junior Enlil\u2019\u2019, could possibly reflect a tradition according to which Enki was regarded a younger brother of Enlil, though it is only one of the possible explanations for this epithet.\nIn the myth Enki and Ninmah, Enki calls Ninmah his sister.\nIn some texts praising the weather-god Ishkur, Enki is referred to as his twin brother. However, such a connection does not appear in texts focusing on Enki. According to Daniel Schwemer, this is explained by the difference in rank between them, as there would be no incentive for naming Ishkur, a lower ranking deity, as the twin of Enki in texts dedicated to the higher ranking god.\nConsort.\nEnki/Ea\u2019s spouse was Damgalnuna (also known as Damkina). She was believed to act as an intermediary between her husband and supplicants.\nIn the myth Enki and Ninhursag, Ninhursag instead appears as Enki\u2019s consort. In this context, she was syncretized with Damgalnuna. \nNingikuga was the name of a goddess regarded as a wife of Enki. In tablet II of the god list An=Anum she is equated with Damgalnuna. Ningikuga was also the name of the mother of Ningal. According to Jacobsen, this name refers to a single deity, while they are treated as separate goddesses in Ningikuga\u2019s Reallexikon der Assyriologie entry by Cavigneaux and Krebernik.\nChildren.\nMarduk, the tutelary god of Babylon, was regarded as the son of Enki/Ea and Damgalnuna. He could be referred to as Ea\u2019s first-born son and heir. The earliest documented sources attesting to the tradition where Enki is Marduk\u2019s father date to the Old Babylonian Period. In this period, Marduk was assimilated to Asalluhi, a god of incantations who was regarded as a son of Enki and Damgalnuna. The syncretism between Asalluhi and Marduk is documented at the earliest in a letter of the king of Larsa Sin-Iddinam, where he is referred to as \u2018\u2019Asalluhi, king of Babylon\u2019\u2019. An hymn from the Old Babylonian period addresses Asalluhi as the first born son of Enki and as Marduk. The syncretism between Asalluhi and Marduk was not fully complete in the Old Babylonian period, however, and they could still be occasionally referred to as separate deities. With the rise of Babylon Marduk\u2019s importance in the pantheon grew and he took over certain characteristics of his father, such as his function as organizer of the earth. In Enuma Elish, Ea is depicted as rejoicing over his son\u2019s new status as king of the gods, and attributing to him his name and offices.\nNanshe was regarded as the daughter of Enki and Damgalnuna. According to Gebhard Selz, the tradition of Enki being the father of Nanshe likely already existed in Early Dynastic Lagash. She could appear alongside him in sumerian and bilingual incantation texts, together with Asalluhi and Nammu. Several scholars argue that Nanshe\u2019s brother Ningirsu, usually regarded as a son of Enlil, was originally also regarded as a son of Enki. \nEnbilulu could be regarded as a son of Enki and Damgalnuna; in the myth Enlil and Ninlil he is instead the son of the eponymous deities. \nIn the Hymn to Ninkasi, the eponymous goddess is Enki\u2019s daughter with Ninti. The hymn further states that she was raised by Ninhursag. It has been proposed that in the context of this hymn Ninti is an alternative name of Damgalnuna. In the god list An=Anum Ninti is equated with this goddess.\nEa is referred to as the father of Dumuzi (Tammuz) in Old Babylonian incantations, though he does not play a role in the narratives about this god.\nA fragmentary literary text identifies Numushda as a son of Enki, though he was usually regarded as a son of Nanna.\nThe incantation goddess Ningirima could be regarded as a daughter of Enki/Ea, but in another tradition she was instead the sister of Enlil.\nIn the god list An=Anum, Ea is assigned several sons aside from Marduk; Dumuzi-abzu, Barra, Barragula, Burnuntasa, Nera, and Kigulla. Kigulla also appears elsewhere as a goddess, the wife of Nita, equated with Ninurta. Dumuzi-abzu was originally the name of a female deity from the region of Lagash who was not referred to as Enki\u2019s child in older sources. Akiko Tsujita has proposed that she was reinterpreted as his son due to a confusion with the similarly named Dumuzi (Tammuz). \u1e2aedimmeku appears as the only daughter of Enki/Ea in An=Anum. She is otherwise twice referred to as \u2018\u2019the daughter of Abzu\u2019\u2019 in incantations, and in the \u0160urpu incantation series she appears near him. \nIn a section of the myth Enki and Ninhursag depicting a succession of incestuous couplings between Enki and his descendents, the goddesses Nin\u0161ar, Ninkurra, in one variant Ninimma, and Uttu appear as Enki\u2019s daughters. It is unclear why its author chose these goddesses for their respective roles. At the end of the myth, eight more deities are born from the ill body parts of Enki; Abu, Ninsikila, Ningirietud, Ninkasi, Nazi, Azimua, Ninti and Ensag. Their names are reinterpreted as word play on the sumerian words referring to his body parts.\nUttu could also be regarded as a daughter of Enki/Ea in other contexts; she is named as such in an incantation ritual, though one text attests that she could also be regarded as a daughter of Anu. In the god list An=Anu \u0161a am\u0113li, which probably originated in the Kassite period, and reflects syncretistic tendencies, she is instead identified as a manifestation of Ea, alongside other deities associated with professions and crafts. In an incantation text, Ea fashions from clay several craftsmanship deities, among them Nin\u0161ar and Ninkurra. As the god of crafts, Enki/Ea was connected to the various craftsmanship deities, though the nature of their relation varies depending on the source.\nCourt.\nEnki/Ea\u2019s sukkal was Isimud, who was characteristically depicted with two faces in Mesopotamian art. It has been argued that the name Ara, which could be used as an alternative name of Isimud from the Old Babylonian Period onwards, initially belonged to a distinct goddess who was also an attendant of Enki. \nSirsir was a deity of the circle of Enki that could be regarded as his boatman, and in later periods, be identified as an aspect of Enki or his son Marduk. Ka\u1e2begal (\u2018\u2019mouth of prosperity\u2019\u2019) and Igi\u1e2begal (\u2018\u2019eye or face of prosperity\u2019\u2019) were two divinities regarded as doorkeepers of Enki, usually paired together in sources. They are attested in this role since Old Babylonian times onwards, and appear in association with Enki and Eridu in incantations. The god-list An=Anum names them among the doorkeepers of Enki, who are there numbered to be eight. A later text refers to Ka\u1e2begal and Igi\u1e2begal as lahmu of Eridu or the Abz\u00fb. \nOne sumerian text of Middle Babylonian origin refers to the goat-fish (su\u1e2burm\u0101\u0161u), a supernatural being well attested as an emblem of Enki/Ea, as the \u2018\u2019lofty purification priest of the Abz\u00fb\u2019\u2019. \nLahmu were a class of supernatural beings regarded as servants of Ea, and later of his son Marduk. They were associated with water. They were believed to reside in Ea\u2019s subterranean domain and act as doorkeepers of his temple. Certain texts number fifty Lahmu at Ea\u2019s service. Lahmu could be depicted in art as a male, long haired figure usually with six or four curls, either naked or wearing a girdle. This figure is sometimes referred to as \u2018\u2019nude hero\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019wild man\u2019\u2019 by art historians. The so-called G\u00f6ttertypentext edited by F. K\u00f6cher mentions supernatural creatures in the service of Ea also referred to as \u2018\u2019lahmu\u2019\u2019. Their appearances are varied, combining the body parts of fish, humans, and other animals. According to Wiggermann, the usage of the term \u2018\u2019lahmu\u2019\u2019 in the G\u00f6ttertypentext represents an evolution from the original meaning of the word and that here it was used to refer to newly invented categories of creatures.\nThe kulull\u00fb, or fish-man, was also a class of supernatural beings who could be associated with Enki/Ea. The G\u00f6ttertypentext refers to the kulull\u00fb as a creature of this god. In art this being was depicted with a human upper half and the lower body of a fish. Textual evidence instead describes the kulull\u00fb as a being with the head of an unidentified creature, the kissugu, the upper body of a human and the lower body of a carp.\nThe Seven Sages (apkallu) were fish-men creatures of the Abz\u00fb regarded as responsible for teaching mankind various aspects of human culture, in a Babylonian and Assyrian tradition dating to the late second and the first millenium BCE. They are described as servants of Ea in the Epic of Erra, and are called \u2018\u2019the Seven Sages of Eridu\u2019\u2019 in a text from the first millennium BCE known as the Twenty One Poultices. Mesopotamian traditions around the Seven Sages were the source for the later Babyloniaca of the Babylonian priest Berossos, which relates that a hybrid fish-human creature named Oannes came out of the sea to teach the inhabitants of Babylonia various aspects of human culture, such as writing, temple building and sciences. The Seven Sons of the Abz\u00fb are servants of Ea which appear in incantations, and who were concerned with the purifying of water and curing of sicknesses. It is presumed that they are identical with the Seven Sages. \nA connection between Ea and the South Wind is documented in texts; Essarhadon refers to her as the breeze of this god, and in an Assyrian incantation she is called \u2018\u2019the beloved of Ea\u2019\u2019.\nEnki/Ea and foreign deities.\nIn an Assyrian incantation series, Enki/Ea is identified with the Elamite god Napirisha, who might have shared with him an association with underground waters. In Elam, Ea was possibly also associated with Inshushinak and the Dilmunite god Enzag. \nAt Ebla, the local form of Ea was associated with Zila\u0161u, the local form of the Mesopotamian beer goddess Siris. He was also connected with Ra\u0161ap, an Underworld god.\nIn a god list part of an Ugaritic ritual, Ea is identified with Kothar-wa-Khasis, like him a god associated with craftsmanship. \nEa and his spouse Damgalnuna were connected with the Hurrian goddesses of fate, Hutena and Hutellura, or to their Hittite counterparts, the Gulses and the Mother-Goddess, in some lists.\nEa was identified with Kronos in the writings of Berossos in the third century BCE.\nComparisons have been sometimes made between Ea and the Greek Titan Prometheus in modern scholarship. They both feature as culture heroes, and save humanity from extinction by warning a human protege in a flood myth. Both are depicted as largely responsible for the various facets of human civilization, and the creation of man. Some scholars have argued that Prometheus was assimilated to Ea by the Greeks, and that he acquired his role as a culture hero as a result, though this view is not universally accepted. \nThough in the nineteenth and early twenty century some scholars proposed that the Israelite god Yahweh was derived from the Mesopotamian Ea, these views are largely rejected by modern scholarship.\nWorship.\nThird millenium BCE.\nEarly attestations of Enki appear in documents from the F\u0101ra (Early Dynastic IIIa) period. His main cult center was the city of Eridu, which was regarded as his home already in the sources of the Early Dynastic Period. Enki was referred to as king of the Abz\u00fb and king of Eridu in inscriptions from this period onwards. Eridu was one of the oldest cities of Sumer. The earliest evidence of occupation at the site dates to the early Ubaid period. The temple of Enki in Eridu was the E-Abz\u00fb (\u2018\u2019House of the Abz\u00fb\u2019\u2019). It could be referred to with the by name Eengura (\u2018\u2019House of Sweet Waters\u2019\u2019) in sumerian literature or cultic laments. The name of Enki/Ea\u2019s ziggurat in Eridu was Enunir (\u2018\u2019House, Temple-Tower\u2019\u2019). It is already attested in the Temple Hymns, and is mentioned in sumerian literature such as the lament for Eridu and the hymn to Haya as well as in the later syncretistic hymn to Nanaya. In the Early Dynastic period, construction work was done on the E-Abz\u00fb by a king of Ur, Elili.\nEnki was regarded as a high ranking deity in the Sumerian city states at the time of the earliest written sources, as evidenced by his prominent position in the Fara and Abu Salabikh god lists, and by royal inscriptions from the period. In the territory of Lagash, it is presumed that he was worshipped in the numerous shrines bearing the name \u2018\u2019Abz\u00fb\u2019\u2019 in the region. One of these shrines, the Abz\u00fb-banda (\u2018\u2019Small Abz\u00fb\u2019\u2019) was built by Ur-Nanshe and plundered some generations later by Lugalzagesi in his invasion of Lagash. An inscription of Enmetena commemorates his building of the Abz\u00fb of Parsir for \u2018\u2019Enki, lord of Eridu\u2019\u2019. In the inscriptions of the rulers of Lagash, Enki is characterized as the god who grants wisdom to the ruler, and who assists him with temple building. In the Stele of Vultures, Enki is invoked after Enlil and Ninhursag, and before Suen, Utu, and Ninki. After the part of the curse section of the Stele invoking Enki, the text further mentions carp-fish that go to the Abz\u00fb. According to Espak, this is possibly to be interpreted as carp-fish being released to take the oath to Enki in the Abz\u00fb, similarly to another passage which mentions doves being released to carry the oath to the moon god Suen in Ur. An inscription of Ur-Nanshe dealing with the building of a temple in Girsu contains an incantation invoking Enki to assist with the temple construction. He is asked to place the root of the reed inside the earth and to give a building oracle. In Umma, the construction of a temple for Enkigal (\u2018\u2019the great Enki\u2019\u2019) is known from an inscription of Ur-Lumma. The king Gisha-kidu describes Enki as his adviser. \nThe earliest attestations of the name of the god Ea date to the 24th century BCE. It is uncertain when Enki and Ea were fully assimilated with each other, though Alfonso Archi argues that a syncretism already existed in this period in some parts of Babylonia. In Ebla, the logogram \"d\"en-ki was used to write the name of the local form of Ea, Hayya, in the pre-sargonic period. He had a place of worship in the city, attested under the designation \u00e9 \"d\"en-ki. A festival of Ea is attested in Ebla, which took place in the twelfth month. It is known that jugglers participated in the festival, and that it included the presentation of a man and a woman to the god as well as an invocation at a gate.\nThe influence of Enki expanded beyond the confines of southern Mesopotamia at an early period. In Kish, a sanctuary of the god existed in the Old Akkadian period.Enki is one of the gods mentioned in the inscription of Naram-Sin of Akkad on the Bassekti Statue dealing with the deification of the king. As he was not among the major gods of the dynasty of Akkad, his appearance here is likely connected to his status as one of the chief deities of Sumer. A fragment from another inscription of Naram-Sin dealing with his successful campaigns against Shimanum describes Enki as the helper of the king.The end of a curse formula of an inscription of Naram-Sin invokes Enki to withdraw access to irrigation water from his enemy, and to take away his knowledge.In the period following the fall of the Akkadian Empire, the Lagashite ruler Ur-Bau commemorated his building of a temple of Enki in Girsu in an inscription. His successor Gudea built a temple on the bank of the Tigris for Enki, which is also attested from an offering list from the Ur III period.\nThe cult of Enki/Ea was particularly influential in the following Ur III and Old Babylonian periods. From the Ur III period, Enki/Ea came to be regarded as part of a triad occupying the top rank in the pantheon and consisting of himself, Anu, and Enlil. Ur III rulers Ur-Nammu, Amar-Suen, and possibly Shulgi commemorated their repair work on Enki\u2019s E-Abz\u00fb in Eridu. A temple of Enki existed in Ur itself in this period. Its name was Ege\u0161tu\u0161udu (\u2018\u2019House of Perfect Wisdom\u2019\u2019). Temples of Enki/Ea are further attested in Umma and Puzrish-Dagan. A variety of priestly as well as secular offices from the temple of Enki in Eridu are attested. A known office is that of the en-priestess. Galter points out that this position might have had a notable importance in the time of the Ur III dynasty, as the appointment of the en-priestess of Eridu was the subject of a year name during the rule of Shulgi, Amar-Suen, and Ibbi-Sin. \"Enkum\" (purification priests) and \"Ninkum\" (purification priestesses) were another class of cultic officials from Eridu in the service of Enki. They chiefly used water contained in various vessels for their rituals. In the myth Inanna and Enki, \"Enkum\" and \"Ninkum\" are servants of Enki that he sends after the goddess to retrieve the me-s that she took. \"Ishib\" (lustration priests) are also attested as part of the cult of the god, though unlike the enkum, this office was not specific to the tradition of Eridu. The myth Inanna and Shukaletuda mentions kh\u00f4l mascara worn by the ishib of Eridu.\nSecond millenium BCE.\nEa\u2019s cult spread to Mari, where the earliest evidence for its presence dates to the beginning of the second millennium. He was one of the major deities of the local pantheon. Evidence from tablets dating to the first two centuries of the second millennium indicate that he was one of the deities most frequently invoked in Mariote personal names. Some examples include Ea-malik, Nabi-Ea, Rama-Ea and Idlal-Ea. He had a sanctuary in the city, which is referred to as \u00e9 \"d\"en-ki in documents. The curse section of an inscription of Puzur-Ishtar invokes Ea alongside Dagan and Ishtar. In the great list of sacrifices of the time of Zimri-Lim, the quantity of offerings that Ea receives is only second to that of the goddess D\u012br\u012btum, and on par with high ranking deities such as Dagan and Adad.\nIn the Old Babylonian Period, Enki/Ea\u2019s cult is attested in most of the important cities of Mesopotamia. In Nippur, Enki and Damgalnuna\u2019s temple is known from a fragment of a business document from the reign of Samsu-Iluna. Enki also had a shrine in Sippar in this period. In seals from this city, Enki/Ea and Damgalnuna/Damkina are the third most invoked couple after Shamash and Aya and Adad and Shala. An inscription of Sin-kashid attests his building of a temple of Enki/Ea in Uruk, though the god is not mentioned in this king's year name formulas. Ea\u2019s temple in Kisurra was built by Itur-Shamash. Shrines of Enki/Ea are attested in Isin and Dilbat.\nEa and his wife Damkina were also the tutelary deities of Malgium, the capital of a small kingdom east of the Tigris and south of Eshnunna essentially known from sources of the Old Babylonian Period. The location of the city has not been identified. An inscription of a king of Malgium, Takil-ilissu, documents the repair work he made on the Enamtila (\u2018\u2019House of life\u2019\u2019), possibly the temple of Ea and Damkina in this city. The curse formula of the same inscription invokes Ea, Damkina, and Ea\u2019s attendant Ara. An inscription from another king, Ipiq-Ishtar, relates that after Anu, Enlil, Dingirmah and Ea determined the fate of Malgium, Ea counseled Damkina to make firm the foundations of Malgium by ensuring a long dynastic kingship in order to avert disaster for the kingdom. This has been interpreted as a possible euphemism to legitimate an usurpation of the throne. \nNur-Adad of Larsa commemorated the repair work he did on the E-Abz\u00fb of Eridu. In Larsa itself, a temple of Ea was built or rebuilt by Rim-Sin I. Rim-Sin I repeatedly used the epithet \u2018\u2019who perfectly executes the me\u2019s and rites of Eridu\u2019\u2019 in his inscriptions, which attests of the importance that Ea and Eridu held for this king. Starting with his twenty second year name, Rim-Sin I began to mention the triad Anu-Enlil-Ea in his year names, possibly reflecting his ambition to rule over southern Babylonia. The king also rebuilt Enki\u2019s temple in Ur. It was headed by a \"sanga\" (administrator). \"Enkum\" and \"ishib\" are among the offices attested. The office of \"sanga\", \"enkum\" and \"ishib\" belonged to the category of priestly offices that were transmitted by inheritance. Secular offices that could be bought are also attested, and included that of oven worker and brewer. Enki, Damgalnuna and Asalluhi were also worshipped in a chapel inside the city\u2019s main sanctuary, the Eki\u0161nugal.\nAfter Rim-Sin I, Ea is no longer mentioned in year name formulas. He only rarely appears in the royal inscriptions of the First Dynasty of Babylon. Unlike Anu and Enlil, he is not mentioned in the year formulas of Hammurabi, though he features prominently in two hymns of praise to this ruler. One of them describes Ea bestowing kingship upon the lands to Hammurabi. Hammurabi was also a patron of the E-Abz\u00fb of Eridu. \nThe kings of the First Sealand Dynasty restored the tradition of invoking Ea in year names. After the Old Babylonian period, evidence for the worship of Ea outside of Eridu is scarce. A temple of Ea and Damkina in Nippur is mentioned in a Middle Babylonian metrological text. By contrast, evidence from the First Sealand Dynasty indicates that Ea was a major deity in the state pantheon. The cult of Ea together with Enlil replaced the former triad of Anu, Enlil, and Ea at the head of the pantheon. Ea was also rather frequently invoked in personal names from the region. Curse formulas on Kassite kudurrus often invoke the triad Anu-Enlil-Ea first in their listing of deities. At the end of the second millennium BCE, the rise of Babylon led to its tutelary god Marduk becoming the head of the Mesopotamian pantheon. As a consequence, Ea\u2019s cult lost importance in favour of that of his son. Marduk took over certain functions of his father such as his role as organizer of the earth.\nFirst millennium BCE.\nEa nevertheless remained an important deity in ritual and cult in first millennium BCE Babylonia. He also retained a degree of importance in the realm of personal piety through his role as the god of magic and incantations, though by contrast he is only infrequently invoked in theophoric personal names of this period, with names formed invoking Marduk or Nabu predominating. Most of the personal names invoking Ea between the sixth and fourth centuries BCE belong to individuals from Babylon. In Babylon, Ea was worshipped in the Ekarzagina (\u2018\u2019House of Pure Quay or House of the Quay of Lapis Lazuli\u2019\u2019), a temple which was part of the complex of Esagil. The earliest evidence for the existence of a temple of the god in Babylon dates to the first millennium. He also had multiple shrines within the city. Essarhaddon had a statue of Ea and other gods made and then purified in the Ekarzagina. An inscription of Assurbanipal commemorates his repair work on this temple, and Nabonidus furnished it with a new throne. Ea\u2019s temple in Babylon is still mentioned in a description of the Esagil complex dating to the Seleucid period. Shrines of Ea are attested in Uruk, Sippar, Borsippa, and possibly Nippur between the sixth and fourth century BCE.\nEa was also worshipped in first millennium BCE Assyria. His cult there is attested in the cities of Assur, where he had several shrines, Nineveh, and Kalhu. In this region, he is usually mentioned under the name Ea-\u0161arru. The temple of Ea and Damkina at Kalhu was rebuilt by Assurnasirpal II. In Assyrian royal inscriptions, Ea is chiefly characterized by his aspect as a craftsman god who assists with building projects.\nAnatolian reception.\nThe worship of Ea was introduced into Anatolia through the Hurrian cults. According to Piotr Taracha, he might have been introduced in the region in the third millennium BCE already. In Hurrian religion, the cult of the god was adopted directly from Babylonia, and he was regarded as a prominent, active god, with a similar rank to the one he held in his region of origin. Ea\u2019s character and role were functionally identical to the ones he had in Babylonia. His name was rendered as Eyan in Hurrian, Aa\u0161 in Hittite, and Iyas in Luwian. He could be invoked as a divine witness in political treaties; the earliest evidence for this dates to the fourteenth century BCE. He could also be invoked in rituals overseeing the construction of buildings. In the procession of Hurrian gods of the sanctuary of Yazilikaya dating to the reign of the Hittite king Tudhaliya IV, Ea is depicted following Kumarbi, and preceding the male form of Shaushka and his two handmaidens Ninatta and Kulitta. In a Hurrian ritual regarding the construction of buildings, Ea receives, among numerous other offerings, ear shaped bread. The akkadian word for ear, adopted as a loanword in Hurrian, was the same as the word for wisdom. Therefore, the shape of the bread was directly connected to the attribute of the god invoked to guarantee the success of the construction. A temple of Ea is attested in Hattusa in the thirteenth century BCE. He was still regarded as a prominent god by the Hittites of Northern Syria in the first millennium BCE.\nMythology.\nCreation myths.\nEnki and the world order.\nPreserved from Old Babylonian tablets, Enki and the world order is one of the longest and best preserved myths in the sumerian language. It portrays Enki as the god responsible for the organization of the world. His prerogatives are given to him by Enlil, the chief god of the pantheon, here his older brother. In this myth, the city of Ur is depicted as the capital of Sumer. It has been argued that this reflects an original date of composition of the myth at the time of the Ur III dynasty.\nThe composition begins with the poet\u2019s praise of Enki. Enki then praises himself twice, declaring his intention to journey to Sumer, Meluhha, Magan and Dilmun, to which the Anuna-gods respond positively, praising his connection to the \"me-s\", fundamental powers and decrees of the gods which enable the functioning of human civilisation. The cult personnel of Enki performs various rituals to purify his temple. The god then travels on his boat, accompanied by his divine attendants. He blesses Sumer and the city of Ur. He then travels to Meluhha, which he blesses with luxuriant fauna and flora, and Dilmun, which he purifies, blesses, and gives to Ninsikila. He also blesses the Martu. In a fragmentary passage, he curses Elam and Marhashi.\nThe second half of the composition focuses on his institution of different crafts and his attribution of different areas of responsibilities to other gods. Enki fills the Tigris and Euphrates with water and puts Enbilulu in charge of its regulation, then he puts a deity whose name is not preserved in charge of the lagoons and marshes. He entrusts the sea, where he built a shrine, to Nanshe, plans the functioning of the rain, and puts Ishkur in charge of it. He takes care of the agricultural tools and puts Enkimdu in charge of them, then he provides the field with various grains and vegetables, and assigns this domain to Ezina. Enki assigns the task of preparing bricks to Kulla; he then builds a model house, and appoints Mushdamma in charge of house construction. After providing the steppe with vegetation and herds, he puts \u0160umugan in charge of it. He builds stalls and sheepfolds and assigns this domain to Dumuzi. He performs certain tasks, such as the demarcation of boundaries, and puts Utu in charge of the universe. He then organizes the art of weaving and assigns this domain to Uttu. In the last, and longest section, Inanna intervenes to complain that she has not received suitable functions. In a badly preserved section, Enki responds by pointing out the functions that she already holds.\nEnki and Ninhursag.\nThis myth is known from three Old Babylonian copies, one from Nippur, one from Ur, and one from an unknown provenance. It is a source of debate in modern scholarship, subject to various different translations and interpretations.\nAt the beginning of the text, the story is set in Dilmun. The goddess of Dilmun, Ninsikila, complains to Enki that her land lacks water. Enki responds by summoning underground sweet waters to Dilmun, and as a result it becomes a rich, fertile land. Some scholars identify Ninsikila as another name of Ninhursag in this myth. However, this interpretation is not universally accepted.\nThe next scene takes place in the marshes in the south of Sumer. Enki sleeps with Ninhursag, and she becomes pregnant. After nine days of gestation, she gives birth to Ninnisig/Nin\u0161ar. One day, Enki spots Ninnisig/Nin\u0161ar along the riverbank in the marsh. He also sleeps with her, she becomes pregnant, and after nine days of gestation, she gives birth to Ninkurra. Similarly, Enki sees her, has intercourse with her, she becomes pregnant, and after nine days of gestation, she gives birth to Uttu. In a variant of the story, she insteads gives birth to Ninimma, who is the one to give birth to Uttu. What follows is a fragmentary passage in which Ninhursag apparently instructs Uttu to not let Enki into her house unless he gives her cucumbers, apples and grapes as a gift. Enki summons sweet waters, making the land fertile, and a gardener gives him cucumbers, apples and grapes as thanks. Enki brings them to Uttu, introducing himself as the gardener, and she opens her house to him. He then has intercourse with her. Ninhursag removes his semen from Uttu\u2019s body, and grows eight plants from it.\nEnki spots the unfamiliar plants in the marsh, and decides to eat them in order to \u2018\u2019know their heart\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019determine their destiny\u2019\u2019. As a result, Ninhursag curses him, and he falls deathly ill. A fox offers its help to Enlil and the other gods, and Enlil promises it fame and to erect two kiskanu trees in its honor if it succeeds in bringing Ninhursag back. The fox adorns itself and goes to see Ninhursag. Due to the fragmentary passage of the text, it is unknown how it managed to convince her to heal Enki. Ninhursag asks Enki which parts of him hurt, and after he names them, she facilitates the birth of eighth deities, which removes the illness from his body. Their names contain elements which pun with the ill body parts of Enki; Abu is connected to the top of the head, and the akkadian word \"abbattu\", Ninsikila to the hair (siki), Ninkiriedu to the nose (kiri), Ninkasi to the mouth (ka), Nazi to the throat (zi), Azimua to the arm (\u00e1), Ninti to the rib (ti), and Ensag to the side (zag). The myth ends with the assignment of roles to the new deities, and a formula of praise to Enki.\nComparisons have been made between Enki\u2019s eating of the plants and its consequences and Adam and Eve\u2019s eating of the apple in Genesis.\nEnki and Ninmah.\nThis myth is known from a few tablets in sumerian from the Old Babylonian period, as well as a bilingual sumerian-akkadian copy from the Neo Assyrian period. In the first part of the myth, Enki creates mankind in collaboration with his mother, Ninmah, and several helper goddesses, while the second part focuses on a drunken contest between Ninmah and Enki.\nThe beginning of the myth describes a time in which the gods had to work for their food themselves. The gods who work grow dissatisfied with their situation. Enki, who lies asleep in his bed in the Abz\u00fb, is woken up by Nammu, here his mother, who informs him of their complaints and tells him to create a substitute to perform the hard labour. Enki devises a plan to create mankind from the clay of the Abz\u00fb, and delegates its execution to his mother, assisted by Ninmah and seven helper goddesses.\nIn the second section, the gods take part in a banquet, where Enki is praised. Enki and Ninmah get drunk, and start a competition. Ninmah fashions six humans with some kind of physical disabilities, the nature of which is not always understood. Each time, Enki successfully finds a place in society for them. Then they exchange roles. Enki creates two beings, the second of which, called Umul, is in such bad shape that Ninmah cannot decree a \"good fate\" for them. As a result, she loses the competition. Then Ninmah gives a difficult to interpret speech where she complains about being chased from her city after it was attacked, accusing Enki of being responsible for her misfortune. Due to the damage to this section of the text, Enki\u2019s answer and the resolution of the myth is unclear, but it seems that he attempts to appease Ninmah and that he finds a place for Umul. Some scholars have interpreted Umul as a premature or not fully developed baby.\nEn\u016bma Eli\u0161.\nThe Babylonian Epic of Creation, celebrating the elevation of Babylon\u2019s national god Marduk as the head of the Mesopotamian pantheon, was composed in the second half of the second millennium BCE. It has been suggested to date to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I, though there is no secure evidence for its date of composition. In En\u016bma Eli\u0161, Ea plays a crucial role in killing Abz\u00fb, here personified as a god of an older generation, and he becomes the father of the future king of the gods, Marduk.\nThe beginning of the poem describes the creation of the first gods as a result of the mingling of Tiamat and Abz\u00fb. While Abz\u00fb is usually the name of Ea\u2019s underground cosmic water domain, it appears here as the personification of these waters and as Tiamat\u2019s consort. Ea is here the son of Anu, himself created from the union of the pair Anshar and Kishar, themselves the result of the union between Lahmu and Lahamu, themselves the result of the union between Tiamat and Abz\u00fb. The clamor and restless behaviour of the younger gods angers Abz\u00fb and Tiamat. While Tiamat is initially reluctant to harm her creations, Abz\u00fb plots to kill the younger gods, supported by his vizier, Mummu. Ea becomes aware of Abz\u00fb\u2019s designs and devises a plan to foil them. He fashions a sleep spell that he casts on Abz\u00fb and Mummu. When they are asleep, he binds and then kills Abz\u00fb, and imprisons Mummu.\nAfterwards, he establishes his abode on the body of Abz\u00fb, which becomes his underground water domain. The following section deals with the birth of Marduk, Ea\u2019s son with Damkina, described as surpassing all of the gods. His grandfather Anu, delighted with the young god, gives him the four winds. The waves that Marduk creates by whirling the winds irritate a group of gods only specified as children of Tiamat. They urge her to act and avenge her consort and his vizier. She raises an army and takes the god Qingu as her new consort. When Ea learns of her preparations, he is horrified and brings the news to his grandfather Anshar. Anshar is initially angered and blames Ea for the situation caused by his murder of Abz\u00fb. Ea defends himself by arguing that it was a necessary action at the time. Anshar then orders Ea to defeat Tiamat. He fails, and Anshar then sends Anu, who also fails. Ea then summons his son and instructs him to seek out Anshar and volunteer to challenge Tiamat.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFoster proposes that while the design of Ea (in his translation \"secret words\") could refer to magic words told to Marduk, it could also be connected to Marduk\u2019s later demand to the gods to be made their king in exchange for his help. Marduk\u2019s offer is accepted by the gods. After his defeat of Tiamat, Marduk organizes the universe. He tells Ea his idea to create mankind from divine blood so that they might do the hard labor of the gods. Ea suggests that one of the rebels be killed to fashion this new creature. Marduk then demands that the rebellious gods hand over their leader in exchange for amnesty. The rebellious gods single out Qingu. He is executed, and Ea fashions mankind from his blood. While Ea still participates in the creation of mankind, in accordance with older Mesopotamian tradition where he works with the mother-goddess to fashion the new being, the idea of the creation of mankind is there attributed to his son. The role of the mother-goddess in the older tradition is here fully taken over by Ea. In the last sections dealing with Marduk\u2019s multiples names, Ea gives to his son his own name, and puts him in charge of his offices.\nThe disputation between the bird and the fish.\nThe beginning of this Sumerian disputation poem relates a creation story centered on Enki. He is depicted bringing the waters of the land together and organizing them, giving the Tigris and Euphrates their places and laying down irrigation ditches. He sets up stalls, sheepfolds, cities and hamlets, causes the people to multiply and organizes their system of government. He then organizes the marshes, and furnishes them with abundant fauna and flora.\nThe First Brick.\nEa appears in his role as a creator deity in an building incantation concerned with the renovation of temples known from Late Babylonian tablets and a late Assyrian fragment, dubbed \u2018\u2019The First Brick\u2019\u2019. It contains a creation myth in which Ea creates the Abz\u00fb and then fashions from clay various deities, as well as a king and mankind, which all participate in the temple renovation process. The deities created are Kulla, tasked to renovate the first brick, the deities Ninildu, Ninsimug and Ninagal, tasked to help with the construction, the deities Arazu, Gu\u0161kinbanda, Ninzadim, Ninkurra, A\u0161nan, La\u1e2bar, Siris, Ningi\u0161zida, Nin\u0161ar, Adag, Umunmutamgu, and Umunmutamnag, the last eight of which are instructed to supply resources to mankind for their regular offerings, and finally Kusu, tasked to perform the rites of the temple.\nThe story of the flood.\nAtra-\u1e2bas\u012bs.\nThis myth is the longest preserved Old Babylonian Epic. It is known from Old Babylonian tablets, the best preserved being three tablets written by the scribe Ku-Aya under the reign of Ammi-\u1e63aduqa, perhaps from Sippar, two Middle Babylonian pieces, one from Ras Shamra and one from Nippur, as well as fourteen Neo Assyrian pieces from the library of Ashurbanipal. Enki plays a crucial role in Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs. He first creates mankind alongside the mother goddess (variously named Mami, Mama, Nintu, and B\u0113let-il\u012b ), and later opposes Enlil\u2019s attempts to wipe it out, which culminate in the sending of the flood.\nThe myth begins describing a time in which the gods had to work for their food themselves. The gods divide the world between themselves; Anu claims the Heavens as his domain, Enlil claims the Earth, and Enki claims the underground water ocean Abz\u00fb. The task of working falls to the Igigi gods. After 40 years of toiling, they grow discontent and rebellious. They set fire to their tools and surround Enlil\u2019s Ekur shrine in Nippur. Enlil is woken up by his vizier Nusku, who informs him of the situation. Anu and Enki are brought into Enlil\u2019s presence. Enki suggests that the mother goddess creates a new being, man, to bear the load of the work instead of the Igigi. He proposes a plan to create man from a mix of clay and divine blood, and works together with the mother goddess to fashion this new creature. The god W\u00ea-ila is killed and his blood used to create mankind. The process of creation of mankind itself is not entirely preserved. The mother goddess is congratulated and named \u2018\u2019Mistress of all gods\u2019\u2019, B\u0113let-k\u0101la-il\u012b.\nIn the next section of the myth, mankind has multiplied, and they create so much noise that Enlil is unable to sleep. He decides to wipe out humanity by sending a plague. The text introduces Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs, who prays to his god, Enki, for help. Enki instructs him to tell his fellow men to stop praying and sending offerings to all of the gods, and to instead concentrate their offerings on the god responsible for the plague, Namtar. Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs executes Enki\u2019s instructions and Namtar, pleased and embarrassed by the gift, alleviates the plague. Humans multiply, and once again Enlil is unable to sleep due to the noise. He decides this time to wipe out humanity with a famine and orders Adad, the weather-god, to withhold his rain. Once more Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs prays to Enki, who instructs him to tell his fellow men to stop praying and sending offerings to all of the gods, and to instead concentrate their offerings on Adad. Adad is embarrassed by the gift and discreetly allows enough rain for humanity to survive. The composition at this point is fragmentary and entire passages are missing. Enlil resumes the drought but appoints Anu and Adad as guards of the heavens, Enki as guard of the regions under the earth, and himself as guard of the earth. His plan is foiled in an incident which involves fish being freed on the starving humanity. Enlil then confronts Enki. He decrees that humanity will be wiped out by a flood, and has him swear an oath against his will to ensure his cooperation. \nEnki finds a way to bypass his oath and sends a dream to Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs. When Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs seeks clarification about the dream, Enki speaks indirectly to him through a reed wall, and instructs him to build a boat and destroy his house. He warns him that the flood will come on the seventh day. Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs speaks with his elders and explains his departure by telling them that since Enki had a falling out with Enlil, he, as Enki's servant, must leave Enlil\u2019s earth. The people help him build his boat and load it with animals. Before the departure, he holds a banquet, but he cannot take part in it himself, as he is feeling sick with the knowledge of the impending destruction. On the seventh day the flood comes and wipes out humanity, with the exception of Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs and his family on the boat. Enki and B\u0113let-il\u012b grieve for their creation, and the gods begin to suffer from hunger, since they no longer receive food offerings. The flood lasts for seven days and seven nights. When the flood ends, Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs makes an offering to the gods. When he discovers that a part of humanity survived, Enlil is furious and confronts Enki again. The section of the text containing Enki\u2019s reply is damaged, but Enlil is convinced to let humanity live. In exchange, he has Enki and B\u0113let-il\u012b institute ways of controlling their population. Only a part of the proposals of Enki and B\u0113let-il\u012b is preserved; it concerns the creation of infertile women, and the institution of classes of priestesses that do not bear children.\nThe Eridu Genesis.\nThis fragmentary myth in the Sumerian language preserves another account of the Mesopotamian story of the flood. It is reconstituted from several related, but distinct variants preserved from two fragments, one from Nippur and one from Ur, both dating to the Old Babylonian period ( circa 1600 BCE), as well as a bilingual sumero-akkadian fragment from the library of Ashurbanipal. As the oldest fragment preserving the this myth dates from around the same period as the tablets preserving Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs, the relation between the two texts is uncertain.\nThough much of the text is lost, it is presumed that Enki plays the same role as he does in other accounts dealing with the flood, and ultimately placates Enlil, ensuring that humankind is allowed to survive. The beginning of the composition seemingly deals with the creation of man, an act for which An, Enlil, Enki and Ninhursag are credited. Another fragmentary section dealing with the establishment of the first cities describes Nintu giving Eridu to Enki. A badly preserved portion of the text deals with the scene where the flood hero, here named Ziusudra, receives Enki\u2019s warning about the flood through a wall.\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh.\nTablet XI of the standard edition of the akkadian Epic of Gilgamesh tells the story of the flood, in which Ea plays the same role as in Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs. The flood story in the Epic of Gilgamesh is believed to be based on the one in Atra-\u1e2bas\u012bs. \nGilgamesh meets the flood survivor, here named Utnapishtim, during his quest for immortality. Utnapishtim tells him how he and his wife survived the flood and were made immortal by the gods as a result. The reason why the gods sent the flood is not given. They swore an oath to make sure the task would be accomplished. Ea, who did not wish to see mankind destroyed, found a way around his oath and warned Utnapishtim. He sent him a dream, and then, speaking his words through a reed wall ,he instructed him to demolish his house and build a boat. When Utnapishtim asked him what to tell the elders and the people of his city of Shuruppak, Ea instructed him to tell them that since he had fallen out with Enlil, he could not remain on the earth and that he was going to live in Ea\u2019s underground ocean. With the help of his people, Utnapishtim built a massive boat that he filled with his kin, possessions, and animals. The flood came and wiped out humanity. It lasted for six days. When the flood stopped, Utnapishtim sent three birds to see if the waters had decreased enough for him to land. This episode has been compared to a similar one in the account of the flood related in the Book of Genesis. After the last bird failed to come back to the boat, Utnapishtim prepared an offering for the gods on the top of the mountain. When Enlil realized that humans still lived, he was furious, and demanded to know the reason for their survival. Ninurta answered that Ea was the only one capable of this feat. Ea told Enlil that his decision to wipe out humanity was a disproportionate punishment, and proposed other ways to control the size of its population. Enlil, convinced to let humanity live, granted Utnapishtim and his wife immortality.\nThe Babyloniaca.\nEa was assimilated with Kronos in the writings of Berossos. Berossos transmitted a variant of the Mesopotamian story of the flood in his Babyloniaca, a work meant to present the history of the Babylonians to the Greeks. His original work is lost, but it is known from quotes of Alexander Polyhistor and Abydenus, themselves quoted by Eusebius. There Kronos warns Xisuthros (the hellenized form of the sumerian Ziusudra) about the incoming flood, appearing to him in a dream in the version quoted by Polyhistor. He instructs him to build a boat, stuff it with provisions and animals, and take his family and kin with him. He tells him the exact month in which the flood will come, and also instructs him to bury all writings in Sippar, two details which are not present in the older cuneiform sources.\nInanna myths.\nInanna and Enki.\nThis long myth is preserved from a few tablets dating to the first third of the second millennium BCE.\nIt tells the story of how Inanna acquired the \"me-s\" from Enki, their guardian.\nThe plot begins when Inanna travels to Enki\u2019s temple in Eridu. Enki instructs his sukkal Isimud to give her food, drink, and to treat her as a friend. Inanna and Enki then begin a drinking contest. Thoroughly drunk, Enki gives her over a hundred \"me-s.\" The list of the \"me-s\" is not fully preserved. It includes the \"me-s\" connected to aspects of human culture such as kingship, war, priestly offices, speech, crafts (woodworking, metalworking, writing, smithing, leather working, masonry, and basket weaving), eroticism and intelligence, among others. Inanna takes them and loads them into the Boat of Heaven, and she departs for her city of Uruk. When he is sober again, Enki realizes that the \"me-s\" are missing. He asks Isimud where they are, and the sukkal replies that he has given them all to Inanna. Enki\u2019s reaction is missing due to the fragmentary of the text at this point, but determined to get back the me-s, he dispatches Isimud and \"enkum\" servants to seize the Boat of Heaven and its cargo.\nIsimud catches up with Inanna and tells her that while she is free to return to Uruk, Enki has ordered that the Boat of Heaven be brought back to Eridu, which angers the goddess. As soon as the \"enkums\" grab the Boat, Inanna summons her sukkal Ninshubur, who prevents them from seizing it in unclear circumstances. Enki then attempts to take back the \"me-s\" five more times. The second time, he dispatches Isimud alongside the fifty giants of Eridu, the third time alongside the fifty Lahamu of the Engur, the fourth time alongside the \u2018\u2019Big fish\u2019\u2019, the fifth time alongside the guards of Uruk, and the sixth time alongside the guards of the Turungal canal. Each time, Inanna calls Ninshubur and the Boat of Heaven is able to continue its journey. Inanna eventually reaches Uruk triumphantly and unloads the \"me-s\" among the celebration of her people. At the end of the myth Enki gives a speech that for the most part is lost, but whose last lines may indicate his reconciliation with Inanna and Uruk.\nInanna\u2019s descent into the Underworld.\nEnki/Ea plays a supporting role in the Sumerian poem Inanna\u2019s descent into the Underworld, and the shorter Akkadian poem Ishtar\u2019s descent, where he devises a plan to revive the eponymous goddess after she has been struck dead by Ereshkigal.\nIn the Sumerian version, as Inanna makes her preparations to journey into the Underworld, she instructs her sukkal Ninshubur to ask Enlil, Nanna, and Enki for help if something happens to her. The queen of the Underworld, Ereshkigal, is displeased to learn of Inanna\u2019s visit. When Inanna is brought into her presence, Ereshkigal strikes her down and hangs her corpse from a nail. Ninshubur, in mourning, goes to see Enlil and Nanna, but both of them refuse to help her. She then goes to see Enki, who expresses concern for Inanna and agrees to help. He fashions two androgynous beings, the galaturra and the kurgarra, from the dirt beneath his fingernails, and gives them the water and bread of life. He then tells them to go see Ereshkigal, who is in labour, and to express sympathy. When, appeased, she offers them gifts, Enki instructs them to refuse all of them, and instead to ask only for the corpse on the nail. Finally they are to sprinkle the food of life and the water of life upon it to revive Inanna. The plan succeeds, and Inanna is able to leave the Underworld, though she then has to find a substitute to take her place there. She picks her husband Dumuzi, who, unlike her attendants, was not mourning her properly.\nIn the Akkadian version, it is Papsukkal that comes to see the gods with the news that since Ishtar has been trapped in the Underworld, all sexual activity has ceased on earth. Ea creates Asushunamir, an androgynous figure, and instructs them to appease Ereshkigal, and then to have her swear an oath of the great gods to give them the water of life. Ishtar is revived, but Ereshkigal is furious and she curses Asushunamir to a grim life on earth.\nThe Agushaya hymn.\nEa plays a major role in this Old Babylonian literary work. Known from two tablets of unknown provenance, it is one of the most difficult literary texts of the period. Here the god appears in his usual role in Mesopotamian literature as an ingenious deity who devises plans to resolve difficult situations.\nThe poem begins with a hymn praising Ishtar in her aspect as the goddess of war. Her excessively aggressive behaviour irritates Ea, who resolves to put an end to it. He proposes to the gods to create her an opponent, \u1e62altu (\u2018\u2019discord\u2019\u2019). As he is the only one with the skill to accomplish the task he has proposed, the gods delegate its execution to him. Ea then creates \u1e62altu from the dirt beneath his fingernails. She is described as a powerful fighter of monstrous proportions. Ea then tells \u1e62altu that she has been created to disrespectfully challenge Ishtar, whom he calls Irnina ( the name of one of her aspects) and he instructs her on how she is to act. He proceeds to describe Ishtar so that \u1e62altu might recognize her. In a fragmentary section, Ea taunts \u1e62altu by praising Ishtar. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs a result, \u1e62altu flows into a rage and goes to look for the goddess. Ishtar hears of this new opponent and dispatches her sukkal Ninshubur to acquire more information on her. The confrontation between Ishtar and \u1e62altu is lost. In the last section, the goddess, now referred to with the name Agushaya, complains to Ea about \u1e62altu and demands that he sends her away. Ea responds positively, and declares that one day of the year people will perform a whirling dance in the street in her honor. The end of the poem indicates that Ishtar has abandoned her overly violent ways. \nInanna and Shukaletuda.\nAfter the prologue of this Sumerian myth, a short story relates how Enki gives to a raven certain tasks, including growing the first palm tree. After Inanna is raped in her sleep by the gardener Shukaletuda, she ravages the land with plagues in search of him, but with the advice of his father, he hides among the masses and is able to initially escape her wrath. Inanna travels to Enki\u2019s temple in Eridu, and asks for his assistance, threatening to not come back to her sanctuary until she is able to bring her attacker to justice. Enki agrees, and the goddess is able to find Shukaletuda by \u2018\u2019stretching herself across the whole sky like a rainbow\u2019\u2019. She then condemns him to death. Bott\u00e9ro presumes that the father of Shukaletuda is Enki in his interpretation of the myth.\nMiscellaneous myths.\nEnki\u2019s journey to Nippur.\nThis myth is one of the shortest and best preserved in the Sumerian language. The first part of the composition is devoted to the praising of Enki\u2019s temple in Eridu, while the second one is concerned with Enki\u2019s journey to Nippur.\nThe composition begins with a poetic description of Enki\u2019s temple, built from silver and lapis lazuli and decorated with gold. Enki\u2019s sukkal Isimud is introduced, and he praises the temple, describing its architecture and enumerating the different kind of musical instruments that play within. The temple itself is portrayed as a mountain floating upon the waters, surrounded by a garden where fruits grow and birds nest. The god then embarks on the journey to Nippur on his boat.\nIn preparation of the banquet that he is to hold in Nippur, Enki kills oxen and sheep, and brings musical instruments with him. When he arrives in Nippur, he enters the \"giguna\" (a sacred part of a temple) and begins to prepare the beer for the banquet. When the preparations are finished, Enki invites the gods to the banquet. An and Enlil are seated in the high place, and Nintu is seated at a place of honor. The gods drink and feast. At the end of the composition, Enlil, pleased by the banquet, gives a blessing praising Enki\u2019s temple.\nEnmerkar and the Lord of Aratta.\nIn a passage of the sumerian myth Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, with relates the rivalry between Uruk and Aratta and the contests between Uruk\u2019s king Enmerkar and the king of Aratta, Enmerkar instructs his messenger to Aratta to recite \u2018\u2019the spell of Nudimmud\u2019\u2019 (line 135). This is followed by a section that most scholars have interpreted as the evocation of this spell (lines 136-155). \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200aThe translation and interpretation of this passage is the subject of much discussion and debate. Some scholars argue that lines 136-155 are not the evocation of the spell of Nudimmud, and that they are therefore not part of Enmerkar\u2019s speech.\nOne subject of debate in this passage of the myth concerns the actions of Enki. One interpretation, followed by the majority of scholars, is that the passage contains an aetiological story explaining why mankind speaks different languages. According to this interpretation, the past is envisioned as a \u2018\u2019Golden Age\u2019\u2019 where mankind spoke the same language, before Enki changed the speech in their mouths and caused the emergence of a multilingual world. The reason for his actions in this context is also debated.\nAnother interpretation is that the passage refers to an unification of languages. Alster Bendt and H.L.J. Vanstiphout argue that the incantation calls upon Enki to restore the unity of languages in the future, and specifically to have mankind speak in Sumerian. An unification of the languages, but taking place in the past, has also been proposed by Christoph Uehlinger.\nMyth of Anz\u00fb.\nIn the standard Akkadian version of this myth, Ea devises a plan to defeat the Anz\u00fb bird ,who stole the tablets of destinies from Enlil , after the gods Adad, Girra, and Shara refuse to fight him. Under his advice, the gods summon Ninurta\u2019s mother Mami, cover her with honors, name her \"Mistress of all the gods\", Belet-ili, and name her son Ninurta champion of the gods. Belet-ili orders him to go fight the Anz\u00fb bird and retrieve the tablets. Ninurta confronts the Anz\u00fb bird, however, he is able to use the powers of the tablets to deflect the arrows that Ninurta shoots at him. Ninurta sends Sharur back to Ea to ask for help. Ea instructs him to cut off the feathers of his wings and throw them around, telling him that the Anz\u00fb will call the detached feathers back to his wings with a cry, and at this moment, Ninurta\u2019s arrows will be able to reach him. Ninurta accomplishes the instructions and is able to kill Anz\u00fb.\nNinurta and the turtle.\nEnki plays one of the main roles in this Sumerian text, which is the only preserved episode of a larger literary composition connected to the later Akkadian Anz\u00fb myth. It differs from this narrative in certain aspects, notably in the fact that here the Anz\u00fb bird has stolen the tablet of destinies from Enki instead of Enlil. In this composition, Enki outmaneuvers Ninurta, who, unsatisfied with the reward he received for defeating the Anz\u00fb, was plotting against him. \nThe beginning of the text preserves a short speech of the Anz\u00fb, who tells the victorious Ninurta that when Ninurta attacked him at the orders of an unnamed god, likely Enki, the tablets of destinies fell from his grasp and were returned to the Abz\u00fb. Ninurta regrets that he couldn't take possession of the tablets and their powers for himself. From his abode, Enki learns of Ninurta\u2019s thoughts. The Anz\u00fb bird brings Ninurta to the Abz\u00fb. Enki first flatters him, lauding him as the victor over the mythical bird, and offers him fame as a reward. Unhappy with his promises, Ninurta begins to secretly plot against Enki, who becomes aware of his plans. After Ninurta raises his hand against Enki\u2019s sukkal Isimud in an altercation, Enki fashions a turtle from the clay of the Abz\u00fb and stations it next to the gates of the Abzu. He lures Ninurta to this location, and pretends to be ignorant of the situation when he is attacked by the turtle. The turtle digs a pit and pushes Ninurta into it. He is unable to ascend from the pit and Enki taunts him. The mother of Ninurta, who appears here under the name Ninmena, comes to ask for her son\u2019s release. Ninmena is identified by Kramer as a name of Ninhursag in this context. Joan Goodnick Westenholz remarks that while in literary texts the name Ninmena was used to refer to her, they were otherwise regarded as distinct goddesses. Here Ninmena refers to Enki as \u2018\u2019my Uruku\u2019\u2019, an unknown epithet of his, the translation of which is uncertain according to Bott\u00e9ro. Kramer translates this epithet as \u2018\u2019my plant-eater\u2019\u2019 and connects it to the myth Enki and Ninhursag.\nNergal and Ereshkigal.\nIn this Akkadian myth, which relates how Nergal became Ereshkigal\u2019s husband and the King of the Underworld, Ea helps the god elude the dangers of the Underworld. The myth is known from two slightly different versions, a shorter one attested from a Middle Babylonian Manuscript, and a much longer one known from a seventh century source and one from Neo Babylonian Uruk.\nAfter Nergal fails to pay his respects to the vizier of the queen of the Underworld, Ereshkigal, at a banquet where he represented her, she demands that Nergal be brought before her. In the later version, Ea gives him instructions so he can elude the dangers of the Underworld; he tells him to fashion a chair from different species of wood, and then warns Nergal not to sit, eat, drink or bathe while he is there. Stephanie Dalley proposes that the chair that Nergal takes with him to the Underworld in this version may have had the same purpose as a type of chair called a \u2018\u2019ghosts chair\u2019\u2019, whose purpose, as described in a ritual text, was to prevent seizure by ghosts. While Nergal follows most of Ea\u2019s advice, he fails to follow the last one and has sex with Ereshkigal. On the seventh day, while Ereshkigal is asleep, Nergal leaves the Underworld. When Ereshkigal realizes that Nergal has left, she is distraught, and sends her vizier Namtar to ask the gods to send him back, threatening to raise the dead to eat the living if they do not comply. Ea has disguised Nergal, so Namtar does not recognize him, and he goes back to his mistress empty handed. Ereshkigal sees through Ea\u2019s scheme, however, and she tells Namtar to seize the disguised god. This time, for an uncertain reason, Namtar fails to identify him. At this point the text breaks. When it resumes, Nergal receives advice from a god, perhaps Ea. He returns to the underworld and reunites with Ereshkigal. \nIn the Middle Babylonian version, Ereshkigal plans to kill Nergal at his arrival, and Ea gives him seven plagues which he stations by each of the gates of the Underworld. While they hold the gates open, he rushes to the palace and is about to kill Ereshkigal when, to save her life, she offers him her hand in marriage and the rulership of the Underworld, which he accepts.\nAdapa and the South Wind.\nThis myth is known from fragmentary tablets from Tell al-Amarna dating to the fifteenth or fourteenth century BCE, and from Assur dating to the late second millennium BCE.\nThe myth begins by introducing Adapa, a priest of Ea. He is described as a sage who expertly accomplishes the rites of Eridu and to whom Ea gave wisdom, but not immortal life. One day he embarks on his boat into the sea. The South Wind blows strongly and sinks his boat, and frustrated, Adapa curses it and breaks its wing. On the seventh day, Anu demands to his sukkal Ilabrat where the South Wind has gone, and Ilabrat answers that Adapa broke its wing. Angered, Anu demands that Adapa be brought before him. Ea, made aware of Anu\u2019s plans, instructs Adapa to go see the gods Dumuzi and Gizzida who stand before the Gate of Anu while wearing mourning garnments, and to tell them that he is mourning them and their seasonal absence from the earth. This will put them in a good mood, they will accompany him to Anu and put a good word for him. Further, Ea tells Adapa that he must not eat or drink anything that Anu gives him, because it will kill him. Adapa accomplishes the instructions, and ingratiates himself to Dumuzi and Gizzida, who bring him before Anu. Anu demands to know why he broke the South Wind\u2019s wing. Adapa answers that he was catching fish for the temple of Ea but that the South Wing created a storm and sank his boat. Dumuzi and Gizzida speak in his favour. Appeased, Anu decides to give him the water and bread of eternal life. However, following the instructions of Ea, Adapa doesn't drink or eat anything, and loses his chance to obtain immortality. Following this, there is a gap of unknown length to the end of the story. An alternate version of the ending of the story preserved on another fragment has Anu give Adapa eternal fame instead of eternal life. \nThe meaning of the myth is debated among scholars, and many different interpretations have been proposed. In Mesopotamia, the tale was later incorporated into incantations invoking Adapa\u2019s powers for curative purposes against illnesses caused by the South Wind.\nGilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld.\nThe second section of the prologue of this sumerian poem describes Enki\u2019s journey into the Underworld by boat, in an unnamed body of water, when he is suddenly attacked. The reason for Enki\u2019s journey is unknown, and it\u2019s outcome is not told by the poet, either because it was so well known that it didn't need to be told, or because it was unimportant to the narrative of this poem. At the end of the composition, when Enkidu is trapped in the Underworld after not following the instructions for the proper behaviour there, Gilgamesh appeals to the gods to bring him back. Enlil refuses to help him, but Enki accepts, and asks Utu to open a passage so Enkidu is able to leave the Underworld.\nThe Death of Gilgamesh.\nIn this sumerian poem, Enki sends a vision to the protagonist, who lies sick on his deathbed. In the vision, he sees the assembly of the gods. They debate over his fate, as while he is a mortal, he is also the son of the goddess Ninsun. Enki says that the only man to receive immortality, Ziusudra, the flood survivor, received it in exceptional circumstances, and that Gilgamesh should therefore remain a mortal. The gods decree that while he is to die, he should have a preeminent position in the Underworld, similar to that of Ningishzida and Dumuzi, and that a wrestling festival should be set up in his honor. In another passage of the poem, with the advice of Enki, Gilgamesh organizes the building of his tomb with the help of the people of Uruk. The tomb is built in stone in the river bed of the Euphrates, which was diverted for the construction. \nIn version B of the sumerian poem Gilgamesh and Huwawa, Enki provides Gilgamesh with advice on how to defeat Huwawa, apparently speaking it through Enkidu.\nIn an atypical variant of the Epic of Gilgamesh preserved from the fragment of a tablet dated to the beginning of the Middle Babylonian Period and perhaps originating in the realm of the First Sealand Dynasty, the name of Enkidu is replaced by \"d\"40, elsewhere used to represent Ea, and the name of Gilgamesh is replaced by \"d\"30, elsewhere used to represent S\u00een. Uruk is replaced by Ur in this variant. The reason for these substitutions is unclear. The preserved parts of the story are the passages relating Enkidu\u2019s initiation into human culture and the interpretation of Gilgamesh\u2019s dreams by his mother.\nOthers.\nEnki plays a supporting role in the sumerian literary composition on the Gudea Cylinders, which relates the building of the temple of Ningirsu by Gudea of Lagash. As a wisdom and craftsmanship god, he plays an active role in the construction process, and alongside deities of his circle, he makes the final preparations for the temple before the arrival of Ningirsu. He blesses the E-ninnu at the inauguration banquet.\nEa appears in a portion of a myth focused on Zarp\u0101n\u012btum preserved from a small fragment of a tablet of uncertain date. He tells his son Marduk that she is suited to be his bride and that they should rule the sea together.\nEa is mentioned under the hellenized form of his name, Aos, in an extract from a text composed by Eudemus of Rhodes and preserved in the writings of Damascius. According to Eudemus, in Babylonian cosmology Aos was regarded as the brother of Anos (Anu) and Ilinos (Enlil), as well as the father of B\u0113los (Marduk) with Dauk\u0113 (Damkina). His parents are here Kissar\u0113 (Kishar) and Ass\u014dros (Anshar). The account given by Eudemus offers parallels to that of the En\u016bma Eli\u0161, though they are not identical; Aos is notably the brother of Anos as opposed to his son. The source that Eudemus used was likely related to the Babylonian Epic.\nA Babylonian text preserved from fragments dating either to the Seleucid or the Parthian period possibly attests of a succession myth between an older and a younger generation of gods involving Ea. Here he is the son of Anu and the brother of Ninamakalla. He and his sister are seemingly responsible for the murder of Anshar, a god of the older generation.\nHurrian myths.\nEa plays a supporting role in the Kumarbi cycle. The cycle includes several compositions in both Hittite and Hurrian. Alfonso Archi argues that these compositions were transmitted from the Hurrians to the Hittites around the fourteenth century BCE, at a time where Hittite culture was significantly influenced by that of its neighbours. Its story centers on the conflict between the god Kumarbi and his son Teshub for kingship over the gods. Ea\u2019s characterization is the same as in Babylonian myths; he appears as a resourceful god who finds solutions to difficult situations. His behavior changes in the different compositions; he appears as an ally of Kumarbi in the Song of LAMMA, criticizes both sides for the destruction they cause in the Song of Hedammu, and finally helps Teshub in the Song of Ullikummi. \nIn the Song of Emergence, Ea helps facilitate the birth of several deities, including that of the future king of the gods, Teshub. The composition begins by relating the succession of three kings of the gods, Alalu, Anu, and Kumarbi, each overthrown by the previous one. After Kumarbi becomes pregnant with several deities, including Teshub, as a result of biting off Anu's genitals during their fight, he seeks the help of Ea in Nippur. A conversation takes place between Ea, Kumarbi, Anu and Teshub to determine how he should exit Kumarbi\u2019s body. Teshub is finally born from Kumarbi\u2019s head while the god of the river Tigris is born from another place. Kumarbi then tells Ea to give him Teshub so he can devour him. In a broken section of the narrative, a rock is substituted for Teshub, and he escapes death. In a later section of the text, a discussion takes place between the gods to determine who will become their king. Teshub is frustrated by the turn of the conversation and he curses several gods, including Ea. His bull \u0160eri cautions him against cursing the gods, singling out Ea in particular. The fact that \u0160eri singles out Ea among the gods which Teshub should not curse may indicate that either he was at the time not aligned with Kumarbi and could still be won over, or that Sheri judges him to be an especially dangerous opponent. Another god later tells Ea about Teshub\u2019s curses, and Ea answers by an expression which perhaps means that any god cursing him does so at their own risk. After a large gap, another fragmentary section of the composition deals with the labours of a pregnant Earth, and Ea rewards the messenger who brings him the news of the successful birth of her children. \nIn the Song of LAMMA, Ea plays the role of a kingmaker. At the beginning, he and Kumarbi raise the eponymous deity to the kingship of the gods. The goddess Kubaba proposes that LAMMA meets the Primeval Gods, but he refuses. Ea and Kumarbi become dissatisfied with their choice of LAMMA as king. Ea enters in communication with the Primeval Gods Nara-Napsara down in the Underworld, and tells them of a scheme to overthrow him. In the end, LAMMA is defeated by Teshub, but due to the badly preserved nature of this portion of the narrative, it is uncertain how exactly the Storm-god succeeded.\nIn the Song of Hedammu, Ea becomes troubled by the destruction caused to mortals by the conflict between Kumarbi and Teshub. He reprimands both sides, pointing out the necessity of human worship of the gods and their offerings. Kumarbi is furious that Ea has admonished him in the assembly of the gods. Hoffner suggests that this moment may be the turning point in the narrative where Ea and Kumarbi\u2019s alliance breaks off, as in the Song of Ullikummi, Ea instead helps Teshub defeat Kumarbi\u2019s champion Ullikummi. \nIn the Song of Ullikummi, following his previous attempts to raise a ruler in order to supplant Teshub, Kumarbi engenders Ullikummi with a giant rock. Teshub and his allies confront Ullikummi, but they are defeated. Ta\u0161mi\u0161u advises Teshub to travel to the Abz\u00fb and ask Ea for help. Ea uncovers the source of Ullikummi\u2019s strength; he grows on the right shoulder of the giant Ubelluri, \u2018\u2019on whom the heaven and earth are built\u2019\u2019. He was placed there as an infant by the Irsirra deities to hide him from Teshub and his allies. Ubelluri was unaware of the identity of the god on his shoulder, and he did not notice his presence at first, until he began to feel pain. In order to cut off Ullikummi from Ubelluri, Ea and the Primeval Gods use the primeval copper cutting tool which was used to cut apart heaven and earth. After a break in the text, Ea expresses sadness for the many lives lost during the conflict. Teshub is then apparently able to defeat Ullikummi, though the end of the text is partially broken.\nIn the poem Ea and the Beast, Ea is engaged in a dialogue with an animal of unknown nature, the \"suppalanza\".\nThe beast makes a prophetic speech announcing the birth and rise of a new god who will become the ruler of the gods, while Ea asks him questions in return. Ea is here depicted as seemingly ignorant of the situation, a portrayal which differs from his usual role as a knowledgeable counselor to the gods.\nArchi argues that the poem is a part of the Kumarbi cycle due to similarities between their narratives, including the impregnation of someone with several deities and the manner of their conception and birth. He proposes that the new god prophesied by the beast is Teshub. Ian Rutherford remarks that the beast\u2019s question to Ea \u2018\u2019don\u2019t you know?\u2019\u2019, parallels Ea\u2019s question to Ubelluri in the song of Ullikummi \u2018\u2019don\u2019t you know, Ubelluri?\u2019\u2019 and proposes that Ea\u2019s behaviour here is explained by the poet\u2018s intention to create a parallel with the song of Ullikummi. He suggests that this might be an argument in favour of classifying the poem as part of the Kumarbi cycle, as it would explain Ea\u2019s apparent character development in the different \"songs\", from an ally of Kumarbi to an ally of Teshub.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" (2007) and \"Nurse Jackie\" (2011).\nEarly life and education.\nEli Herschel Wallach () was born on December 7, 1915, at 156 Union Street in Red Hook, Brooklyn, a son of Polish Jewish immigrants Abraham () and Bertha Wallach (n\u00e9e Schorr; ) from Przemy\u015bl. He had a brother and two sisters. He and his family were among only a few Jews in an otherwise Italian American neighborhood. His parents owned Bertha's Candy Store. Wallach graduated in 1936 from the University of Texas with a degree in history. In a later interview, Wallach said that he learned to ride horses while in Texas, explaining that he liked Texas because \"It opened my eyes to the word \"friendship...\" You could rely on people. If they gave you their word, that was it\u00a0... It was an education.\"\nTwo years later he earned a master of arts degree in education from the City College of New York. He gained his first method acting experience at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City, where he studied under Sanford Meisner. There, according to Wallach, actors were forced to \"unlearn\" all their physical and vocal mannerisms, while traditional stage etiquette and \"singsong\" deliveries were \"utterly excised\" from his classroom.\nMilitary service.\nWallach's education was cut short when he was drafted into the United States Army in 1940. He served as a staff sergeant and medic in a military hospital in Hawaii and later was sent to Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Abilene, Texas, to train as a medical administrative officer. Commissioned as a second lieutenant, he was ordered to Casablanca. Later, when he was serving in France, a senior officer noticed his acting career and asked him to create a show for the patients. He and his unit wrote a play called \"Is This the Army?\", which was inspired by Irving Berlin's \"This Is the Army\". In the comedy, Wallach and the other actors mocked Axis dictators, with Wallach portraying Adolf Hitler. Wallach was discharged as a captain following the war's end in 1945. He was awarded the Army Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the Asiatic\u2013Pacific Campaign Medal, the European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.\nCareer.\nStage actor.\nWallach took classes in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of the New School in New York City with the influential German director Erwin Piscator. He later became a founding member of the Actors Studio, taught by Lee Strasberg. There, he studied more method acting technique with founding member Robert Lewis, and with other students including Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, Herbert Berghof, Sidney Lumet, and his soon-to-be wife, Anne Jackson. Wallach became Marilyn Monroe's first new friend when she became a student at the Actors Studio, once insisting on watching him perform in \"The Teahouse of the August Moon\" from the backstage wings, simply to see up close how experienced actors perform a two-hour play. She also became friends with his wife, Anne Jackson, also studying at the Studio, and would visit the couple at their home and sometimes babysit their new child.\nIn 1945 Wallach made his Broadway debut and he won a Tony Award in 1951 for his performance alongside Maureen Stapleton in the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\". His other theater credits include \"Mister Roberts\", \"The Teahouse of the August Moon\", \"Camino Real\", \"Major Barbara\" (in which director Charles Laughton discouraged Wallach's established method acting style), \"Luv\", and \"Staircase\", co-starring Milo O'Shea, which was a serious depiction of an aging homosexual couple. He also played a role in a tour of \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" produced by the actress Katharine Cornell in 1946. He exposed Americans to the work of playwright Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco in plays including \"The Chairs\" and \"The Lesson\" in 1958, and in 1961 \"Rhinoceros\" opposite Zero Mostel. He last starred on stage as the title character in \"Visiting Mr. Green\".\nThe stage was where Wallach focused his early career. From 1945 to 1950 he and his wife, Anne Jackson, worked together acting in various plays by Tennessee Williams. The five years following, he continued only working on stage, not becoming involved in film work until 1956. During those years, however, they were generally having a hard time making ends meet. He recalls they were getting along on unemployment insurance and living in a one-room, $35 a month apartment on lower Fifth Avenue in the Village. When he did get offered early movie parts, he turned them down with no regrets, and very early in his career he explained his reasoning:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What do I need a movie for? The stage is on a higher level in every way, and a more satisfying medium. Movies, by comparison, are like calendar art next to great paintings. You can't really do very much in movies or in television, but the stage is such an anarchistic medium.\nHe said that the stage was what attracted him most and what he \"needed\" to do. \"Acting is the most alive thing I can do, and the most joyous\", he stated.\nWallach and Jackson became one of the best-known acting couples in the American theater, as iconic as Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, and Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, and they looked for opportunities to work together. During an interview, he said of Jackson, \"I have tremendous respect and admiration for her as an actress . . . we have a terrific working compatibility when we're in the same play, especially when the play means something important to us.\" When he did gravitate toward accepting parts in films, he did so to \"help pay the bills\", he said, adding, \"for actors, movies are a means to an end.\"\nDespite the fact that he eventually acted in over 90 films and almost as many television dramas, he continued to accept stage parts throughout his career, often with Jackson. They played in comedies like \"The Typists\" and \"The Tiger\" in 1963, and acted together in \"Waltz of the Toreadors\" in 1973. In 1978 they played in a revival of \"The Diary of Anne Frank\", along with their daughters, and in 1984 they acted in \"Nest of the Wood Grouse,\" directed by Joseph Papp. Four years later, in 1988, they acted in a revival of \"Cafe Crown\", a portrait of the Yiddish theater scene during its prime. They continued acting together as late as 2000, while he also took on roles alone throughout all those years.\nFilm and television roles.\nWallach's film debut was in Elia Kazan's controversial 1956 \"Baby Doll\", for which he won the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTA) as \"Most Promising Newcomer.\" \"Baby Doll\" was controversial because of its underlying sexual theme. Director Elia Kazan however, set explicit limits on Wallach's scenes, telling him not to actually seduce Carroll Baker, but instead to create an unfulfilled erotic tension. Kazan later explained his reasoning:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What is erotic about sex to me is the seduction, not the act\u00a0... The scene on the swing with Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker in \"Baby Doll\" is my exact idea of what eroticism in films should be.\nWallach went on to a prolific career as \"one of the greatest 'character actors' ever to appear on stage and screen\", notes Turner Classic Movies, acting in over 90 films. Having grown up on the \"mean streets\" of an Italian American neighborhood, and his versatility as a method actor, Wallach developed the ability to play a wide variety of different roles, although he tried to not get pinned down to any single type of character. \"Right now I'm playing an old man\", he said at age 84. But \"I've been through all the ethnic groups, from Mexican bandits to Italian Mafia heads to Okinawans to half-breeds, and now I'm playing old Jews. Who knows?\"\nNoting this versatility as a character actor, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences called him \"the quintessential chameleon\", with the ability to play different characters \"effortlessly\", and \"L.A. Times\" theater critic Charles McNulty saw Wallach's \"power to illuminate\" his various screen or stage personas as being \"radioactive.\" \"The Guardian\" has written that \"Wallach was made for character acting\", and includes movie clips from some of his most memorable roles in a tribute to him.\nIn 1961, Wallach co-starred with Marilyn Monroe, Montgomery Clift and Clark Gable in \"The Misfits\", Monroe's and Gable's last film before their deaths. Wallach never learned why he was cast in the film, although he suspected that Monroe had something to do with it. Its screenwriter, Arthur Miller, who was married to Monroe at the time, said that \"Eli Wallach is the happiest good actor I've ever known. He really enjoys the work.\"\nSome of his other films included \"The Lineup\" (1958); \"Lord Jim\" (1965) with Peter O'Toole; a comic role in \"How to Steal a Million\" (1966), again with O'Toole, and Audrey Hepburn; and as Tuco (\"the Ugly\") in Sergio Leone's \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1966) with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, followed by other Spaghetti Westerns, such as \"Ace High\". At one point, Henry Fonda had asked Wallach whether he himself should accept a part offered to him to act in a similar Western, \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (1968), which would also be directed by Leone. Wallach said \"Yes, you'll enjoy the challenge\", and Fonda later thanked Wallach for that advice.\nWallach and Eastwood became friends during the filming of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" and he recalled their off-work time together: \"Clint was the tall, silent type. He's the kind where you open up and do all the talking. He smiles and nods and stores it all away in that wonderful calculator of a brain.\" In 2003 Wallach acted in \"Mystic River\", produced and directed by Eastwood, who once said \"working with Eli Wallach has been one of the great pleasures of my life.\"\nA pivotal moment in Wallach's career came in 1953, when he, along with Frank Sinatra and Harvey Lembeck, tried out for the role of Maggio in the film \"From Here to Eternity\". Sinatra biographer Kitty Kelly notes that while Sinatra's test was good, it had none of the \"consummate acting ability\" of Wallach. Producer Harry Cohn and director Fred Zinnemann were \"dazzled\" by Wallach's screen test and wanted him to play the part. However, Wallach had previously been offered an important role in another Tennessee Williams play, \"Camino Real\", to be directed by Elia Kazan, and turned down the movie role. Wallach said that when he learned that the play had finally received financing, he \"grabbed\" the opportunity: \"It was a remarkable piece of writing by the leading playwright in America and it was going to be directed by the country's best. There really wasn't much of a choice for me.\" The film, however, went on to win eight Academy Awards, including one for Sinatra, which revived his career. Wallach recalled afterwards, \"Whenever Sinatra saw me, he'd say, 'Hello, you crazy actor!'\" Wallach, however, said he had no regrets.\nFilm historian James Welsh states that during Wallach's career, he appeared in most of the \"prestige\" television dramas during the \"Golden Age\" of the 1950s, including \"Studio One\", \"The Philco Television Playhouse\", \"The Armstrong Circle Theatre\", \"Playhouse 90\", and \"The Hallmark Hall of Fame\", among others. He won the 1966\u20131967 Emmy Award for his role in the telefilm \"The Poppy is Also a Flower\". In 2006 Wallach appeared on NBC's \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\", playing a former writer who was blacklisted in the 1950s. His character was a writer on \"The Philco Comedy Hour\", a show that aired on a fictional NBS network. This is a reference to \"The Philco Television Playhouse\", in several episodes of which Wallach actually appeared in 1955. Wallach earned a 2007 Emmy nomination for his work on the show.\nDuring the filming of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\", Wallach nearly died three times. Once, he accidentally drank a bottle of acid which was placed next to his pop bottle; another time was in a scene where he was about to be hanged, someone fired a pistol which caused the horse underneath him to bolt and run while Wallach's hands were still tied behind his back; in a different scene with him lying on a railroad track, he was close to being decapitated by steps jutting out from the train.\nWallach appeared as DC Comics' supervillain Mr. Freeze in the 1960s \"Batman\" television series. He said that he received more fan mail about his role as Mr. Freeze than for all his other roles combined. He played Gus Farber in the television miniseries \"Seventh Avenue\" in 1977, and 10 years later, at the age of 71, he starred alongside Michael Landon in \"Highway to Heaven\" episode \"A Father's Faith\". Three years later, he played aging mob boss Don Altobello in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather Part III\". Eli Wallach was an actor who guest-starred on Law &amp; Order in the episode \"The Working Stiff\" as Simon Vilanis in 1991.\nOn November 13, 2010, at the age of 94, Wallach received an Academy Honorary Award for his contribution to the film industry from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. A few years prior to that event, Kate Winslet told another audience that Wallach, with whom she acted in \"The Holiday\" in 2006, was one of the \"most charismatic men\" she'd met, and her \"very own sexiest man alive.\"\nWallach's final performance was in the short film \"The Train\" (2015). Wallach plays a Holocaust survivor who, in a meeting, teaches a self-consumed and preoccupied young man that life can change in a moment. The short was shot in early 2014 and premiered on August 6, 2015, at the Rhode Island International Film Festival.\nBetween 1984 and 1997, he also performed voiceovers in a series of television commercials for the Toyota Pickup.\nPersonal life.\nWallach was married to actress Anne Jackson, with whom he frequently shared the screen, from March 5, 1948, until his death on June 24, 2014. They had three children: Peter, Katherine and Roberta.\nA few years before 2005, Wallach lost sight in his left eye due to a stroke.\nHis niece is historian Joan Wallach Scott (daughter of his brother Sam). A.O. Scott, a film critic for \"The New York Times\", is his great-nephew.\nDeath.\nWallach died on June 24, 2014, of natural causes at the age of 98. His body was cremated.\nKatherine Wallach told \"The New York Times\" that Anne Jackson died on April 12, 2016, aged 90, at her home in Manhattan.\nFilmography.\nSelected filmography: \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10484", "revid": "37372456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10484", "title": "Electric Light Orchestra", "text": "English rock band\nElectric Light Orchestra (ELO) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970 by multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood and drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of pop and classical arrangements with futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's sole leader, co-arranging and producing every album while writing nearly all of their original material. During their first run from 1970 to 1986, Lynne and Bevan were the group's only consistent members.\nThe group's name is a pun that references both electric light and \"light orchestral music\", a popular style featured in places such as the BBC Light Programme between the 1940s and 1960s. ELO was formed out of Lynne's and Wood's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical influences. It derived as an offshoot of Wood's previous band, the Move, of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including the band's most commercially successful album, the double album \"Out of the Blue\" (1977). Two ELO albums reached the top of the British charts: the disco-inspired \"Discovery\" (1979) and the science-fiction-themed concept album \"Time\" (1981). \nIn 1986, Lynne lost interest in the band and disbanded the group. Bevan responded by forming his own band, ELO Part II, in 1988, which came to contain several of his former ELO bandmates by the early 1990s. Part II later evolved into The Orchestra after Bevan's departure in 1999. Following a brief reunion from 2000 to 2001 under Lynne's leadership, ELO once again went inactive until 2014, when Lynne re-formed the band with longtime member Richard Tandy (who had joined in 1971 and stayed until the initial 1986 split) as Jeff Lynne's ELO. Tandy died in May 2024, leaving Lynne as the sole member. In 2024 ELO embarked on their final tour, which had been announced four years prior to Tandy's death, but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring ELO's original 13-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide. They collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA, and 38 BPI awards. From 1972 to 1986 ELO accumulated 27 Top 40 songs on the UK Singles Chart, and fifteen Top 20 songs on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The band also holds the record for having the most \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Top 40 hits (20) without a number one. In 2017, four key members of ELO (Wood, Lynne, Bevan, and Tandy) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nHistory.\n1970\u20131973: Formation and early albums.\nIn 1968, Roy Wood\u2014guitarist, vocalist and songwriter of the Move\u2014had an idea to form a new band that would use violins, cellos, string basses, horns and woodwinds to give their music a classical sound, allowing rock music to \"pick up where the Beatles left off\" in a new direction. The orchestral instruments would be the main focus, rather than the guitars. Jeff Lynne, frontman of fellow Birmingham group the Idle Race, was excited by the concept. When Trevor Burton left the Move in February 1969, Lynne was asked by Wood to join, only to say no, as he was still focused on finding success with his band. But in January 1970, when Carl Wayne quit the band, Lynne accepted Wood's second invitation to join, on the condition that they focus their energy on the new project.\nOn 12 July 1970, when Wood added cellos to a Lynne-penned song intended to be a Move B-side, the new concept became a reality and \"10538 Overture\" became the first Electric Light Orchestra song. The original plan was to end the Move following the release of the \"Looking On\" album at the end of 1970, crossing over to the new unit in the new year. But to help finance the fledgling band, one further Move album, \"Message from the Country\", was recorded during the lengthy ELO recordings and released in mid-1971. The resulting debut album, \"The Electric Light Orchestra\", was released in December 1971. Only the trio of Wood, Lynne and Bevan played on all songs, with Bill Hunt supplying the French Horn parts and Steve Woolam playing violin. It was released in the United States in March 1972 as \"No Answer\". The name was chosen after a U.S. record company secretary had tried to ring the UK company to get the name of the album. They were unavailable so she left a note reading \"No answer\". \"10538 Overture\" became a UK top-ten hit. With both bands' albums in the stores simultaneously, the Move and ELO both appeared on television during this period.\nELO's debut concert took place on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey, with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards/French horn), Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello), and Richard Tandy (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the recordings for the band's second LP. Taking Hunt and McDowell with him, Wood left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, who Wood felt failed in his role, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy. However, Arden would manage Wizzard, despite Wood's negative comments towards Arden. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, who had been the driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello, respectively.\nThe new line-up performed at the 1972 Reading Festival on 12 August 1972. Barcus Berry instrument pick-ups, now sported by the band's string trio, allowed them to have proper amplification on stage for their instruments, which had previously been all but drowned out by the electrified instruments. The band released their second album, \"ELO 2\", in early 1973, which produced their second UK top 10 and their first US chart single, an elaborate version of the Chuck Berry classic \"Roll Over Beethoven\" (which also incorporated the first 2 or 3 lines from the first movement of Beethoven's own Fifth Symphony). ELO also made their first appearance on \"American Bandstand\". During the recording of the third album, Gibson was let go after a dispute over money, Mik Kaminski joined as violinist, and Walker left since touring was keeping him away from his family too much. Remaining cellist Edwards finished the cello parts for the album. The resulting album, \"On the Third Day\", was released in late 1973, with the American version featuring the popular single \"Showdown\". After leaving Wizzard, Hugh McDowell returned as the group's second cellist, also in late 1973, in time to appear on the \"On the Third Day\" cover in some regions, despite not having played on the album.\n1974\u20131982: Global success and concept albums.\nFor the band's fourth album, \"Eldorado\", a concept album about a daydreamer, Lynne stopped multi-tracking strings and hired Louis Clark as string arranger with an orchestra and choir. ELO's string players still continued to perform on recordings, however. The first single off the album, \"Can't Get It Out of My Head\", became their first US top 10 hit, and \"Eldorado, A Symphony\" became ELO's first gold album. Mike de Albuquerque departed the band during the recording sessions as he wished to spend more time with his family, and consequently much of the bass on the album was performed by Lynne.\nFollowing the release of \"Eldorado\", Kelly Groucutt was recruited as a bassist and secondary vocalist and in early 1975, Melvyn Gale replaced Edwards on cello. The line-up stabilised as the band took to a decidedly more accessible sound. ELO had become successful in the US at this point and the group was a star attraction on the stadium and arena circuit, and appeared on \"The Midnight Special\" more than any other band in that show's history with four appearances (in 1973, 1975, 1976, and 1977).\n\"Face the Music\" was released in 1975, producing the hit singles \"Evil Woman\", their third UK top 10, and \"Strange Magic\". The opening instrumental \"Fire on High\", with its mix of strings and acoustic guitars, saw heavy exposure as the theme music for the American television programme \"CBS Sports Spectacular\" in the mid-1970s. The group toured extensively from 3 February to 13 April 1976, playing 68 shows in 76 days in the US.\nTheir sixth album, the platinum-selling \"A New World Record\", became their first UK top 10 album when it was released in 1976. It contained the hit singles \"Livin' Thing\", \"Telephone Line\", \"Rockaria!\" and \"Do Ya\", the last a re-recording of the Move's final single. The band toured in support in the US only from September 1976 to April 1977 with a break in December, then an \"American Music Awards\" show appearance on 31 January 1977, plus a one-off gig in San Diego in August 1977.\n\"A New World Record\" was followed by a multi-platinum-selling album, the double LP \"Out of the Blue\", in 1977. \"Out of the Blue\" featured the singles \"Turn to Stone\", \"Sweet Talkin' Woman\", \"Mr. Blue Sky\", and \"Wild West Hero\", each becoming a hit in the United Kingdom. The band then set out on a nine-month, 92-date world tour, with an enormous set and a hugely expensive spaceship stage with fog machines and a laser display. In the United States the concerts were billed as \"The Big Night\" and were their largest to date, with 62,000 people seeing them at Cleveland Stadium. \"The Big Night\" became the highest-grossing live concert tour in music history up to that point (1978). The band played at London's Wembley Arena for eight straight sold-out nights during the tour, another record at the time. During an Australian tour in early 1978, Electric Light Orchestra were presented with 9 platinum awards for the albums \"Out of the Blue\" and \"A New World Record\".\nIn 1979, the multi-platinum album \"Discovery\" was released, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart. Although the biggest hit on the album (also ELO's biggest hit overall) was the rock song \"Don't Bring Me Down\", the album was noted for its heavy disco influence. \"Discovery\" also produced the hits \"Shine a Little Love\" (their only No. 1 hit on a US singles chart---Radio &amp; Records (R&amp;R)), \"Last Train to London\", \"Confusion\", and \"The Diary of Horace Wimp\". Another song, \"Midnight Blue\", was released as a single in southeast Asia. The band recorded promotional videos for all the songs on the album.\nBy the end of 1979, ELO had reached the peak of their stardom, selling millions of albums and singles, and even inspiring a parody/tribute song on the Randy Newman album \"Born Again\", titled \"The Story of a Rock and Roll Band\". During 1979, Jeff Lynne also turned down an invitation for ELO to headline the August 1979 Knebworth Festival concerts. That allowed Led Zeppelin to headline instead.\nIn January 1980, Hugh McDowell, Melvyn Gale, and Mik Kaminski were fired, as Jeff Lynne sought to take the band in a more modern direction. Later that year, Lynne was asked to write for the soundtrack of the musical film \"Xanadu\" and provided half of the songs, with the other half written by John Farrar and performed by the film's star Olivia Newton-John. The film performed poorly at the box office, but the soundtrack did exceptionally well, eventually going double platinum. The album spawned hit singles from both Newton-John (\"Magic\", a No. 1 hit in the United States, and \"Suddenly\" with Cliff Richard) and ELO (\"I'm Alive\", which went gold, \"All Over the World\" and \"Don't Walk Away\"). The title track, performed by both Newton-John and ELO, is ELO's only song to top the UK singles chart. More than a quarter of a century later, \"Xanadu\", a Broadway musical based on the film, opened on 10 July 2007 at the Helen Hayes Theatre to uniformly good reviews. It received four Tony Award nominations. The musical received its UK premiere in London in October 2015.\nIn 1981, ELO's sound changed again with the science fiction concept album \"Time\", a throwback to earlier, more progressive rock albums like \"Eldorado\". With the string section now departed, synthesisers took a dominating role, as was the trend in the larger music scene of the time; although studio strings were present on some of the tracks conducted by Rainer Pietsch, the overall soundscape had a more electronic feel in keeping with the futuristic nature of the album. \"Time\" topped the UK charts for two weeks and was the last ELO studio album to be certified platinum in the United Kingdom until \"Alone in the Universe\" in 2015. Singles from the album included \"Hold On Tight\", \"Twilight\", \"The Way Life's Meant to Be\", \"Here Is the News\" and \"Ticket to the Moon\". However, the release of the single for \"Rain Is Falling\" in 1982 was the band's first single in the US to fail to reach the \"Billboard\" Top 200 since 1975, and the release of \"The Way Life's Meant to Be\" similarly was their first single in the UK to fail to chart since 1976. The band embarked on their last world tour to promote the LP. For the tour, Kaminski returned to the line-up on violin, whilst Louis Clark (synthesizers) and Dave Morgan (guitar, keyboards, synthesizers, vocals) also joined the on stage line-up. Clark had previously handled string arrangements for the band.\n1983\u20131986: \"Secret Messages\", \"Balance of Power\", disbanding.\nJeff Lynne wanted to follow \"Time\" with a double album, but CBS blocked his plan on the grounds that a double vinyl album would be too expensive and not sell as well as a single record, so as a result, the new album was edited down to a single disc and released as \"Secret Messages\" in 1983; many of the out-takes were later released on \"Afterglow\" or as B-sides of singles. The album was a hit in the UK reaching the top 5, but its release was undermined by a string of bad news that there would be no tour to promote the LP. Lynne, discouraged by the dwindling crowds on the \"Time\" tour, CBS's order to cut \"Secret Messages\" down to one disc, and his falling out with manager Don Arden, decided to end ELO in late 1983.\nDrummer Bevan moved on to play drums for Black Sabbath, and bassist Groucutt, unhappy with no touring income that year, sued Lynne and Jet Records in November 1983, eventually resulting in a settlement for the sum of \u00a3300,000 (equivalent to \u00a31,004,913 in 2025). While \"Secret Messages\" debuted at number four in the United Kingdom, it subsequently performed poorly in the charts, with a lack of hit singles (though \"Rock 'n' Roll Is King\" was a sizeable hit in UK, the US and Australia) and a lukewarm media response. That same year, Lynne moved into production work: having already produced two tracks for the Dave Edmunds album \"Information\", he would produce six cuts for his next, \"Riff Raff\" in 1984, and one cut on the Everly Brothers reunion album \"EB 84\". He also composed a track for former ABBA member Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog's 1985 album \"Eyes of a Woman\".\nLynne and Tandy recorded tracks for the 1984 \"Electric Dreams\" soundtrack under Lynne's name; however, Lynne was contractually obliged to make one more ELO album. So Lynne, Bevan and Tandy returned to the studio in 1984 and 1985 as a three-piece (with Christian Schneider playing saxophone on some tracks and Lynne again doubling on bass in addition to his usual guitar in the absence of an official bass player) to record \"Balance of Power\", released early in 1986 after some delays. Though the single \"Calling America\" placed in the Top 30 in the United Kingdom (number 28) and Top 20 in the States, subsequent singles failed to chart. The album lacked actual classical strings, which were replaced once again by synthesizers, played by Tandy and Lynne. However, despite being a 3-piece, much of the album was made by Lynne alone, with Tandy and Bevan giving their additions later.\nThe band was then rejoined by Kaminski, Clark and Morgan, adding Martin Smith on bass guitar, and proceeded to perform a small number of live ELO performances in 1986, including shows in England and Germany along with US appearances on \"American Bandstand\", \"Solid Gold\", then at Disneyland that summer. ELO performed at the Heart Beat 86 charity concert organised by Bevan in the band's hometown of Birmingham on 15 March 1986; a hint of Lynne's future was seen when George Harrison appeared onstage during the encore, joining in the all-star jam of \"Johnny B. Goode\". ELO's last performance for several years occurred on 13 July 1986 in Stuttgart, Germany, opening for Rod Stewart. With Lynne no longer contractually obliged to further performances, ELO effectively disbanded after that show, but there was no announcement made of it for the next two years, during which George Harrison's Lynne-produced album \"Cloud Nine\" and the pair's follow-up (with Roy Orbison, Bob Dylan and Tom Petty as Traveling Wilburys) \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1\" were released.\n1989\u20131999: ELO Part II.\nBev Bevan (under an agreement with Lynne, who co-owned the ELO name with him) continued on in 1989 as ELO Part II, initially with no other former ELO members, but with ELO's main orchestra conductor, Louis Clark. Bevan also recruited Eric Troyer, Pete Haycock, and Neil Lockwood. ELO Part II released their debut album, \"Electric Light Orchestra Part Two\", in May 1991, featuring songs written primarily by Troyer and Haycock. Mik Kaminski, Kelly Groucutt and Hugh McDowell, at the time working in a group called OrKestra, joined the group for their first tour in 1991. While McDowell did not stay long-term, Groucutt and Kaminski became fully fledged members.\nIn 1994, after the departure of Haycock and Lockwood, the remaining five members of Part II recorded \"Moment of Truth\", featuring songs mostly written by Troyer and the band's newest member, singer-songwriter and guitarist Phil Bates. This line-up toured up to 1999, following which Bates was replaced by Parthenon Huxley. Bevan retired from the line-up later that year and sold his share of the ELO name to Jeff Lynne in 2000, after Lynne had expressed his dismay that in certain areas the band were billed as 'ELO', rather than with '...Part II' added, suggesting it was the original outfit. The remaining band members continued after they changed the group's name to The Orchestra. In 2001 The Orchestra released their debut (and so far only) album, \"No Rewind\". The Orchestra continues to tour, although Kaminski is the sole remaining member of the group to have been a member or affiliate of ELO, following Kelly Groucutt's death in 2009 and Louis Clark's in 2021.\n2000\u20132001: Reformation.\nLynne's comeback with ELO began in 2000 with the release of a retrospective box set, \"Flashback\", containing three CDs of remastered tracks and a handful of out-takes and unfinished works, most notably a new version of ELO's only UK number one hit, \"Xanadu\". In 2001 \"Zoom\", ELO's first album of new material since 1986, was released. Though billed and marketed as an ELO album, the only returning member other than Lynne was Tandy, who performed on one track. Guest musicians included former Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison. Upon completion of the album, Lynne re-formed the band with completely new members, including his then-girlfriend Rosie Vela (who had released her own album, \"Zazu\", in 1986) and announced that ELO would tour again. Tandy rejoined the band a short time afterwards for two television live performances: \"VH1 Storytellers\" and a PBS concert shot at CBS Television City, later titled \"Zoom Tour Live\" and released on DVD. Besides Lynne, Tandy and Vela, the new live ELO line-up included Gregg Bissonette (drums, backing vocals), Matt Bissonette (bass guitar, backing vocals), Marc Mann (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals), Peggy Baldwin (cello), and Sarah O'Brien (cello). However, the planned tour was cancelled, reportedly due to poor ticket sales.\n2001\u20132013: Non-performing work, reissues and miniature reunions.\nFrom 2001 to 2007, Harvest and Epic/Legacy reissued ELO's back catalogue. Included amongst the remastered album tracks were unreleased songs and outtakes, including two new singles. The first was \"Surrender\", which registered on the lower end of the UK Singles Chart at number 81, some 30 years after it was written in 1976. The other single was \"Latitude 88 North\".\nIn August 2010, Eagle Rock Entertainment released \"Live \u2013 The Early Years\" in the UK as a DVD compilation that included \"Fusion \u2013 Live in London\" (1976) along with previously unreleased live performances at Brunel University (1973) and on the German TV show \"Rockpalast\" (1974). \"The Essential Electric Light Orchestra\" artwork was re-jigged to feature two different covers. The US and Australian releases shared one design, while the rest of the world featured the other for a new double album release in October 2011.\n\"\" was released on 8 October 2012. It is an album of re-recordings of ELO's greatest hits, performed by Lynne exclusively, along with a new song titled \"Point of No Return\". Released to coincide with Lynne's second solo album, \"Long Wave\", these new albums contained advertisement cards, announcing the re-release of expanded and remastered versions of both the 2001 album \"Zoom\" and Lynne's debut solo album, \"Armchair Theatre\", originally released in 1990. Both albums were re-released in April 2013 with various bonus tracks. Also released was the live album \"Electric Light Orchestra Live\", showcasing songs from the Zoom tour. All three releases also featured new studio recordings as bonus tracks.\nThough not billed as Electric Light Orchestra (or the abbreviated ELO), in 2012, Lynne and Tandy reunited, largely under Lynne's name, to perform stripped-down acoustic versions of their ELO hits for the BBC television special \"Jeff Lynne Acoustic: Live from Bungalow Palace\". Lynne and Tandy reunited again on 12 November 2013 to perform, under the name Jeff Lynne and Friends, \"Livin' Thing\" and \"Mr. Blue Sky\" at the Children in Need Rocks concert at Hammersmith Eventim Apollo, London. The backing orchestra was the BBC Concert Orchestra, with Chereene Allen on lead violin.\n2014\u2013present: Jeff Lynne's ELO.\nThe success of the Children in Need performance was followed by support from BBC Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who had Lynne as his on-air guest and asked his listeners if they wanted to see ELO perform. The 50,000 tickets for the resulting BBC Radio 2's \"Festival in a Day\" in Hyde Park on 14 September 2014 sold out in 15 minutes. Billed as \"Jeff Lynne's ELO\", Lynne and Richard Tandy were backed by the Take That/Gary Barlow band from the Children in Need concert, led by Mike Stevens and the BBC Concert Orchestra. Lynne chose to use the name as a response to ELO offshoots ELO Part II and The Orchestra. Chereene Allen was again the lead violinist for the band. The development of modern digital processing added a smoother finish to the work, which led Lynne to reconsider his preference for studio work, hinting at a UK tour in 2015. On 8 February 2015, Jeff Lynne's ELO played at the Grammy Awards for the first time. They performed a medley of \"Evil Woman\" and \"Mr. Blue Sky\" with Ed Sheeran, who introduced them as \"A man and a band who I love\".\nOn 10 September 2015, it was announced that a new ELO album would be released. The album was to be under the moniker of Jeff Lynne's ELO, with the band signed to Columbia Records. \"Alone in the Universe\" was released on 13 November 2015. The album was ELO's first album of new material since 2001's \"Zoom\". The first track, and single, \"When I Was a Boy\" was made available for streaming on the same day and a music video for the song was also released. A small promotional tour followed the album's release, which saw Jeff Lynne's ELO perform a full concert for \"BBC Radio 2\" along with their first two shows in the United States in 30 years, both which sold out very quickly. Jeff Lynne's ELO also made rare US television appearances on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" and \"CBS This Morning\". A 19-date European tour was announced for 2016, with the band playing the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury Festival on 26 June 2016.\nIn 2017 they played their \"Alone in the Universe\" tour. That same year, on 7 April, they played at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as they were inducted during the 32nd Annual Induction Ceremony.\nThe band continued to tour in 2018 in North America and Europe. A video was created for the City of Birmingham which used the original recording of \"Mr. Blue Sky\" as its music; this was played at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games Closing Ceremony during the handover presentation of Birmingham 2022. On 3 August 2018, \"Secret Messages\" was reissued \"as originally conceived\" as a double album. It included several cut tracks, such as the CD exclusive bonus track \"Time After Time\", B-side exclusives \"Buildings Have Eyes\" and \"After All\", the \"Afterglow\" exclusives \"Mandalay\" and \"Hello My Old Friend\", and the 2001 reissue exclusives \"Endless Lies\" and \"No Way Out\". On 22 October 2018, Lynne announced that Jeff Lynne's ELO would embark on a 2019 North American tour from June to August 2019.\nELO released their 14th album, \"From Out of Nowhere\", on 1 November 2019. While a tour from the album was announced to begin in October 2020, the official Jeff Lynne's ELO Twitter page later announced that the tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn 18 March 2024, ELO announced the Over And Out Tour, a final tour of North America that would span August to October 2024. Tandy died in 2024, at the age of 76. Lynne announced his death on social media on 1 May 2024, and said Tandy had been \"a remarkable musician and friend.\" On 21 October 2024, it was announced that ELO would perform a farewell concert at the BST event in Hyde Park, London, on 13 July 2025. That same month, it was reiterated that Lynne was \"unambiguous\" about the tour being the band's last. On 12 July, the day before the show was to take place, it was announced to have been cancelled due to Lynne having a 'systemic infection' and would not be rescheduled.\nLegacy and influence.\nAccording to music journalist Simon Price, ELO is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;arguably the most uncool, even defiantly anti-cool, of the lot and have been the slowest to be rehabilitated since\u00a0... They've been sampled by dozens upon dozens of acts, from Company Flow to the Pussycat Dolls, if you go looking. Every now and then in my journalistic career, it's been possible to coax a contemporary band to admit to an ELO influence; the Flaming Lips and Super Furry Animals being two examples. But the band in whom I perceive the greatest amount of ELO DNA are outside the rock genre altogether: Daft Punk.\"\nIn November 2016, Jeff Lynne's ELO won Band of the Year at the Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards. In October 2016, ELO were nominated for the 2017 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time. It was the first time the Hall had announced in advance the members of bands who would be inducted; the members of ELO listed were Jeff Lynne, Roy Wood, Bev Bevan and Richard Tandy. On 20 December 2016, it was announced ELO had been elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2017.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "10487", "revid": "49886700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10487", "title": "Evil Dead II", "text": "1987 film by Sam Raimi\nEvil Dead II (also known in publicity materials as Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn) is a 1987 American comedy horror film directed by Sam Raimi, who co-wrote it with Scott Spiegel. It is the sequel to \"The Evil Dead\" (1981) and the second installment in the Evil Dead franchise. It stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams, who vacations with his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods. He discovers an audio tape of recitations from a book of ancient texts, and when the recording is played, it unleashes a number of demons which possess and torment him.\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of \"Crimewave\" (1985), Raimi, producer Robert Tapert, and Campbell began work on a sequel to \"The Evil Dead\" at the insistence of their publicist Irvin Shapiro. Having endorsed the original film, author Stephen King brought the project to the attention of producer Dino De Laurentiis, with whom he had been making his directorial debut \"Maximum Overdrive\" (1986). De Laurentiis agreed to provide financial backing, and assigned the filmmakers a considerably larger budget than they had worked with on the original film. Although Raimi had devised a premise set in the Middle Ages and involving time travel, De Laurentiis requested that the film be similar to its predecessor.\n\"Evil Dead II\" was shot in Wadesboro, North Carolina and Detroit, Michigan in 1986, and featured extensive stop-motion animation and prosthetic makeup effects created by a team of artists that included Mark Shostrom, Greg Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Tom Sullivan, the latter of whom returned from the original film. The finished film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987; due to its high level of violence, it was released through a pseudonymous distributor to curb an anticipated X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Much like \"The Evil Dead\", it was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its humor, Raimi's direction, and Campbell's performance; many have considered it superior to its predecessor and similarly as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Despite being given a somewhat limited release, it was a minor box office success, grossing just under $6 million.\nAs with the first film, \"Evil Dead II\" has accumulated a large, international cult following. In 1992, it was followed by the direct sequel \"Army of Darkness\", which utilized Raimi's original premise; in 2013, it was followed by the soft reboot and continuation \"Evil Dead\"; and in 2015, it was followed by the television series \"Ash vs Evil Dead\". A fifth film in the series, \"Evil Dead Rise\", was released on April 21, 2023.\nPlot.\nMichigan State University students Ash Williams and his girlfriend, Linda, take a romantic getaway to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods. While in it, Ash plays a tape of archaeologist Raymond Knowby, the cabin's previous inhabitant, reciting passages from the \"Book of the Dead\", \"Necronomicon Ex-Mortis\", which he uncovered during an archaeological dig. The recorded incantation unleashes an unseen evil force, known as the Kandarian Demon, that kills and possesses Linda, turning her into a \"deadite\". Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and buries her in a shallow grave near the cabin. As dawn approaches, the evil force throws Ash through the woods. He briefly becomes possessed by the demon, but the sunlight expels it from him.\nAsh attempts to flee the area but finds that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. The entity chases him back to the cabin, where Linda's revived head bites his hand. He runs to the toolshed and destroys the deadite Linda with a chainsaw, but his bitten right hand becomes possessed and tries to kill him. Ash severs it with the chainsaw and tries to shoot it with a shotgun, but the hand mocks him and escapes. Meanwhile, Knowby's daughter Annie and her research partner, Ed Getley, return from the dig with the missing pages of the \"Necronomicon\". Blocked by the destroyed bridge, they enlist handyman Jake and his girlfriend Bobby Joe to lead them to the cabin on foot. There they find an embattled Ash, who accidentally grazes Bobby Joe while trying to shoot his possessed hand. Assuming that he murdered Annie's parents, the newcomers lock him in the cellar.\nThe four new arrivals listen to the rest of the tape recording, where Knowby explains that he killed his wife Henrietta after she was possessed by the Kandarian Demon, then buried her in the cellar. The deadite Henrietta bursts from her grave and possesses Ed, whom Ash, now freed from the cellar, dismembers with an axe. Bobby Joe flees through the woods when Ash's severed hand latches onto hers, but demonically possessed trees drag her to her death. Annie translates two of the \"Necronomicon\"'s pages, which portray a fabled hero with a blade for a hand and detail a ritual that will make the evil take physical form and then open a portal through which it may be banished. Before they can perform the ritual, Jake turns on them and throws the pages into the cellar, forcing them at gunpoint to locate Bobby Joe. In the woods, Ash becomes possessed once more and attacks Jake. Annie retreats to the cabin and accidentally stabs Jake with a Kandarian dagger, mistaking him for the possessed Ash, before Henrietta kills him. Deadite Ash tries to kill Annie, but returns to his normal self upon seeing Linda's necklace.\nWith Annie's help, Ash modifies the chainsaw, attaches it to the stump of his right arm, and cuts the shotgun's barrel. After finding the missing pages of the \"Necronomicon\" in the cellar, Ash kills Henrietta. Annie starts reciting the incantation, which makes the demon physically manifest and attack Ash. As she attempts to finish the incantation, Ash's severed hand stabs her in the back. Annie completes the ritual with her dying breath, opening up a whirling temporal vortex which sucks in not only the demon, but also Ash and his Oldsmobile Delta 88.\nAsh and his Oldsmobile land in the Middle Ages. A group of knights confront him and initially mistake him for a deadite, but when a harpy-like Deadite appears and Ash blasts it with his shotgun, they hail him as their champion. Realizing that he is the hero prophesied in the book, Ash breaks down and screams in dismay.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe concept of a sequel to \"The Evil Dead\" was discussed during location shooting on the first film. Irvin Shapiro, the film's publicist, pushed writer/director Sam Raimi to devise a premise for such a film. Working with screenwriter Sheldon Lettich, Raimi settled on a story in which Ash was sucked through a time portal to the Middle Ages, where he would encounter more deadites. Shapiro was enticed by the concept, and took out advertisements in trade magazines to promote the project, then titled \"Evil Dead II: Evil Dead and the Army of Darkness\", in May 1984. After Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox passed on it, the sequel was shelved in favor of Raimi's next film, \"Crimewave\" (1985), a comedy/crime film co-written with Joel and Ethan Coen.\nAfter \"Crimewave\" was released to critical and audience disinterest, Raimi and his partners at Renaissance Pictures, producer Robert Tapert and actor/co-producer Bruce Campbell, took Shapiro up on his sequel offer, knowing that another flop would further stall their already-lagging careers. Development of \"Evil Dead II\" initially began in collaboration with Embassy Pictures, which had co-financed and distributed \"Crimewave\", but the filmmakers eventually felt that they were being stalled after five months' pre-production work, and began conducting interviews with prospective cast and crew members. Around this time, producer Dino De Laurentiis, the owner of production and distribution company De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG), asked Raimi if he would be interested in directing an adaptation of the Stephen King novel \"Thinner\". Raimi turned down the offer, but De Laurentiis remained in touch with the young filmmaker.\nThe \"Thinner\" adaptation was part of a deal between De Laurentiis and King to produce several adaptations of King's successful horror novels and short stories. At the time, King was directing the first such adaptation, \"Maximum Overdrive\" (1986), based on his short story \"Trucks\". He had dinner with a crew member who had been among those interviewed by Raimi and his colleagues about \"Evil Dead II\", and told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a glowing review of the first film that helped it become an audience favorite at Cannes, called De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film. While he was initially skeptical, De Laurentiis met with Renaissance, who highlighted the first film's extremely high revenue in the Italian market. Within twenty minutes, De Laurentiis agreed to finance \"Evil Dead II\" for $3.6 million. Raimi and Tapert had desired $4 million for the production, but De Laurentiis requested a film that was similar to its predecessor instead of their original medieval-themed proposal, which was instead used for the second sequel, \"Army of Darkness\" (1992).\nWriting.\nDespite Raimi's crew having only recently received the funding necessary to produce the film, the script had been written for some time, having been composed largely during the production of \"Crimewave\". Raimi contacted his old friend Scott Spiegel, who had collaborated with Campbell and others on the Super 8 mm films they had produced during their childhood in Michigan. Most of these films had been comedies, and Spiegel felt that \"Evil Dead II\" should be less straight horror than the first. Initially, the opening sequence included all five of the original film's characters; however, in an effort to save time and money, all but Ash and Linda were cut from the final draft. The film went through several other drafts, including a group of escaped convicts holding Ash captive in the cabin while searching for buried treasure.\nSpiegel and Raimi wrote most of the film in their house in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California, where they were living with the aforementioned Coen brothers, as well as actors Frances McDormand, Kathy Bates, and Holly Hunter (the primary inspiration for the Bobby Joe character). Due both to the distractions of their house guests and the films they were involved with, \"Crimewave\" and Josh Becker's \"Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except\", the script took a long time to finish.\nAmong the film's many inspirations include the Three Stooges and slapstick comedy films. Ash's fights with his disembodied hand come from a film made by Spiegel as a teenager titled \"Attack of the Helping Hand\", which was itself inspired by television commercials advertising Hamburger Helper. The \"laughing room\" scene, where all the objects in the room seemingly come to life and begin to cackle maniacally along with Ash, came about after Spiegel jokingly used a gooseneck lamp to visually demonstrate a Popeye-esque laugh. Spiegel's humorous influence can be seen throughout the film, perhaps most prominently in certain visual jokes. For instance, when Ash traps his rogue hand under a pile of books, on top is \"A Farewell to Arms\".\nWhile Raimi and Campbell have stated that \"Evil Dead II\" was intended as a direct sequel, there are differences between the first installment and the recap at the beginning of the second: for example, the Necronomicon is destroyed in a fire by Ash during the conclusion of \"The Evil Dead\", but remains intact in \"Evil Dead II\". The corpses of Ash's friends from the first are absent, and are never mentioned. The cabin itself remains perfectly intact until the events of this film, despite much of it having been destroyed in the original film.\nFilming.\nWith the script completed and a production company secured, principal photography began on \"Evil Dead II\". The production commenced in Wadesboro, North Carolina, not far from De Laurentiis' offices in Wilmington. De Laurentiis had wanted them to film in his elaborate Wilmington studio, but the production team felt uneasy being so close to the producer, so they moved to Wadesboro, approximately three hours away. Steven Spielberg had previously filmed \"The Color Purple\" in Wadesboro, and the large white farmhouse used as an exterior location in that film became the production office for \"Evil Dead II\". Most of the film was shot in the woods near that farmhouse, or J.R. Faison Junior High School, where the interior cabin set was located.\nMark Shostrom served as the film's makeup effects supervisor, and delegated work to Robert Kurtzman, Greg Nicotero, and Howard Berger of KNB EFX Group. The shot of undead Henrietta's flying eyeball was accomplished using a ping pong ball provided and painted by KNB EFX. Effects artist Verne Hyde, who joined the North Carolina unit in 1986 after filming had already begun, experimented with various rigs in order to achieve the effect Raimi desired. It was ultimately achieved by mounting the eyeball on a small, spinning motor, attached to a wand bolted directly onto the camera.\nTed Raimi, director Sam's younger brother, had been briefly involved in the first film, acting as a fake Shemp. However, in \"Evil Dead II\", he plays a larger role as the undead Henrietta. Raimi wore a full-body, latex costume, and was also made to crouch in a small hole in the floor acting as a \"cellar\"; on one day, he did both. Raimi became extremely overheated to the point that his costume was filled with liters of sweat; Nicotero describes pouring the fluid into several Dixie cups so as to get it out of the costume. The sweat is also visible on-screen, dripping out of the costume's ear, in the scene where Henrietta spins around over Annie's head.\nFor Ash's chainsaw hand, effects artist Verne Hyde modified a real chainsaw, replacing its gasoline engine with a small, 12-volt electric motor, leaving space for Campbell to insert his hand into the body of the saw. The teeth of the saw were filed down for safety purposes, and tobacco smoke was pumped through a plastic tube that ran up Campbell's leg to simulate chainsaw smoke.\nThe crew sneaked various in-jokes into the film itself, such as the clawed glove of Freddy Krueger (the primary antagonist of Wes Craven's \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" series of slasher films) which hangs in the cabin's basement and tool shed. This was, at least partially, a reference to a scene in the original \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", where the character Nancy Thompson (portrayed by Heather Langenkamp) dozes off watching the original \"Evil Dead\" on a television set in her room. In turn, that scene was a reference to the torn \"The Hills Have Eyes\" poster seen in the original \"Evil Dead\" film, which was itself a reference to a torn \"Jaws\" poster in \"The Hills Have Eyes\". The real life clawed glove appearing in \"Evil Dead II\" has been attributed to Shostrom, who was also working on \"\" at around the same time as \"Evil Dead II\", suggesting he borrowed it from the \"Dream Warriors\" set for a day. The rat seen in the cellar was nicknamed \"Se\u00f1or Cojones\" by the crew (\"cojones\" is Spanish slang for \"testicles\").\nAt the film's wrap party, the crew held a talent contest where Raimi and Campbell sang the Byrds' \"Eight Miles High\", with Nicotero on guitar.\nMusic.\nThe score was composed by Joseph LoDuca, who also composed the other two scores in the \"Evil Dead\" trilogy. In 2017, Waxwork Records released the soundtrack on vinyl for the film's 30th anniversary.\nRelease.\nPre-release.\nLike the original film, \"Evil Dead II\" had censorship difficulties due to its high level of violence. Because DEG was a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), Raimi was contractually obliged to shoot the film with the intention of it earning an R rating. Upon reviewing the completed film, DEG's executives felt that \"Evil Dead II\" would almost certainly receive an X rating, which would limit its commercial prospects. Lawrence Gleason, the company's president of marketing and distribution, felt that if it were to be cut for an R, the film \"would have been about 62 minutes long\" and that both Raimi's vision and the audience's enjoyment would have been sabotaged as a result.\nUltimately, DEG decided not to submit \"Evil Dead II\" to the MPAA for review or be credited onscreen for their involvement in it. Instead, Rosebud Releasing Corporation, a shell company run by De Laurentiis' son-in-law Alex De Benedetti, was set up to handle the film's US release, allowing it to be shown unrated. Although Rosebud technically did not have a distribution network, DEG had already booked the film in 340 cinemas across the country, and had created and paid for the film's advertising campaign. Rosebud's logo, a rose blooming in time-lapse photography against a painted sky backdrop, was designed and shot by Raimi himself.\nHome media.\nThe film was released on VHS by Vestron Video in 1987. Another VHS release came from Anchor Bay Entertainment on February 17, 1998. In a similar fashion to the first \"Evil Dead\" film and \"Army of Darkness\", there have been numerous DVD releases of \"Evil Dead II\". The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay on August 29, 2000, in the form of a limited edition tin, and was re-released by Anchor Bay on September 27, 2005, designed to resemble the \"Necronomicon\". On October 2, 2007, the film was released on Blu-ray, and on November 15, 2011, it was re-released on Blu-ray and DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment for its 25th anniversary. On September 13, 2016, the film was re-released on Blu-ray by Lionsgate. A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the film was released on December 11, 2018.\nThe film was released on DVD in the United Kingdom in 2003 as part of a region 2 \"Evil Dead\" trilogy box set. In 2013, the trilogy saw another UK release on Blu-ray, released by StudioCanal. A 25th Anniversary Wood Edition was released in Germany by StudioCanal in 2007. The film was released on Blu-ray in Australia in 2014, alongside \"The Evil Dead\", \"Army of Darkness\", and the 2013 reboot, as part of an \"Evil Dead\" Anthology box set. The film has been released together with the first \"Evil Dead\" film by Green Nara Media in South Korea in region A.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Evil Dead II\" opened on March 13, 1987, to an unimpressive weekend gross of $807,260, due to its limited release in 310 theaters at the time. However, after spending a little over a month in theaters, it ultimately grossed $5,924,421 worldwide.\nCritical response.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of 84 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Less a continuation than an outright reimagining, Sam Raimi transforms his horror tale into a comedy of terrors -- and arguably even improves on the original formula.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the a score of 72 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating . \"Empire\" magazine praised the film, saying \"the gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel uses every trick in the cinematic book\" and confirms that \"Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods\".

{"id": "10489", "revid": "12694058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10489", "title": "Edwin Hubble", "text": "American astronomer (1889\u20131953)\nEdwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 \u2013 September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology.\nHubble proved that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as \"nebulae\" were actually galaxies beyond the Milky Way. He used the strong direct relationship between a classical Cepheid variable's luminosity and pulsation period (discovered in 1908 by Henrietta Swan Leavitt) for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances.\nHubble confirmed in 1929 that the recessional velocity of a galaxy increases with its distance from Earth, a behavior that became known as Hubble's law, although it had been proposed two years earlier by Georges Lema\u00eetre. The Hubble law implies that the universe is expanding. A decade before, the American astronomer Vesto Slipher had provided the first evidence that the light from many of these nebulae was strongly red-shifted, indicative of high recession velocities.\nHubble's name is most widely recognized for the Hubble Space Telescope, which was named in his honor, with a model prominently displayed in his hometown of Marshfield, Missouri.\nEarly life and education.\nEdwin Hubble was born in 1889 to Virginia Lee Hubble (n\u00e9e James) (1864\u20131934) and John Powell Hubble, an insurance executive, in Marshfield, Missouri, and moved to Wheaton, Illinois, in\u00a01900. In his younger days, he was noted more for his athletic prowess than his intellectual abilities, although he did earn good grades in every subject except spelling. Edwin was a gifted athlete, playing baseball, football, and running track in both high school and college. He won seven first places and a third place in a single high school track and field meet in 1906, and he played a variety of positions on the basketball court, from center to shooting guard. Hubble led the University of Chicago's basketball team to their first Big Ten Conference title in 1907.\nUndergraduate studies.\nHubble's studies at the University of Chicago were concentrated on mathematics, astronomy and philosophy, which resulted in a Bachelor of Science degree by 1910. For a year he was also a student laboratory assistant for the physicist Robert Millikan, a future Nobel Prize winner. Hubble also became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. A Rhodes Scholar, he spent three years at The Queen's College, Oxford studying jurisprudence instead of science (as a promise to his dying father), and later added studies in literature and Spanish, eventually earning a master's degree.\nIn 1909, Hubble's father moved his family from Chicago, Illinois to Shelbyville, Kentucky, so that the family could live in a small town, ultimately settling in nearby Louisville. His father died in the winter of\u00a01913, while Edwin was still in England. In the following summer, Edwin returned home to care for his mother, two sisters, and younger brother, along with his brother William. The family moved once more to Everett Avenue, in Louisville's Highlands neighborhood, to accommodate Edwin and William.\nHubble was a dutiful son, who despite his intense interest in astronomy since boyhood, acquiesced to his father's request to study law, first at the University of Chicago and later at Oxford University. In this time, he also took some math and science courses. After the death of his father in 1913, Edwin returned to the Midwest from Oxford but did not have the motivation to practice law. Instead, he proceeded to teach Spanish, physics and mathematics at New Albany High School in New Albany, Indiana, where he also coached the boys' basketball team. After a year of high-school teaching, he entered graduate school with the help of his former professor from the University of Chicago to study astronomy at the university's Yerkes Observatory, where he received his Ph.D. in 1921. His dissertation was titled \"Photographic Investigations of Faint Nebulae\". At Yerkes, he had access to its 40-inch refractor telescope built by George Ellery Hale in 1897, as well as an innovative 26-inch (61\u00a0cm) reflector telescope.\nDoctoral studies.\nAfter the [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917), Hubble rushed to complete his Ph.D. dissertation so he could join the military. Hubble volunteered for the [[United States Army]] and was assigned to the newly created [[86th Infantry Division (United States)|86th Division]], where he served in the 2nd Battalion, 343rd Infantry Regiment. He rose to the rank of major, and was found fit for overseas duty on July 9, 1918; the 86th Division moved overseas, but never saw combat as it was broken up and its personnel used as replacements in other units. After the end of World War I, Hubble spent a year at [[University of Cambridge]], where he renewed his studies of astronomy.\nCareer.\nIn 1919, Hubble was offered a staff position at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science]]'s [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], near [[Pasadena, California]], by [[George Ellery Hale]], the founder and director of the observatory. Hubble remained on staff at Mount Wilson until his death in 1953. Shortly before his death, Hubble became the first astronomer to use the newly completed giant reflector [[Hale Telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] near San Diego, California.\nHubble also worked as a civilian for [[United States Army]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in Maryland during [[World War II]] as the Chief of the External Ballistics Branch of the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] during which he directed a large volume of research in exterior [[ballistics]] which increased the effective firepower of bombs and projectiles. His work was facilitated by his personal development of several items of equipment for the instrumentation used in exterior ballistics, the most outstanding development being the high-speed clock camera, which made possible the study of the characteristics of bombs and low-velocity projectiles in flight. The results of his studies were credited with improving the design, performance, and military effectiveness of bombs and rockets. For his work there, he received the [[Legion of Merit]] award.\nDiscoveries.\nUniverse goes beyond the Milky Way galaxy.\n[[File:100inchHooker.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Mount Wilson Observatory#100-inch Hooker telescope|Hooker telescope]] at Mount Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to measure galaxy distances and a value for the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].]]\nEdwin Hubble's arrival at Mount Wilson Observatory, California, in 1919 coincided roughly with the completion of the [[Mount Wilson Observatory#100-inch Hooker telescope|Hooker Telescope]], then the world's largest. At that time, the prevailing view of the cosmos was that the universe consisted entirely of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.\n[[File:Hubble Tuning Fork diagram.svg|left|thumb|upright=1.5|Hubble's [[Hubble sequence|classification scheme]]]]\nUsing the Hooker Telescope at [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mount Wilson]], Hubble identified [[Cepheid variable]]s, a [[Cosmic distance ladder#Standard candles|standard candle]] discovered by [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]]. Comparing their [[Apparent magnitude|apparent luminosity]] to their intrinsic luminosity gives their distance from Earth. Hubble found Cepheids in several [[Spiral galaxy#Spiral nebula|nebulae]], including the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda Nebula]] and [[Triangulum Galaxy|Triangulum Nebula]]. His observations, made in 1924, proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the Milky Way and were, in fact, entire galaxies outside the Milky Way galaxy; thus, today they are no longer considered [[nebula]]e.\nThis was first [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] as early as 1755 when [[Immanuel Kant]]'s \"General History of Nature and Theory of the Heavens\" appeared. Hubble's hypothesis [[Great Debate (astronomy)|was opposed]] by many in the astronomy establishment of the time, in particular by [[Harvard University]]\u2013based [[Harlow Shapley#The Great Debate of 1920|Harlow Shapley]]. Despite the opposition, Hubble, then a thirty-five-year-old scientist, had his findings first published in \"[[The New York Times]]\" on November 23, 1924, then presented them to other astronomers at the January 1, 1925, meeting of the [[American Astronomical Society]]. Hubble's results for the Andromeda galaxy were not formally published in a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] until 1929.\nHubble's findings fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe. Supporters state that Hubble's discovery of nebulae outside of our galaxy helped pave the way for future astronomers. Although some of his more renowned colleagues simply scoffed at his results, Hubble published his findings. This published work earned him the American Association Prize and five hundred dollars from Burton E. Livingston of the Committee on Awards.\nHubble also devised the most commonly used [[Galaxy morphological classification|system for classifying galaxies]], grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images. He arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the Hubble sequence.\nRedshift increases with distance.\nHubble went on to estimate the distances to 24 extra-galactic nebulae, using a variety of methods. In 1929, Hubble examined the relationship between these distances and their [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]] as determined from their [[redshift]]s. All of his estimated distances are now known to be too small, by up to a factor of about 7. This was due to factors such as the fact that there are two kinds of Cepheid variables or confusing bright gas clouds with bright stars. However, his distances were more or less proportional to the true distances, and combining his distances with measurements of the redshifts of the galaxies by [[Vesto Slipher]], and by his assistant [[Milton L. Humason]], he found a roughly linear relationship between the distances of the galaxies and their radial velocities (corrected for solar motion), a discovery that later became known as Hubble's law.\nThis meant that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. When interpreted that way, Hubble's measurements on 46 galaxies lead to a value for the [[Hubble's law|Hubble constant]] of 500\u00a0km/s/Mpc, which is much higher than the currently accepted values of 74\u00a0km/s/Mpc (cosmic distance ladder method) or 68\u00a0km/s/Mpc ([[Cosmic microwave background|CMB method]]) due to errors in their distance calibrations.\nYet the reason for the redshift remained unclear. Georges Lema\u00eetre predicted on theoretical grounds based on Einstein's equations for [[general relativity]] the [[redshift]]-distance relation, and published observational support for it, two years before the discovery of Hubble's law. Although he used the term \"velocities\" in his paper (and \"apparent radial velocities\" in the introduction), he later expressed doubt about interpreting these as real velocities. In 1931, he wrote a letter to the Dutch cosmologist [[Willem de Sitter]] expressing his opinion on the theoretical interpretation of the redshift-distance relation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Mr. Humason and I are both deeply sensible of your gracious appreciation of the papers on velocities and distances of nebulae. We use the term 'apparent' velocities to emphasize the empirical features of the correlation. The interpretation, we feel, should be left to you and the very few others who are competent to discuss the matter with authority.\nToday, the \"apparent velocities\" in question are usually thought of as an increase in [[Comoving and proper distances|proper distance]] that occurs due to the [[expansion of the universe]]. Light traveling through an expanding metric will experience a Hubble-type redshift, a mechanism somewhat different from the [[Doppler effect]], although the two mechanisms become equivalent descriptions related by a [[Coordinate system#Transformations|coordinate transformation]] for nearby galaxies.\nIn the 1930s, Hubble was involved in determining the distribution of galaxies and [[shape of the universe|spatial curvature]]. These data seemed to indicate that the universe was [[Euclidean geometry|flat]] and homogeneous, but there was a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. According to [[Allan Sandage]],\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hubble believed that his count data gave a more reasonable result concerning spatial curvature if the redshift correction was made assuming no recession. To the very end of his writings, he maintained this position, favouring (or at the very least keeping open) the model where no true expansion exists, and therefore that the redshift \"represents a hitherto unrecognized principle of nature.\"\nThere were methodological problems with Hubble's survey technique that showed a deviation from flatness at large redshifts. In particular, the technique did not account for changes in luminosity of galaxies due to [[Galaxy formation and evolution|galaxy evolution]]. Earlier, in\u00a01917, [[Albert Einstein]] had found that his newly developed theory of general relativity indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting. Unable to believe what his own equations were telling him, Einstein introduced a [[cosmological constant]] (a\u00a0\"[[Wiktionary:fudge factor|fudge factor]]\") to the equations to avoid this \"problem\". When Einstein learned of Hubble's redshifts, he immediately realized that the expansion predicted by general relativity must be real, and in later life, he said that changing his equations was \"the biggest blunder of [his] life\". Einstein visited Mount Wilson Observatory in 1931, and met Hubble. Einstein announced there that \"the visit had changed his mind\".\nHubble also discovered the [[asteroid]] [[1373 Cincinnati]] on August 30, 1935. In 1936 he wrote \"The Observational Approach to Cosmology\" and \"The Realm of the Nebulae\" which explained his approaches to extra-galactic astronomy and his view of the subject's history.\nIn December 1941, Hubble reported to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] that results from a six-year survey with the Mount Wilson telescope did not support the expanding universe theory. According to a \"Los Angeles Times\" article reporting on Hubble's remarks, \"The nebulae could not be uniformly distributed, as the telescope shows they are, and still fit the explosion idea. Explanations which try to get around what the great telescope sees, he said, fail to stand up. The explosion, for example, would have had to start long after the earth was created, and possibly even after the first life appeared here.\" (Hubble's estimate of what we now call the Hubble constant would put the Big Bang only 2 billion years ago.)\nPersonal life.\nHubble married Grace Lillian (Burke) Leib (1889\u20131980), daughter of John Patrick and Luella (Kepford) Burke, on February 26, 1924.\nHubble was raised as a Protestant Christian, but some of his later statements suggest uncertainty.\nHealth issues and death.\nHubble had a heart attack in July 1949 while on vacation in [[Colorado]]. He was cared for by his wife and continued on a modified diet and work schedule. He died of [[Thrombus|cerebral thrombosis]] (a blood clot in his brain) on September 28, 1953, in [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], California. No funeral was held for him, and his wife never revealed his burial site.\nHubble's papers comprising the bulk of his correspondence, photographs, notebooks, observing logbooks, and other materials, are held by the [[Huntington Library]] in San Marino, California. They were donated by his wife Grace Burke Hubble upon her death in 1980.\nControversies.\nAccusations concerning Lema\u00eetre's priority.\nIn 2011, the journal [[Nature (journal)|\"Nature\"]] reported claims that Hubble might have played a role in the [[redaction]] of key parts of the 1931 English translation of [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre's]] 1927 paper, which formulated what was later called Hubble's law and also gave observational evidence. Historians quoted in the article were skeptical that the redactions were part of a campaign to ensure Hubble retained priority. However, the observational astronomer [[Sidney van den Bergh]] published a paper suggesting that while the omissions may have been made by a translator, they may still have been deliberate.\nIn November 2011, the astronomer [[Mario Livio]] reported in \"Nature\" that a letter he found in the Lema\u00eetre archive demonstrated that the redaction had been made by Lema\u00eetre himself, who apparently saw no point in publishing scientific content which had already been reported in 1929 by Hubble. However, the fact remains that Lema\u00eetre published the law in French, two years prior to Hubble.\nCampaign to obtain a Nobel Prize.\nDuring Hubble's life the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] did not cover astronomy. Hubble spent much of the later part of his career attempting to have astronomy considered part of physics, instead of being a separate science. He did this largely so that astronomers\u2014including himself\u2014could be recognized by the [[Nobel Committee]] for their contributions to [[astrophysics]]. This campaign was unsuccessful in Hubble's lifetime, but shortly after his death, the Nobel Prize Committee decided that astronomical work would be eligible for the physics prize. However, the Nobel prize is not awarded posthumously.\nHonors.\nPostage stamp.\nOn March 6, 2008, the [[United States Postal Service]] released a 41-cent stamp honoring Hubble on a sheet titled \"American Scientists\" designed by artist [[Victor Stabin]]. His citation reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Often called a \"pioneer of the distant stars\", astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889\u20131953) played a pivotal role in deciphering the vast and complex nature of the universe. His meticulous studies of spiral nebulae proved the existence of galaxies other than our own Milky Way. Had he not died suddenly in 1953, Hubble would have won that year's Nobel Prize in Physics.\nThe other scientists on the \"American Scientists\" sheet include [[Gerty Cori]], biochemist; [[Linus Pauling]], chemist, and [[John Bardeen]], physicist.\nIn popular culture.\nIn the 1980 documentary \"[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]\" by astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], Hubble's life and work are portrayed on screen in episode 10, \"The Edge of Forever\".\nThe play \"Creation's Birthday\", written by Cornell physicist Hasan Padamsee, tells Hubble's life story.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Edwin Hubble| ]]\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1953 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century American astronomers]]\n[[Category:American agnostics]]\n[[Category:American astrophysicists]]\n[[Category:American men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:American Rhodes Scholars]]\n[[Category:American cosmologists]]\n[[Category:Discoverers of asteroids]]\n[[Category:Discoverers of comets]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the Queen's College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Chicago Maroons baseball players]]\n[[Category:Chicago Maroons men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit]]\n[[Category:United States Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:United States Army personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:Military personnel from Missouri]]\n[[Category:United States Army officers]]\n[[Category:People from Marshfield, Missouri]]\n[[Category:People from San Marino, California]]\n[[Category:People from Wheaton, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Physicists from Missouri]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:High school basketball coaches in Indiana]]\n[[Category:Hubble Space Telescope]]\n[[Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society]]\n[[Category:Recipients of Franklin Medal]]"}

His mother was the Empress Fujiwara no Takaiko, who was also known after Seiwa's abdication as the Nij\u014d empress. Y\u014dzei's mother was the sister of Fujiwara no Mototsune, who would figure prominently in the young emperor's life.\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the \"Gempeit\u014dkitsu\" (\u6e90\u5e73\u85e4\u6a58). One of these clans, the Minamoto clan (\u6e90\u6c0f) are also known as Genji, and of these, the \"Y\u014dzei Genji\" (\u967d\u6210\u6e90\u6c0f) are descended from the 57th emperor Y\u014dzei.\nY\u014dzei had nine Imperial children, born after he had abdicated.\nHe is said to have mental instability after acceding to his position at a tender young age. He concentrated on waka during his later years. His famous waka expressed his growing love by superimposing the image of the flow of the river.\nEvents of Y\u014dzei's life.\nY\u014dzei was made emperor when he was an immature, unformed young boy.\nAccording to very scanty information from the Imperial archives, including sources such as \"Rikkokushi,\" and \"Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku,\" Emperor Y\u014dzei murdered one of his retainers, an action that caused massive scandal in the Heian court. Japanese society during the Heian era was very sensitive to issues of \"pollution,\" both spiritual and personal. Deaths (especially killing animals or people) were the worst acts of pollution possible, and warranted days of seclusion in order to purify oneself. Since the Emperor was seen as a divine figure and linked to the deities, pollution of such extreme degree committed by the highest source was seen as extremely ruinous. Many of the high court officials construed Emperor Y\u014dzei's actions as exceeding the bounds of acceptable behavior, and as justifiable cause for the emperor to be forcibly deposed.\nIn Kitabatake Chikafusa's 14th-century account of Emperor Y\u014dzei's reign, the emperor is described as possessing a \"violent disposition\" and unfit to be a ruler. In the end, when Fujiwara no Mototsune, who was \"Sessh\u014d\" (regent for the child-emperor, 876\u2013880), \"Kampaku\" (chief advisor or first secretary for the emperor, 880\u2013890), and \"Daij\u014d Daijin\" (Great Minister of the Council of State), decided that Y\u014dzei should be removed from the throne, he discovered that there was general agreement amongst the \"kuge\" that this was a correct and necessary decision.\nY\u014dzei was succeeded by his father's uncle, Emperor K\u014dk\u014d; and in the reign of K\u014dk\u014d's son, Emperor Uda, the madness re-visited the tormented former emperor:\nY\u014dzei lived in retirement until the age of 80.\nThe actual site of Y\u014dzei's grave is known.

The prince signaled his acceptance by going into the imperial palanquin, which then conducted him to the emperor's residence within the palace. Curiously, he was still wearing the robes of a prince when he decided to take this ride into an entirely unanticipated future.\nDuring his reign, K\u014dk\u014d revived many ancient court rituals and ceremonies, and one example is the imperial hawking excursion to Serikawa, which had been initiated in 796 by Emperor Kanmu.

His mother was Empress Dowager Hanshi, a daughter of Prince Nakano (who was himself a son of Emperor Kanmu). Uda had five Imperial consorts and 20 Imperial children. Particularly important sons include:\nHistorical background.\nIn ancient Japan, there were four noble clans, the \"Gempeit\u014dkitsu\" . One of these clans, the Minamoto clan , is also known as Genji. Some of Uda's grandchildren were granted the surname \"Minamoto\", the most used surname for former Japanese royalty. In order to distinguish Uda's descendants from other Genji, they became known as the Uda Genji , some of which moved to \u014cmi Province and became known as Sasaki clan or .\nAmong the Uda Genji, Minamoto no Masazane , a son of succeeded in the court. Masazane became \"sadaijin\" (Minister of the Left). One of Masazane's daughters, Minamoto no Rinshi married Fujiwara no Michinaga and from this marriage three empresses dowagers and two regents (\"sessh\u014d\") were born.\nFrom Masanobu, several kuge families originated including the Niwata, Ayanok\u014dji, Itsutsuji, \u014chara and Jik\u014dji. From his fourth son Sukeyosi, the Sasaki clan originated, and thus Ky\u014dgoku clan originated. These descendants are known as \u014cmi Genji today. From this line, Sasaki Takauji made a success at the Muromachi shogunate and the Amago clan originated from his brother.\nEvents of Uda's life.\nUda's father, Emperor K\u014dk\u014d, demoted his sons from the rank of imperial royals to that of subjects in order to reduce the state expenses, as well as their political influence. Sadami was given the clan name of Minamoto and named Minamoto no Sadami. Later, in 887, when K\u014dk\u014d needed to appoint his successor, Sadami was once again promoted to the Imperial Prince rank with support of \"kampaku\" Fujiwara no Mototsune, since Sadami was adopted by a half-sister of Mototsune. After the death of his father in November of that year, Sadami\"-shinn\u014d\" ascended to the throne.\nIn the beginning of Uda's reign, Mototsune held the office of \"kampaku\" (or chancellor). Emperor Uda's reign is marked by a prolonged struggle to reassert power by the Imperial Family away from the increasing influence of the Fujiwara, beginning with the death of Mototsune in 891. Records show that shortly thereafter, Emperor Uda assigned scholars Sukeyo and Kiyoyuki, supporters of Mototsune, to provincial posts in the remote provinces of Mutsu and Higo respectively. Meanwhile, non-Fujiwara officials mainly from the Minamoto family were promoted to prominent ranks, while his trusted counselor, Sugawara no Michizane rapidly rose in rank within five years to reach the third rank in the court, and supervision of the Crown Prince's household. Meanwhile, Mototsune's son and heir, Fujiwara no Tokihira, rose in rank, but only just enough to prevent an open power struggle.\nMeanwhile, Emperor Uda attempted to return Court politics to the original spirit envisioned in the Ritsury\u014d Codes, while reviving intellectual interest in Confucian doctrine and culture. In the seventh month of 896, Emperor Uda dispatched Sugawara no Michizane to review prisoners in the capitol and provide a general amnesty for the wrongfully accused, in keeping with Chinese practices. Emperor Uda also issued edicts reinforcing peasant land rights from encroachment by powerful families in the capital or monastic institutions, while auditing tax collections made in the provinces.\nEmperor Uda stopped the practice of sending ambassadors to China . The emperor's decision was informed by what he understood as persuasive counsel from Sugawara Michizane.\nThe Special Festival of the Kamo Shrine was first held during Uda's reign.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nIn 897, Uda abdicated in favor of his eldest son, Prince Atsuhito, who would later come to be known as Emperor Daigo. Uda left behind an hortatory will or testament which offered general admonitions or precepts for his son's guidance (\"see excerpt at right\"). The document praises Fujiwara no Tokihira as an advisor but cautions against his womanizing; and Sugawara no Michizane is praised as Uda's mentor. Both were assigned by Emperor Uda to look after his son until the latter reach maturity.\nThree years later, he entered the Buddhist priesthood at age 34 in 900. Having founded the temple at Ninna-ji, Uda made it his new home after his abdication.\n His Buddhist name was Kong\u014d Kaku. He was sometimes called \"the Cloistered Emperor of Teiji \", because the name of the Buddhist hall where he resided after becoming a priest was called Teijiin.\nUda died in 931 (\"Sh\u014dhei 1, 19th day of the 7th month\") at the age of 65.\nThe actual site of Uda's grave is known.

The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Uda is today named \"O-uchiyama\". The emperor's burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Uda died.

{"id": "10500", "revid": "51010551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10500", "title": "Earless seal", "text": "Family of mammals\nThe earless seals, phocids, or true seals are one of the three main groups of mammals within the seal lineage, Pinnipedia. All true seals are members of the family Phocidae (). They are sometimes called crawling seals to distinguish them from the fur seals and sea lions of the family Otariidae. Seals live in the oceans of both hemispheres and, with the exception of the more tropical monk seals, are mostly confined to polar, subpolar, and temperate climates. The Baikal seal is the only species of exclusively freshwater seal.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nEvolution.\nThe earliest known fossil earless seal is \"Noriphoca gaudini\" from the late Oligocene or earliest Miocene (Aquitanian) of Italy. Other early fossil phocids date from the mid-Miocene, 15 million years ago in the north Atlantic. Until recently, many researchers believed that phocids evolved separately from otariids and odobenids; and that they evolved from otter-like animals, such as \"Potamotherium\", which inhabited European freshwater lakes. Recent evidence strongly suggests a monophyletic origin for all pinnipeds from a single ancestor, possibly \"Enaliarctos\", most closely related to the mustelids and bears.\nMonk seals and elephant seals were previously believed to have first entered the Pacific through the open straits between North and South America, with the Antarctic true seals either using the same route or travelled down the west coast of Africa. It is now thought that the monk seals, elephant seals, and Antarctic seals all evolved in the southern hemisphere, and likely dispersed to their current distributions from more southern latitudes.\nTaxonomy.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, morphological phylogenetic analysis of the phocids led to new conclusions about the interrelatedness of the various genera. More recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have confirmed the monophyly of the two phocid subfamilies (Phocinae and Monachinae). The Monachinae (known as the \"southern\" seals), is composed of three tribes; the Lobodontini, Miroungini, and Monachini. The four Antarctic genera \"Hydrurga\", \"Leptonychotes\", \"Lobodon\", and \"Ommatophoca\" are part of the tribe Lobodontini. Tribe Miroungini is composed of the elephant seals. The Monk seals (\"Monachus\" and \"Neomonachus\") are all part of the tribe Monachini. Likewise, subfamily Phocinae (the \"northern\" seals) also includes three tribes; Erignathini (\"Erignathus)\", Cystophorini (\"Cystophora)\", and Phocini (all other phocines). More recently, five species have been split off from \"Phoca\", forming three additional genera.\nAlternatively the three monachine tribes have been evaluated to familiar status, which elephant seals and the Antarctic seals are more closely related to the phocines.\nBiology.\nExternal anatomy.\nAdult phocids vary from in length and in weight in the ringed seal to and in the southern elephant seal, which is the largest member of the order Carnivora. Phocids have fewer teeth than land-based members of the Carnivora, although they retain powerful canines. Some species lack molars altogether. The dental formula is:\n2\u20133.1.4.0\u201321\u20132.1.4.0\u20132\nWhile otariids are known for speed and maneuverability, phocids are known for efficient, economical movement. This allows most phocids to forage far from land to exploit prey resources, while otariids are tied to rich upwelling zones close to breeding sites. Phocids swim by sideways movements of their bodies, using their hind flippers to fullest effect. Their fore flippers are used primarily for steering, while their hind flippers are bound to the pelvis in such a way that they cannot bring them under their bodies to walk on them. They are more streamlined than fur seals and sea lions, so they can swim more effectively over long distances. However, because they cannot turn their hind flippers downward, they are very clumsy on land, having to wriggle with their front flippers and abdominal muscles.\nPhocid respiratory and circulatory systems are adapted to allow diving to considerable depths, and they can spend a long time underwater between breaths. Air is forced from the lungs during a dive and into the upper respiratory passages, where gases cannot easily be absorbed into the bloodstream. This helps protect the seal from the bends. The middle ear is also lined with blood sinuses that inflate during diving, helping to maintain a constant pressure.\nPhocids are more specialized for aquatic life than otariids. They lack external ears and have sleek, streamlined bodies. Retractable nipples, internal testicles, and an internal penile sheath provide further streamlining. A smooth layer of blubber lies underneath the skin. Phocids are able to divert blood flow to this layer to help control their temperatures.\nCommunication.\nUnlike otariids, phocine seals do not communicate by \"barking\". Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting, with a few species have been documented to clap at each other underwater. One study published in \"Animal Behaviour\" found that seals use rhythmic percussive signalling (clapping) in both \"agonistic interactions\" and display behavior.\nConversely, monachine seals are well known to vocalize: elephant seals often vocalize on land, with the bulls being well known for roaring to establish dominance and identifying themselves. The Weddell and leopard seals are well known for their underwater singing.\nMovements.\nWith short front flippers and because their rear flipper is unable to rotate, true seals cannot walk when out of the water like sea lions. As a result, they bounce themselves forward in a motion called \"galumphing\"; the polar explorer Edward Wilson referred to the motion as \"lolloping\".\nReproduction.\nPhocids spend most of their time at sea, although they return to land or pack ice to breed and give birth. Pregnant females spend long periods foraging at sea, building up fat reserves, and then return to the breeding site to use their stored energy to nurse pups. However, the common seal displays a reproductive strategy similar to that used by otariids, in which the mother makes short foraging trips between nursing bouts.\nBecause a phocid mother's feeding grounds are often hundreds of kilometers from the breeding site, she must fast while lactating. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup at a time when she is not eating (and often, not drinking). Mothers must supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the humpback whales' strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.\nPhocids produce thick, fat-rich milk that allows them to provide their pups with large amounts of energy in a short period. This allows the mother to return to the sea in time to replenish her reserves. Lactation ranges from five to seven weeks in the monk seal to just three to five days in the hooded seal. The mother ends nursing by leaving her pup at the breeding site to search for food (pups continue to nurse if given the opportunity). \"Milk stealers\" that suckle from unrelated, sleeping females are not uncommon; this often results in the death of the mother's pup, since a female can only feed one pup.\nGrowth and maturation.\nThe pup's diet is so high in calories that it builds up a fat store. Before the pup is ready to forage, the mother abandons it, and the pup consumes its own fat for weeks or even months while it matures. Seals, like all marine mammals, need time to develop the oxygen stores, swimming muscles, and neural pathways necessary for effective diving and foraging. Seal pups typically eat no food and drink no water during the period, although some polar species eat snow. The postweaning fast ranges from two weeks in the hooded seal to 9\u201312 weeks in the northern elephant seal. The physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow phocid pups to endure these remarkable fasts, which are among the longest for any mammal, remain an area of active study and research.\nFeeding strategy.\nPhocids make use of at least four different feeding strategies: suction feeding, grip and tear feeding, filter feeding, and pierce feeding. Each of these feeding strategies is aided by a specialized skull, mandible, and tooth morphology. However, despite morphological specialization, most phocids are opportunistic and employ multiple strategies to capture and eat prey. For example, the leopard seal, \"Hydrurga leptonyx\", uses grip and tear feeding to prey on penguins, suction feeding to consume small fish, and filter feeding to catch krill.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Such information is also referred to as intelligence. A professional trained in conducting intelligence operations by their government may be employed as an intelligence officer. Espionage may be conducted in a foreign country, domestically or remotely. The practice is clandestine, as it is by definition unwelcome. In some circumstances, it may be a legal tool of law enforcement and in others, it may be illegal and punishable by law.\nEspionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern. The term is frequently associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes. However, there are many types of espionage. Industrial espionage, for example, involves spying on civilians and their respective business or corporate interests.\nOne way spies gather data and information about a targeted military organization is by infiltrating its ranks. They can then return information such as the size and strength of the enemy forces. They can also find collaborators and dissidents within the organization and influence them to provide further information or defect. Spies can steal technology and sabotage the enemy in various ways. Counterespionage, also known as counterintelligence or offensive countertintelligence, is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence gathering. Almost all sovereign states have laws concerning espionage and the penalties for being caught spying are often severe.\nHistory.\nAncient world.\nEspionage has been recognized as of importance in military affairs since ancient times.\nThe oldest known classified document was a report made by a spy disguised as a diplomatic envoy in the court of King Hammurabi, who died in around 1750 BC. The ancient Egyptians had a developed secret service, and espionage is mentioned in the \"Iliad\", the Bible, and the Amarna letters. Espionage was also prevalent in the Greco-Roman world, when spies employed illiterate subjects in civil services.\nThe thesis that espionage and intelligence has a central role in war as well as peace was first advanced in \"The Art of War\" and in the \"Arthashastra\". \"The Art of War,\" identifies five types of spies that are essential for gathering intelligence and achieving victory: \"local spies\" (citizen informants within the enemy's territory), \"inward spies\" (recruited double agents within the enemy ranks), converted spies (recruited defectors converted to serve your side), doomed spies (expendable fabricators used to spread disinformation; acts as decoy for counter-intelligence), and surviving spies (spies that provide accurate intelligence after gathering information from the enemy).\nMiddle Ages.\nIn the Middle Ages European states excelled at what has later been termed counter-subversion when Catholic inquisitions were staged to annihilate heresy. Inquisitions were marked by centrally organised mass interrogations and detailed record keeping. Western espionage changed fundamentally during the Renaissance when Italian city-states installed resident ambassadors in capital cities to collect intelligence.\nFeudal Asia.\nIn Asia, the Mongol Empire relied on a state-sponsored network of spies, often disguised as merchants, who gathered intelligence on enemy strengths, weaknesses and potential allies in a series of conquests. Feudal Japan utilized specialized covert agents called shinobi (ninja), who were mercenaries hired by feudal lords for espionage, sabotage and infiltration, often operating outside the code of the samurai.\nThe Renaissance.\nRenaissance Venice became so obsessed with espionage that the Council of Ten, which was nominally responsible for security, did not even allow the doge to consult government archives freely. In 1481 the Council of Ten barred all Venetian government officials from making contact with ambassadors or foreigners. Those revealing official secrets could face the death penalty. Venice became obsessed with espionage because successful international trade demanded that the city-state could protect its trade secrets.\nUnder Queen Elizabeth I of England (r.\u20091558\u00a0\u2013\u00a01603), Francis Walsingham (c.\u20091532\u20131590) was appointed foreign secretary and intelligence chief. The novelist and journalist Daniel Defoe (died 1731) not only spied for the British government, but also developed a theory of espionage foreshadowing modern police-state methods.\nUnited States.\nDuring the American Revolution, Nathan Hale and Benedict Arnold achieved their fame as spies, and there was considerable use of spies on both sides during the American Civil War. Though not a spy himself, George Washington was America's first spymaster, utilizing espionage tactics against the British.\nWorld War I, World War II.\nIn the 20th century, at the height of World War I, all great powers except the United States had elaborate civilian espionage systems, and all national military establishments had intelligence units. In order to protect the country against foreign agents, the U.S. Congress passed the Espionage Act of 1917. Mata Hari, who obtained information for Germany by seducing French officials, was the most noted espionage agent of World War I. Prior to World War II, Germany and Imperial Japan established elaborate espionage nets. In 1942 the Office of Strategic Services was founded by Gen. William J. Donovan. However, the British Special Operations Executive was the keystone of Allied intelligence. Numerous resistance groups such as the Austrian Maier-Messner Group, the French Resistance, the Witte Brigade, Milorg and the Polish Home Army worked against Nazi Germany and provided the Allied secret services with information that was very important for the war effort.\nCold War.\nSince the end of World War II, the activity of espionage has enlarged, much of it growing out of the Cold War between the United States and the former USSR. The Russian Empire and its successor, the Soviet Union, have had a long tradition of espionage ranging from the Okhrana to the KGB (Committee for State Security), which also acted as a secret police force. In the United States, the 1947 National Security Act created the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to coordinate intelligence and the National Security Agency for research into codes and electronic communication. In addition to these, the United States has 13 other intelligence gathering agencies; most of the U.S. expenditures for intelligence gathering are budgeted to various Defense Dept. agencies and their programs. Under the intelligence reorganization of 2004, the director of national intelligence is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the activities and budgets of the U.S. intelligence agencies.\nIn the Cold War, espionage cases included Alger Hiss, Whittaker Chambers and the Rosenberg Case. In 1952 the Communist Chinese captured two CIA agents and in 1960 Francis Gary Powers, flying a U-2 reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union for the CIA, was shot down and captured. During the Cold War, many Soviet intelligence officials defected to the West, including Gen. Walter Krivitsky, Victor Kravchenko, Vladimir Petrov, Peter Deriabin, Pawel Monat and Oleg Penkovsky of the GRU. Among Western officials who defected to the Soviet Union are Guy Burgess and Donald D. Maclean of Great Britain in 1951, Otto John of West Germany in 1954, William H. Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell, U.S. cryptographers, in 1960, and Harold (Kim) Philby of Great Britain in 1962. U.S. acknowledgment of its U-2 flights and the exchange of Francis Gary Powers for Rudolf Abel in 1962 implied the legitimacy of some espionage as an arm of foreign policy.\nChina has a very cost-effective intelligence program that is especially effective in monitoring neighboring countries such as Mongolia, Russia and India. Smaller countries can also mount effective and focused espionage efforts. For instance, the Vietnamese communists had consistently superior intelligence during the Vietnam War. Some Islamic countries, including Libya, Iran and Syria, have highly developed operations as well. SAVAK, the secret police of the Pahlavi dynasty, was particularly feared by Iranian dissidents before the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\nModern day.\nToday, spy agencies target the illegal drug trade and terrorists as well as state actors.\nIntelligence services value certain intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred human sources over research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. In the Soviet Union, both political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited.\nTargets of espionage.\nEspionage agents are usually trained experts in a targeted field so they can differentiate mundane information from targets of value to their own organizational development. Correct identification of the target at its execution is the sole purpose of the espionage operation.\nBroad areas of espionage targeting expertise include:\nMethods and terminology.\nHow the United States defines espionage.\nAlthough the news media may speak of \"spy satellites\" and the like, espionage is not a synonym for all intelligence-gathering disciplines. It is a specific form of human source intelligence (HUMINT). Codebreaking (cryptanalysis or COMINT), aircraft or satellite photography (IMINT), and analysis of publicly available data sources (OSINT) are all intelligence gathering disciplines, but none of them is considered espionage. Many HUMINT activities, such as prisoner interrogation, reports from military reconnaissance patrols and from diplomats, etc., are not considered espionage. Espionage is the disclosure of sensitive information (classified) to people who are not cleared for that information or access to that sensitive information.\nUnlike other forms of intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people who bought his information.\nThe US defines espionage towards itself as \"the act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defence with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation\". \"Black's Law Dictionary\" (1990) defines espionage as: \"...\u00a0gathering, transmitting, or losing\u00a0... information related to the national defense\". Espionage is a violation of United States law, \u00a0https://\u2013https:// and Article 106a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The United States, like most nations, conducts espionage against other nations, under the control of the National Clandestine Service. Britain's espionage activities are controlled by the Secret Intelligence Service.\nTechnology and techniques.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSource:\nOrganization.\nA spy is a person employed to seek out secret information from a source. Within the United States Intelligence Community, \"asset\" is more common usage. A case officer or Special Agent, who may have diplomatic status (i.e., official cover or non-official cover), supports and directs the human collector. Cut-outs are couriers who do not know the agent or case officer but transfer messages. A safe house is a refuge for spies. Spies often seek to obtain secret information from another source.\nIn larger networks, the organization can be complex with many methods to avoid detection, including clandestine cell systems. Often the players have never met. Case officers are stationed in foreign countries to recruit and supervise intelligence agents, who in turn spy on targets in the countries where they are assigned. A spy need not be a citizen of the target country and hence does not automatically commit treason when operating within it. While the more common practice is to recruit a person already trusted with access to sensitive information, sometimes a person with a well-prepared synthetic identity (cover background), called a \"legend\" in tradecraft, may attempt to infiltrate a target organization.\nThese agents can be moles (who are recruited before they get access to secrets), defectors (who are recruited after they get access to secrets and leave their country) or defectors in place (who get access but do not leave).\nA \"legend\" is also employed for an individual who is not an illegal agent, but is an ordinary citizen who is \"relocated\", for example, a \"protected witness\". Nevertheless, such a non-agent very likely will also have a case officer who will act as a controller. As in most, if not all synthetic identity schemes, for whatever purpose (illegal or legal), the assistance of a controller is required.\nSpies may also be used to spread disinformation in the organization in which they are planted, such as giving false reports about their country's military movements, or about a competing company's ability to bring a product to market. Spies may be given other roles that also require infiltration, such as sabotage.\nMany governments spy on their allies as well as their enemies, although they typically maintain a policy of not commenting on this. Governments also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf such as SCG International Risk, International Intelligence Limited and others.\nMany organizations, both national and non-national, conduct espionage operations. It should not be assumed that espionage is always directed at the most secret operations of a target country. National and terrorist organizations and other groups are also targeted. This is because governments want to retrieve information that they can use to be proactive in protecting their nation from potential terrorist attacks.\nCommunications both are necessary to espionage and clandestine operations, and also a great vulnerability when the adversary has sophisticated SIGINT detection and interception capability. Spies rely on COVCOM or covert communication through technically advanced spy devices. Agents must also transfer money securely.\nIndustrial espionage.\nIndustrial espionage, also known as economic espionage, corporate spying, or corporate espionage, is a form of espionage conducted for commercial purposes instead of purely national security. While political espionage is conducted or orchestrated by governments and is international in scope, industrial or corporate espionage is more often national and occurs between companies or corporations. It may include the acquisition of intellectual property, such as information on industrial manufacture, ideas, techniques and processes, recipes and formulas. Or it could include sequestration of proprietary or operational information, such as that on customer datasets, pricing, sales, marketing, research and development, policies, prospective bids, planning or marketing strategies or the changing compositions and locations of production. It may describe activities such as theft of trade secrets, bribery, blackmail and technological surveillance. As well as orchestrating espionage on commercial organizations, governments can also be targets \u2013 for example, to determine the terms of a tender for a government contract.\nReportedly Canada is losing $12 billion and German companies are estimated to be losing about \u20ac50 billion ($87 billion) and 30,000 jobs to industrial espionage every year.\nTypes of agent.\nIn espionage jargon, an \"agent\" is the person who does the spying. They may be a citizen of a country recruited by that country to spy on another; a citizen of a country recruited by that country to carry out false flag assignments disrupting his own country; a citizen of one country who is recruited by a second country to spy on or work against his own country or a third country, and more.\nIn popular usage, this term is sometimes confused with an \"intelligence officer\", \"intelligence operative\", or \"case officer\" who recruits and handles agents.\nAmong the most common forms of agent are:\nLess common or lesser known forms of agent include:\nPrivate espionage.\nPrivate espionage is a large scale industry involving a vast array of different companies and individuals who provide a variety of services. These companies may be employed to act independently without any connection to a state agency or they may be hired to work in an integrated manner with a state agency, or agencies, in order to provide the specific services which are required. \nIn terms of scale, the writer Frederic Lemieux states that 'In 2010. it was estimated that 1,931 private intelligence firms were working within the intelligence community in the United States, employing approximately 265, 000 contractors with top-secret clearances.' He goes on to state, however, that only about 110 of them represent 90% of the market. These include: AEGIS, BAE Systems, Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), CACI International Inc., CSRA Inc., General Dynamics, Leidos, Northrop Grumman, and Science Applications International Corporation.\nLaw.\nEspionage against a nation is a crime under the legal code of many world states.\nEspionage law in the United States.\nIn the United States, it is covered by the Espionage Act of 1917. The risks of espionage vary. A spy violating the host country's laws may be deported, imprisoned, or even executed. A spy violating its own country's laws can be imprisoned for espionage or/and treason (which in the United States and some other jurisdictions can only occur if they take up arms or aids the enemy against their own country during wartime), or even executed, as the Rosenbergs were. For example, when Aldrich Ames handed a stack of dossiers of U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents in the Eastern Bloc to his KGB-officer \"handler\", the KGB \"rolled up\" several networks, and at least ten people were secretly shot. When Ames was arrested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), he faced life in prison; his contact, who had diplomatic immunity, was declared \"persona non grata\" and taken to the airport. Ames' wife was threatened with life imprisonment if her husband did not cooperate; he did, and she was given a five-year sentence. Hugh Francis Redmond, a CIA officer in China, spent nineteen years in a Chinese prison for espionage\u2014and died there\u2014as he was operating without diplomatic cover and immunity.\nIn United States law, treason, espionage, and spying are separate crimes. Treason and espionage have graduated punishment levels.\nThe United States in World War I passed the Espionage Act of 1917. Over the years, many spies, such as the Soble spy ring, Robert Lee Johnson, the Rosenberg ring, Aldrich Hazen Ames, Robert Philip Hanssen, Jonathan Pollard, John Anthony Walker, James Hall III, and others have been prosecuted under this law.\nIn modern times, many people convicted of espionage have been given penal sentences rather than execution. For example, Aldrich Hazen Ames is an American CIA analyst, turned KGB mole, who was convicted of espionage in 1994; he is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole in the high-security Allenwood U.S. Penitentiary. Ames was formerly a 31-year CIA counterintelligence officer and analyst who committed espionage against his country by spying for the Soviet Union and Russia. So far as it is known, Ames compromised the second-largest number of CIA agents, second only to Robert Hanssen, who also served a prison sentence until his death in 2023.\nUse against non-spies.\nEspionage laws are also used to prosecute non-spies. In the United States, the Espionage Act of 1917 was used against socialist politician Eugene V. Debs (at that time the Act had much stricter guidelines and amongst other things banned speech against military recruiting). The law was later used to suppress publication of periodicals, for example of Father Coughlin in World War II. In the early 21st century, the act was used to prosecute whistleblowers such as Thomas Andrews Drake, John Kiriakou, and Edward Snowden, as well as officials who communicated with journalists for innocuous reasons, such as Stephen Jin-Woo Kim.\nAs of 2012[ [update]], India and Pakistan were holding several hundred prisoners of each other's country for minor violations like trespass or visa overstay, often with accusations of espionage attached. Some of these include cases where Pakistan and India both deny citizenship to these people, leaving them stateless. The BBC reported in 2012 on one such case, that of Mohammed Idrees, who was held under Indian police control for approximately 13 years for overstaying his 15-day visa by 2\u20133 days after seeing his ill parents in 1999. Much of the 13 years were spent in prison waiting for a hearing, and more time was spent homeless or living with generous families. The Indian People's Union for Civil Liberties and Human Rights Law Network both decried his treatment. The BBC attributed some of the problems to tensions caused by the Kashmir conflict.\nEspionage law in the UK.\nFrom ancient times, the penalty for espionage in many countries was execution. This was true right up until the era of World War II; for example, Josef Jakobs was a Nazi spy who parachuted into Great Britain in 1941 and was executed for espionage.\nEspionage is illegal in the UK under the National Security Act 2023, which repealed prior Official Secrets Acts and creates three separate offences for espionage. A person is liable to be imprisoned for life for committing an offence under Section 1 of the Act, or 14 years for an offence under Sections 2 and 3\nGovernment intelligence law and its distinction from espionage.\nGovernment intelligence is very much distinct from espionage, and is not illegal in the UK, providing that the organisations of individuals are registered, often with the ICO, and are acting within the restrictions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA). 'Intelligence' is considered legally as \"information of all sorts gathered by a government or organisation to guide its decisions. It includes information that may be both public and private, obtained from much different public or secret sources. It could consist entirely of information from either publicly available or secret sources, or be a combination of the two.\"\nHowever, espionage and intelligence can be linked. According to the MI5 website, \"foreign intelligence officers acting in the UK under diplomatic cover may enjoy immunity from prosecution. Such persons can only be tried for spying (or, indeed, any criminal offence) if diplomatic immunity is waived beforehand. Those officers operating without diplomatic cover have no such immunity from prosecution\".\nThere are also laws surrounding government and organisational intelligence and surveillance. Generally, the body involved should be issued with some form of warrant or permission from the government and should be enacting their procedures in the interest of protecting national security or the safety of public citizens. Those carrying out intelligence missions should act within not only RIPA but also the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act. However, there are spy equipment laws and legal requirements around intelligence methods that vary for each form of intelligence enacted.\nMilitary intelligence and military justice.\nIn war, espionage is considered permissible as many nations recognize the inevitability of opposing sides seeking intelligence each about the dispositions of the other. To make the mission easier and successful, combatants wear disguises to conceal their true identity from the enemy while penetrating enemy lines for intelligence gathering. However, if they are caught behind enemy lines in disguises, they are not entitled to prisoner-of-war status and subject to prosecution and punishment\u2014including execution.\nThe Hague Convention of 1907 addresses the status of wartime spies, specifically within \"Laws and Customs of War on Land\" (Hague IV); October 18, 1907: Chapter II Spies\". Article 29 states that a person is considered a spy who, acts clandestinely or on false pretences, infiltrates enemy lines with the intention of acquiring intelligence about the enemy and communicate it to the belligerent during times of war. Soldiers who penetrate enemy lines in proper uniforms for the purpose of acquiring intelligence are not considered spies but are lawful combatants entitled to be treated as prisoners of war upon capture by the enemy. Article 30 states that a spy captured behind enemy lines may only be punished following a trial. However, Article 31 provides that if a spy successfully rejoined his own military and is then captured by the enemy as a lawful combatant, he cannot be punished for his previous acts of espionage and must be treated as a prisoner of war. This provision does not apply to citizens who committed treason against their own country or co-belligerents of that country and may be captured and prosecuted at any place or any time regardless whether he rejoined the military to which he belongs or not or during or after the war.\nThe ones that are excluded from being treated as spies while behind enemy lines are escaping prisoners of war and downed airmen as international law distinguishes between a disguised spy and a disguised escaper. It is permissible for these groups to wear enemy uniforms or civilian clothes in order to facilitate their escape back to friendly lines so long as they do not attack enemy forces, collect military intelligence, or engage in similar military operations while so disguised. Soldiers who are wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes simply for the sake of warmth along with other purposes rather than engaging in espionage or similar military operations while so attired are also excluded from being treated as unlawful combatants.\nSaboteurs are treated as spies as they too wear disguises behind enemy lines for the purpose of waging destruction on an enemy's vital targets in addition to intelligence gathering. For example, during World War II, eight German agents entered the U.S. in June 1942 as part of Operation Pastorius, a sabotage mission against U.S. economic targets. Two weeks later, all were arrested in civilian clothes by the FBI thanks to two German agents betraying the mission to the U.S. Under the Hague Convention of 1907, these Germans were classified as spies and tried by a military tribunal in Washington D.C. On August 3, 1942, all eight were found guilty and sentenced to death. Five days later, six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail. Two who had given evidence against the others had their sentences reduced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to prison terms. In 1948, they were released by President Harry S. Truman and deported to the American Zone of occupied Germany.\nEighteen German soldiers were shot by the United States Army after being caught in American uniform as part of Operation Greif during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. In June 1945, after Germany had been occupied by the allies, the US Army executed six individuals, including two German youths aged 16 and 17, for espionage committed against American forces during the final stages of World War II. \nThe U.S. codification of enemy spies is Article 106 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This provides a mandatory death sentence if a person captured in the act is proven to be \"lurking as a spy or acting as a spy in or about any place, vessel, or aircraft, within the control or jurisdiction of any of the armed forces, or in or about any shipyard, any manufacturing or industrial plant, or any other place or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution of the war by the United States, or elsewhere\".\nSpy fiction.\nSpies have long been favorite topics for novelists and filmmakers. An early example of espionage literature is \"Kim\" by the English novelist Rudyard Kipling, with a description of the training of an intelligence agent in the Great Game between the UK and Russia in 19th century Central Asia. An even earlier work was James Fenimore Cooper's classic novel, \"The Spy,\" written in 1821, about an American spy in New York during the Revolutionary War.\nDuring the many 20th-century spy scandals, much information became publicly known about national spy agencies and dozens of real-life secret agents. These sensational stories piqued public interest in a profession largely off-limits to human interest news reporting, a natural consequence of the secrecy inherent in their work. To fill in the blanks, the popular conception of the secret agent has been formed largely by 20th and 21st-century fiction and film. Attractive and sociable real-life agents such as Valerie Plame find little employment in serious fiction, however. The fictional secret agent is more often a loner, sometimes amoral\u2014an existential hero operating outside the everyday constraints of society. Loner spy personalities may have been a stereotype of convenience for authors who already knew how to write loner private investigator characters that sold well from the 1920s to the present.\nJohnny Fedora achieved popularity as a fictional agent of early Cold War espionage, but James Bond is the most commercially successful of the many spy characters created by intelligence insiders during that struggle. Other fictional agents include Le Carr\u00e9's George Smiley, and Harry Palmer as played by Michael Caine.\nJumping on the spy bandwagon, other writers also started writing about spy fiction featuring female spies as protagonists, such as \"The Baroness\", which has more graphic action and sex, as compared to other novels featuring male protagonists.\nSpy fiction has permeated the video game world as well, in games such as \"Perfect Dark\", \"GoldenEye 007\", \"\", \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\" and the \"Metal Gear\" series.\nEspionage has also made its way into comedy depictions. The 1960s TV series \"Get Smart\", the 1983 Finnish film \"Agent 000 and the Deadly Curves\", and \"Johnny English\" film trilogy portrays an inept spy, while the 1985 movie \"Spies Like Us\" depicts a pair of none-too-bright men sent to the Soviet Union to investigate a missile.\nThe historical novel \"The Emperor and the Spy\" highlights the adventurous life of U.S. Colonel Sidney Forrester Mashbir, who during the 1920s and 1930s attempted to prevent war with Japan, and when war did erupt, he became General MacArthur's top advisor in the Pacific Theater of World War Two.\nBlack Widow is also a fictional agent who was introduced as a Russian spy, an antagonist of the superhero Iron Man. She later became an agent of the fictional spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and a member of the superhero team the Avengers.\nUnlike much of the spy fiction, real life espionage is described as routine and boring work.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain&amp;colon; Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, 12 April 2001 (As Amended Through 31 October 2009) [aka Join Publication 1-02]\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10503", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10503", "title": "Exile (1995 video game series)", "text": "Exile is a series of role-playing video games created by Jeff Vogel of Spiderweb Software. They were released as shareware titles for Macintosh and Windows systems. \"Exile III\" was also ported to Linux by a third party. There were four games released in the series. All of the games were later revived in the \"Avernum\" series. Common to all games in the \"Exile\" series are 2D graphics and basic sound. The graphics in the first versions of \"Exile I\" and \"II\" had simple textures, colours and outlines, which were then replaced in later versions with \"Exile III\"'s graphics. The games are designed to be non-linear and long in gameplay length.\nGameplay.\nIn each game, the player is required to create six characters to form a party of adventurers or may instead use a default party. The characters' general, combat, magic and miscellaneous skills can be customized along with the character names and graphics. From \"Exile II\" onward, characters can have their traits and race configured.\nThe games have three modes including Outdoor Mode, Town Mode and Combat Mode. In Outdoor Mode, the party can enter a town, engage a group of enemies in Combat Mode and rest (if the party has food). In Town Mode, the party can talk to people, purchase from shops (provided they have enough gold), train the characters (provided they have sufficient gold and skill points), find sub-quests, pick up items (from \"Exile 2\" onward, items can be stolen) and enter Combat Mode. In Combat Mode, the party can attack enemies, defend themselves and pick up adjacent items. Combat Mode can be ended at any time in towns, but can only end outdoors when all enemies are killed.\nMagic is divided into Mage and Priest spell types. Spells for attacking can only be cast in Combat Mode. Some spells, such as Light spells, can be cast at any time. Other spells can only be cast outdoors or in town when not in Combat Mode. Players can create a character equipped with spells up to level 3, but higher level or certain spells must be purchased or found in special encounters.\nGames.\n\"Exile I: Escape from the Pit\".\nThe first game of the \"Exile\" trilogy released in January 1995 sees a party of newly created characters thrown from the world above into the subterranean world known as Exile. Once here, the party discovers a civilization formed from the outcasts of the Empire above, a culture beset by constant warfare and monsters galore. The party meets with many of those who wish to get revenge on the Empire for the wrongs it has done to the peoples of Exile.\nThe characters become a rallying point around which the people of Exile who desire vengeance gather to focus their energies into finding a way to strike back against the cruel Emperor of the surface. Together, the party manages to assassinate Emperor Hawthorne in his throne room, banish the demon king Grah-hoth who was becoming a significant threat to the citizens of Exile, and secure an escape route to the surface.\n\"Exile II: Crystal Souls\".\nThe second \"Exile\" game follows directly from the first, released in November 1996. The Empire has begun to recognise the threat the Exiles pose and begin sending their army down into Exile in huge numbers. To make matters worse, unknown barriers of energy are sprouting up around the world \u2013 sometimes aiding the Exiles, sometimes helping the Empire who can afford the losses much more easily than the Exiles.\nA new party of characters meets one of the creatures causing the barriers sprouting up in Exile and go to meet with the unknown race to negotiate. In the end, the party is more successful - and the Vahnatai joins with the Exiles to drive out the Empire. With the support of the Vahnatai the Exiles turn the tables on the Empire and successfully repulse their invasion.\n\"Exile III: Ruined World\".\nThe final release in the \"Exile\" trilogy takes place some time after \"Exile II\", released in January 1997. The Linux version was ported by http:// in Summer, 2000. A lot of preparation has taken place and now the Exiles are ready to send a selected few back into the light of the surface. However, while the members of the expedition are at first stunned by the sheer beauty of the land around them, they begin to notice that things are not as perfect as they seem. The slimes the party encounters are only the first part of what becomes a series of monsters and terrible occurrences that are blighting the Empire and laying it to waste.\nWhile scouting the land, as were the expedition members' orders from the nation of Exile, the members are asked by the Empire to help save the surface from its blight. They bring the Exiles and the Empire together as allies trying to find the cause of the destruction.\n\"Blades of Exile\".\n\"Blades of Exile\" was released in December 1997, consisting of three short scenarios set after the main trilogy as well as an editor that allows players to create their own scenarios, which need not be set in the \"Exile\" game world at all. Several hundred custom-made scenarios have been designed since the release of the game in 1997. The most prominent meeting places on the web of the \"Blades of Exile\" community are the official company-hosted internet forum. These forums offer support for beginning designers and players, reviews of new scenarios and general discussions about the use of the scenario editor. In June 2007, Jeff Vogel released the source code and game content for \"Blades of Exile\", which is currently under version 2 of the GNU General Public License.\nRelease.\nOn December 1, 1998, the first three \"Exile\" games also came packaged on a CD called the \"Exile Trilogy CD\". As of July 8, 2013, these games are freeware on Spiderweb Software's website.\nReception.\nReviews described the \"Exile\" trilogy as a \"throwback\" to old fashioned role-playing games, with deep, complex gameplay and simplistic graphics. \"Computer Games Strategy Plus\" rated \"Exile: Escape from the Pit\" three and a half out of five stars, calling it \"one of the year's best shareware games.\" The reviewer dropped a half star for its \"primitive graphics\" but found the game addictive and recommended it to veteran players \"hungry for good, old fashioned fantasy role-playing games\". \"Inside Mac Games\" rated \"Exile\" four out of five, calling it an Ultima-style role-playing game that required \"patience and thoroughness\" and had slightly \"cheesy\" graphics and sound. \"Inside Mac Games\" named \"Exile\" as runner up to \"\" for the best role-playing game of 1996.\n\"Inside Mac Games\" awarded \"Exile II\" 4 out 5 and said that it carried on \"Exile\"'s tradition as \"truly a high quality Shareware game\". A subsequent \"Inside Mac Games\" review said \"Exile II: Crystal Souls\" had \"a size, scope and depth of plot unmatched in Macintosh role-playing games.\" \"Exile II: Crystal Souls\" was an honorable mention for \"MacUser\"'s award for the best shareware game of 1996, behind winner \"Escape Velocity\". \n\"Computer Gaming World\" said that \"Exile III: Ruined World\" appears at first to be \"a shareware game with primitive graphics\" but reveals itself to be a \"remarkably deep\" traditional role-playing game with deceptive complexity. The reviewer praised the \"well written and witty\" NPC dialogue and elegant interface. Emil Pagliarulo reviewed \"Exile III\" positively for the \"Adrenaline Vault\", rating the game four out of five stars and calling it an \"engrossing, thoroughly entertaining [...] epic computer role-playing game\" with simplistic presentation and \"enormous depth\". \"Inside Mac Games\" rated \"Exile III\" 4 out of 5, saying that despite superficial similarities to previous games in the series, \"enough new features, situations and challenges\" would keep newcomers and veterans interested. The review concluded that \"Exile III\" was \"more of the same old thing: inexpensive, challenging, interesting, exciting and entertaining.\" \"Inside Mac Games\" called \"Exile III\" \"huge\" and \"highly detailed\", with quality graphics, \"an elegant interface\", and \"one of the largest and most detailed worlds and plots a fantasy role-playing game has offered\". \"Exile III\" received the 1998 ZDNet Shareware Game of the Year award, selected by the editors of Ziff-Davis magazines \"FamilyPC\", \"PC Magazine\", and \"Computer Gaming World\".\n\"Inside Mac Games\" awarded \"Blades of Exile\" 3 out of 5, calling it \"a nice, solid CRPG\" that offered value for money and ran bug-free. The reviewer found the introductory scenario lacking in story, with too much repetitive combat and \"plot-checks that have the potential to really aggravate\".\n\"Avernum\".\nSpiderweb Software has remade the \"Exile\" trilogy twice. The games were remade in 2000\u20132002 as the ' of the \"Avernum\" series, which replaced the two-dimensional tile-based graphics system of \"Exile\" with an isometric one and made numerous changes to the RPG system and some changes to the content. The remakes were followed by a remake of \"Blades of Exile\", \"Blades of Avernum\", in 2004. The \"Exile\" trilogy was rebooted for a second time with the release of ' (2011), ' (2015), and ' (2018); the remakes featured an enhanced game engine and expanded storylines.\nEngine and interface.\nWhile the game engine itself remained relatively similar between all games in the series, the interface went through many changes. Each iteration sported a new layout and color scheme, as well the individual elements, like the inventory and character roster boxes, were also changed to display information differently. Between \"Exile I\" and \"Exile II\" the most notable difference is a background color change as well as a change to the border of the play window. Between \"Exile II\" and \"Exile III\" the interface was changed significantly in that the colors and window styles were changed again but the player roster was overhauled and an inventory window was added. The changes between \"Exile III\" and \"Blades of Exile\" were more subtle and were again of the color and style nature.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The prince's mother was Fujiwara no Kaneko/\"Kaishi\" (\u85e4\u539f\u61d0\u5b50), who was a daughter of \"sessh\u014d\" Fujiwara no Koretada. Morasada was also the brother of Emperor Sanj\u014d.\nEvents of Kazan's life.\nPrince Morasada was seventeen years of age at the time of the succession.\nHe commissioned the Sh\u016bi Wakash\u016b.\nHe faced a tough political struggle from the Fujiwara family; and at the age of nineteen, he was manipulated into abandoning the throne by Fujiwara no Kaneie. Kaneie told him that Ichijo (Kaneie's maternal grandson) already held the Regalia, and that there was no purpose in Kazan continuing to rule. Under some pressure, Kazan acquiesced, and went to the Gangy\u014d-ji temple. He was accompanied by Kaneie's second son, Michikane, who was also to enter religion. When they arrived, however, Michikane said he would like to see his parents one final time while he was still a layman. Michikane never came back.\nNy\u016bkaku went on various pilgrimages and 're-founded' the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage, which was established in the early 8th century by a monk to the name of Tokudo Shonin. This pilgrimage involves travelling to 33 locations across the eight provinces of the Western Japan.\nSome scholars doubt that Kazan, in his unstable mental condition at the time was involved with the founding of the pilgrimage, thereby leaving all of the credit to Shonin.\nIt is suggested by many scholars that the mental health of Kazan, particularly in later life, was not stable; and therefore, living as a monk may have caused deteriorating behavior.\n\"Daij\u014d-tenn\u014d\" Kazan died at the age of 41 on the 8th day of the 2nd month of the fifth year of \"Kank\u014d\" (1008).\nThe actual site of Kazan's grave is known. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (\"misasagi\") at Kyoto.\nThe Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kazan's mausoleum. It is formally named \"Kamiya no hotori no misasagi\".\nHe is buried amongst the \"Seven Imperial Tombs\" at Ry\u014dan-ji Temple in Kyoto. The mound which commemorates the Hosokawa Emperor Kazan is today named \"Kinugasa-yama.\" The emperor's burial place would have been quite humble in the period after Kazan died. These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (\"misasagi\") which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.\nKugy\u014d.\n is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.\nIn general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time.

{"id": "10510", "revid": "41840956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10510", "title": "Elvis Costello", "text": "English singer-songwriter (born 1954)\nDeclan Patrick MacManus (born 25 August 1954), known professionally as Elvis Costello, is an English singer, songwriter, record producer, author and television host. According to \"Rolling Stone\", Costello \"reinvigorated the literate, lyrical traditions of Bob Dylan and Van Morrison with the raw energy and sass that were principal ethics of punk\", noting the \"construction of his songs, which set densely layered wordplay in an ever-expanding repertoire of styles\". He has won two Grammy Awards, two Ivor Novello Awards, four Edison Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, a BAFTA award, an ASCAP Founders award, and a Gemini award. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\nBorn into a musical family, Costello was raised with knowledge and appreciation of a wide range of musical styles and an insider's view of the music business. His opportunity to begin a professional career as a musician coincided with the rise of punk rock in England. The primitivism brought into fashion by punk led Costello to disguise his musical knowledge at the beginning of his career, but his stylistic range has come to encompass R&amp;B, country, jazz, baroque pop, Tin Pan Alley and classical music. His first album, \"My Aim Is True\" (1977), produced no hit singles but contains some of his best-known songs, including the ballad \"Alison\". Costello's next two albums, \"This Year's Model\" (1978) and \"Armed Forces\" (1979), recorded with his backing band the Attractions, helped define the new wave genre. From late 1977 until early 1980, each of the eight singles he released reached the UK Top 30. His biggest hit single, \"Oliver's Army\" (1979), sold more than 500,000 copies in Britain. He has had more modest commercial success in the US, but has earned much critical praise. From 1977 until the early 2000s, Costello's albums regularly ranked high on the \"Village Voice\" Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll, with \"This Year's Model\" and \"Imperial Bedroom\" (1982) voted the best album of their respective years. His biggest US hit single, \"Veronica\" (1989), reached number 19 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\nCostello has released album-length collaborations with the classical ensemble the Brodsky Quartet, the New Orleans R&amp;B songwriter and producer Allen Toussaint and the hip-hop group the Roots. Costello has written more than a dozen songs with Paul McCartney and had a long-running songwriting partnership with Burt Bacharach. He has had hits with covers of songs, including Sam &amp; Dave's \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\", Jerry Chesnut's \"Good Year for the Roses\" and Charles Aznavour's \"She\". One of the songs he is best known for, \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\", was written by Nick Lowe and recorded by Lowe's group Brinsley Schwarz in 1974, but remained obscure until Costello released his version in 1979. Costello's own songs have been recorded by artists including Linda Ronstadt, George Jones, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, Dave Edmunds, Chet Baker and Alison Krauss.\nFrom 2008 to 2010, he hosted a television show, \"\", on which he interviewed other musicians. In 2015, he published a well-received memoir, \"Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink\".\nEarly life.\nElvis Costello was born Declan Patrick MacManus, on 25 August 1954, at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, West London, the only child of a record shop worker and a jazz musician. Both parents were from the Liverpool area and had moved to London together.\nCostello's father was of Irish descent and a Catholic, while his mother was English and was raised a Congregationalist.\nFamily background.\nCostello's mother, Lillian MacManus (n\u00e9e Ablett, 1927\u20132021), was born and raised in Toxteth, Liverpool, the daughter of a gas-main layer and a mother who became increasingly disabled by rheumatoid arthritis as Lillian grew up. Responsible for caring for her younger brother and sick mother, Lillian left school at 13 and took the first of a series of jobs at music stores. After moving to London with her future husband Ross in 1951, she took a job in the record department in Selfridges department store and continued selling records through the 1960s. Even after she no longer worked selling records, Lillian maintained a keen interest in a wide variety of music, including the popular music of the day.\nCostello's father, Ross MacManus (1927\u20132011), was a professional trumpet player and singer, born and raised in Birkenhead, across the River Mersey from Liverpool. He began his career in music in the late 1940s, playing trumpet in bebop bands in Birkenhead and Liverpool. He segued to playing trumpet and singing in modern jazz bands after moving to London in 1951. By 1954, he was sufficiently well known for his son's birth to be announced in the \"New Musical Express\". From 1955 to 1968, he was a featured singer in the Joe Loss Orchestra, one of Britain's most popular big bands. Ross had a solo cabaret act from 1969 through the 1990s, playing workingmen's social clubs in Scotland, Wales, and the north of England. Ross recorded for small record labels under a variety of aliases, including Day Costello \u2013 Costello being Ross's paternal grandmother's maiden name. He also recorded advertising jingles. In 1973, he sang the \"Secret Lemonade Drinker\" jingle featured in a series of advertisements for R. Whites, with Costello on backing vocals.\nRoss's father, Patrick Matthew McManus, known as Pat, was also a professional musician. Pat was raised in an orphanage from age eight, where he learned to play trumpet. He later played trumpet as an army bandsman, a ship's musician for the White Star Line, and an orchestra musician in music halls and in theatres showing silent films. Costello has said that Pat, being the first in the family to make a career in music, is the reason he himself is a musician.\nChildhood and early musical influences.\nCostello spent most of his childhood in Twickenham, in west London, before moving to Liverpool with his mother in 1970. Costello was raised Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy until he was 14.\nCostello's parents had separated by the time Costello was ten years old, after which he was raised by his mother. Ross continued to be a significant presence in Costello's life and the two remained close until Ross's death in 2011. Costello has said that a childhood spent watching his father work gave him an innate sense of how to be a musician but also an understanding that a career in music was a job like any other, requiring discipline and hard work.\nCostello's parents never insisted he take music lessons or otherwise pushed him to follow in the family business. Instead, they raised him in a home filled with music, encouraged his musical curiosity, and supported his efforts to find his own way towards a career in music. Lillian told journalists that she knew before he was born he would have a career in music and that she listened to a broad range of music while she was pregnant with him with the intention of giving him an early start in music appreciation.\nAs a young child, Costello's musical influences came from his parents' record collection, which encompassed a wide range of styles but centred on traditional pop and jazz. Ross's job with the Joe Loss Orchestra required him to sing many of the pop hits of the day for the band's weekly radio show. To learn these songs, Ross received demonstration copies of the original artists' records, which he brought home to rehearse. When Costello grew old enough to have an interest in the current pop hits, Ross began giving him five or six of these demonstration records per week. Costello has said, \"That's why I know so many songs\".\nChief among Costello's early favourites among the hit-makers of the day were the Beatles. He has said that, having turned nine years old in 1963, he was exactly the right age to experience the full force of Beatles fandom as he grew up. He has described the Beatles as his biggest musical influence. Costello was also deeply impressed by the songs of his future collaborator Burt Bacharach, which he knew through the hits British artists Cilla Black and Dusty Springfield had with them.\nAs Costello grew into his teens, his favourites included British beat groups the Kinks, Small Faces and the Who, Jamaican rocksteady and reggae acts who were popular in Britain, and especially Motown artists, whose work he knew mainly through their British hit singles and through the Motown Chartbusters compilation series. By the time Costello reached his mid-teens, Joni Mitchell had become an important and enduring influence on him. When Costello moved to Liverpool, he found he did not enjoy much of the progressive rock that was popular with his peers, so, casting around for music he might like, he developed an interest in the Grateful Dead and folk rock groups like the Byrds and the Band, and through them, country music.\nEducation and decision to pursue a career in music.\nCostello was a well-behaved if sometimes argumentative student, but not generally an academically outstanding one. Not having scored well enough on his eleven-plus exams to go on to grammar school, he attended Archbishop Myers secondary modern school in Hounslow and then a comprehensive school in Everton, Liverpool, for sixth form. Costello showed an early talent for writing. His mother told a journalist that, when Costello was 11 years old, his school entered him into a writing contest held by \"The Times\" intended for people aged 16 to 25, for which he won a prize. As he finished secondary school, he earned one A-level, in English, despite having made a firm decision to pursue a career in music a few months earlier and putting little effort into his final months of school.\nAlthough he never had any alternative career plan, Costello had previously been reluctant to commit to a career in music, partly because his upbringing had made him aware of the potential pitfalls involved. The shock of witnessing a teenage friend's death in a traffic accident changed his mind. He would later write, \"Suddenly, everything but music seemed like a waste of precious time\".\nCostello completed his formal education in 1972 and, still living at home with his mother, set out to find a job that would earn him a steady wage while he pursued a career in music. He soon took a job as a computer operator at the Midland Bank data centre, in the Merseyside town of Bootle, because, at \u00a320 a week, it paid slightly better than other unskilled work he felt he was qualified for. According to Costello, the job consisted of essentially manual labour such as mounting tape reels and loading punched cards. Because the job involved frequent periods of waiting for the mainframe computers to complete their tasks before beginning them on the next one, it gave Costello time to write songs while at work. Except for a few months in 1973 when he worked as a clerk at the Midland Bank Putney branch, he continued to work full-time as a computer operator until a few weeks before his first album was released in July 1977.\nMusic career.\n1969\u20131976: Pre-professional career.\nCostello began writing songs and teaching himself to play guitar by age 14. To test his songs in front of an audience, he performed them in folk clubs that permitted amateur musicians to perform unpaid. He played these clubs regularly in London and continued in similar clubs when he moved to Liverpool at age 16, although folk music venues that welcomed original songs were scarcer in Liverpool than in London. By 17, he was occasionally being paid a little money. On the eve of the release of his debut album in 1977, Costello told a journalist that by that time he had written hundreds of songs.\nRusty.\nAt the beginning of 1972, Costello was invited to join a folk-rock band called Rusty by the band's founder, an 18-year-old veteran of the Liverpool music scene named Allan Mayes. As other members left, Rusty soon became a duo, with Mayes and Costello singing and playing acoustic guitars. For a little over a year, Rusty played regularly in small venues like pubs, clubs, schools, and community centres, mostly in and around Liverpool, unpaid or for small amounts of money. In Mayes's estimation, Costello was already a talented songwriter, able to quickly write songs in a variety of styles, and could sing like Neil Young or Robbie Robertson. Mayes has said he introduced Costello to Brinsley Schwarz, a band that would be an important influence on him. While in Rusty, Costello wrote an early version of a song he would record in 1980 as \"Ghost Train\", although by then little remained of the Rusty version except the central narrative idea of a married double act making their way through the low end of show business. In 2022, Costello reunited with Mayes to record and release an EP called \"The Resurrection of Rust\". The EP contained songs that were typical of Rusty's shows in 1972, including the early version of \"Ghost Train\", then called \"Maureen and Sam\".\nDeclan Costello.\nBy early 1973, Costello had determined that the music scene in Liverpool was too small to support his ambition to have a career in music, so he arranged to transfer from his job as a computer operator in the Midland Bank data centre in Bootle to a position as a clerk at the bank's Putney branch. Returning to London, Costello moved into the same Twickenham flat where he had lived with his mother a few years earlier, by then occupied by his father (Ross), Ross's second wife, and their infant son. When booking himself into London clubs, he began using the name Declan Costello, adopting a family name that Ross had once made a record under, because it was easier to spell and understand than MacManus when he spoke on the phone. Around this time, Costello accompanied Ross to Costello's first professional recording session, for the R. White's \"Secret Lemonade Drinker\" commercial jingle. Ross sang the lead vocal while Costello played guitar and sang backing vocals.\nFlip City.\nIn the second half of 1973, Costello formed a band called Flip City with several slightly older men who, like him, were fans of Brinsley Schwarz and other pub rock bands. The members of Flip City also shared Costello's enthusiasm for the Band, the Grateful Dead, and Clover. For most of 1974, Costello shared a rented house in southwest London with some of his bandmates. Flip City played the London pub rock circuit until the end of 1975, occasionally opening for more prominent bands such as Dr. Feelgood, but generally making little money and attracting little notice. Flip City's performances consisted of a mix of Costello's original songs and covers of rock, R&amp;B, and country songs. Their repertoire of Costello originals included early versions of songs that would appear on his first two albums as \"Pay It Back\", \"Miracle Man\", \"Living in Paradise\", and \"Radio Radio\". Costello wrote all but one of Flip City's original songs, did most of the singing, and chose the cover songs they played. A friend from those days later told a journalist, \"It wasn't so much that he imposed the ideas; he was the one who \"had\" the ideas\". None of the other members of Flip City shared Costello's commitment to pursuing a career in music and some disapproved of his desire to make money from his music.\nCostello became engaged to marry a former schoolmate in late 1973. By then he had found a job as a computer operator at the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics factory in North Acton, in northwest London, similar to the one he had in Bootle and with similarly low wages. By early 1975, Costello was a husband and father and was struggling to support his family. Flip City's live engagements added little to his income, rarely paying more than the band's expenses.\nCostello recorded demos with Flip City at several sessions from mid-1974 until mid-1975, hoping to use them to get live bookings, secure a recording contract, or sell Costello's songs for other artists to record. All but the first of these sessions were at a small studio owned by Dave Robinson, future Stiff Records founder. Robinson later said that he thought Flip City \"could not play at all\" but Costello was talented and ought to \"find a real band\".\nAfter Costello became successful, Flip City's demos were widely bootlegged, often misleadingly labelled to imply they were outtakes from the \"My Aim Is True\" sessions or otherwise affiliated with Stiff Records. The only Flip City recording to have been officially released is Costello's song \"Imagination (Is a Powerful Deceiver)\", recorded in early 1975, which appeared as a bonus track on the 1993 and 2001 reissues of \"My Aim Is True\". In the liner notes to the 2001 reissue, Costello wrote that, in retrospect, the song sounded to him like \"a very early attempt to write a song like 'Alison'\".\nD.P. Costello.\nEven before disbanding Flip City in late 1975, Costello was writing songs he did not include in the band's repertoire. He recorded some of these as solo demos for Dave Robinson in mid-1975. For the next year, he shopped these and other solo demos to music publishers and record companies, hoping to be hired either as a songwriter or a recording artist. He sent out as many as 20 songs on a single tape to publishers, not yet realising that no publisher would have the patience to listen to so many songs. Sometimes he went to publishers' offices to perform his songs in person. None of this generated anything but rejections until he began creating \"show reels\" of no more than six of what he believed were his most attention-getting songs, selected to appeal to the recipient of each demo tape.\nBy February 1976, Costello was booking himself into clubs as a solo act under the name D.P. Costello, D.P. being his initials and a nickname he was sometimes called by his family. While working as D.P. Costello, he learned to sing and play guitar very loudly and developed a forceful stage presence, although he was still playing to small audiences for very little money. Few of the songs he had played with Flip City were included in these performances. Instead, he was debuting some of the songs that would start to get the attention of the music industry, such as \"Mystery Dance\" and \"Wave a White Flag\". Costello included both songs on a six-track demo tape he sent to London radio presenter Charlie Gillett, who thought \"Wave a White Flag\" was the best of the six. Gillett played several songs from the tape on his radio show later that year, the first time any Costello song received airplay.\nSometime in 1976, lack of money forced Costello, his wife and their toddler son to move in with relatives near Heathrow Airport, on the far west side of London. This meant Costello's commute to work in North Acton took him past the Hoover Building in Perivale. Around the same time, he was starting to become aware of the nascent punk movement, although he would not hear any of the British punk bands until they began releasing records. The Modern Lovers' song \"Roadrunner\", with its reference to such quotidian landmarks as the Stop &amp; Shop, inspired him to write a song about the historical Art Deco building he rode past every day. Although he did not record it until 1980, Costello regarded this song, \"Hoover Factory\", as an artistic breakthrough. In the period just prior, he had been trying to imitate songwriters Randy Newman and John Prine. \"Hoover Factory\", he later recalled, got him \"through the door to a different, less ingratiating way of speaking\" in his songwriting. The next song he wrote was \"Radio Sweetheart\", which would become the B-side of his first single.\n1976\u20131977: \"My Aim Is True\".\nIn mid-August 1976, Costello included \"Mystery Dance\" and \"Radio Sweetheart\" on a demo tape he gave to Stiff Records, a new independent label that had just released its first single. Partly due to the airplay received from Gillett around the same time, Costello was soon evaluating offers from several record companies, including Gillett's own Oval Records. Costello chose to work with Stiff Records because they seemed prepared to move the fastest. Stiff had been founded by Jake Riviera, who managed several acts Costello admired, and Dave Robinson. Nick Lowe, whom Costello was on friendly terms with because he had attended so many performances by Lowe's band Brinsley Schwarz, was the label's first artist and soon became its in-house producer.\nFollowing a successful test-session in mid-September at Pathway Studios, an inexpensive studio in North London, Stiff agreed to finance more sessions for Costello with Clover, an American country-rock band from Marin County, California, as the backing band. Starting in late November or early December, Costello travelled to Headley Grange in East Hampshire, where Clover were living, to spend the day rehearsing and working out arrangements for a batch of his songs and then recording the songs with the band the next day at Pathway. Costello still held a full-time office job, so the sessions were spaced over several weeks to accommodate his work schedule and Stiff's tight finances. \"My Aim Is True\" was recorded and mixed in six four-hour sessions for a total cost of about \u00a31,000. The final mix was completed in late January 1977. Producer Nick Lowe, recording engineer Barry Farmer and Clover bassist John Ciambotti have all said they found Costello confident, well-prepared, and mature beyond his years during the making of the album.\nBy February 1977, Riviera and Robinson, who were now Costello's managers, had given him his new stage name, Elvis. The reference to Elvis Presley, who was still alive at the time, was simply intended to get attention. Costello neither particularly liked nor disliked Presley. Because Costello had seen his father, Ross, work under a variety of stage names, he gave little thought to the name change. Riviera and Robinson also helped give Costello a distinctive appearance that contrasted with the contemporaneous ideas how pop stars looked; they swapped the unobtrusive rimless glasses Costello had worn to correct astigmatism since he was a teenager for a pair with large black frames.\nCostello's first single, \"Less than Zero\", was released at the end of March 1977. It received a few brief, mixed reviews in the British music press and sold very few copies. Two further singles, \"Alison\" and \"(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes\", also sold poorly; the former would become one of his best-regarded and best-known songs. Costello was receiving increasingly prominent, positive coverage in the British music press.\n\"My Aim Is True\" had been completed since the end of January but its release was delayed, first because Stiff had wanted to release records by other artists who seemed more tied to transient music trends and then because of legal difficulties with Stiff's distributor, Island Records. It was released on 22 July 1977. Two weeks earlier, Costello had left his job as a computer operator at Elizabeth Arden on the condition that Stiff pay him, as an advance on future royalties, a regular stipend equal to the wages he had been earning at his job.\n1977\u20131979: Peak pop stardom.\nIn mid-June 1977, Costello held auditions for a bassist and keyboardist for a backing band for a tour to promote \"My Aim Is True\", wanting a sparser sound than on the album. Pete Thomas, formerly of pub-rock band Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers, who were managed by Riviera, agreed to be drummer, although Thomas was then living in California and needed to be brought back to England. Steve Goulding and Andrew Bodnar, rhythm section of the Rumour, also participated in these audition sessions, so that Costello could test how the musicians auditioning played as part of a band. Chosen were bassist Bruce Thomas (no relation to Pete), who was 28 years old and had ten years' experience in professional bands, the most successful being the Sutherland Brothers and Quiver; and keyboardist Steve Nieve (then Steve Nason), a 19-year-old student at the Royal College of Music who had formal musical training but no experience in any kind of pop group. The band, soon named the Attractions, would be Costello's touring and recording band for the next seven years.\n\"Watching the Detectives\" and commercial breakthrough.\nCostello used the time with Goulding and Bodnar to arrange and rehearse \"Watching the Detectives\". He recorded the song with them at Pathway a few days later. Costello had written the song a few weeks earlier, partly inspired by the Clash's newly released debut album. Some of the musical ideas, which Nieve fleshed out when he overdubbed his piano and organ parts a few weeks later, were inspired by film scores Bernard Herrmann had done for Alfred Hitchcock. Costello later called the recording of \"Watching the Detectives\" his first experience of \"making records as opposed to recording some songs in a room\". The song would be released as a non-album single in the UK and as a track on the US version of \"My Aim Is True\".\n\"My Aim Is True\" received extensive, favourable coverage in the UK music press through a combination of effective publicity stunts, such as Costello busking in front of the London hotel hosting the CBS Records business convention, and genuine enthusiasm for his music among music journalists. The album reached number 14 on the UK Albums Chart within a few weeks of its release. \"Watching the Detectives\", released in mid-October, reached number 15 in the UK singles chart, becoming Costello's first single to chart in any country. This was the first of an unbroken streak of eight Costello singles to reach the UK top 30. When Costello began touring the US in mid-November, he received prominent coverage in the US press, even though he played venues holding fewer than a thousand people. By this time, Costello had signed to Columbia Records, who released \"My Aim Is True\" in the US in early November. The album gradually climbed to number 32 on the US \"Billboard\" Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and was named among the best albums of the year by US music critics. In mid-December, Costello and the Attractions appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\", where they angered the show's producer by unexpectedly playing the then-unrecorded song \"Radio Radio\" during the live broadcast.\nBy late 1977, Costello had moved from Stiff Records to Radar Records, a new label founded by an associate of Jake Riviera. Riviera had split from Dave Robinson and was now Costello's sole manager. For the next year and a half, Costello's records were released on Radar in Britain.\n\"This Year's Model\".\nCostello recorded his second album and his first with the Attractions, \"This Year's Model\", during short breaks from touring, from November 1977 through January 1978. Produced by Nick Lowe, it was recorded at Eden Studios, in west London, in eleven days. Inspirations for the album's sound included 1960s beat groups like the Who, the Kinks and Small Faces, as well as contemporary acts like Talking Heads, but the biggest influence was the Rolling Stones' album \"Aftermath\" (1966). Costello himself called \"This Year's Model\" \"a ghost version of \"Aftermath\"\" and \"This Year's Girl\" an answer song to the Rolling Stones' \"Stupid Girl\".\nMost of the songs on \"This Year's Model\" were written while Costello was still working a full-time office job, before his first album was released. Among them was \"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea\", which was released as the album's first single in early March 1978, reaching number 16 on the UK singles chart. The second single, \"Pump It Up\", which reached number 24, was written later, while Costello was on tour with other Stiff acts, in reaction to what he later called his \"first exposure to idiotic rock and roll decadence\". Upon release in March, \"This Year's Model\" entered the UK Albums Chart at number 4. The US version of the album dropped \"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea\" and \"Night Rally\", a song written in response to the rise of the British National Front, and replaced them with \"Radio Radio\". The US release reached number 30 on the \"Billboard\" chart but spent fewer weeks on the chart than \"My Aim Is True\". \"Radio Radio\" was released as a non-album single in the UK in October 1978, where it reached number 29.\n\"This Year's Model\" was highly praised by critics in Britain and the US. \"Melody Maker\" called it an \"achievement so comprehensive, so inspired, that it exhausts superlatives\". The \"NME\" review read similarly, saying the album was \"so ridiculously good that one's immediate inclinations are to clamber effusively over the top, superlative peaking superlative\". The \"Village Voice\" Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll voted it the best album of 1978. \"Rolling Stone\" named it among the best five albums of 1978.\nFor the seven months following the completion of \"This Year's Model\", Costello and the Attractions continued touring Britain, Europe and North America, playing larger venues and debuting new songs that Costello was writing for his next album. In July 1978, Costello performed at the Danish Roskilde Festival, topping the bill with three other artists, premiering the song \"Oliver's Army\" that would become his biggest hit in the UK.\n\"Armed Forces\".\nCostello and the Attractions recorded his third album, \"Armed Forces\", at Eden Studios in six weeks from August and September 1978. It was again produced by Nick Lowe, but Costello himself provided greater creative control. Like \"This Year's Model\", the album's influences came from the music Costello and the Attractions listened to while touring, from the Berlin-era records of David Bowie and Iggy Pop to ABBA and Kraftwerk. Costello later said that \"Armed Forces\" was his first album of songs he wrote with an awareness of having an audience. The album's lyrics reflected his experiences on the road in the US, as well his continued concern over the rise of far-right political groups in the UK; the album was originally to be called \"Emotional Fascism\". Just before the album's completion in late September, Costello and the Attractions played to an audience of 150,000 in Brockwell Park, south London, as part of the second Rock Against Racism music festival. A few weeks later, they began six months of touring that included, for the first time, Japan and Australia, as well as the UK, Europe, Canada and the US.\nReleased in early January 1979, \"Armed Forces\" debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart, and spent 28 weeks on the chart. In the US, it spent 25 weeks on the \"Billboard\" chart, peaking at number 10 in mid-March. The US release replaced \"Sunday's Best\" with Costello's cover of Lowe's \"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\". Costello's best-selling single, \"Oliver's Army\", was released in Britain in February. Costello has said he wrote the song after his first visit to Northern Ireland and was inspired by seeing young British soldiers on the streets of Belfast as a part of the Troubles. The song reached number two on the UK singles chart. It was also his biggest hit single in Ireland, reaching number four on the Irish singles chart. The second single, \"Accidents Will Happen\", was released in early May. According to Costello, the song was written in response to his own marital infidelities. The song reached number 28 in the UK. In the US, it reached number 101, missing the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 but charting higher than any previous Costello single.\nThe concert tour promoting \"Armed Forces\" was marked by bad publicity. Costello and the Attractions played some shows that audiences considered too brief and refused to return for encores. Audiences in Sydney, Australia, and Berkeley, California, responded by vandalising the concert venues. After a concert in Columbus, Ohio, on 15 March, Costello got into a drunken argument at a hotel bar with members of the Stephen Stills band and entourage. The argument culminated in Costello disparaging James Brown and Ray Charles with racially charged insults, in comments he would later call \"the exact opposite of my true feelings\". When Costello's comments were reported in the press a few weeks later, the bad publicity was sufficiently severe and widespread to be regarded, including by Costello himself, as the reason he never achieved the top-level commercial success in the US that had been predicted for him.\nIn June, Costello had a hit as a songwriter when Dave Edmunds released his recording of \"Girls Talk\", a song Costello had written but not yet recorded. Edmunds' version reached number four on the UK singles chart and number 65 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n1980s.\nCostello's 1980 \"Get Happy!!\" album featured a sound based on vintage American soul music. Some songs marked a distinct change in mood from the angry, frustrated tone of his first three albums to a more upbeat, happy manner. The single, \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\", was a rendition of a Sam and Dave song. Lyrically, the songs are full of Costello's signature wordplay. His only 1980 appearance in North America was at the Heatwave festival in August near Toronto.\nIn January 1981, Costello released \"Trust\" amidst growing tensions within the Attractions. The single \"Watch Your Step\" was released in the US only and played live on Tom Snyder's \"Tomorrow\" show, and received airplay on FM rock radio. In the UK, the single \"Clubland\" scraped the lower reaches of the UK singles chart; follow-up single \"From a Whisper to a Scream\" (a duet with Glenn Tilbrook of Squeeze) became the first Costello single in over four years to completely miss the chart. Costello also co-produced Squeeze's 1981 album \"East Side Story\" (with Roger B\u00e9chirian) and performed backing vocals on the group's hit \"Tempted\".\nOctober saw the release of \"Almost Blue\", a cover album of country music including songs written by Hank Williams (\"Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do?)\"), Merle Haggard (\"Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down\"), Gram Parsons (\"How Much I Lied\") and George Jones (\"Brown to Blue\"). The album received mixed reviews. The first pressings of the record in the UK bore a sticker with the message: \"WARNING: This album contains country &amp; western music and may cause a radical reaction in narrow minded listeners\". \"Almost Blue\" did spawn a surprise UK hit single with a version of Jerry Chesnut's \"Good Year for the Roses\", which reached number six. Costello had long been an avid country music fan and has cited George Jones as his favourite country singer. He had appeared on Jones' duet album \"My Very Special Guests\", contributing \"Stranger in the House\", which they later performed together on a 1981 HBO special dedicated to Jones.\n\"Imperial Bedroom\" (1982) featured lavish production by Geoff Emerick, engineer of several Beatles records. It remains one of his most critically acclaimed records, but again it failed to produce any hit singles\u2014\"You Little Fool\" and the critically acclaimed \"Man Out of Time\" both failed to reach the Top 40 in the UK. Costello collaborated with Chris Difford, also of Squeeze, to write the song \"Boy With a Problem\". Costello has said he disliked the marketing pitch for the album. \"Imperial Bedroom\" also featured Costello's song \"Almost Blue\", inspired by the music of jazz singer and trumpeter Chet Baker. Baker later recorded his own version of the song. \"Imperial Bedroom\" placed first on the \"Village Voice\"'s annual Pazz &amp; Jop poll.\nIn 1983, he released \"Punch the Clock\", featuring female backing vocal duo (Afrodiziak) and a four-piece horn section (the TKO Horns), alongside the Attractions. Clive Langer (who co-produced with Alan Winstanley), provided Costello with a melody which eventually became \"Shipbuilding\", which featured a trumpet solo by Baker. Prior to the release of Costello's own version, a version of the song was a minor UK hit for Soft Machine founder Robert Wyatt.\nUnder the pseudonym The Imposter, Costello released \"Pills and Soap\", an attack on the changes in British society brought on by Thatcherism, released to coincide with the run-up to the 1983 UK general election. \"Punch the Clock\" also generated an international hit in the single \"Everyday I Write the Book\", aided by a music video featuring lookalikes of Prince Charles and Princess Diana undergoing domestic strife in a suburban home. The song became Costello's first Top 40 hit single in the US. Also in the same year, Costello provided vocals on a version of the Madness song \"Tomorrow's Just Another Day\" released as a B-side.\nTensions within the band \u2013 notably between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas \u2013 were beginning to tell, and Costello announced his retirement and the break-up of the group shortly before they were to record \"Goodbye Cruel World\" (1984). Costello later expressed disappointment with the final album's production, describing it as \"probably the worst record that I could have made of a decent bunch of songs\". The record was poorly received upon its initial release; the liner notes to the 1995 Rykodisc re-release, penned by Costello, begin with the words \"Congratulations! You've just purchased our worst album\". Costello's retirement, although short-lived, was accompanied by two compilations, \"Elvis Costello: The Man\" in the UK, Europe and Australia, and \"The Best of Elvis Costello &amp; The Attractions\" in the US. Daryl Hall provided backing vocals on the song \"The Only Flame in Town\" on \"Goodbye Cruel World\".\nIn 1985, Costello performed at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium, singing the Beatles' \"All You Need Is Love\" as a solo artist. He introduced the song as an \"old northern English folk song\", and the audience was invited to sing the chorus. In the same year Costello teamed up with friend T\u00a0Bone Burnett for the single \"The People's Limousine\" under the moniker of the Coward Brothers. That year, Costello also produced \"Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash\" for the Irish punk/folk band the Pogues and he sang with Annie Lennox on the song \"Adrian\" from the Eurythmics record \"Be Yourself Tonight\".\nGrowing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions' first split in 1986 when Costello was preparing to make a comeback. Working in the US with Burnett, a band containing a number of Elvis Presley's sidemen (including James Burton and Jerry Scheff), and minor input from the Attractions, he produced \"King of America\", an acoustic guitar-driven album with a country sound. It was billed as performed by \"The Costello Show featuring the Attractions and Confederates\" in the UK and Europe and \"The Costello Show featuring Elvis Costello\" in North America. Around this time he legally changed his name back to Declan MacManus, adding Aloysius as an extra middle name. Costello retooled his upcoming tour to allow for multiple nights in each city, playing one night with the Confederates, one night with the Attractions, and one night solo acoustic. In May 1986, he performed at Self Aid, a benefit concert held in Dublin that focused on the chronic unemployment which was widespread in Ireland at that time.\nLater that year, Costello returned to the studio with the Attractions and recorded \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\", which was lauded for a post-punk fervour not heard since 1978's \"This Year's Model\". It also marked the return of producer Nick Lowe, who had produced Costello's first five albums. While \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\" failed to chart a hit single of any significance, it did produce what has since become one of Costello's signature concert songs, \"I Want You\". On this album, Costello adopted the alias Napoleon Dynamite, the name he later attributed to the character of the emcee that he played during the vaudeville-style tour to support \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\". (The pseudonym had previously been used in 1982, when the B-side single \"Imperial Bedroom\" was credited to Napoleon Dynamite &amp; the Royal Guard; whether the title of the 2004 film \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was inspired by Costello is disputed). After the tour for \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\", Costello split from the Attractions, due mostly to lingering tensions between him and Bruce Thomas. Costello continued to work with another Attraction, Pete Thomas, as a session musician for future releases.\nCostello's recording contract with Columbia Records ended after \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\". In 1987, he released a compilation album, \"Out of Our Idiot\", on his UK label, Demon Records consisting of B-sides, side projects, and unreleased songs from recording sessions from 1980 to 1987. He signed a new contract with Warner Bros. and in early 1989 released \"Spike\", which spawned his biggest single in the US, the Top 20 hit (it reached number 19) \"Veronica\", one of several songs Costello co-wrote with Paul McCartney. At the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards on 6 September in Los Angeles, \"Veronica\" won the MTV Award for Best Male Video.\nCostello and McCartney wrote several songs together over a short period, which were released over a number of years:\nIn 1987, Costello appeared on the HBO special \"Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night\", a tribute to his long-time idol Roy Orbison. Costello co-wrote \"The Other End (Of the Telescope)\" with the American singer-songwriter Aimee Mann. It appears on the 1988 album \"Everything's Different Now\" by Mann's band Til Tuesday.\n1990s.\nIn 1991, Costello released \"Mighty Like a Rose\", which featured the single \"The Other Side of Summer\". He also co-composed and co-produced, with Richard Harvey, the title and incidental music for the mini-series \"G.B.H.\" by Alan Bleasdale. This entirely instrumental, and largely orchestral, soundtrack garnered a BAFTA, for Best Music for a TV Series for the pair.\nIn 1993, Costello experimented with classical music with a critically acclaimed collaboration with the Brodsky Quartet on \"The Juliet Letters\". During this period, he wrote a full album's worth of material for Wendy James, and these songs became the tracks on her 1993 solo album \"Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears\". Costello returned to rock and roll the following year with a project that reunited him with the Attractions, \"Brutal Youth\". In 1995, he released \"Kojak Variety\", an album of cover songs recorded five years earlier, and followed in 1996 with an album of songs originally written for other artists, \"All This Useless Beauty\". This was the final album of original material that he issued under his Warner Bros. contract, and also his final album with the Attractions.\nIn 1994, he sang \"They Can't Take That Away from Me\" with Tony Bennett for \"MTV Unplugged\", appearing on the album released from the broadcast.\nIn the spring of 1996, Costello played a series of intimate club dates, backed only by Steve Nieve on the piano, in support of \"All This Useless Beauty\". An ensuing mid-year tour with the Attractions proved to be the death knell, with relations between Costello and bassist Bruce Thomas at a breaking point, Costello announced that the current tour would be the Attractions' last. The quartet performed their final US show in Seattle, Washington on 1 September 1996, before wrapping up their tour in Japan. Costello continued to work frequently with Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas; eventually, both became members of Costello's new back-up band, The Imposters.\nTo fulfill his contractual obligations to Warner Bros., Costello released a greatest hits album titled \"Extreme Honey\" (1997). It contained an original track titled \"The Bridge I Burned\", featuring Costello's son, Matt, on bass. In the intervening period, Costello had served as artistic chair for the 1995 Meltdown Festival, which gave him the opportunity to explore his increasingly eclectic musical interests. His involvement in the festival yielded a one-off live EP with jazz guitarist Bill Frisell, which featured both cover material and a few of his own songs.\nIn 1998, Costello signed a multi-label contract with Polygram Records, sold by its parent company the same year to become part of the Universal Music Group. Costello released his new work on what he deemed the suitable imprimatur within the family of labels. His first new release as part of this contract involved a collaboration with Burt Bacharach. Their work had commenced earlier, in 1996, on \"God Give Me Strength\" for the movie \"Grace of My Heart\". This led the pair to write and record the critically acclaimed album \"Painted From Memory\", released under his new contract in 1998, on the Mercury Records label, featuring songs that were largely inspired by the dissolution of his relationship with Cait O'Riordan. Costello and Bacharach performed several concerts with full orchestral backing, and also recorded an updated version of Bacharach's \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" for the soundtrack to ', with both appearing in the film to perform the song. He also wrote \"I Throw My Toys Around\" for \"The Rugrats Movie\" and performed it with No Doubt. The same year, he collaborated with Paddy Moloney of the Chieftains on \"The Long Journey Home\" on the soundtrack of the PBS/Disney ' miniseries. The soundtrack won a Grammy Award in 1999.\nIn 1999, Costello contributed a version of \"She\", released in 1974 by Charles Aznavour and Herbert Kretzmer, for the soundtrack of the film \"Notting Hill\", with Trevor Jones producing. Costello's version of the song reached number 19 on the UK singles chart. For the 25th anniversary of \"Saturday Night Live\", Costello was invited to the programme, where he re-enacted his abrupt song-switch: This time, however, he interrupted the Beastie Boys' \"Sabotage\", and they acted as his backing group for \"Radio Radio\". He also co-wrote another song with Aimee Mann, \"The Fall of the World's Own Optimist\", for her 2000 album \"Bachelor No. 2\".\n2000s.\nFrom 2001 to 2005, Costello re-issued his back catalogue in the US, from \"My Aim Is True\" (1977) to \"All This Useless Beauty\" (1996), on double-disc collections on the Rhino Records label. These releases, which each contained second discs of bonus material, ultimately fell out of print by 2007 after Universal Music acquired the rights to Costello's catalogue. Universal subsequently released new deluxe editions of \"My Aim Is True\" and \"This Year's Model\" with new bonus material of full-length concerts from the time of each album's release. These deluxe editions also fell out of print and Universal has reverted to re-releasing Costello's pre-1987 albums in their original context without bonus material.\nIn 2000, Costello wrote lyrics to \"Green Song\", a solo cello piece by Svante Henryson; this song appears on the Anne Sofie von Otter album \"For the Stars\".\nIn 2000, Costello appeared at the Town Hall, New York, in Steve Nieve's opera \"Welcome to the Voice\", alongside Ron Sexsmith and John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants. In 2001, Costello was artist-in-residence at UCLA and wrote the music for a new ballet. He produced and appeared on an album of pop songs for the classical singer Anne Sofie von Otter. He released the album \"When I Was Cruel\" in 2002 on Island Records, and toured with a new band, the Imposters (essentially the Attractions but with a different bass player, Davey Faragher, formerly of Cracker).\nOn 23 February 2003, Costello, along with Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt and Dave Grohl, performed a version of the Clash's \"London Calling\" at the 45th Grammy Awards ceremony, in honour of Clash frontman Joe Strummer, who had died the previous December. In March, Elvis Costello &amp; the Attractions were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In May, he announced his engagement to Canadian jazz singer and pianist Diana Krall, whom he had seen in concert and then met backstage at the Sydney Opera House in Australia. That September, he released \"North\", an album of piano-based ballads concerning the breakdown of his former marriage, and his falling in love with Krall.\nThe song \"Scarlet Tide\" (co-written by Costello and T Bone Burnett and used in the film \"Cold Mountain\") was nominated for a 2004 Academy Award; he performed it at the awards ceremony with Alison Krauss, who sang the song on the official soundtrack. Costello co-wrote many songs on Krall's 2004 CD, \"The Girl in the Other Room\", the first of hers to feature several original compositions. In July 2004, Costello's first full-scale orchestral work, \"Il Sogno\", was performed in New York. The work, a ballet based on Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", was commissioned by Italian dance troupe Aterballeto, and received critical acclaim from classical music critics. Performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, the recording was released on CD in September by Deutsche Grammophon. In September 2004, Costello released the album \"The Delivery Man\", recorded in Oxford, Mississippi, on Lost Highway Records, and it was hailed as one of his best.\nA CD recording of a collaboration with Marian McPartland on her show \"Piano Jazz\" was released in 2005. It featured Costello singing six jazz standards and two of his own songs, accompanied by McPartland on piano.\nA 2005 tour included a gig at Glastonbury that Costello considered so dreadful that he said \"I don't care if I ever play England again. That gig made up my mind I wouldn't come back. I don't get along with it. We lost touch. It's 25 years since I lived there. I don't dig it, they don't dig me...British music fans don't have the same attitude to age as they do in America, where young people come to check out, say Willie Nelson. They feel some connection with him and find a role for that music in their lives\".\nIn 2005, Costello performed with Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong. They played both Costello and Green Day songs together, including \"Alison\", \"No Action\", \"Basket Case\" and \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\".\nIn November, Costello started recording a new album with Allen Toussaint and producer Joe Henry. Costello had a collaborative history with Toussaint, beginning with a couple of scattered album tracks in the 1980s. In September 2006, Costello and Allen Toussaint performed in New York at a series of benefit concerts for victims of Hurricane Katrina. By week's end, Costello had written \"The River in Reverse\", performed it with Toussaint and discussed plans for an album with Verve Records executives. Costello turned to older songs to reflect the national malaise at the time.\nIn a studio recording of Nieve's opera \"Welcome to the Voice\" (2006, Deutsche Grammophon), Costello interpreted the character of Chief of Police, with Barbara Bonney, Robert Wyatt, Sting and Amanda Roocroft, and the album reached No.\u00a02 in the \"Billboard\" classical charts. Costello later reprised the piece on the stage of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in Paris in 2008, with Sting, Joe Sumner (Sting's son) and Sylvia Schwartz. Also released in 2006 was a live recording of a concert with the Metropole Orkest at the North Sea Jazz Festival, entitled \"My Flame Burns Blue\". The soundtrack for \"House, M.D.\" featured Costello's interpretation of \"Beautiful\" by Christina Aguilera, with the song appearing in the second episode of Season 2.\nCostello was commissioned to write a chamber opera by the Danish Royal Opera, Copenhagen, on the subject of Hans Christian Andersen's infatuation with Swedish soprano Jenny Lind. Called \"The Secret Songs\", it remained unfinished. In a performance in 2007 directed by Kasper Bech Holten at the Opera's studio theatre (Takelloftet), finished songs were interspersed with pieces from Costello's 1993 collaborative classical album \"The Juliet Letters\", featuring Danish soprano Sine Bundgaard as Lind. The 2009 album \"Secret, Profane &amp; Sugarcane\" includes material from \"Secret Songs\".\nOn 22 April 2008, \"Momofuku\" was released on Lost Highway Records, the same imprint that released \"The Delivery Man\", his previous studio album. The album was, at least initially, released exclusively on vinyl (with a code to download a digital copy). That summer, in support of the album, Costello toured with the Police on the final leg of their 2007/2008 Reunion Tour. Costello played a homecoming gig at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on 25 June 2006. and, that month, gave his first performance in Poland, appearing with The Imposters for the closing gig of the Malta theatre festival in Pozna\u0144.\nIn 2006, Costello performed with Fiona Apple in the Decades Rock TV special. Apple performed two Costello songs and Costello performed two Apple songs.\nIn 2007, Costello collaborated with the Argentinean/Uruguayan electro-tango band Bajofondo on the song \"Fairly Right\" from the album \"Mar Dulce\". In 2008, Costello collaborated with Fall Out Boy on the track \"What a Catch, Donnie\" from their album \"Folie a Deux\". In Jenny Lewis' 2008 release, \"Acid Tongue\", Costello provided vocals for the song \"Carpetbaggers\". In November 2009, Costello appeared live with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at Madison Square Garden and performed the Jackie Wilson song \"(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher\".\nIn July 2008, Costello (as Declan McManus) appeared in his home city Liverpool where he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Music from the University of Liverpool. Costello was featured on Fall Out Boy's 2008 album \"Folie \u00e0 Deux\", providing vocals on the track \"What a Catch, Donnie\", along with other artists who are friends with the band.\nCostello appeared in Stephen Colbert's television special \"\". In the program, he was eaten by a bear, but later saved by Santa Claus; he also sang a duet with Colbert. The special was first aired on 23 November 2008. Costello released \"Secret, Profane &amp; Sugarcane\", a collaboration with T Bone Burnett, on 9 June 2009. It was his first on the Starbucks Hear Music label and a return to country music in the manner of \"Good Year for the Roses\".\nIn May 2009, Costello made a surprise cameo appearance on-stage at the Beacon Theatre in New York as part of Spinal Tap's \"Unwigged and Unplugged\" show, singing their fictional 1965 hit \"Gimme Some Money\" with the band backing him up.\nIn December 2009, Costello portrayed The Shape on the album \"Ghost Brothers of Darkland County\", a collaboration between rock singer John Mellencamp and novelist Stephen King. In February 2010, Costello appeared in the live cinecast of Garrison Keillor's \"Prairie Home Companion\", singing some of his own songs, and participating in many of the show's other musical and acting performances. On 30 April 2011, he played the song \"Pump it Up\" with the Odds before the start of a Vancouver Canucks playoff game at Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n2010\u2013present.\nCostello released the album \"National Ransom\" in autumn of 2010.\nOn 26 February 2012, Costello paid tribute to music legends Chuck Berry and Leonard Cohen, who were the recipients of the first annual PEN Awards for songwriting excellence, at the JFK Presidential Library, in Boston, Massachusetts. In September 2013 Costello released \"Wise Up Ghost\", a collaboration with the Roots. On 25 October 2013, Costello was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the New England Conservatory.\nIn 2012, he played ukulele, mandolin, guitar and added backing vocals on Diana Krall's 11th studio album, \"Glad Rag Doll\" (as \"Howard Coward\"). On 10 September 2013, he played during the Apple September 2013 Event after the introduction of iTunes Radio, iPhone 5C and 5S at Town Hall, at the Apple campus.\nOn Gov't Mule's album \"Shout!\", released in September 2013, he sang on the track \"Funny Little Tragedy\". In March 2014, Costello recorded \"\" with Rhiannon Giddens, Taylor Goldsmith, Jim James and Marcus Mumford. During the 2016 Detour, he performs with Larkin Poe.\nOn 12 October 2018, Costello released his first studio album in five years, \"Look Now\", recorded with The Imposters. The album features three songs co-written with Burt Bacharach, and one song co-written with Carole King. Costello wrote and produced a large majority of the album himself, with help from producer Sebastian Krys. On 26 January 2020, \"Look Now\" won the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards.\nCostello was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to music.\nIn 2021, Costello released \"Spanish Model\", a remix of 1978's \"This Year's Model\" with Spanish lyrics. Singers from Spanish-speaking parts of the world, with help from Spanish-speaking songwriters, translated all 16 songs of the album into Spanish, with the new vocals set to the original recording and instrumentation by the Attractions. The singers included Juanes, Jorge Drexler, Luis Fonsi, Francisca Valenzuela, Fuego, Draco Rosa, and Fito P\u00e1ez.\nIn 2021, Costello appeared at the Royal Variety Performance playing two songs with the Imposters. He was introduced by the MC Alan Carr as a man who has achieved everything except appearing at the Royal Variety Performance. Between songs Costello informed the audience that he was the second McManus to appear. His father Ross appeared in the 1960s singing \"If I Had a Hammer\".\nIn January 2022, he performed on \"The Graham Norton Show\". That same month he released the LP \"The Boy Named If\", recorded with the Imposters. \"The Resurrection of Rust\" by a reformed Rusty followed later that year.\nIn April 2023, Costello collaborated with Slovenian band Joker Out on their single, \"New Wave\". The compilation \"The Songs of Bacharach &amp; Costello\" was also released at this time. In August 2023, he made a three-dates mini-tour together with Italian singer-songwriter Carmen Consoli, a project the two had originally planned in 2012 but that at the time had been shelved due to Consoli's pregnancy.\nIn November 2024, Costello and T\u00a0Bone Burnett released a scripted comedy audio series on Audible, directed by Christopher Guest, as the Coward Brothers, characters the two created in the 1980s. The series features guest appearances by Harry Shearer as the radio host interviewing the two, along with Rhea Seehorn, Edward Hibbert, Stephen Root and Kathreen Khavari. An accompanying soundtrack album was released via New West Records.\nWriting.\nSince the early 1980s, Costello has written about music for publications including \"Hot Press,\" \"Details\", \"Mojo\", \"Musician\", \"NME\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"Vanity Fair.\" He has also written several articles about football (soccer), as an avid and knowledgeable fan, for the \"Times\" of London. A \"Vanity Fair\" editor who worked with Costello said his \"copy was clean, elegant, and ready to run\".\nCostello has written liner notes for releases by artists including Gram Parsons, the Fairfield Four, Dusty Springfield, Booker T. &amp; the M.G.'s, Burt Bacharach, and Bill Frisell. He has written forewords to books by Geoff Emerick, Loretta Lynn, and Wanda Jackson.\nIn 1993, Costello began reissuing his catalogue of albums from 1977 through 1986, on Rykodisc, and wrote detailed liner notes for each reissued album. Reviewers praised these liner notes as frank and charming. In 2001, he began a second round of reissues, this time of his catalogue from 1977 through 1996, on Rhino Entertainment, and wrote even more detailed liner notes. \"Goldmine\" said the Rhino liner notes brought \"a wealth of insight into the songs and the creative process itself\" and that \"liner notes simply don't get any better than this\". \"Pitchfork\" called them \"truly fascinating\". Several journalists noted that, at a total of 60,000 words, the Rhino liner notes amounted to a serialised memoir. In 2012, \"Slate\" magazine published a book review of the Rhino liner notes in which it called them \"one of the best rock-star memoirs of the last decade\".\nIn 2015, Costello published \"Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink\", a memoir that had little overlap with his reissue liner notes. In this book, he recounted his life in music and traced parallels between his own experiences and those of his father and grandfather, both of whom were musicians. The book received enthusiastic positive reviews from prominent publications. \"The New York Times\" said that it contained \"some of the best writing \u2013 funny, strange, spiteful, anguished \u2013 we've ever had from an important musician\". \"The Washington Post\" praised it as having more in common with Frank McCourt's memoir \"Angela's Ashes\" than M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's and said it was more enjoyable than Keith Richards' \"Life\" and Bob Dylan's \"\". Some positive reviews noted that the quality of the writing in the book was uneven and that the book might have been improved by being shorter, more focused thematically, or both. Dublin Review of Books praised Costello's more experimental short sequences within the book \"...as short stories. They have something of the flavour of Pinter\u2019s more or less adjective-shorn prose, and seem to be offered as sublimated insights into Costello\u2019s fears and worst experiences.\" The few negative reviews the book received criticised its nonlinear structure, its relative lack of emphasis on Costello's pop-star period, and its lack of details about his romantic relationships. The book reached number seven on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller list. It was shortlisted for the Penderyn Music Book Prize, a British award for excellence in writing about music. The audiobook, narrated by Costello, was nominated for a Grammy Award.\nActing and television presenting.\nCostello has played himself or fictional characters very similar to himself in movies and television shows including \"\" (1999), \"The Simpsons\" (2002), \"Frasier\" (2003), \"Two and a Half Men\" (2004), \"30 Rock\" (2009), \"Treme\" (2010), and \"Sesame Street\" (2011). He has also played more character-based roles, such as the title character's eccentric brother in screenwriter Alan Bleasdale's television series \"Scully\" (1984), an inept magician in Bleasdale's movie \"No Surrender\" (1985)\",\" a teacher at an impoverished school in the movie \"Prison Song\" (2001), and the title character's father in the children's animated series \"The Adventures of Pete the Cat\" (2017). In 1995, he appeared as a guest pundit on the British football commentary television show \"Football Italia\".\nIn 2003, Costello substituted for an ailing David Letterman as the host of \"Late Show with David Letterman\", making him the only musical guest of the show to have served as guest host. Costello's performance on that show led to interest in developing a music-orientated talk show with him as the host, which came to fruition a few years later.\nIn 2008, Costello began production on \"\", a show on which he interviewed and performed songs with other musicians. The series was executive-produced by Elton John, who also appeared as a guest, and other guests included Tony Bennett, Bruce Springsteen, Smokey Robinson, Bono and the Edge of U2, opera singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming, and former president (and accomplished saxophonist) Bill Clinton. It ran for 20 episodes over two seasons from 2008 through 2010, and aired on Sundance Channel in the US, CTV in Canada, and Channel 4 in the UK. The show was received favourably in the US, with reviewers praising Costello's ability to get his guests to reveal insights into their creative processes and calling him a \"deeply knowledgeable, erudite and witty host\". In Canada, the show won a Gemini Award for Best Talk Series. In Britain, it was aired in an overnight time slot and largely ignored.\nPublic image and controversies.\nCostello revealed little about his background and gave few interviews in the first five years of his career, so the few widely published interviews he gave played a large role in forming his early public image. In a widely quoted August 1977 interview with Nick Kent, Costello said the only things that mattered to him were \"revenge and guilt\". This phrase would be associated with him throughout his career.\n1977 \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance.\nOn 17 December 1977, Costello and the Attractions appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" as last-minute replacements for the Sex Pistols. One of the songs Costello was scheduled to perform, at the request of his record company, was \"Less Than Zero\", a song Costello wrote in reaction to seeing British fascist Oswald Mosley being treated with what Costello felt was undeserved deference during an interview on British television. Costello did not want to play the song because he thought the subject was too obscure for American audiences and the song was too low-key to make a strong impression. Instead, he wanted to play the then-unrecorded song, \"Radio Radio\". During the live broadcast, Costello played a few bars of \"Less Than Zero\" and then told the Attractions to play \"Radio Radio\", which they played in its entirety. This angered the show's producer, Lorne Michaels, because Michaels was not prepared for the change and because \"Radio Radio\" had not been cleared by NBC's censors. When asked about the incident on NBC's \"Tomorrow Show\" three years later, Costello said he was told he would never appear on American television again. He appeared as musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" again in 1989 and 1991. Although the incident provoked little comment at the time, by 1999 it had become so well-known that \"Saturday Night Live\" invited Costello to perform a parody of it with the Beastie Boys on the show's 25th anniversary special.\n1979 Columbus incident.\nIn March 1979, during a drunken argument with Bonnie Bramlett and other members of the Stephen Stills band, at a Holiday Inn bar in Columbus, Ohio, Costello referred to Ray Charles as a \"blind, ignorant nigger\" and made similar comments about James Brown. At a New York City press conference a few days later, Costello said he had been drunk and had been attempting to be obnoxious to bring the conversation to a swift conclusion, not anticipating that Bramlett would bring his comments to the press. According to Costello, \"It became necessary for me to outrage these people with about the most obnoxious and offensive remarks that I could muster\".\nIn his liner notes for the expanded version of \"Get Happy!!\" Costello writes that some time after the incident he had declined an offer to meet Charles out of guilt and embarrassment, although Charles himself had forgiven Costello, saying \"Drunken talk isn't meant to be printed in the paper\". Costello worked extensively in Britain's Rock Against Racism campaign both before and after the incident. In an interview with Questlove (drummer for the Roots, with whom Costello collaborated in 2013), he stated: \"It's upsetting because I can't explain how I even got to think you could be funny about something like that\" and further elaborating with, \"I'm sorry. You know? It's about time I said it out loud.\"\n2010 cancelled Tel Aviv concerts.\nIn early 2010, Costello was invited to play his first concert in Israel, on 30 June of that year, at the Caesarea Amphitheater north of Tel Aviv. Due to high demand for tickets, a second concert was added for 1 July. At first, Costello seemed resolved to resist political pressure on artists to refrain from performing in Israel due to the country's controversial treatment of Palestinians. In early May, Costello told Israel's largest daily newspaper, \"Yedioth Ahronoth\", \"As soon as you play you are going to get criticised\". Costello told the newspaper he did not agree with organisations that \"think that they need to boycott Israel to pressure it\", saying he thought \"culture is the only way in which humanity shares experiences, and that is why I need to come and perform here\". Two weeks later, he announced on his website that he had cancelled the concerts because of what he called the \"grave and complex\" sensitivities of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He told \"The Jerusalem Post\" his decision was part of a \"30-year conundrum\" that he had been dealing with regarding playing in Israel. He also told the \"Post\" that he had not been threatened or coerced, but that he \"woke up one day and realised [he] couldn't go on with the shows\". The promoters of the concerts expressed shock. Israeli Culture Minister Limor Livnat, a member of the right-wing Likud Party who opposed the Oslo accords and withdrawal from the occupied territories, denounced the decision. The organisation Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel praised it.\nPersonal life.\nCostello has no full siblings. He has four half-brothers from his father's second marriage, all of whom are musicians.\nIn November 1974, Costello married Mary Burgoyne. Costello has said he had hoped to marry Burgoyne since he was 14 years old and they were at school together in London, although they did not begin dating until four years later, when Costello moved back to London after living with his mother in Liverpool for two and a half years. They have one child, Matthew MacManus, born in early 1975. Costello's rapid rise to fame put a strain on their marriage almost immediately. The couple separated in early 1978 but reconciled the following year. They separated permanently in mid-1984 and finalised their divorce in 1988. Costello has said that his inability to remain faithful in his first marriage, and the emotional turmoil it caused him, has been a major inspiration for his songs.\nIn early 1985, Costello began a romantic relationship with Cait O'Riordan, then bass player for the Pogues, whom he met in October 1984 while their respective bands were on tour together. In May 1986, they exchanged wedding rings and thereafter presented themselves, and were regarded, as husband and wife. They were never legally married. In September 2002, Costello ended the relationship. O'Riordan said that she was never married, that there was \"no piece of paper with marriage on it\". They have no children. Since their split, both Costello and O'Riordan have described the union as unhappy.\nIn early 2003, Costello became engaged to and went on to marry singer and pianist Diana Krall, whom he met at the Grammy Awards ceremony the year before. They married in December 2003. The couple has twin sons, born in December 2006.\nHealth.\nIn July 2018, Costello announced that he had been successfully treated for a cancerous growth six weeks earlier, but needed to cancel the remaining six dates of his European tour to continue recovering from the surgery. Costello said he had underestimated how much time he would need to recover. He resumed performing in September 2018.\nHumanitarian causes.\nIn 2017, Costello helped establish the Musician Treatment Foundation as a member of its board of directors. The foundation, which is based in Austin, Texas, helps under- and uninsured professional musicians receive free orthopaedic care for upper limb injuries. He performed concerts for the foundation's benefit in October 2017 and December 2022.\nCostello sits on the advisory board of the board of directors of the Jazz Foundation of America, which provides emergency financial support and other services to working and retired musicians.\nPescatarianism.\nA pescatarian since the early 1980s, Costello says he was moved to reject meat after seeing the documentary \"The Animals Film\" (1982), which also helped inspire his song \"Pills and Soap\" from 1983's \"Punch the Clock\". In January 2013, Costello teamed up with Paul McCartney to create an advertisement campaign backing vegetarian foods produced by the Linda McCartney Foods brand.\nLegacy.\nCostello is considered by experts in pop and rock music to be one of the best songwriters of his generation. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarised Costello as the \"most evocative, innovative, and gifted songwriter since Bob Dylan, with songs that offer highly personal takes on love and politics\". In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him 24th their list of the greatest songwriters of all time, calling him a songwriter of \"almost unparalleled versatility\". When he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016, the induction announcement said the impact of Costello's songs \"far out-distanced their commercial performance\".\nCostello's debut album, \"My Aim Is True\", is widely considered one of the best debut albums in the history of rock music. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the album's release, \"Billboard\" called it \"one of the most influential albums in the history of rock and punk\" and \"one of the strongest debut albums in history\". Although Costello never applied the term \"new wave\" to his music, Costello's early records helped defined the new wave music genre. AllMusic said, \"Costello's early albums changed the face of pop music by harnessing punk's energy to a leaner, more incisive aesthetic that included pop hooks, virtually inventing new wave in the process\". In their 2013 list of greatest albums of all time, \"NME\" described \"This Year's Model\" as \"defining the British new wave\". In their 2009 list of greatest albums of all time, \"Rolling Stone\" said \"the keyboard-driven sound of [Costello's 1979 song] 'Accidents Will Happen' helped define New Wave\".\nMusical artists with little connection to new wave have also acknowledged influence by Costello. Bruce Springsteen has said that comments Costello made in the press criticising Springsteen's early songs as overly romantic led Springsteen to write darker songs for his 1978 album \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\". Thom Yorke of Radiohead called \"Blood &amp; Chocolate\" \"the album that made me change the way I thought about recording and writing music [and] lyrics\". Liz Phair, in her appreciation of Costello for \"Rolling Stone\"'s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, wrote: \"I'd pay a great amount of money to audit a course taught by him\". Suzanne Vega has called Costello one of the \"melodic geniuses\" whose music she listens to in order to \"stretch my sense of melody\".\nProminent artists in other fields have claimed influence or inspiration from Costello. Filmmaker and comedian Judd Apatow has called Costello \"a gigantic inspiration to me\" and has suggested that he and other comedians are \"fanatical\" about Costello's music because of the \"spirit of standing up for what you believe in and the humor\" in it. Satirist and television host Stephen Colbert has described Costello as \"probably my favourite rock artist\" and said he sees parallels between his own humour and Costello's \"wry, sardonic\" songs. Novelist Bret Easton Ellis titled his 1985 novel \"Less Than Zero\" after a Costello song and its 2010 sequel \"Imperial Bedrooms\" after a Costello album. Ellis has said Costello was once his \"idol\". Visual artist Peter Blake featured Costello prominently in his 2012 reworking of the artwork he created for the cover of the Beatles' 1967 album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Blake said he included people he admired and who had contributed to British culture since he created the original work.\nAwards and honours.\nEntertainment industry awards.\nUnited States:\nUnited Kingdom:\nNetherlands:\nCanada:\nCritics' best-of lists and music press awards.\nBest of year:\nBest of all time:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10511", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10511", "title": "Epilepsy", "text": "Group of neurological disorders causing seizures\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nEpilepsy is a group of neurological disorders characterized by a tendency for recurrent, unprovoked seizures. A seizure is a sudden burst of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, ranging from brief lapses of awareness or muscle jerks to prolonged convulsions. These episodes can result in physical injuries, either directly, such as broken bones, or through causing accidents. The diagnosis of epilepsy typically requires at least two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart. In some cases, however, it may be diagnosed after a single unprovoked seizure if clinical evidence suggests a high risk of recurrence. Isolated seizures that occur without recurrence risk or are provoked by identifiable causes are not considered indicative of epilepsy.\nThe underlying cause is often unknown, but epilepsy can result from brain injury, stroke, infections, tumors, Cavernous hemangiomas, genetic conditions, or developmental abnormalities. Epilepsy that occurs as a result of other issues may be preventable. Diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that can resemble seizures, and may include neuroimaging, blood tests, and electroencephalography (EEG).\nMost cases of epilepsy \u2014 approximately 69% \u2014 can be effectively controlled with anti-seizure medications, and inexpensive treatment options are widely available. For those whose seizures do not respond to drugs, other approaches, such as surgery, neurostimulation or dietary changes, may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], approximately 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, with nearly 80% of cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries. The burden of epilepsy in low-income countries is more than twice that in high-income countries, likely due to higher exposure to risk factors such as perinatal injury, infections, and traumatic brain injury, combined with limited access to healthcare. In 2021, epilepsy was responsible for an estimated 140,000 deaths, an increase from 125,000 in 1990.\nEpilepsy is more common in both children and older adults. About 5\u201310% of people will have an unprovoked seizure by the age of 80. The chance of experiencing a second seizure within two years after the first is around 40%. \nPeople with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to the alarming nature of their symptoms. In many countries, people with epilepsy face driving restrictions and must be seizure-free for a set period before regaining eligibility to drive. The word \"epilepsy\" is from Ancient Greek , 'to seize, possess, or afflict'.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nEpilepsy is characterized by a long-term tendency to experience recurrent, unprovoked seizures. They may vary widely in their presentation depending on the affected brain regions, age of onset, and type of epilepsy.\nSeizures.\nAccording to the 2025 classification by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), seizures are grouped into four main classes: focal, generalized, unknown (whether focal or generalized), and unclassified.\nFocal seizures.\nFocal seizures originate in one area of the brain and may involve localized or distributed networks. For a given seizure type, the site of onset tends to be consistent across episodes. Once initiated, the seizure may remain localized or spread to adjacent areas, and in some cases, may propagate to the opposite hemisphere (contralateral spread).\nThey are further classified based on the state of consciousness during the episode:\nExperiences known as auras often precede focal seizures. The seizures can include sensory (visual, hearing, or smell), psychic, autonomic, and motor phenomena depending on which part of the brain is involved. Muscle jerks may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups, a pattern known as a Jacksonian march. Automatisms, or non-consciously generated activities, may occur; these may be simple repetitive movements like smacking the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something. Some focal seizures can evolve into focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, where abnormal brain activity spreads to both hemispheres.\nGeneralized seizures.\nGeneralized seizures originate at a specific point within, and quickly spread across both hemispheres through interconnected brain networks. Although the spread is rapid, the onset may appear asymmetric in some cases. These seizures typically impair consciousness from the outset and can take several forms, including:\nTonic\u2013clonic seizures are among the most recognizable seizure types, typically involving sudden loss of consciousness, stiffening (tonic phase), and rhythmic jerking (clonic phase) of the limbs. This form of seizure \u2014 whether focal to bilateral, generalized, or of unknown onset \u2014 is given particular emphasis due to their clinical severity; they are associated with the highest risk of injury, medical complications, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).\nMyoclonic seizures involve sudden, brief muscle jerks, which may affect specific muscle groups or the whole body. They can cause falls and injury. Absence seizures are characterized by brief lapses in awareness, sometimes accompanied by subtle movements such as blinking or slight head turning. The person typically recovers immediately afterward without confusion. Atonic seizures involve a sudden loss of muscle tone, often resulting in falls.\nTriggers and reflex seizures.\nCertain external or internal factors may increase the likelihood of a seizure in individuals with epilepsy. Common triggers include sleep deprivation, stress, fever, illness, menstruation, alcohol, and certain medications. These do not cause seizures by themselves, but lower the threshold in people who are already susceptible.\nA small subset of individuals have reflex epilepsy, in which seizures are reliably provoked by specific stimuli. These reflex seizures account for about 6% of epilepsy cases. Common triggers include flashing lights (photosensitive epilepsy), sudden sounds, or specific cognitive tasks such as reading or performing calculations. In some epilepsy syndromes, seizures occur more frequently during sleep or upon awakening.\nSeizure clusters.\nSeizure clusters refer to multiple seizures occurring over a short period of time, with incomplete recovery between events. They are distinct from status epilepticus, though the two may overlap. Definitions vary across studies, but seizure clusters are typically described as two or more seizures within 24 hours or a noticeable increase in seizure frequency over a person's usual baseline. Estimates of their prevalence range widely \u2014 from 5% to 50% of people with epilepsy \u2014 largely due to differing definitions and populations studied. Seizure clusters are more common in individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy, high baseline seizure frequency, or certain epilepsy syndromes. They are associated with increased emergency care utilization, worse quality of life, impaired psychosocial functioning, and possibly elevated risk of mortality.\nPostictal state.\nAfter the active portion of a seizure (the ictal state) there is typically a period of recovery during which there is confusion, referred to as the postictal state, before a normal level of consciousness returns, lasting minutes to days. This period is marked by confusion, headache, fatigue, or speech and motor disturbances. Some may experience Todd's paralysis, a transient focal weakness. Postictal psychosis occurs in approximately 2% of individuals with epilepsy, particularly after clusters of generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures.\nPsychosocial.\nEpilepsy can have substantial effects on psychological and social well-being. People with the condition may experience social isolation, stigma, or functional disability, which can contribute to lower educational attainment and reduced employment opportunities. These challenges often extend to family members, who may also encounter stigma and increased caregiving burden.\nSeveral psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders are more common in individuals with epilepsy. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is particularly prevalent among children with epilepsy, occurring three to five times more often than in the general population. ADHD and epilepsy together can markedly affect behavior, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism spectrum disorder.\nApproximately, one-in-three people with epilepsy have a lifetime history of a psychiatric disorder. This association is thought to reflect a combination of shared neurobiological mechanisms and the psychosocial impact of living with a chronic neurological condition. Some research also suggests that psychiatric conditions such as depression may precede the onset of epilepsy in certain individuals, particularly those with focal epilepsy. However, the nature of this association remains under investigation and may involve shared pathways, diagnostic overlap, or other confounding factors.\nComorbid depression and anxiety are associated with poorer quality of life, increased healthcare utilization, reduced treatment response (including to surgery), and higher mortality. Some studies suggest that these psychiatric conditions may influence quality of life more than seizure type or frequency. Despite their clinical importance, depression and anxiety often go underdiagnosed and undertreated in people with epilepsy.\nCauses.\nEpilepsy can result from a wide range of genetic and acquired factors, and in many cases, both play a role. Acquired causes include serious traumatic brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, and central nervous system infections. Despite advances in diagnostic tools, no clear cause is identified in approximately 50% of cases. The distribution of causes often varies with age. Epilepsies associated with genetic, congenital, or developmental conditions are more common in children, while epilepsy related to stroke or tumors is more frequently seen in older adults.\nSeizures may also occur as a direct response to acute health conditions such as stroke, head trauma, metabolic disturbances, or toxic exposures. These are known as acute symptomatic seizures and are distinct from epilepsy, which involves a recurrent tendency to have unprovoked seizures over time.\nThe International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classifies the causes of epilepsy into six broad categories: structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, and unknown. These categories are not mutually exclusive, and more than one may apply in an individual case.\nStructural.\nStructural causes of epilepsy refer to abnormalities in the anatomy of the brain that increase the risk of seizures. These may be acquired \u2014 such as from a stroke, traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or central nervous system infection \u2014 or developmental and genetic in origin, as seen in conditions like focal cortical dysplasia or certain congenital brain malformations. A major example is mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), a common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy.\nTraumatic brain injury is estimated to cause between 6% and 20% of epilepsy cases, depending on severity, mechanism, and study population. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold, while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%. Stroke is a major cause of epilepsy, particularly in older adults. Approximately 6% to 10% of individuals who experience a stroke develop epilepsy, most often within the first few years after the event. The risk is highest following severe strokes that involve cortical regions, especially in cases of intracerebral hemorrhage. Brain tumors are implicated in approximately 4% of epilepsy cases, with seizures occurring in nearly 30% of individuals with intracranial neoplasms. \nIn clinical practice, a structural cause is typically identified through neuroimaging (such as MRI), which reveals an abnormality that plausibly accounts for the individual's seizure semiology and EEG findings. The lesion must be epileptogenic, meaning that it is capable of generating seizures. Infections like encephalitis or brain abscess may lead to permanent structural damage, increasing the risk of epilepsy even after the infection resolves.\nStructural damage can also result from perinatal brain injury, such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, especially in low- and middle-income countries where access to prenatal and neonatal care may be limited. When seizures are linked to a clearly defined structural lesion, epilepsy surgery may be considered \u2014 particularly in individuals whose seizures do not respond to medication.\nGenetics.\nGenetic causes of epilepsy are those in which a person's genes directly contribute to the development of seizures. This includes cases where a specific mutation has been identified, as well as situations where the family history and clinical features strongly suggest a genetic basis, even if no known mutation is found. In the updated classification by the ILAE, the term genetic replaces the older term \"idiopathic\", to highlight that these epilepsies arise from inherited or spontaneous changes in a person's biology \u2014 not from injury or infection.\nGenetic factors are believed to contribute to many cases of epilepsy, either directly or by increasing vulnerability to other causes. Some forms are caused by a single gene defect, which account for around 1\u20132% of cases. However, most are due to a combination of multiple genes and environmental influences. Many of the genes known to play a role in epilepsy affect how brain cells send electrical signals, especially those involved in ion channels, receptors, or signaling proteins.\nGenetics is believed to play an important role in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.\nSome genetic disorders, including phakomatoses such as tuberous sclerosis complex and Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome, are strongly associated with epilepsy.\nInfectious.\nInfectious causes include infections of the central nervous system that directly affect brain tissue and lead to long-term seizure susceptibility. Examples include herpes simplex encephalitis, which carries a high risk of developing epilepsy, and neurocysticercosis, a major preventable cause of epilepsy in endemic regions. Other infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis.\nImmune.\nImmune causes include conditions like autoimmune encephalitis, in which the immune system attacks brain tissue, often presenting with seizures. Certain autoimmune epilepsies are associated with specific autoantibodies, including those against the NMDA receptor, LGI1, and CASPR2. These cases often present with rapid-onset, difficult-to-treat seizures.\nCeliac disease has also been associated with epilepsy in rare syndromic forms, such as the triad of epilepsy, cerebral calcifications, and celiac disease.\nMetabolic.\nMetabolic causes of epilepsy include metabolic disorders that disrupt the brain's normal function. In rare cases, epilepsy may result from inborn errors of metabolism, such as mitochondrial diseases, urea cycle disorders, or glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency. These often present early in life and may be associated with developmental delays, movement disorders, or other neurological symptoms.\nSeizures can also occur in the context of acquired metabolic disturbances, such as hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, or hypocalcemia. These seizures are often considered acute symptomatic seizures, and are not epilepsy.\nSome forms of malnutrition, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, have been associated with a higher risk of epilepsy, although it remains unclear whether the relationship is causal or due to other contributing factors.\nUnknown.\nUnknown causes of epilepsy refer to cases where no clear structural, genetic, infectious, immune, or metabolic origin can be identified despite thorough evaluation. This category acknowledges the limits of current diagnostic techniques and scientific understanding. A substantial proportion of epilepsy cases still fall into this group, particularly in regions with limited access to advanced testing.\nMechanism.\nUnderstanding the mechanism of epilepsy involves two related but distinct questions: how the brain develops a long-term tendency to generate seizures (epileptogenesis), and how individual seizures begin and spread (ictogenesis). While these processes are not yet fully understood, research has identified a number of cellular, molecular, and network-level changes that contribute to each.\nSeizures.\nIn a healthy brain, neurons communicate through electrical signals that are generally desynchronized. This activity is tightly regulated by a balance between excitatory and inhibitory influences. Intracellular factors that influence neuronal excitability include the type, number, and distribution of ion channels, as well as alterations in receptor function and gene expression. Extracellular factors include ionic concentrations in the surrounding environment, synaptic plasticity, and the regulation of neurotransmitter breakdown by glial cells.\nDuring a seizure, this balance breaks down, leading to a sudden and excessive synchronization of neuronal firing. A localized group of neurons may begin firing together in an abnormal and repetitive pattern, overwhelming normal inhibitory controls. This abnormal activity can remain confined to a specific region of the brain or propagate to other areas. The process by which this transition occurs is known as ictogenesis. It involves a shift in network dynamics, typically beginning with excessive excitatory activity in a susceptible area of cortex \u2014 known as a seizure focus \u2014 and failure of inhibitory mechanisms to contain it. At the cellular level, ictogenesis is often marked by a paroxysmal depolarizing shift, a characteristic pattern of sustained neuronal depolarization followed by rapid repetitive firing. As excitatory feedback loops engage and inhibition further declines, the seizure may become self-sustaining and spread to other regions of the brain.\nThere is evidence that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors (also known as triggers) such as stress, excessive alcohol use, flickering light, or a lack of sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure; this threshold is lowered in epilepsy. The seizures can be described on different scales, from the cellular level to the whole brain.\nEpilepsy.\nWhile ictogenesis explains how individual seizures arise, it does not account for why the brain develops a persistent tendency to generate them. This longer-term process is known as epileptogenesis \u2014 the sequence of biological events that transforms a previously non-epileptic brain into one capable of producing spontaneous seizures. It can occur after a wide range of brain insults, including traumatic brain injury, stroke, central nervous system infections, brain tumors, or prolonged seizures (such as status epilepticus). In most cases, no clear cause is identified. Although not fully understood, it involves a range of biological changes, including neuronal loss, synaptic reorganization, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and disruption of the blood\u2013brain barrier.\nTogether, these changes contribute to the formation of hyperexcitable neural networks, often anchored around a seizure focus. Once established, this pathological network increases the brain's susceptibility to seizures, even in the absence of ongoing injury. Although many of the processes underlying ictogenesis and epileptogenesis have been identified, the exact mechanisms by which the brain transitions into a seizure or becomes epileptic remain unknown.\nDiagnosis.\nThe diagnosis of epilepsy is primarily clinical, based on a thorough evaluation of the person's history, seizure features, and risk of recurrence. Diagnostic tests such as electroencephalograms and neuroimaging can support the diagnosis. Clinicians must also distinguish epileptic seizures from other conditions that can mimic them and determine whether the event was provoked by an acute, reversible cause or if it suggests a long-term tendency for unprovoked seizures.\nDefinition.\nAccording to the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), a diagnosis of epilepsy can be made when any one of the following criteria is met:\nThe ILAE also introduced the concept of resolved epilepsy, which applies to individuals who are past the typical age range for an age-dependent syndrome, or who have remained seizure-free for at least 10 years, including the last 5 years without medication.\nThis 2014 practical definition built upon the broader 2005 conceptual framework, which defined epilepsy as a disorder involving an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures. The updated criteria incorporated recurrence risk and reflected the realities of clinical decision-making. While widely adopted in clinical settings, other definitions\u2014such as the traditional \"two unprovoked seizures\" rule still used by the World Health Organization \u2014 remain appropriate in epidemiology and public health contexts, provided they are clearly stated. The 2014 revision also shifted terminology, referring to epilepsy as a \"disease\" rather than a disorder, to reflect its medical seriousness and public health impact.\nClassification.\nOnce epilepsy is diagnosed, the ILAE recommends a three-level framework to guide further classification and management:\nNot all levels can always be determined; in some cases, only the seizure type is identifiable. The etiology \u2014 whether structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, or unknown \u2014 should be considered at each stage of classification, as it often influences treatment and prognosis.\nThe classification of epilepsies has evolved significantly over time. Earlier systems emphasized seizure location and used terms such as \"partial\" or \"cryptogenic,\" which have been replaced in the modern framework. The current system, introduced in 2017, reflects advances in neuroimaging, genetics, and clinical understanding, and allows for a more individualized and dynamic diagnostic approach.\nSyndromes.\nAn epilepsy syndrome is a specific diagnosis based on a combination of features, including seizure types, age of onset, EEG patterns, imaging findings, and associated symptoms or comorbidities. In many cases, a known genetic or structural cause may also support the diagnosis. Recognizing a syndrome can guide treatment decisions, inform prognosis, and provide clarity for individuals and families navigating an epilepsy diagnosis.\nSome syndromes are self-limited and age-dependent, such as childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and self-limited epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes. These typically respond well to treatment or remit with age. In contrast, more severe syndromes fall under the category of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). These include Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome, West syndrome, and Dravet syndrome, which are associated with early onset, drug-resistant seizures, and significant neurodevelopmental impairments.\nSome epilepsy syndromes do not yet fit neatly within current etiological categories, particularly when no definitive cause has been identified. In many cases, a genetic cause is presumed based on age of onset, family history, and electroclinical features, even if no mutation has been found. As genetic and neuroimaging technologies continue to evolve, the classification of epilepsy syndromes is expected to become more precise.\nTests.\nThe diagnostic evaluation of epilepsy begins with confirming whether the reported event was in fact a seizure. A detailed clinical history remains essential, supported by eyewitness accounts and, when possible, video recordings. The initial assessment aims to distinguish epileptic seizures from common mimics such as syncope, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, or transient ischemic attacks.\nFollowing clinical evaluation, selected tests may be used to rule out acute causes and seizure mimics. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is recommended for all individuals presenting with a first seizure, to screen for cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiovascular conditions that may resemble epilepsy. Blood tests may be performed to identify metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, or renal and hepatic dysfunction, particularly in acute settings.\nOnce epilepsy is suspected, electroencephalography (EEG) is used to support the diagnosis, classify seizure types, and help identify specific epilepsy syndromes. A routine EEG may include activation techniques such as hyperventilation or photic stimulation. However, a normal EEG does not rule out epilepsy. When initial EEG findings are inconclusive, further studies such as sleep-deprived EEG, ambulatory EEG, or long-term video EEG monitoring may be considered.\nNeuroimaging, usually with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is recommended to detect structural causes of epilepsy. If MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, computed tomography (CT) may be considered. Imaging should be interpreted by radiologists with expertise in epilepsy.\nAdditional tests may be guided by clinical context. Genetic testing may be considered in individuals with early-onset epilepsy, developmental delay, or features of a known genetic epilepsy syndrome. Testing for neuronal antibodies may be appropriate in suspected cases of autoimmune encephalitis, particularly when seizures are new-onset, rapidly progressive, or resistant to standard treatment. Metabolic testing may be pursued in infants or children with unexplained epilepsy, especially when developmental regression or multisystem involvement is present.\nSerum prolactin may occasionally be measured after a suspected seizure, particularly to help distinguish epileptic seizures from non-epileptic events. While it can be elevated following certain seizure types, the test lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity and is not recommended for routine use.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nA number of conditions can resemble epileptic seizures, leading to potential misdiagnosis. Accurate diagnosis is essential, as inappropriate treatment may delay effective care or cause harm. Common mimics include fainting (syncope), psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES), transient ischemic attacks, migraine, narcolepsy, and various sleep or movement disorders. In children, reflux, breath-holding spells, and parasomnias such as night terrors may also resemble seizures.\nPsychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are a particularly important consideration, especially in individuals with refractory epilepsy. PNES are involuntary episodes that resemble epileptic seizures but are not associated with abnormal electrical discharges. They are classified as functional neurological disorders and are typically associated with psychological distress or trauma. Studies suggest that approximately 20% of individuals referred to epilepsy centers are diagnosed with PNES, and up to 10% of these individuals also have coexisting epilepsy. Differentiating between the two can be difficult and often requires prolonged video EEG monitoring.\nMisdiagnosis remains a significant concern in epilepsy. Reported rates vary widely \u2014 from 2% to 71% \u2014 depending on factors such as clinical setting, patient population, diagnostic criteria, and physician expertise.\nPrevention.\nAlthough many causes of epilepsy are not preventable, several known risk factors are modifiable. Perinatal care, including prevention of birth trauma, hypoxia, and maternal infections, can lower the risk of epilepsy in infants. Vaccination programs, especially against neurotropic infections such as measles and meningitis, play a key role in preventing epilepsy caused by central nervous system infections. In low- and middle-income countries, neurocysticercosis remains a major preventable cause of epilepsy, which can be reduced through improved sanitation and food safety. Eliminating or reducing risk factors for seizures in older adults such as inactivity, smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and excessive alcohol consumption have been suggested as strategies to help prevent epilepsy in older adults.\nComplications.\nEpilepsy can lead to a range of medical, psychological, and social complications, particularly when seizures are frequent or uncontrolled. One of the most serious risks is injury during a seizure, including falls, burns, or accidents while driving, swimming, or operating machinery. The risk of drowning is significantly increased in people with epilepsy, especially those with poor seizure control.\nPeople with epilepsy are at greater risk for mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and social isolation. These challenges are often compounded by stigma, employment difficulties, and driving restrictions. In children, epilepsy \u2014 especially when drug-resistant \u2014 can interfere with cognitive development and academic performance.\nA rare but serious complication is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which is most often associated with uncontrolled generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizures, particularly during sleep.\nManagement.\nThe primary goals of epilepsy management are to control seizures, minimize treatment side effects, and optimize quality of life. Management strategies are individualized based on the type of seizures or epilepsy syndrome, the underlying cause when known, the person's age and comorbidities, and their preferences and life circumstances.\nSupporting people's self-management of their condition may be useful. In drug-resistant cases different management options may be considered, including special diets, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.\nFirst aid and acute management of seizures.\nDuring a generalized tonic\u2013clonic seizure, the primary goals are to ensure safety and prevent injury. The following steps should be taken:\nIf the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes or if multiple seizures occur without full recovery in between, it is important to call for emergency medical assistance immediately, as it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. \nConvulsive status epilepticus requires immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications. In a community setting (such as at home or in the ambulance), first-line treatment includes the administration of benzodiazepines. If the person has an individualized emergency management plan \u2014 which may have been developed with healthcare providers and outlines personalized treatment steps (such as the use of buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam) \u2014 this plan should be followed immediately. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred.\nIf seizures continue after the first dose of benzodiazepine, emergency medical services should be contacted, and further doses can be given. For ongoing seizures, levetiracetam, phenytoin, or sodium valproate may be used as second-line treatments, with levetiracetam preferred for its quicker action and fewer side effects.\nMost institutions have a preferred pathway or protocol to be used in a seizure emergency like status epilepticus. These protocols have been found to be effective in reducing time to delivery of treatment.\nMedications.\nThe primary treatment for epilepsy involves the use of antiseizure medications (ASMs), which aim to control seizures while minimizing side effects. Treatment plans should be individualized, taking into account the seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, patient age, sex, comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and the potential for drug interactions.\nFirst-line treatment for most individuals with epilepsy is monotherapy with a single ASM. For many people with epilepsy, seizure control is achieved with a single medication, but some may require combination therapy if seizures are not well-controlled with monotherapy.\nThere are a number of medications available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Evidence suggests that these drugs are similarly effective for both focal and generalized seizures, although their side-effect profiles vary. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the UK, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatments for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate used as second-line treatments due to concerns about cost and side effects. Valproate is the first-line choice for generalized seizures, while lamotrigine is used as second-line. For absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended, with valproate also being effective for myoclonic and tonic\u2013clonic seizures.\nControlled-release formulations of carbamazepine may be preferred in some cases, as they appear to be equally effective as immediate-release carbamazepine but may have fewer side effects. Once a person's seizures are well-controlled on a specific treatment, it is generally not necessary to routinely check medication blood levels, unless there are concerns about side effects or toxicity.\nIn low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the management of epilepsy is often hindered by limited access to medications, diagnostic tools, and specialized care. While phenytoin and carbamazepine are commonly used as first-line treatments due to their availability and low cost, newer drugs like levetiracetam and lamotrigine may not be accessible. Additionally, surgical options and advanced therapies, such as vagus nerve stimulation or resective surgery, are typically inaccessible due to high costs and lack of infrastructure. \nThe least expensive anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around US$5 a year. The World Health Organization gives it a first-line recommendation in LMICs and it is commonly used in these countries. Access, however, may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug.\nAdverse effects from medications are reported in 10% to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that are not related to dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.\nSlowly stopping medications may be reasonable in some people who do not have a seizure for two to four years; however, around a third of people have a recurrence, most often during the first six months. Stopping is possible in about 70% of children and 60% of adults. Measuring medication levels is not generally needed in those whose seizures are well controlled.\nSurgery.\nEpilepsy surgery is an important treatment option for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy, typically defined as the failure of at least two appropriately chosen and tolerated antiseizure medications. Surgery is most effective in cases of focal epilepsy, where seizures originate from a specific area of the brain that can be safely removed.\nAlthough epilepsy surgery has demonstrated strong evidence of efficacy \u2014 especially in drug-resistant focal epilepsy \u2014 it remains underutilized worldwide and is often reserved for individuals whose condition has reached an advanced or chronic stage. Early consideration and referral for surgical evaluation can improve long-term outcomes and quality of life. This evaluation, conducted in specialized epilepsy centers, includes seizure classification, long-term video EEG monitoring, high-resolution MRI with epilepsy-specific protocols, neuropsychological assessment, and sometimes functional imaging or invasive monitoring. Early referral improves the likelihood of successful outcomes and avoids prolonged periods of unnecessary disability.\nThe primary goal of epilepsy surgery is to achieve seizure freedom, but even when that is not possible, palliative procedures that significantly reduce seizure frequency can lead to meaningful improvements in quality of life and development \u2014 particularly in children. Studies suggest that 60-70% of individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy experience a substantial reduction in seizures following surgery.\nCommon procedures include anterior temporal lobe resection, which often involves removal of the hippocampus in cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as lesionectomy for tumors or cortical dysplasia, and lobectomy for larger seizure foci. In cases where resection is not possible, procedures such as corpus callosotomy may help reduce the severity and spread of seizures. In addition to traditional resective techniques, minimally invasive approaches such as MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) have gained traction as safer alternatives in select cases, particularly where reducing cognitive impact and recovery time is a priority. In many cases, antiseizure medications can be tapered following successful surgery, though long-term monitoring remains essential. Surgical treatment is not limited to adults. A 2023 systematic review found that early surgery in children under 3 years with drug-resistant epilepsy can result in meaningful seizure reduction or freedom when other treatments have failed.\nAlthough epilepsy surgery has demonstrated efficacy, it is still rarely used around the world, and is typically reserved for cases where the condition has reached an advanced stage.\nNeuromodulation.\nNeurotherapy or Neuromodulation therapies, including vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), Neuromodulation through Radiotherapy (e.g. Leksell Gamma Knife) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), are treatment options for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy who are not candidates for resective surgery, or for whom previous surgery has not resulted in seizure freedom. These neurotherapies aim to reduce seizure frequency and severity by delivering controlled electrical stimulation to targeted neural circuits.\nDiet.\nDietary therapy, particularly the ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein), is a non-pharmacological treatment option used primarily in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. Evidence suggests that children on a classical ketogenic diet may be up to three times more likely to achieve seizure freedom and up to six times more likely to experience a \u226550% reduction in seizure frequency compared to those receiving standard care. Modified versions of the diet, such as the modified Atkins diet, are better tolerated but may be less effective. In adults, the ketogenic diet has shown limited evidence of achieving seizure freedom, though it may increase the likelihood of seizure reduction. However, further research is necessary. \nIt is typically supervised by a multidisciplinary team, including neurologists and dietitians, due to its restrictive nature and potential side effects, such as vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea. Regular monitoring of nutritional status, blood parameters, and growth is recommended. It is unclear why this diet works. A gluten-free diet has been proposed in rare cases of epilepsy associated with celiac disease and occipital calcifications, though evidence is limited and based on small case series.\nAdjunctive and complementary therapies.\nThere is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of psychological interventions \u2014 such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation techniques, and self-management training \u2014 alongside standard treatment. These approaches may improve quality of life, emotional wellbeing, and treatment adherence; however, evidences targeting seizure control are uncertain. Avoidance therapy consists of minimizing or eliminating triggers. For example, those who are sensitive to light may have success with using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses. Biofeedback, particularly EEG-based operant conditioning, has shown preliminary benefit in some people with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, these methods are considered adjunctive and are not recommended as standalone treatments.\nCannabidiol (CBD) has shown benefit as an add-on therapy in certain severe childhood epilepsies. A purified form of CBD was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2018 and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex.\nRegular physical activity is generally considered safe and may have beneficial effects on seizure frequency, mood, and overall wellbeing. While evidence remains limited, some studies suggest that moderate exercise can reduce seizure burden in certain individuals. Seizure response dogs have been trained to assist individuals during or after seizures by providing physical support or alerting others. Although anecdotal reports claim that some dogs can anticipate seizures, there is no conclusive scientific evidence supporting the consistent ability of dogs to predict seizures before they occur.\nVarious forms of alternative medicine, including acupuncture, routine vitamins, and yoga, have no reliable evidence to support their use in epilepsy. Melatonin, as of 2016[ [update]], is insufficiently supported by evidence. The trials were of poor methodological quality and it was not possible to draw any definitive conclusions.\nContraception and pregnancy.\nWomen of child-bearing age, including those with epilepsy, are at risk of unintended pregnancies if they are not using an effective form of contraception. Women with epilepsy may experience a temporary increase in seizure frequency when they begin hormonal contraception.\nSome anti-seizure medications interact with enzymes in the liver and cause the drugs in hormonal contraception to be broken down more quickly. These enzyme inducing drugs make hormonal contraception less effective, and this is particularly hazardous if the anti-seizure medication is associated with birth defects. Potent enzyme-inducing anti-seizure medications include carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and rufinamide. The drugs perampanel and topiramate can be enzyme-inducing at higher doses. Conversely, hormonal contraception can lower the amount of the anti-seizure medication lamotrigine circulating in the body, making it less effective. The failure rate of oral contraceptives, when used correctly, is 1%, but this increases to between 3\u20136% in women with epilepsy. Overall, intrauterine devices (IUDs) are preferred for women with epilepsy who are not intending to become pregnant.\nWomen with epilepsy, especially if they have other medical conditions, may have a slightly lower, but still high, chance of becoming pregnant. Women with infertility have about the same chance of success with in vitro fertilisation or other forms of assisted reproductive technology as women without epilepsy. There may be a higher risk of pregnancy loss.\nOnce pregnant, there are two main concerns related to pregnancy. The first concern is about the risk of seizures during pregnancy, and the second concern is that the anti-seizure medications may result in birth defects. Most women with epilepsy must continue treatment with anti-seizure drugs, and the treatment goal is to balance the need to prevent seizures with the need to prevent drug-induced birth defects.\nPregnancy does not seem to change seizure frequency very much. When seizures happen, however, they can cause some pregnancy complications, such as pre-term births or the babies being smaller than usual when they are born.\nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defects, e.g., due to smoking during pregnancy. In addition to this typical level of risk, some anti-seizure drugs significantly increase the risk of birth defects and intrauterine growth restriction, as well as developmental, neurocognitive, and behavioral disorders. Most women with epilepsy receive safe and effective treatment and have typical, healthy children. The highest risks are associated with specific anti-seizure drugs, such as valproic acid and carbamazepine, and with higher doses. Folic acid supplementation, such as through prenatal vitamins, reduced the risk. Planning pregnancies in advance gives women with epilepsy an opportunity to switch to a lower-risk treatment program and reduced drug doses.\nAlthough anti-seizure drugs can be found in breast milk, women with epilepsy can breastfeed their babies, and the benefits usually outweigh the risks.\nPrognosis.\nEpilepsy is generally considered a chronic neurological condition, but its long-term course can vary widely depending on factors such as seizure type, underlying cause, and response to treatment. Although epilepsy is not typically \"cured,\" in many cases it may be considered resolved. According to the ILAE, epilepsy is considered to be resolved in individuals who have been seizure-free for at least 10 years, with no antiseizure medications for the last 5 of those years.\nApproximately 60\u201370% of individuals with epilepsy achieve good seizure control with appropriate antiseizure medications, and many can maintain long-term remission. However, outcomes vary significantly by epilepsy type and etiology. Early treatment response is one of the strongest predictors of long-term outcome, with poor early control correlating with lower chances of remission. Several factors \u2014 such as structural brain abnormalities, comorbid developmental disorders, or a high frequency of seizures at onset \u2014 have been associated with worse outcomes, although findings are not always consistent.\nEpilepsy disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries, where nearly 80% of the global epilepsy population resides. In these countries, to 75% of individuals with epilepsy do not receive the treatment they need. Untreated epilepsy is associated with elevated risk of injury, psychiatric comorbidities, and early death, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). \nCognition.\nCognitive impairment frequently accompanies epilepsy, although it is difficult to determine to what extant it is caused by the epilepsy itself. This is because observed cognitive decline could be a result of the cause of the epilepsy (e.g. epilepsy caused by mesial temporal sclerosis), or be secondary to the epilepsy (e.g. brain damage from falling due to a seizure, or impairment from pharmacological or surgical treatment of the epilepsy).\nIn the majority of people who achieve seizure control, there is no associated progressive cognitive decline. However, severe intractable epilepsy does cause negative cognitive effects. Due to its variability, it is unclear whether any given case of epilepsy will lead to cognitive decline, but a few points are noted:\nMortality.\nPeople with epilepsy may have a higher risk of premature death compared to those without the condition. This risk is estimated to be between 1.6 and 4.1 times greater than that of the general population. The greatest increase in mortality from epilepsy is among the elderly. Those with epilepsy due to an unknown cause have a relatively low increase in risk.\nMortality is often related to the underlying cause of the seizures, status epilepticus, suicide, trauma, and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Death from status epilepticus is primarily due to an underlying problem rather than missing doses of medications. The risk of suicide is between two and six times higher in those with epilepsy; the cause of this is unclear. SUDEP appears to be partly related to the frequency of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and accounts for about 15% of epilepsy-related deaths; it is unclear how to decrease its risk. Risk factors for SUDEP include nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures, seizures, sleeping alone and medically intractable epilepsy.\nIn the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 40\u201360% of deaths are possibly preventable. In the developing world, many deaths are due to untreated epilepsy leading to falls or status epilepticus.\nEpidemiology.\nEpilepsy is one of the most common serious neurological disorders, affecting approximately 50 million people globally as of 2021, with the majority living in low- and middle-income countries. The point prevalence of active epilepsy is generally reported between 5 and 7 per 1,000 people, while lifetime prevalence is slightly higher, typically between 6 and 9 per 1,000. Both prevalence and incidence are higher in low-income regions. The annual incidence of epilepsy \u2014 the rate of new diagnoses each year \u2014 is estimated at 50 to 70 new cases per 100,000 people globally, based on population studies. Rates are significantly higher in low- and middle-income countries, and, within high-income countries, higher incidence has also been observed among lower socioeconomic groups and some ethnic minorities.\nEpilepsy can develop at any age, but its incidence is highest in early infancy and in older adults, following a bimodal distribution. In high-income countries, the incidence peaks during the first year of life, declines during adulthood, and rises again in people over age 85. The increase in older adults is associated with age-related conditions such as stroke, brain tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases. In low- and middle-income countries, incidence more often peaks in older children and young adults, which may reflect the effects of trauma, infections, and underdiagnosis in the elderly. Epilepsy is slightly more common in males than females, a difference that may be influenced by risk factor exposure and underreporting in women in some regions due to sociocultural factors.\nBeyond prevalence and incidence, epilepsy imposes a significant global burden in terms of disability, stigma, and premature mortality. The disorder is responsible for an estimated 13 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide each year, with the majority of this burden falling on individuals in low-resource settings where access to diagnosis and treatment remains limited. \nHistory.\nThe oldest medical records show that epilepsy has been affecting people at least since the beginning of recorded history. Throughout ancient history, the condition was thought to be of a spiritual cause. The world's oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in Akkadian (a language used in ancient Mesopotamia) and was written around 2000 BC. The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a moon god, and underwent an exorcism. Epileptic seizures are listed in the Code of Hammurabi (c.\u20091790 BC) as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus (c.\u20091700 BC) describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions.\nThe oldest known detailed record of the condition itself is in the \"Sakikku\", a Babylonian cuneiform medical text from 1067\u20131046 BC. This text gives signs and symptoms, details treatment and likely outcomes, and describes many features of the different seizure types. As the Babylonians had no biomedical understanding of the nature of epilepsy, they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means. Around 900 BC, Punarvasu Atreya described epilepsy as loss of consciousness; this definition was carried forward into the Ayurvedic text of Charaka Samhita (c.\u2009400 BC).\nThe ancient Greeks had contradictory views of the condition. They thought of epilepsy as a form of spiritual possession, but also associated the condition with genius and the divine. One of the names they gave to it was the \"sacred disease\" (). Epilepsy appears in Greek mythology: it is associated with the Moon goddesses Selene and Artemis, who afflicted those who upset them. The Greeks thought that important figures such as Julius Caesar and Hercules had the condition. The notable exception to this divine and spiritual view was that of the school of Hippocrates. In the fifth century BC, Hippocrates rejected the idea that the condition was caused by spirits. In his landmark work \"On the Sacred Disease\", he proposed that epilepsy was not divine in origin and instead was a medically treatable problem originating in the brain. He accused those of attributing a sacred cause to the condition of spreading ignorance through a belief in superstitious magic. Hippocrates proposed that heredity was important as a cause, described worse outcomes if the condition presents at an early age, and made note of the physical characteristics as well as the social shame associated with it. Instead of referring to it as the \"sacred disease\", he used the term \"great disease\", giving rise to the modern term \"grand mal\", used for tonic\u2013clonic seizures. Despite his work detailing the physical origins of the condition, his view was not accepted at the time. Evil spirits continued to be blamed until at least the 17th century.\nIn Ancient Rome people did not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was affected. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affecting them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, to detect epilepsy, it was common to light a piece of \"gagates\", whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.\nIn most cultures, persons with epilepsy have been stigmatized, shunned, or even imprisoned. As late as in the second half of the 20th century, in Tanzania and other parts of Africa epilepsy was associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and was believed by many to be contagious. In the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, the birthplace of modern neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot found people with epilepsy side by side with the mentally ill, those with chronic syphilis, and the criminally insane. In Ancient Rome, epilepsy was known as the or 'disease of the assembly hall' and was seen as a curse from the gods. In northern Italy, epilepsy was traditionally known as Saint Valentine's malady. In at least the 1840s in the United States of America, epilepsy was known as the \"falling sickness\" or \"the falling fits\", and was considered a form of medical insanity. Around the same time period, epilepsy was known in France as the lit.\u2009'high evil', lit.\u2009'earthen sickness', lit.\u2009'Saint John's sickness', lit.\u2009'child sickness', and lit.\u2009'falling sickness'. People of epilepsy in France were also known as lit.\u2009'people who fall', due to the seizures and loss of consciousness in an epileptic episode.\nIn the mid-19th century, the first effective anti-seizure medication, bromide, was introduced. The first modern treatment, phenobarbital, was developed in 1912, with phenytoin coming into use in 1938.\nSociety and culture.\nEpilepsy has significant social and cultural implications that vary across regions and contexts. People with epilepsy may experience social stigma, legal restrictions, economic disadvantage, and barriers to education and employment. Public perceptions of the condition are shaped by cultural beliefs, media portrayals, and the level of awareness in a given society. Efforts by advocacy groups and international organizations aim to improve public understanding, reduce stigma, and promote access to care. Social consequences, such as educational exclusion, unemployment, and social isolation, further compound the impact on quality of life. Despite the availability of effective antiseizure medications and cost-effective treatment strategies, a large treatment gap persists in many countries, underscoring the need for strengthened health systems and public health interventions.\nStigma.\nSocial stigma is commonly experienced by people with epilepsy worldwide, and it can have economic, social, and cultural consequences. Misconceptions about the condition \u2014 including beliefs that it is contagious, a form of madness, or caused by supernatural forces \u2014 persist in many communities. In parts of Africa, including Tanzania and Uganda, epilepsy is sometimes associated with spirit possession, witchcraft, or poisoning, and is incorrectly believed to be contagious. Similar stigmatizing beliefs have been reported in other regions, such as India and China, where epilepsy may be cited as grounds for denying marriage. In the United Kingdom, epilepsy was legally considered valid grounds for annulling a marriage until 1971.\nStigma can also affect how people respond to a diagnosis. Some individuals with epilepsy may deny having had seizures, fearing discrimination. A 2024 cross-sectional study found that 64.8% of relatives of people with epilepsy reported experiencing moderate levels of stigma, which was associated with more negative attitudes toward the condition. Greater stigma was observed among relatives of patients with more frequent seizures or poor medication adherence.\nNegative perceptions of epilepsy can also affect educational opportunities and academic outcomes. Children with epilepsy are at increased risk of underachievement in school due to a combination of neurological factors, medication side effects, and the effects of social exclusion.\nIn adulthood, stigma can result in reduced employment opportunities and workplace discrimination. Adults with epilepsy are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed than the general population, a disparity often driven by employer concerns about safety, productivity, or liability. Disclosure of an epilepsy diagnosis in job applications or interviews may lead to discrimination, although nondisclosure can limit access to workplace accommodations.\nEconomic impact.\nEpilepsy is associated with a substantial economic burden at both the individual and societal levels. Direct costs include expenses related to diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management, such as antiseizure medications and hospitalizations. Indirect costs may arise from lost productivity, unemployment, and premature death. In many countries, especially those with limited health infrastructure, individuals with epilepsy and their families often bear the majority of healthcare expenses out of pocket. A 2021 modeling study estimated the total global cost of epilepsy at approximately $119.27\u00a0billion annually, based on per capita cost projections applied to an estimated 52.51 million people living with epilepsy worldwide, while accounting for the treatment gap. The treatment gap \u2014 referring to the proportion of people with epilepsy who do not receive appropriate care \u2014 remains high in low- and middle-income countries, exacerbating the economic burden through avoidable seizures, injuries, and emergency care.\nSeizures result in direct economic costs of about one billion dollars in the United States. Epilepsy resulted in economic costs in Europe of around 15.5\u00a0billion euros in 2004. In India, epilepsy is estimated to result in costs of US$1.7\u00a0billion or 0.5% of the GDP. It is the cause of about 1% of emergency department visits (2% for emergency departments for children) in the United States.\nDriving and legal restrictions.\nThose with epilepsy are at about twice the risk of being involved in a motor vehicular collision and thus in many areas of the world are not allowed to drive or able to drive only if certain conditions are met. Diagnostic delay has been suggested to be a cause of some potentially avoidable motor vehicle collisions since at least one study showed that most motor vehicle accidents occurred in those with undiagnosed non-motor seizures as opposed to those with motor seizures at epilepsy onset. In some places physicians are required by law to report if a person has had a seizure to the licensing body while in others the requirement is only that they encourage the person in question to report it themselves. Countries that require physician reporting include Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Spain. Countries that require the individual to report include the UK and New Zealand, and physicians may report if they believe the individual has not already. In Canada, the United States and Australia the requirements around reporting vary by province or state. If seizures are well controlled most feel allowing driving is reasonable. The amount of time a person must be free from seizures before they can drive varies by country. Many countries require one to three years without seizures. In the United States the time needed without a seizure is determined by each state and is between three months and one year.\nThose with epilepsy or seizures are typically denied a pilot license.\nAdvocacy and support organizations.\nThere are organizations that provide support for people and families affected by epilepsy. In 1997 the International Bureau for Epilepsy (IBE), the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) and the World Health Organization launched the Global Campaign Against Epilepsy (GCAE) to bring epilepsy 'out of the shadows' by raising awareness of, and improving treatment and services for epilepsy. In the United States, the Epilepsy Foundation is a national organization that works to increase the acceptance of those with the disorder, their ability to function in society and to promote research for a cure. The Epilepsy Foundation, some hospitals, and some individuals also run support groups in the United States. In Australia, the Epilepsy Foundation provides support, delivers education and training and funds research for people living with epilepsy.\nInternational Epilepsy Day (World Epilepsy Day) began in 2015 and occurs on the second Monday in February.\nPurple Day, a different world-wide epilepsy awareness day for epilepsy, was initiated by a nine-year-old Canadian named Cassidy Megan in 2008, and is every year on 26 March.\nResearch directions.\nEpilepsy research aims to uncover the causes of seizures, improve diagnosis, and develop more effective treatments. It spans genetics, neuroscience, pharmacology, and biomedical engineering, with the shared goal of reducing the burden of disease. Researchers also study how epilepsy develops (epileptogenesis), seeking ways to prevent it entirely.\nAnimal models.\nAnimal models are widely used in epilepsy research, providing insight into seizure mechanisms, disease progression, and treatment effects. Rodents are most commonly used, with models based on chemical induction (e.g. kainic acid, pilocarpine), electrical stimulation (e.g. kindling), genetic mutations, and others. Other species, including zebrafish, dogs, and non-human primates, are also employed to capture features not easily replicated in rodents, such as complex behaviors or chronic seizure patterns. These models help researchers study epileptogenesis, test antiseizure drugs, and explore surgical or neuromodulatory interventions. While no model captures the full complexity of human epilepsy, they remain essential for translational research.\nGenetics and molecular research.\nAdvances in genetics have transformed the understanding of epilepsy, particularly in early-onset and treatment-resistant forms. Mutations in genes affecting ion channels, synaptic transmission, and mTOR signaling pathways have been linked to a growing number of epilepsy syndromes, including Dravet syndrome (SCN1A), PCDH19-related epilepsy, and familial focal epilepsies. High-throughput sequencing has enabled the discovery of de novo mutations in severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. In parallel, research into polygenic risk and epigenetic mechanisms is expanding the view of common epilepsies as complex traits. Molecular studies also support the development of targeted therapies, such as precision treatments for specific genetic subtypes. Variations within the sodium channel SCN3A, and Na+/K+,ATPase (ATP1A3), has been implicated some of earliest onset epilepsies with cortical malformations.\nEpileptogenesis and biomarkers.\nUnderstanding how epilepsy develops (epileptogenesis) is a major focus of current research. This includes identifying biomarkers that predict who is at risk of developing epilepsy. EEG patterns, neuroimaging features, and molecular signals in blood or cerebrospinal fluid are being investigated as early indicators. The goal is to detect epilepsy before chronic seizures begin and to develop interventions that prevent or halt this process. While no validated biomarker is yet in clinical use, this area holds promise for future disease-modifying therapies.\nAntiseizure drug development.\nThe development of new antiseizure medications remains a priority, especially for people with drug-resistant epilepsy. Current research focuses on compounds with novel mechanisms of action, better safety profiles, and disease-modifying potential. High-throughput screening, including zebrafish and organoid models, accelerates early-stage discovery, while pharmacogenomic studies aim to personalize drug selection. Cannabinoids and neurosteroids are also under investigation for specific syndromes and seizure types.\nSeizure prediction.\nThe unpredictability of seizures is a major concern for many people with epilepsy, and seizure prediction has been a longstanding focus of research. Early efforts were limited by small datasets and inconsistent results; however, advances in computational modeling, long-term EEG recording, and machine learning have led to renewed interest in the field. Public EEG databases and algorithm competitions have helped standardize evaluation and fostered the development of more accurate methods. In one clinical trial, prospective seizure prediction using intracranial EEG was achieved in a small group of participants. Current approaches often integrate network models of brain activity, multimodal data sources, and closed-loop systems capable of both detecting and responding to pre-ictal changes. These developments have laid the groundwork for future large-scale clinical trials and the potential integration of seizure forecasting into clinical practice.\nMechanistic modeling and alternative pathways.\nMathematical and computational models are increasingly used to simulate the neural dynamics underlying seizures. Reductionist models such as the Epileptor use ordinary differential equations to replicate interictal and ictal discharges observed in experimental data. More detailed versions, including the Epileptor-2, incorporate physiological variables such as ion concentrations and synaptic resource availability. These models suggest that fluctuations in extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium levels may play a key role in the emergence and termination of seizures.\nPotential future therapies.\nSeveral novel therapeutic strategies are under investigation for epilepsy. Gene therapy is being studied in some types of epilepsy. Medications that alter immune function, such as intravenous immunoglobulins, may reduce the frequency of seizures when including in normal care as an add-on therapy; however, further research is required to determine whether these medications are very well tolerated in children and in adults with epilepsy. Noninvasive stereotactic radiosurgery is, as of 2012[ [update]], being compared to standard surgery for certain types of epilepsy.\nOther animals.\nEpilepsy has also been documented in several animal species, particularly dogs and cats. Veterinary treatments often use similar antiepileptic drugs, such as phenobarbital or levetiracetam. In horses, diagnosis can be challenging, especially in focal seizures, and such conditions as juvenile idiopathic epilepsy have been reported in foals.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term was adopted by Duke University botanist J. B. Rhine to denote psychic abilities such as telepathy, psychometry, clairvoyance and their trans-temporal operation as precognition or retrocognition.\nSecond sight is an alleged form of extrasensory perception, whereby a person perceives information, in the form of a vision, about future events before they happen (precognition), or about things or events at remote locations (remote viewing). There is no evidence that second sight exists. Reports of second sight are known only from anecdotes. Second sight and ESP are classified as pseudosciences.\nHistory.\nIn the 1930s, at Duke University in North Carolina, J. B. Rhine and his wife Louisa E. Rhine conducted an investigation into extrasensory perception. While Louisa Rhine concentrated on collecting accounts of spontaneous cases, J. B. Rhine worked largely in the laboratory, carefully defining terms such as ESP and \"psi\" and designing experiments to test them. A simple set of black and white cards was developed, originally called Zener cards \u2013 now called ESP cards. They bear the symbols circle, square, wavy lines, cross, and star. There are five of each type of card in a pack of 25.\nIn a telepathy experiment, the \"sender\" looks at a series of cards while the \"receiver\" guesses the symbols. To try to observe clairvoyance, the pack of cards is hidden from everyone while the receiver guesses. To try to observe precognition, the order of the cards is determined after the guesses are made. Later he used dice to test for psychokinesis.\nThe parapsychology experiments at Duke evoked criticism from academics and others who challenged the concepts and evidence of ESP. A number of psychological departments attempted, unsuccessfully, to repeat Rhine's experiments. W. S. Cox (1936) from Princeton University with 132 subjects produced 25,064 trials in a playing card ESP experiment. Cox concluded \"There is no evidence of extrasensory perception either in the 'average man' or of the group investigated or in any particular individual of that group. The discrepancy between these results and those obtained by Rhine is due either to uncontrollable factors in experimental procedure or to the difference in the subjects.\" Four other psychological departments failed to replicate Rhine's results.\nIn 1938, the psychologist Joseph Jastrow wrote that much of the evidence for extrasensory perception collected by Rhine and other parapsychologists was anecdotal, biased, dubious and the result of \"faulty observation and familiar human frailties\". Rhine's experiments were discredited due to the discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being able to read the symbols from the back of the cards and being able to see and hear the experimenter to note subtle clues.\nIn the 1960s, parapsychologists became increasingly interested in the cognitive components of ESP, the subjective experience involved in making ESP responses, and the role of ESP in psychological life. This called for experimental procedures that were not limited to Rhine's favored forced-choice methodology. Such procedures have included dream telepathy experiments, and the ganzfeld experiments (a mild sensory deprivation procedure).\nSecond sight may have originally been so called because normal vision was regarded as coming first, while supernormal vision is a secondary thing, confined to certain individuals. \"An d\u00e0 shealladh\" or \"the two sights\", meaning \"the sight of the seer\", is the way Gaels refer to \"second sight\", the involuntary ability of seeing the future or distant events. There are many Gaelic words for the various aspects of second sight, but \"an d\u00e0 shealladh\" is the one mostly recognized by non-Gaelic speakers, even though, strictly speaking, it does not really mean second sight, but rather \"two sights\".\nSkepticism.\nParapsychology is the study of paranormal psychic phenomena, including ESP. Parapsychology has been criticized for continuing investigation despite being unable to provide convincing evidence for the existence of any psychic phenomena after more than a century of research. The scientific community rejects ESP due to the absence of an evidence base, the lack of a theory which would explain ESP and the lack of positive experimental results; it considers ESP to be pseudoscience.\nThe scientific consensus does not view extrasensory perception as a scientific phenomenon. Skeptics have pointed out that there is no viable theory to explain the mechanism behind ESP, and that there are historical cases in which flaws have been discovered in the experimental design of parapsychological studies.\nThere are many criticisms pertaining to experiments involving extrasensory perception, particularly surrounding methodological flaws. These flaws are not unique to a single experimental design, and are effective in discrediting much of the positive research surrounding ESP. Many of the flaws seen in the Zener cards experiment are present in the Ganzfeld experiment as well. First is the stacking effect, an error that occurs in ESP research. Trial-by-trial feedback given in studies using a \"closed\" ESP target sequence (e.g., a deck of cards) violates the condition of independence used for most standard statistical tests. Multiple responses for a single target cannot be evaluated using statistical tests that assume independence of responses. This increases the likelihood of card counting and, in turn, increases the chances for the subject to guess correctly without using ESP. Another methodological flaw involves cues through sensory leakage, for example, when the subject receives a visual cue. This could be the reflection of a Zener card in the holder's glasses. In this case, the subject is able to guess the card correctly because they can see it in the reflection, not because of ESP. Finally, poor randomization of target stimuli could be happening. Poor shuffling methods can make the orders of the cards easier to predict, or the cards could have been marked and manipulated, again, making it easier to predict which cards come next. The results of a meta-analysis found that when these errors were corrected and accounted for, there was still no significant effect of ESP. Many of the studies only appeared to have significant occurrence of ESP, when in fact, this result was due to the many methodological errors in the research.\nDermo-optical perception.\nIn the early 20th century, Joaquin Mar\u00eda Argamasilla, known as the \"Spaniard with X-ray Eyes\", claimed to be able to read handwriting or numbers on dice through closed metal boxes. Argamasilla managed to fool Gustav Geley and Charles Richet into believing he had genuine psychic powers. In 1924, he was exposed by Harry Houdini as a fraud. Argamasilla peeked through his simple blindfold and lifted the edge of the box, so he could look inside it without others noticing.\nScience writer Martin Gardner has written that the ignorance of blindfold deception methods has been widespread in investigations into objects at remote locations from persons who claim to possess second sight. Gardner documented various conjuring techniques psychics such as Rosa Kuleshova, Lina Anderson and Nina Kulagina have used to peek from their blindfolds to deceive investigators into believing they used second sight.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10517", "revid": "32990417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10517", "title": "Economies of scale", "text": "Cost advantages obtained via scale of operation\nIn microeconomics, economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, and are typically measured by the amount of output produced per unit of cost (production cost). A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale that is, increased production with lowered cost. At the basis of economies of scale, there may be technical, statistical, organizational or related factors to the degree of market control.\nEconomies of scale arise in a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a production, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale occur. Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a physical or engineering basis. The economic concept dates back to Adam Smith and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor. Diseconomies of scale are the opposite.\nEconomies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase. Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, pulp and paper industry. A common limit for a low cost per unit weight raw materials is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship products uneconomic distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.\nLarge producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently. They will, therefore, avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins. Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity-grade production to specialty products. Economies of scale must be distinguished from economies stemming from an increase in the production of a given plant. When a plant is used below its optimal production capacity, increases in its degree of utilization bring about decreases in the total average cost of production. Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (1966) and Nicholas Kaldor (1972) both argue that these economies should not be treated as economies of scale.\nOverview.\nThe simple meaning of economies of scale is doing things more efficiently with increasing size. Common sources of economies of scale are purchasing (bulk buying of materials through long-term contracts), managerial (increasing the specialization of managers), financial (obtaining lower-interest charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments), marketing (spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in media markets), and technological (taking advantage of returns to scale in the production function). Each of these factors reduces the long run average costs (LRAC) of production by shifting the short-run average total cost (SRATC) curve down and to the right.\nEconomies of scale is a concept that may explain patterns in international trade or in the number of firms in a given market. The exploitation of economies of scale helps explain why companies grow large in some industries. It is also a justification for free trade policies, since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country\u2014for example, it would not be efficient for Liechtenstein to have its own carmaker if they only sold to their local market. A lone carmaker may be profitable, but even more so if they exported cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market. Economies of scale also play a role in a \"natural monopoly\". There is a distinction between two types of economies of scale: internal and external. An industry that exhibits an internal economy of scale is one where the costs of production fall when the number of firms in the industry drops, but the remaining firms increase their production to match previous levels. Conversely, an industry exhibits an external economy of scale when costs drop due to the introduction of more firms, thus allowing for more efficient use of specialized services and machinery.\nEconomies of scale exist whenever the total cost of producing two quantities of a product X is lower when a single firm instead of two separate firms produce it. See Economies of scope#Economics.\nformula_1\nDeterminants of economies of scale.\nPhysical and engineering basis: economies of increased dimension.\nSome of the economies of scale recognized in engineering have a physical basis, such as the square\u2013cube law, by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube. This law has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.\nIn structural engineering, the strength of beams increases with the cube of the thickness.\nDrag loss of vehicles like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, although the physical details can be quite complicated. Therefore, making them larger usually results in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed.\nHeat loss from industrial processes vary per unit of volume for pipes, tanks and other vessels in a relationship somewhat similar to the square\u2013cube law. In some productions, an increase in the size of the plant reduces the average variable cost, thanks to the energy savings resulting from the lower dispersion of heat.\nEconomies of increased dimension are often misinterpreted because of the confusion between indivisibility and three-dimensionality of space. This confusion arises from the fact that three-dimensional production elements, such as pipes and ovens, once installed and operating, are always technically indivisible. However, the economies of scale due to the increase in size do not depend on indivisibility but exclusively on the three-dimensionality of space. Indeed, indivisibility only entails the existence of economies of scale produced by the balancing of productive capacities, considered above; or of increasing returns in the utilisation of a single plant, due to its more efficient use as the quantity produced increases. However, this latter phenomenon has nothing to do with the economies of scale which, by definition, are linked to the use of a larger plant.\nEconomies in holding stocks and reserves.\nAt the base of economies of scale there are also returns to scale linked to statistical factors. In fact, the greater of the number of resources involved, the smaller, in proportion, is the quantity of reserves necessary to cope with unforeseen contingencies (for instance, machine spare parts, inventories, circulating capital, etc.).\nTransaction economies.\nOne of the reasons firms appear is to reduce transaction costs. A larger scale generally determines greater bargaining power over input prices and therefore benefits from pecuniary economies in terms of purchasing raw materials and intermediate goods compared to companies that make orders for smaller amounts. In this case, we speak of pecuniary economies, to highlight the fact that nothing changes from the \"physical\" point of view of the returns to scale. Furthermore, supply contracts entail fixed costs which lead to decreasing average costs if the scale of production increases. This is of important utility in the study of corporate finance.\nEconomies deriving from the balancing of production capacity.\nEconomies of productive capacity balancing derives from the possibility that a larger scale of production involves a more efficient use of the production capacities of the individual phases of the production process. If the inputs are indivisible and complementary, a small scale may be subject to idle times or to the underutilization of the productive capacity of some sub-processes. A higher production scale can make the different production capacities compatible. The reduction in machinery idle times is crucial in the case of a high cost of machinery.\nEconomies resulting from the division of labour and the use of superior techniques.\nA larger scale allows for a more efficient division of labour. The economies of division of labour derive from the increase in production speed, from the possibility of using specialized personnel and adopting more efficient techniques. An increase in the division of labour inevitably leads to changes in the quality of inputs and outputs.\nManagerial economics.\nMany administrative and organizational activities are mostly cognitive and, therefore, largely independent of the scale of production. When the size of the company and the division of labour increase, there are a number of advantages due to the possibility of making organizational management more effective and perfecting accounting and control techniques. Furthermore, the procedures and routines that turned out to be the best can be reproduced by managers at different times and places.\nLearning and growth economies.\nLearning and growth economies are at the base of dynamic economies of scale, associated with the process of growth of the scale dimension and not to the dimension of scale per se. Learning by doing implies improvements in the ability to perform and promotes the introduction of incremental innovations with a progressive lowering of average costs. Learning economies are directly proportional to the cumulative production (experience curve).\nGrowth economies emerge if a company gains an added benefit by expanding its size. These economies are due to the presence of some resource or competence that is not fully utilized, or to the existence of specific market positions that create a differential advantage in expanding the size of the firms. That growth economies disappear once the scale size expansion process is completed. For example, a company that owns a supermarket chain benefits from an economy of growth if, opening a new supermarket, it gets an increase in the price of the land it owns around the new supermarket. The sale of these lands to economic operators, who wish to open shops near the supermarket, allows the company in question to make a profit, making a profit on the revaluation of the value of building land.\nCapital and operating cost.\nOverall costs of capital projects are known to be subject to economies of scale. A crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known, changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio (the point six to the power rule).\nIn estimating capital cost, it typically requires an insignificant amount of labor, and possibly not much more in materials, to install a larger capacity electrical wire or pipe having significantly greater capacity.\nThe cost of a unit of capacity of many types of equipment, such as electric motors, centrifugal pumps, diesel and gasoline engines, decreases as size increases. Also, the efficiency increases with size.\nCrew size and other operating costs for ships, trains and airplanes.\nOperating crew size for ships, airplanes, trains, etc., does not increase in direct proportion to capacity. (Operating crew consists of pilots, co-pilots, navigators, etc. and does not include passenger service personnel.) Many aircraft models were significantly lengthened or \"stretched\" to increase payload.\nMany manufacturing facilities, especially those making bulk materials like chemicals, refined petroleum products, cement and paper, have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity. This is because labor requirements of automated processes tend to be based on the complexity of the operation rather than production rate, and many manufacturing facilities have nearly the same basic number of processing steps and pieces of equipment, regardless of production capacity.\nEconomical use of byproducts.\nKarl Marx noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste. Marx cited the chemical industry as an example, which today along with petrochemicals, remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products. In the pulp and paper industry, it is economical to burn bark and fine wood particles to produce process steam and to recover the spent pulping chemicals for conversion back to a usable form.\nEconomies of scale and the size of exporter.\nLarge and more productive firms typically generate enough net revenues abroad to cover the fixed costs associated with exporting. However, in the event of trade liberalization, resources will have to be reallocated toward the more productive firm, which raises the average productivity within the industry.\nFirms differ in their labor productivity and the quality of their products, so more efficient firms are more likely to generate more net income abroad and thus become exporters of their goods or services. There is a correlating relationship between a firm's total sales and underlying efficiency. Firms with higher productivity will always outperform a firm with lower productivity which will lead to lower sales. Through trade liberalization, organizations are able to drop their trade costs due to export growth. However, trade liberalization does not account for any tariff reduction or shipping logistics improvement. However, total economies of scale is based on the exporters individual frequency and size. So large-scale companies are more likely to have a lower cost per unit as opposed to small-scale companies. Likewise, high trade frequency companies are able to reduce their overall cost attributed per unit when compared to those of low-trade frequency companies.\nEconomies of scale and returns to scale.\nEconomies of scale is related to and can easily be confused with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale. Where economies of scale refer to a firm's costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run (all inputs variable) production function. A production function has \"constant\" returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion. Returns are \"decreasing\" if, say, doubling inputs results in less than double the output, and \"increasing\" if more than double the output. If a mathematical function is used to represent the production function, and if that production function is homogeneous, returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function. Homogeneous production functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous, increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one, and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one.\nIf the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shown that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, has diseconomies of scale if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale. In this case, with perfect competition in the output market the long-run equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves (i.e., at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale).\nIf, however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets, then the above conclusions are modified. For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels. Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.\nIn essence, returns to scale refer to the variation in the relationship between inputs and output. This relationship is therefore expressed in \"physical\" terms. But when talking about economies of scale, the relation taken into consideration is that between the average production cost and the dimension of scale. Economies of scale therefore are affected by variations in input prices. If input prices remain the same as their quantities purchased by the firm increase, the notions of increasing returns to scale and economies of scale can be considered equivalent. However, if input prices vary in relation to their quantities purchased by the company, it is necessary to distinguish between returns to scale and economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale is more general than that of returns to scale since it includes the possibility of changes in the price of inputs when the quantity purchased of inputs varies with changes in the scale of production.\nThe literature assumed that due to the competitive nature of reverse auctions, and in order to compensate for lower prices and lower margins, suppliers seek higher volumes to maintain or increase the total revenue. Buyers, in turn, benefit from the lower transaction costs and economies of scale that result from larger volumes. In part as a result, numerous studies have indicated that the procurement volume must be sufficiently high to provide sufficient profits to attract enough suppliers, and provide buyers with enough savings to cover their additional costs.\nHowever, Shalev and Asbjornse found, in their research based on 139 reverse auctions conducted in the public sector by public sector buyers, that the higher auction volume, or economies of scale, did not lead to better success of the auction. They found that auction volume did not correlate with competition, nor with the number of bidders, suggesting that auction volume does not promote additional competition. They noted, however, that their data included a wide range of products, and the degree of competition in each market varied significantly, and offer that further research on this issue should be conducted to determine whether these findings remain the same when purchasing the same product for both small and high volumes. Keeping competitive factors constant, increasing auction volume may further increase competition.\nEconomies of scale in the history of economic analysis.\nEconomies of scale in classical economists.\nThe first systematic analysis of the advantages of the division of labour capable of generating economies of scale, both in a static and dynamic sense, was that contained in the famous First Book of Wealth of Nations (1776) by Adam Smith, generally considered the founder of political economy as an autonomous discipline.\nJohn Stuart Mill, in Chapter IX of the First Book of his Principles, referring to the work of Charles Babbage (On the economics of machines and manufactories), widely analyses the relationships between increasing returns and scale of production all inside the production unit.\nEconomies of scale in Marx and distributional consequences.\nIn (1867), Karl Marx, referring to Charles Babbage, extensively analyzed economies of scale and concludes that they are one of the factors underlying the ever-increasing concentration of capital. Marx observes that in the capitalist system the technical conditions of the work process are continuously revolutionized in order to increase the surplus by improving the productive force of work. According to Marx, with the cooperation of many workers brings about an economy in the use of the means of production and an increase in productivity due to the increase in the division of labour. Furthermore, the increase in the size of the machinery allows significant savings in construction, installation and operation costs. The tendency to exploit economies of scale entails a continuous increase in the volume of production which, in turn, requires a constant expansion of the size of the market. However, if the market does not expand at the same rate as production increases, overproduction crises can occur. According to Marx the capitalist system is therefore characterized by two tendencies, connected to economies of scale: towards a growing concentration and towards economic crises due to overproduction.\nIn his 1844 \"Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts\", Karl Marx observes that economies of scale have historically been associated with an increasing concentration of private wealth and have been used to justify such concentration. Marx points out that concentrated private ownership of large-scale economic enterprises is a historically contingent fact, and not essential to the nature of such enterprises. In the case of agriculture, for example, Marx calls attention to the sophistical nature of the arguments used to justify the system of concentrated ownership of land:\n As for large landed property, its defenders have always sophistically identified the economic advantages offered by large-scale agriculture with large-scale landed property, as if it were not precisely as a result of the abolition of property that this advantage, for one thing, received its greatest possible extension, and, for another, only then would be of social benefit.\nInstead of concentrated private ownership of land, Marx recommends that economies of scale should instead be realized by associations:\nAssociation, applied to land, shares the economic advantage of large-scale landed property, and first brings to realization the original tendency inherent in land-division, namely, equality. In the same way association re-establishes, now on a rational basis, no longer mediated by serfdom, overlordship and the silly mysticism of property, the intimate ties of man with the earth, for the earth ceases to be an object of huckstering, and through free labor and free enjoyment becomes once more a true personal property of man.\nEconomies of scale in Marshall.\nAlfred Marshall notes that Antoine Augustin Cournot and others have considered \"the internal economies [...] apparently without noticing that their premises lead inevitably to the conclusion that, whatever firm first gets a good start will obtain a monopoly of the whole business of its trade \u2026 \". Marshall believes that there are factors that limit this trend toward monopoly, and in particular:\nSraffa's critique.\nPiero Sraffa observes that Marshall, in order to justify the operation of the law of increasing returns without it coming into conflict with the hypothesis of free competition, tended to highlight the advantages of external economies linked to an increase in the production of an entire sector of activity. However, \"those economies which are external from the point of view of the individual firm, but internal as regards the industry in its aggregate, constitute precisely the class which is most seldom to be met with.\" \"In any case - Sraffa notes \u2013 in so far as external economies of the kind in question exist, they are not linked to be called forth by small increases in production,\" as required by the marginalist theory of price. Sraffa points out that, in the equilibrium theory of the individual industries, the presence of external economies cannot play an important role because this theory is based on marginal changes in the quantities produced.\nSraffa concludes that, if the hypothesis of perfect competition is maintained, economies of scale should be excluded. He then suggests the possibility of abandoning the assumption of free competition to address the study of firms that have their own particular market. This stimulated a whole series of studies on the cases of imperfect competition in Cambridge. However, in the succeeding years Sraffa followed a different path of research that brought him to write and publish his main work \"Production of commodities by means of commodities\" . In this book, Sraffa determines relative prices assuming no changes in output, so that no question arises as to the variation or constancy of returns.\nRule of six-tenths.\nIn 1947, DuPont engineer Roger Williams Jr. (1930\u20132005) published a rule of thumb that costs of chemical process are roughly proportional to the tonnage in power ~0.6. In the following decades it became widely adopted other engineering industries and terrestrial mining, sometimes (e. g., in electrical power generation) with modified exponential scaling factors.\nEconomies of scale and the tendency towards monopoly: \"Cournot's dilemma\".\nIt has been noted that in many industrial sectors there are numerous companies with different sizes and organizational structures, despite the presence of significant economies of scale. This contradiction, between the empirical evidence and the logical incompatibility between economies of scale and competition, has been called the 'Cournot dilemma'. As Mario Morroni observes, Cournot's dilemma appears to be unsolvable if we only consider the effects of economies of scale on the dimension of scale. If, on the other hand, the analysis is expanded, including the aspects concerning the development of knowledge and the organization of transactions, it is possible to conclude that economies of scale do not always lead to monopoly. In fact, the competitive advantages deriving from the development of the firm's capabilities and from the management of transactions with suppliers and customers can counterbalance those provided by the scale, thus counteracting the tendency towards a monopoly inherent in economies of scale. In other words, the heterogeneity of the organizational forms and of the size of the companies operating in a sector of activity can be determined by factors regarding the quality of the products, the production flexibility, the contractual methods, the learning opportunities, the heterogeneity of preferences of customers who express a differentiated demand with respect to the quality of the product, and assistance before and after the sale. Very different organizational forms can therefore co-exist in the same sector of activity, even in the presence of economies of scale, such as, for example, flexible production on a large scale, small-scale flexible production, mass production, industrial production based on rigid technologies associated with flexible organizational systems and traditional artisan production. The considerations regarding economies of scale are therefore important, but not sufficient to explain the size of the company and the market structure. It is also necessary to take into account the factors linked to the development of capabilities and the management of transaction costs.\nExternal economies of scale.\nExternal economies of scale tend to be more prevalent than internal economies of scale. Through the external economies of scale, the entry of new firms benefits all existing competitors as it creates greater competition and also reduces the average cost for all firms as opposed to internal economies of scale which only allows benefits to the individual firm. Advantages that arise from external economies of scale include; \nSources.\nPurchasing.\nFirms are able to lower their average costs by buying their inputs required for the production process in bulk or from special wholesalers.\nManagerial.\nFirms might be able to lower their average costs by improving their management structure within the firm. This can range from hiring better skilled or more experienced managers from the industry.\nTechnological.\nTechnological advancements change production processes and subsequently reduce the overall cost per unit. Tim Hindle argues that the rollout of the internet \"has completely reshaped the assumptions underlying economies of scale\".\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He authored 57 books, written mostly in French and English, including \"Night\", which is based on his experiences as a Jewish prisoner at Auschwitz and Buchenwald during the Holocaust.\nAs a political activist, Wiesel became a regular speaker on the subject of the Holocaust and remained a strong defender of human rights during his lifetime, advocating for justice in numerous causes around the globe, including that of Soviet Jews and Ethiopian Jews, South African apartheid, the Rwandan genocide, the Bosnian genocide, the War in Darfur, the Kurdish independence movement, the Armenian genocide, Argentina's \"Desaparecidos\", Nicaragua's Miskito people, the Sri Lankan Tamils, and the Cambodian genocide. He was also an outspoken advocate for Israel and frequently weighed in to support the country during escalations of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict and throughout the Iran\u2013Israel proxy conflict. He backed Netanyahu publicly, including his controversial 2015 Congress speech on Iran, and signed ads praising settlers who occupied Palestinian homes in Silwan, East Jerusalem - one of the most provocative settlement activities. He claimed Jerusalem \"belongs to the Jewish people\" and opposed territorial compromise there. He also hosted direct talks to facilitate the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process.\nWiesel was a professor of the humanities at Boston University, which created the Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies in his honor. He received a number of awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986. He was a founding board member of the Human Rights Foundation and remained active in it throughout his life. Wiesel was one of the main figures who spearheaded the establishment of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1993.\nEarly life.\nEliezer Wiesel was born in Sighet (now Sighetu Marma\u021biei), Maramure\u0219, in the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. His parents were Sarah Feig and Shlomo Wiesel. At home, Wiesel's family spoke Yiddish most of the time, but also German, Hungarian, and Romanian. Wiesel's mother, Sarah, was the daughter of Dodye Feig, a Vizhnitz Hasid and farmer from the nearby village of Bocsk\u00f3. Dodye was active and trusted within the community.\nWiesel's father, Shlomo, instilled a strong sense of humanism in his son, encouraging him to learn Hebrew and to read literature, whereas his mother encouraged him to study the Torah. Wiesel said his father represented reason, while his mother Sarah promoted faith. Wiesel was instructed that his genealogy traced back to Rabbi Schlomo Yitzhaki (Rashi), and was a descendant of Rabbi Yeshayahu ben Abraham Horovitz ha-Levi.\nWiesel had three siblings\u2014older sisters Beatrice and Hilda, and younger sister Tzipora. Beatrice and Hilda survived the war, and were reunited with Wiesel at a French orphanage. They eventually emigrated to North America, with Beatrice moving to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Tzipora, Shlomo, and Sarah did not survive the Holocaust.\nImprisonment and orphaning during the Holocaust.\nIn March 1944, Germany occupied Hungary, thus extending the Holocaust into Northern Transylvania as well. Wiesel was 15, and he, with his family, along with the rest of the town's Jewish population, was placed in one of the two confinement ghettos set up in M\u00e1ramarossziget (Sighet), the town where he had been born and raised. In May 1944, the Hungarian authorities, under German pressure, began to deport the Jewish community to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where up to 90 percent of the people were murdered on arrival.\nImmediately after they were sent to Auschwitz, his mother and his younger sister were murdered in the gas chambers. Wiesel and his father were selected to perform labor so long as they remained able-bodied, after which they were to be murdered in the gas chambers. Wiesel and his father were later deported to the concentration camp at Buchenwald. Until that transfer, he admitted to Oprah Winfrey, his primary motivation for trying to survive Auschwitz was knowing that his father was still alive: \"I knew that if I died, he would die.\" After they were taken to Buchenwald, his father died before the camp was liberated. In \"Night\", Wiesel recalled the shame he felt when he heard his father being beaten and was unable to help.\nWiesel was tattooed with inmate number \"A-7713\" on his left arm. The camp was liberated by the U.S. Third Army on April 11, 1945, when they were just prepared to be evacuated from Buchenwald.\nMarch of the Living.\nThe March of the Living is an annual educational program that has brought over 300,000 participants from around the world to Poland, where they visit historical sites of the Holocaust, make a two-mile trek from Auschwitz to the former extermination site of Birkenau. Students learn about the experience through live testimony from survivors. Wiesel served on the Presidium for the first March of the Living in 1988, during its founding year. Wiesel attended the March of the Living in 1990, and again in 2005, during the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII. Wiesel addressed over 18,000 in attendance. It was the biggest event in the program's history .\nOn the 1990 March of the Living, Elie Wiesel addressed the participants at Auschwitz about his concerns about antisemitism. He stated, \"We were convinced that antisemitism perished here. Antisemitism did not perish here; its victims perished here.\" He started to share a story of a young girl, paused, and left the stage. The footage stated Wiesel was simply unable to continue the story. The corroborating article from Eli Rubenstein, who was in attendance that day described that even \"the world's most eloquent witness to the Holocaust,\" was not able to convey the story that led to the fate of this young girl.\nin 2017, Wiesel's son, Elisha participated in the March of the Living in memory of his father, honoring his legacy. Since his father's death, he has spoken at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum and Auschwitz, and has begun working on his late father's foundation, the Elie Wiesel Foundation.\nWiesel is included in the publication \".\" Along with his picture from when he was imprisoned at Buchenwald, he was quoted from the 1990 March of the Living:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Forever will I see the children who no longer have the strength to cry. Forever will I see the elderly who no longer have the strength to help them. Forever will I see the mothers and the fathers, the grandfathers and grandmothers, the little schoolchildren\u2026their teachers\u2026the righteous and the pious\u2026. From where do we take the tears to cry over them? Who has the strength to cry for them?\"\u2014\u200a\nPost-war career as a writer.\nFrance.\nAfter World War II ended and Wiesel was freed, he joined a transport of 1,000 child survivors of Buchenwald to Ecouis, France, where the \u0152uvre de secours aux enfants (OSE) had established a rehabilitation center. Wiesel joined a smaller group of 90 to 100 boys from Orthodox homes who wanted kosher facilities and a higher level of religious observance; they were cared for in a home in Ambloy under the directorship of Judith Hemmendinger. This home was later moved to Taverny and operated until 1947.\nAfterwards, Wiesel traveled to Paris where he learned French and studied literature, philosophy and psychology at the Sorbonne. He heard lectures by philosopher Martin Buber and existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and he spent his evenings reading works by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Franz Kafka, and Thomas Mann.\nBy the time he was 19, he had begun working as a journalist, writing in French, while also teaching Hebrew and working as a choirmaster. He wrote for Israeli and French newspapers, including \"Tsien in Kamf\" (in Yiddish).\nIn 1946, after learning of the Irgun's bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, Wiesel made an unsuccessful attempt to join the underground Zionist movement. In 1948, he translated articles from Hebrew into Yiddish for Irgun periodicals, but never became a member of the organization. In 1949, he traveled to Israel as a correspondent for the French newspaper \"L'arche\". He then was hired as Paris correspondent for the Israeli newspaper \"Yedioth Ahronoth\", subsequently becoming its roaming international correspondent.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExcerpt from \"Night\"\nNever shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.\n \u2014Elie Wiesel, from \"Night\".\nFor ten years after the war, Wiesel refused to write about or discuss his experiences during the Holocaust. He began to reconsider his decision after a meeting with the French author Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, the 1952 Nobel Laureate in Literature who eventually became Wiesel's close friend. Mauriac was a devout Christian who had fought in the French Resistance during the war. He compared Wiesel to \"Lazarus rising from the dead\", and saw from Wiesel's tormented eyes, \"the death of God in the soul of a child\". Mauriac persuaded him to begin writing about his harrowing experiences.\nWiesel first wrote the 900-page memoir \"Un di velt hot geshvign\" (\"And the World Remained Silent\") in Yiddish, which was published in abridged form in Buenos Aires. Wiesel rewrote a shortened version of the manuscript in French, \"La Nuit\", in 1955. It was translated into English as \"Night\" in 1960. The book sold few copies after its initial publication, but still attracted interest from reviewers, leading to television interviews with Wiesel and meetings with writers such as Saul Bellow.\nAs its profile rose, \"Night\" was eventually translated into 30 languages with ten million copies sold in the United States. At one point film director Orson Welles wanted to make it into a feature film, but Wiesel refused, feeling that his memoir would lose its meaning if it were told without the silences in between his words. Oprah Winfrey made it a spotlight selection for her book club in 2006.\nUnited States.\nIn 1955, Wiesel moved to New York as foreign correspondent for the Israel daily, \"Yediot Ahronot\". In 1969, he married Austrian Marion Erster Rose, who also translated many of his books. They had one son, Shlomo Elisha Wiesel, named after Wiesel's father.\nIn the U.S., he eventually wrote over 40 books, most of them non-fiction Holocaust literature, and novels. As an author, he was awarded a number of literary prizes and is considered among the most important in describing the Holocaust from a highly personal perspective. As a result, some historians credited Wiesel with giving the term \"Holocaust\" its present meaning, although he did not feel that the word adequately described that historical event. In 1975, he co-founded the magazine \"Moment\" with writer Leonard Fein.\nThe 1979 book and play \"The Trial of God\" are said to have been based on his real-life Auschwitz experience of witnessing three Jews who, close to death, conduct a trial against God, under the accusation that He has been oppressive towards the Jewish people.\nWiesel also played a role in the initial success of \"The Painted Bird\" by Jerzy Kosinski by endorsing it before it became known the book was fiction and, in the sense that it was presented as all Kosinski's true experience, a hoax.\nWiesel published two volumes of memoirs. The first, \"All Rivers Run to the Sea\", was published in 1994 and covered his life up to the year 1969. The second, titled \"And the Sea is Never Full\" and published in 1999, covered the years from 1969 to 1999.\nPolitical activism.\nWiesel and his wife, Marion, started the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity in 1986. He served as chairman of the President's Commission on the Holocaust (later renamed the US Holocaust Memorial Council) from 1978 to 1986, spearheading the building of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. Sigmund Strochlitz was his close friend and confidant during these years.\nThe Holocaust Memorial Museum gives the Elie Wiesel Award to \"internationally prominent individuals whose actions have advanced the Museum's vision of a world where people confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity\". The Foundation had invested its endowment in money manager Bernard L. Madoff's investment Ponzi scheme, costing the Foundation $15\u00a0million and Wiesel and his wife much of their own personal savings.\nSupport for the Israeli government.\nIn 1982, at the request of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Wiesel agreed to resign from his position as chairman of a planned international conference on the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide. Wiesel then worked with the Foreign Ministry in its attempts to get the conference either canceled or to remove all discussion of the Armenian genocide from it, and to those ends he provided the Foreign Ministry with internal documents on the conference's planning and lobbied fellow academics to not attend the conference.\nWiesel was a co-founder of the Writers and Artists for Peace in the Middle East, a pro-Israel group. In 1984, he signed a letter protesting German arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\nOn the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict.\nWiesel was critical of Hamas; he condemned them for the \"use of children as human shields\" during the 2014 Gaza War, and ran an ad in several large newspapers to express this message. \"The Times\" refused to run the advertisement, saying, \"The opinion being expressed is too strong, and too forcefully made, and will cause concern amongst a significant number of \"Times\" readers.\"\nDuring his lifetime, Wiesel had deflected questions on the topic of the Israeli settlements, claiming to abstain from commenting on Israel's internal debates. According to Lebanese-American columnist Hussein Ibish, despite this position, Wiesel had gone on record as supporting the idea of expanding Jewish settlements into the Palestinian territories conquered by Israel during the Six-Day War; such settlements are considered illegal by the international community. Wiesel often emphasized the Jewish connection to Jerusalem, and criticized the Obama administration for pressuring Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to halt the construction of settlements in East Jerusalem, stating that \"Jerusalem is above politics. It is mentioned more than six hundred times in Scripture\u2014and not a single time in the Koran\u00a0... It belongs to the Jewish people and is much more than a city\".\nAwards and other activism.\nWiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986 for speaking out against violence, repression, and racism. The Norwegian Nobel Committee described Wiesel as \"one of the most important spiritual leaders and guides in an age when violence, repression, and racism continue to characterize the world\" and called him a \"messenger to mankind\". It also stressed that Wiesel's commitment originated in the sufferings of the Jewish people but that he expanded it to embrace all repressed peoples and races.\nIn his acceptance speech he delivered a message \"of peace, atonement, and human dignity\". He explained his feelings: \"Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human lives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities become irrelevant.\"\nHe received many other prizes and honors for his work, including the Congressional Gold Medal in 1985, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. \nHe was also elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1996.\nWiesel co-founded \"Moment\" magazine with Leonard Fein in 1975. They founded the magazine to provide a voice for American Jews. He was also a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor.\nA staunch opponent of the death penalty, Wiesel stated that he thought that even Adolf Eichmann should not have been executed. Wiesel advocated clemency in the Cheshire murder case, instead supporting a life sentence of hard labor for the perpetrators.\nWiesel, a supporter of immigrant's rights, popularized the slogan \"No human being is illegal\". stating \"you who are so-called illegal aliens should know that no human being is illegal. That is a contradiction in terms Human beings can be beautiful or more beautiful, they can be fat or skinny, they can be right or wrong, but illegal? How can a human being be illegal?\"\nIn April 1999, Wiesel delivered the speech \"The Perils of Indifference\" in Washington D.C., criticizing the people and countries who chose to be indifferent while the Holocaust was happening. He defined indifference as being neutral between two sides, which, in this case, amounts to overlooking the victims of the Holocaust. Throughout the speech, he expressed the view that a little bit of attention, either positive or negative, is better than no attention at all.\nIn 2003, he discovered and publicized the fact that at least 280,000 Romanian and Ukrainian Jews, along with other groups, were massacred in Romanian-run death camps.\nIn 2005, he gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the new building of Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust History Museum:\nI know what people say \u2013 it is so easy. Those that were there won't agree with that statement. The statement is: it was man's inhumanity to man. NO! It was man's inhumanity to Jews! Jews were not killed because they were human beings. In the eyes of the killers they were not human beings! They were Jews!\nIn early 2006, Wiesel accompanied Oprah Winfrey as she visited Auschwitz, a visit which was broadcast as part of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". The trip was organized by International March of the Living's Vice Chair, \"David Machlis.\" On November 30, 2006, Wiesel received a knighthood in London in recognition of his work toward raising Holocaust education in the United Kingdom.\nIn September 2006, he appeared before the UN Security Council with actor George Clooney to call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. When Wiesel died, Clooney wrote, \"We had a champion who carried our pain, our guilt, and our responsibility on his shoulders for generations.\"\nIn 2007, Wiesel was awarded the Dayton Literary Peace Prize's Lifetime Achievement Award. That same year, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity issued a letter condemning Armenian genocide denial, a letter that was signed by 53 Nobel laureates including Wiesel. Wiesel repeatedly called Turkey's 90-year-old campaign to downplay its actions during the Armenian genocide a double killing.\nIn 2009, Wiesel criticized the Vatican for lifting the excommunication of controversial bishop Richard Williamson, a member of the Society of Saint Pius X. The excommunication was later reimposed.\nIn June 2009, Wiesel accompanied US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as they toured the Buchenwald concentration camp. Wiesel was an adviser at the Gatestone Institute. In 2010, Wiesel accepted a five-year appointment as a Distinguished Presidential Fellow at Chapman University in Orange County, California. In that role, he made a one-week visit to Chapman annually to meet with students and offer his perspective on subjects ranging from Holocaust history to religion, languages, literature, law and music.\nIn July 2009, Wiesel announced his support to the minority Tamils in Sri Lanka. He said that, \"Wherever minorities are being persecuted, we must raise our voices to protest\u00a0... The Tamil people are being disenfranchised and victimized by the\u00a0Sri Lanka authorities. This injustice must stop. The Tamil people must be allowed to live in peace and flourish in their homeland.\"\nIn 2009, Wiesel returned to Hungary for his first visit since the Holocaust. During this visit, Wiesel participated in a conference at the Upper House Chamber of the Hungarian Parliament, met Prime Minister Gordon Bajnai and President L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00f3lyom, and made a speech to the approximately 10,000 participants of an anti-racist gathering held in Faith Hall. However, in 2012, he protested against \"the whitewashing\" of Hungary's involvement in the Holocaust, and he gave up the Great Cross award he had received from the Hungarian government.\nWiesel was active in trying to prevent Iran from making nuclear weapons, stating that, \"The words and actions of the leadership of Iran leave no doubt as to their intentions\".\nTeaching.\nWiesel held the position of Andrew Mellon Professor of the Humanities at Boston University from 1976, teaching in both its religion and philosophy departments. He became a close friend of the president and chancellor John Silber. The university created the Elie Wiesel Center for Jewish Studies in his honor. From 1972 to 1976 Wiesel was a Distinguished Professor at the City University of New York and member of the American Federation of Teachers.\nIn 1982 he served as the first Henry Luce Visiting Scholar in Humanities and Social Thought at Yale University. He also co-instructed Winter Term (January) courses at Eckerd College, St. Petersburg, Florida. From 1997 to 1999 he was Ingeborg Rennert Visiting professor of Judaic Studies at Barnard College of Columbia University.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1969 he married Marion Erster Rose, who originally was from Austria and also translated many of his books from French to English. They had one son, Shlomo Elisha Wiesel, named after Wiesel's father. The family lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nWiesel was attacked in a San Francisco hotel by 22-year-old Holocaust denier Eric Hunt in February 2007, but was not injured.

{"id": "10520", "revid": "36449898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10520", "title": "Ed Wood", "text": "American filmmaker, actor and author (1924\u20131978)\nEdward Davis Wood Jr. (October 10, 1924\u00a0\u2013 December 10, 1978) was an American filmmaker, actor, and pulp novelist.\nIn the 1950s, Wood directed several low-budget science fiction, crime and horror films that later became cult classics, notably \"Glen or Glenda\" (1953), \"Jail Bait\" (1954), \"Bride of the Monster\" (1955), \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (1957) and \"Night of the Ghouls\" (1959). In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as \"The Sinister Urge\" (1960), \"Orgy of the Dead\" (1965) and \"Necromania\" (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.\nFollowing the publication of Rudolph Grey's 1992 oral biography \"Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.\", a biopic of his life, \"Ed Wood\" (1994), was directed by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp as Wood and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the film received critical acclaim and various awards, including two Academy Awards for Best Makeup and Best Supporting Actor for Landau respectively.\nEarly years.\nWood's father worked for the United States Post Office as a custodian, and his family relocated numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in Poughkeepsie, New York, where Wood was born in 1924. According to his second wife, Kathy O'Hara, Wood's mother Lillian would dress him in girl's clothing when he was a child because she had always wanted a daughter (Wood had one brother, several years younger than himself). For the rest of his life, Wood crossdressed, infatuated with the feel of angora on his skin.\nDuring his childhood, Wood was interested in the performing arts and pulp fiction. He collected comic books and pulp magazines, and adored movies, especially Westerns, serials, and the occult. Buck Jones and Bela Lugosi were two of his earliest childhood idols. He often skipped school in order to watch motion pictures at the local movie theater, where stills from last week's films would often be thrown into the trash by theater staff, allowing Wood to salvage the images, and to add to his extensive collection.\nOn his 12th birthday, in 1936, Wood received as a gift his first movie camera, a Kodak \"Cine Special\". One of his first pieces of footage showed the airship \"Hindenburg\" passing over the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie, shortly before its disastrous crash at Lakehurst, New Jersey. One of Wood's first paid jobs was as a cinema usher, and he also sang and played drums in a band. Subsequently, he formed a quartet called \"Eddie Wood's Little Splinters\" in which he sang and played multiple stringed instruments.\nMilitary service.\nIn 1942, Wood enlisted at age 17 in the United States Marine Corps, just months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Assigned to the 2nd Defense Battalion, he reached the rank of corporal before he was discharged in 1946 at age 21. Although Wood reportedly claimed to have faced strenuous combat (including having his front teeth knocked out by a Japanese soldier), his actual military adventures included recovering bodies on Betio following the Battle of Tarawa, and experiencing minor Japanese bombing raids on Betio and the Ellice Islands. A recurring filariasis infection left him performing clerical work for the remainder of his enlistment. His dental extractions were carried out over several months by Navy dentists, unconnected to any combat. Wood had false teeth that he would slip out from his mouth when he wanted to make his wife Kathy laugh, showing her a big toothless grin. Wood later claimed that he feared being wounded in battle more than he feared being killed, mainly because he was afraid a combat medic would discover him wearing a pink bra and panties under his uniform during the Battle of Tarawa.\nCareer.\nDirecting and screenwriting.\nIn 1947, Wood moved to Hollywood, California, where he wrote scripts and directed television pilots, commercials and several forgotten micro-budget westerns, most of which failed to sell. Wood biographer Rudolph Grey states that Ed Wood made approximately 125 commercials for Story-Ad films and approximately 30 commercials for Play-Ad Films, in addition to a few commercials for \"Pie-Quick\".\nIn 1948, Wood wrote, produced, directed, and starred in \"The Casual Company\", a play derived from his own unpublished novel which was based on his service in the United States Marine Corps. It opened at the Village Playhouse to negative reviews on October 25. That same year, he wrote and directed a low-budget western called \"Crossroads of Laredo\" with the aid of a young producer he met named Crawford John Thomas. The film was shot silent and was only completed posthumously decades after Wood's death.\nIn 1949, Wood and Thomas acted together in a play called \"The Blackguard Returns\" at the Gateway Theatre (Wood played the Sheriff and Thomas was the villain). Wood joined the Screen Actors Guild in 1951, and worked very briefly as a stuntman among other things. When writing, Wood used a number of different pen names, including Ann Gora (in reference to Angora, his favorite textile) and Akdov Telmig (the backwards spelling of his favorite drink, the vodka gimlet).\nIn 1952, Wood was introduced to actor Bela Lugosi by friend and fellow writer-producer Alex Gordon (Wood's roommate at the time who was later involved in creating American International Pictures). Lugosi's son, Bela George Lugosi Jr., has been among those who felt Wood exploited the senior Lugosi's stardom, taking advantage of the fading actor when he could not afford to refuse any work. However, most documents and interviews with other Wood associates in \"Nightmare of Ecstasy\" suggest that Wood and Lugosi were genuine friends and that Wood helped Lugosi through the worst days of his clinical depression and drug addiction. Lugosi had become dependent on morphine as a way of controlling his debilitating sciatica over the years, and was in a poor mental state caused by his recent divorce.\n\"Glen or Glenda\".\nIn 1953, Wood wrote and directed the semi-documentary film \"Glen or Glenda\" (originally titled \"I Changed My Sex!\") with producer George Weiss. The film starred Wood (under the alias \"Daniel Davis\") as a transvestite, his girlfriend Dolores Fuller, Timothy Farrell, Lyle Talbot, Conrad Brooks and Bela Lugosi as the narrator/scientist. Fuller was shocked when she learned soon afterward that Wood actually was a cross-dresser.\nIn 1953, Wood wrote and directed a stage show for Lugosi called \"The Bela Lugosi Review\" (a take-off on \"Dracula\") that was put on at the Silver Slipper in Las Vegas. When Lugosi appeared on the TV show \"You Asked For It\" that same year, he announced that Ed Wood was producing a \"Dr. Acula\" TV show for him, but it never materialized. Wood acted as Lugosi's dialogue coach when he guest-starred on \"The Red Skelton Show\" in 1954, alongside Lon Chaney Jr. and Vampira (aka Maila Nurmi).\n\"Jail Bait\".\nWood co-produced and directed a crime film, \"Jail Bait\" (1954, originally titled \"The Hidden Face\"), along with his co-writer/roommate Alex Gordon, which starred Herbert Rawlinson (as the plastic surgeon), Lyle Talbot, Dolores Fuller, Timothy Farrell, Theodora Thurman and Steve Reeves (in one of his first acting jobs). Bela Lugosi was supposed to play the lead role of the plastic surgeon, but was busy with another project when filming started and had to bow out. His replacement, Herbert Rawlinson, died the day after he filmed his scenes. Distributor Ron Ormond changed the title from \"The Hidden Face\" to \"Jail Bait\" just before releasing it.\n\"Bride of the Monster\".\nWood produced and directed the horror film \"Bride of the Monster\" (1955, originally titled \"Bride of the Atom\" or \"The Monster of the Marshes\"), based on an original story idea by Alex Gordon which he had originally called \"The Atomic Monster\". It starred Bela Lugosi as the mad scientist, Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson as mute manservant \"Lobo\", Paul Marco, Billy Benedict (\"Whitey\" of \"The Bowery Boys\"), Harvey B. Dunn and Loretta King. Soon after the film was completed, Bela Lugosi committed himself to the Norwalk State Hospital for three months, to be treated for drug addiction. The film premiered on May 11, 1955, at the Paramount theater in Hollywood while Lugosi was institutionalized, but a special screening was arranged for him upon his release, pleasing him greatly.\n\"The Violent Years\".\nIn 1956, Wood wrote the screenplay (uncredited) for the film \"The Violent Years\" (originally titled \"Teenage Girl Gang\"), which was directed by William M. Morgan, starring \"Playboy\" model Jean Moorhead, Timothy Farrell, and serial star I. Stanford Jolley (as a judge).\nWood began filming a juvenile delinquency film called \"Rock and Roll Hell\" (a.k.a. \"Hellborn\") in 1956, but producer George Weiss pulled the plug on the project after only ten minutes of footage had been completed. Wood's friend Conrad Brooks purchased the footage from Weiss, and some scenes were later incorporated as stock footage into Wood's later \"Night of the Ghouls\" (1959). (The entire ten minutes of footage was later released complete on VHS in 1993, as \"Hellborn\".)\n\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\".\nIn late 1956, Wood co-produced, wrote, and directed his science fiction opus \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" (his screenplay was originally titled \"Grave Robbers from Outer Space\"), which featured Bela Lugosi in a small role. (Although Lugosi died in August 1956 before production began, Wood used footage he had shot of Lugosi in 1955\u20131956.) The film also starred Tor Johnson, Vampira (Maila Nurmi), Tom Mason (who doubled for Lugosi in some scenes), and the Amazing Criswell as the film's narrator. \"Plan 9\" premiered on March 15, 1957, at the Carlton Theatre in Hollywood, and later went into general release in July 1958 (retitled \"Plan Nine from Outer Space\") in Texas and a number of other Southern states. It was finally sold to late night television in 1961, thereby finding its audience over the years. It became Wood's best-known film and found a cult following in 1980 when Michael Medved declared this film \"the worst film ever made\" in his book \"The Golden Turkey Awards\".\n\"Final Curtain\".\nIn 1957, Wood wrote and directed a pilot for a suspense-horror TV series called \"Portraits in Terror\" that ultimately failed to sell. The pilot, entitled \"Final Curtain\", sees an old and world-weary actor wandering in an empty theatre, imagining ghosts and a living mannequin haunting the backstage area, until he realizes that he himself is dead. The episode has no dialogue, and Dudley Manlove narrates the thoughts of Duke Moore as the actor. Lugosi would have starred in this short film had he lived. Parts of the unsold pilot were later recycled for use in Wood's \"Night of the Ghouls\" (1959). The episode was thought to be lost until a complete print was located c.\u20092010. It was remastered and given its first ever cinema showing in a theater in February 2012. Today it is widely available online and on DVD.\n\"Night of the Ghouls\".\nIn 1958, Wood wrote, produced, and directed \"Night of the Ghouls\" (originally titled \"Revenge of the Dead\"), starring Kenne Duncan, Tor Johnson (reprising his role as \"Lobo\" from \"Bride of the Monster\"), Criswell, Duke Moore, and Valda Hansen. The film premiered at the Vista Theatre in Hollywood on a double bill with the Lana Turner movie \"Imitation of Life\" on March 17, 1959, and then promptly vanished from circulation. For many years, it was thought to be a lost film, but distribution of the film was held up for 25 years because Wood had not paid the lab bill. Video producer Wade Williams paid the bill and released the film on videocassette in 1984, copyrighting the film in his own name.\nIn 1958, Wood also wrote the screenplay for \"The Bride and the Beast\" (1958), which was directed by Adrian Weiss. Wood's screenplay was based on Weiss' plot.\nWood also wrote the screenplay (as \"Peter LaRoche\") for a 1959 \"nudie cutie\" film called \"Revenge of the Virgins\", which was directed by Peter Perry Jr.\n\"The Sinister Urge\".\nWood wrote and directed the exploitation film \"The Sinister Urge\" (1960), starring Kenne Duncan, Duke Moore, Dino Fantini, Harvey B. Dunn and Carl Anthony. Filmed in just five days, this is the last mainstream film Wood directed, although it has exploitation elements. The film contains an \"eerily prescient\" scene, in which Carl Anthony's character states, \"I look at this slush, and I try to remember, at one time, I made good movies\". The scenes of the teenagers at the pizzeria had been previously shot in 1956 for Wood's unfinished juvenile delinquency film, \"Rock and Roll Hell\" (a.k.a. \"Hellborn\").\nAlso in 1960, Wood wrote the screenplay for \"The Peeper\", which he intended as a direct sequel to his 1960 film \"The Sinister Urge\", but it was never produced.\nWood also contributed to the plot of Jane Mann's 1961 screenplay \"Anatomy of a Psycho\". The film was directed by Mann's husband Boris Petroff.\nIn 1963, Wood wrote the screenplay for \"Shotgun Wedding\" (an exploitation film directed by Boris Petroff about hillbillies marrying child brides in the Ozarks). Wood wrote the screenplay from a story idea by Jane Mann. Wood's friend, cameraman William C. Thompson, died around this time.\n\"Orgy of the Dead\".\nWood's 1965 transitional film \"Orgy of the Dead\" (originally titled \"Nudie Ghoulies\") combined the horror and sexploitation genres. Wood handled various production details while Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film begins with a recreation of the opening scene from \"Night of the Ghouls\". Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in a misty graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays with Apostolof and occasionally even acted in some of the films.\nIn 1969, Wood appeared in \"The Photographer\" (a.k.a. \"Love Feast\" or \"Pretty Models All in a Row\"), the first of two films produced by a Marine buddy, Joseph F. Robertson, with Wood portraying a photographer using his position to engage in sexual antics with his models.\nWood had a smaller role in Robertson's second film, \"Mrs. Stone's Thing\" (1970), as a transvestite who spends his time at a party trying on lingerie in a bedroom.\nIn 1969, Wood adapted his own novel \"Mama's Diary\" written under the pseudonym Dick Trent into \"Operation Red Light\" for Jacques Descent Production. Over half the footage was destroyed in a film-processing accident and the film is considered lost.\n\"Venus Flytrap\" (1970) aka \"The Revenge of Dr. X\", a US/Japanese co-production, was based on an unproduced Ed Wood screenplay from the 1950s. The film was produced and directed by Sci-Fi pulp writer Norman Earl Thomson. The film involves a mad scientist who uses lightning to transform plants into man-eating monsters. Wood did not participate in the actual making of the movie.\n\"Take It Out in Trade\".\nIn 1970, Wood wrote and directed his own pornographic film, \"Take It Out in Trade\", starring Duke Moore and Nona Carver. Wood played a transvestite named Alecia in the film.\nIn 1970, Wood produced a 45 rpm record which featured Tor Johnson on one side, reading \"The Day The Mummy Returned\", and Criswell reading \"The Final Curtain\" on the other. It has never been determined whether or not the record was actually released, but many of them were definitely produced.\n\"Necromania\".\nIn 1971, Wood produced, wrote and directed \"Necromania\" (subtitled \"A Tale of Weird Love\") under the pseudonym \"Don Miller\". The film was an early entry to the new subgenre of hardcore pornographic films. Thought lost for years, it resurfaced in edited form on Mike Vraney's Something Weird imprint in the late 1980s and was re-released later on DVD by Fleshbot Films in 2005. In the Rudolph Grey biography \"Nightmare of Ecstasy\", Maila Nurmi (\"Vampira\") said she declined Wood's offer to do a nude scene sitting in a coffin for \"Necromania\", claiming she was recovering from a stroke at the time.\nFrom 1971 to 1972, Wood directed an unknown number of short X-rated films produced by the Swedish Erotica film company. These were short 12-minute loops that were silent films with subtitles. Wood was paid $100 for every ten loops he subtitled.\nWood's friends Kenne Duncan and Tor Johnson both died during this period. Wood was named executor of Kenne Duncan's estate, and following Duncan's death, Wood held a small memorial funeral for him with his wife and some friends in his backyard around the swimming pool where they eulogized the departed Western film star. Wood's friend Duke Moore died in 1976.\nThroughout the 1970s, Wood worked with his friend Stephen C. Apostolof, usually co-writing scripts with him, but also serving as an assistant director and an associate producer. (Together they had made Wood's \"Orgy of the Dead\" back in 1965.) Wood's last known on-screen appearance (a dual role) was in Apostolof's 1974 film \"Fugitive Girls\" (a.k.a. \"Five Loose Women\"), in which he played both a gas station attendant called \"Pops\" and a sheriff on the fugitive women's trail. In 1974, Wood was allegedly on the set of an ultra-low budget film called \"Meatcleaver Massacre\" (1977) and is said to have co-directed at least one scene in the film (uncredited), but his involvement is dubious.\nAt the time of his death, Wood was working on a biographical screenplay based on the last years of actor Bela Lugosi to be called \"Lugosi Post Mortem\", which was supposed to star actor Peter Coe as Lugosi and Karl Johnson as his father Tor Johnson. The nearly completed script was left behind the last time Wood was evicted and is presumed to have been discarded in the trash. Wood was also working on a screenplay for a film called \"Venus De Milo\", a mystery that would explain the famous statue's missing arms.\nTechnically, Wood's last acting job was in the 1978 Stephen Apostolof film \"Hot Ice\". Ed Wood played a janitor in the film, but his scene was cut out at the last minute due to his drunkenness on the set. Wood died soon after this film was made in 1978, at age 54. Apostolof himself stopped making films as well at this time.\nBooks and novels.\nBeginning in 1963 up until his death, Wood wrote at least 80 lurid crime and sex novels in addition to hundreds of short stories and non-fiction pieces for magazines and daily newspapers.\nHis novels include \"Black Lace Drag\" (1963) (reissued in 1965 as \"Killer in Drag\"), \"Orgy of the Dead\" (1965), \"Parisian Passions\" (1966), \"Watts the Difference\" (1966), \"Side-Show Siren\" (1966), \"Drag Trade\" (1967), \"Watts After\" (1967), \"Devil Girls\" (1967), \"It Takes One to Know One\" (1967), \"Death of a Transvestite\" (1967), \"Suburbia Confidential\" (1967), \"Night Time Lez\" (1968), \"The Perverts\" (1968), \"Bye Bye Broadie\" (1968), \"Raped in the Grass\" (1968), \"Sex, Shrouds and Caskets\" (1968), \"Love of the Dead\" (1968), \"The Sexecutives\" (1968), \"Young, Black and Gay\" (1968), \"Hell Chicks\" (1968), \"The Gay Underworld\" (1968), \"Carnival Piece\" (1969), \"Toni, Black Tigress\" (1969), \"Mama's Diary\" (1969), \"To Make a Homo\" (1969), \"Mary-Go-Round\" (1969), \"The Sexual Woman\" (1971), \"The Only House\" (1972), \"A Study of Fetishes and Fantasies\" (1973), \"Tales for a Sexy Night Part 1 and 2\" (1973), \"Sex Star\" (1973), \"Death of a Transvestite Hooker\" (1974). \"Forced Entry\" (1974), and \"TV Lust\" (1977).\nIn 1965, Wood wrote the quasi-memoir \"Hollywood Rat Race\", which was only published years later in 1998. In it, Wood advises new writers to \"just keep on writing. Even if your story gets worse, you'll get better\", and also recounts tales of dubious authenticity, such as how he and Bela Lugosi entered the world of nightclub cabaret.\nThirty-two short stories known to be written by Wood (he sometimes wrote under pseudonyms such as \"Ann Gora\" and \"Dr. T.K. Peters\") are collected in an anthology \"Blood Splatters Quickly\", published by OR Books in 2014.\nUnrealized projects.\nWood's list of unrealized film projects also included scripts called \"Piranhas\" (1957), \"Trial by Terror\" (1958), \"The Peeper\" (a proposed 1960 sequel to \"The Sinister Urge\"), \"Silent Night\" (1961), \"Joaquin Murieta\" (a 1965 biopic about the infamous bandit of the Old West), \"Mice on a Cold Cellar Floor\" (1973), \"Epitaph for the Town Drunk\" (1973), \"To Kill a Saturday Night\" (1973, which was set to star John Carradine), \"The Teachers\" (1973), \"The Basketballers\" (1973), \"The Airline Hostesses\" (1973), \"I Awoke Early the Day I Died\" (1974, a rewrite of Wood's 1961 \"Silent Night\"), \"Heads, No Tails\" (1974, a take-off on Sweeney Todd), and \"Shoot Seven\" (1977, Wood's proposed musical based on the St. Valentine's Day Massacre).\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and marriages.\nWood was in a long-term relationship with actress and songwriter Dolores Fuller, whom he met in late 1952. She was in the process of divorcing her first husband Donald Fuller, with whom she had had two sons. Wood and Fuller shared an apartment for three years, and Wood cast her in three of his films: \"Glen or Glenda\", \"Jail Bait\" and, in a very brief cameo, in \"Bride of the Monster\". Fuller later said she initially had no idea that Wood was a crossdresser and was mortified when she saw Wood dressed as a woman for the first time in \"Glen or Glenda\". The couple broke up in 1955 after Wood cast another actress for the lead role in \"Bride of the Monster\" (Wood originally wrote the part for Fuller but later reduced her part to a brief cameo appearance) and because of Wood's excessive drinking. Fuller relocated to New York City where she embarked on a successful songwriting career, writing for famous singers like Elvis Presley and Nat King Cole. Fuller died on May 9, 2011, at age 88.\nIn 1956, soon after his breakup with Fuller, Wood married actress Norma McCarty. McCarty appeared as Edie, the airplane stewardess, in \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", and was recently divorced with two sons, Mike and John McCarty, from her earlier marriage. The marriage took Wood's friends by surprise; one night, Wood called everyone to the sound stage for what they thought was a cast party, but when everyone was present, Wood brought out a huge wedding cake and a preacher, and announced he was getting married. The marriage ended approximately one month later after McCarty discovered that Wood was a crossdresser, and while it has been reported that their marriage was annulled, according to film archivist Wade Williams, they neither annulled the marriage nor legally divorced. McCarty died on June 27, 2014, at age 93.\nWood moved in with his friend Paul Marco for a short while after McCarty left him. Later in 1956, Wood met Kathy O'Hara in a bar one night where he was drinking with Bela Lugosi. O'Hara fell in love with Wood immediately; they were married in Las Vegas a short while later, and Wood always considered O'Hara his legal wife despite the fact that his first marriage had not been legally annulled. Wood and O'Hara remained together until Wood's death in December 1978. O'Hara never got along with his mother Lillian, calling her \"a strict disciplinarian\" who damaged Wood psychologically from early childhood. Wood occasionally sent money to his mom in the mail without O'Hara's knowledge. O'Hara died on June 26, 2006, due to esophageal cancer. She was 84 years old.\nAlleged daughter.\nWood was shocked to learn he had fathered a child out of wedlock after World War II with a young woman he had dated while he was in the Marines. According to Conrad Brooks, Wood and his wife Kathy only met the woman (also named Kathy) in 1967 when she was already 21 years old. Born on May 23, 1946, she had been living in Lancaster, California, and had managed to trace her father's whereabouts. Wood's mother Lillian said she had been contacted by the girl back in 1963 when she sent his mother a photo and introduced herself to Lillian as her granddaughter. Lillian said she sent the girl a watch for her graduation in 1964, but never heard back from her.\nThere is a photo of the young woman in Rudolph Grey's biography on Wood.\nShe visited the Woods and stayed over at their house for a couple of days, but apparently the two women did not get along well. In fact, Wood's wife physically threw her out of the house on the second day when she found her sleeping on their sofa.\nWood's wife Kathy never believed that the girl was Wood's daughter, saying in an interview, \"There was never any proof, only the woman's statement on a birth certificate.\" Wood told Kathy that the woman he had sex with in 1946 used to sleep around regularly \"with 10 or 20 other Marines at the base\", so he probably wasn't the girl's father. She said, \"She's \"not\" your daughter, that bitch lied to you! The father could have been anyone. There's only her accusation.\"\nActress Valda Hansen said, \"I met Ed's daughter at his house in the Valley. She looked just like him. Beautiful, delicate. Green eyes, dark chocolate brown hair. She was very sweet.\" Art director Bob Derteno, who worked with Wood on \"Orgy of the Dead\", said that Wood later travelled to attend his daughter's wedding in New York and was later told that he had become a grandfather.\nCross-dressing.\nIn Rudolph Grey's 1992 biography \"Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr.\", Wood's wife Kathy O'Hara recalls that Wood told her that his mother dressed him in girls' clothing as a child. O'Hara stated that Wood's cross-dressing was not a sexual inclination, but rather a neomaternal comfort derived mainly from angora fabric (angora is featured in many of Wood's films). Even in his later years, Wood was not shy about going out in public dressed in drag as \"Shirley\", his female alter ego (a name that appeared in many of his screenplays and stories). In his partly autobiographical film \"Glen or Glenda\", the heterosexual Wood takes pains to emphasize that a male cross-dresser is not automatically also a homosexual. In a 1996 interview, American International Pictures co-founder Sam Arkoff said Wood came into his office for the first time dressed as a woman. Wood directed many of his pornographic films in drag, but usually would not take the time to shave, which made for a bizarre sight, according to his friends. Wood always swore that he had never had a single homosexual relationship in his life, and was even considered quite a womanizer by many of his acquaintances. He once said that if he could have anything in life, it would be reincarnation as a blonde woman.\nLater years.\nDuring the last 15 years of his life, Wood depended almost entirely on writing pornographic novels to earn a living, receiving an average of $1,000 per novel which he spent almost immediately on alcohol at the local liquor store. Friends have stated how, in his final years, he eventually stopped bathing, and that his apartment became so filthy that he eventually would not allow friends to come over and visit because he knew they would be horrified to see how unkempt it had become. Paul Marco said Wood was constantly moaning, \"My God, I've given everything away. I should be a millionaire. I should have a million bucks right now!\"\nActor John Agar, an alcoholic himself, was drinking at Wood's apartment one day in the late 1960s when the afternoon news program erroneously announced Agar's obituary. Wood called the studio and told them that Agar was not dead. He told them \"He's alive... he's sitting right here with me now!\". The story was corrected shortly thereafter.\nEd Wood and his wife were routinely evicted from their apartments for non-payment of rent. Each time they moved, Wood would immediately establish credit with the liquor store nearest his new address. Their last apartment was in a high-crime ghetto area at the corner of Yucca and Cahuenga Hollywood inhabited by drug addicts, gamblers and prostitutes. Wood, who regularly pawned his typewriters for cash, was mugged regularly when he would stumble down the street to the liquor store. Eventually he had his publisher send his paychecks directly to the various liquor store owners so that he would not have to carry cash when he went there.\nThe Woods' apartment was always in danger of being burglarized. One night, a cross-dresser was beaten to death in the hallway just outside Wood's apartment door and the sound of gunshots outside the building was a nightly occurrence.\nAccording to friends, Wood and his wife often became violent when they drank. Stories abound of the two beating each other; Wood sometimes knocked Kathy unconscious. Criswell commented once, \"I always had the feeling that one would kill the other. And if you were there, the killer would say you did it!\" Nonetheless, years after Wood's death, his wife always professed to love him dearly.\nBela Lugosi biographer Robert Cremer interviewed Wood once in his Yucca apartment for his 1976 book \"Lugosi: The Man Behind the Cape\" two years before Wood died. Cremer said Wood began the interview sober, but quickly became intoxicated over the next hour as the interview proceeded. Cremer said, \"He started getting really angry at me because he felt he was the person who should be writing (the book)... He went out in the kitchen, grabbed a bottle of Wild Turkey... He smashed the bottle on the kitchen counter and then came after me with it. He lunged at me, but he was so drunk, I just pushed him against the wall, and he collapsed. I just walked out the door and said 'Okay Ed, I guess that was our last interview. I'll see you.'\"\nDeath.\nBy 1978, Wood's depression had worsened as he and his wife Kathy O'Hara had both succumbed to alcoholism. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on December 7, 1978, in total poverty by two sheriff's deputies called by their landlord for failure to pay their overdue rent. Wood had to leave behind all of his scrapbooks and unfinished screenplays, which the landlord allegedly threw into a garbage dumpster. Wood's large film collection of his early commercials were also thrown out following his eviction. The couple moved into the small North Hollywood apartment of their friend, actor Peter Coe, located at 5636 Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka and desperately calling old friends for money, but to no avail.\nAround noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom while Coe, O'Hara and a few friends were watching a football game on TV. From the bedroom, he asked O'Hara to bring him a drink, which she refused to do. A few minutes later, he yelled out, \"Kathy, I can't breathe!\", a plea O'Hara ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood bossing her around. After hearing no movement in the bedroom for twenty minutes, O'Hara sent a female friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead on the bed from a heart attack. O'Hara later said, \"I still remember when I went into that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open. I'll never forget the look in his eyes. He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell.\"\nWood was cremated at the Utter-McKinley mortuary, and his ashes were scattered at sea. Paul Marco, O'Hara, David DeMering and The Amazing Criswell attended Wood's makeshift memorial service which was held at Peter Coe's apartment following the cremation. Marco recalled how devastated O'Hara was at the time.\nLegacy and homages.\nAt the time of his death, Wood's name and career had become so obscure that most local Los Angeles newspapers, including the entertainment magazine \"Variety\", did not run an obituary about him.\nThe 1982 film \"It Came from Hollywood\" featured a \"Tribute to Ed Wood\" segment.\nIn 1986 in an essay paying homage to Wood in \"Incredibly Strange Films\", Jim Morton wrote: \"Eccentric and individualistic, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a man born to film. [...] Lesser men, if forced to make movies under the conditions Wood faced, would have thrown up their hands in defeat\".\nIn 1994, director Tim Burton released the biopic \"Ed Wood\", starring Johnny Depp in the title role and Martin Landau, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. It also won an Academy Award for Best Makeup for Rick Baker. Conrad Brooks appeared in the movie in a cameo role as \"Barman\", along with Gregory Walcott in the role of a potential backer. The film premiered on September 30, 1994, just ten days before what would have been Wood's 70th birthday. Despite receiving critical acclaim, the movie did poorly at the box office; however, it has since developed a cult following.\nIn 1996, Reverend Steve Galindo of Seminole, Oklahoma, created a legally recognized religion with Wood as its official savior. Founded as a joke, the Church of Ed Wood now boasts more than 3,500 baptized followers. Woodites, as Galindo's followers are called, celebrate \"Woodmas\" on October 10, which was Wood's birthday. Numerous parties and concerts are held worldwide to celebrate Woodmas. On October 4\u20135, 2003, horror host Mr. Lobo was canonized as the \"Patron Saint of late night movie hosts and insomniacs\" in the Church of Ed Wood.\nIn 1997 the University of Southern California began holding an annual \"Ed Wood Film Festival\", in which student teams are challenged to write, film, and edit an Ed Wood-inspired short film based on a preassigned theme. Past themes have included \"Rebel Without a Bra\" (2004), \"What's That in Your Pocket?\" (2005), and \"Slippery When Wet\" (2006).\nLost films.\nWood's 1972 film \"The Undergraduate\" was a lost film, as was his 1970 film \"Take It Out in Trade\", but they both eventually turned up years later. (Both films in their entirety are now available on DVD.)\nAn 80-minute print of \"Take It Out in Trade\" was discovered and publicly exhibited at Anthology Film Archives in New York City in September 2014. Silent outtakes from the film were released by Something Weird Video.\nWood's 1971 film \"Necromania\" was also believed lost for years, until an edited version resurfaced at a yard sale in 1992, followed in 2001 by a complete, unedited print.\nA complete print of Wood's lost 1972 pornographic film \"The Young Marrieds\" was discovered in 2004. It was released by Alpha Blue Archives in July 2014 as a part of the four-DVD set \"The Lost Sex Films of Ed Wood Jr.\".\nWood is said to have filmed some scenes of Lon Chaney Jr. in a werewolf costume in Hollywood in 1964 that were said to have been incorporated into Jerry Warren's film \"Face of the Screaming Werewolf\" (1965). Chaney biographer Don G. Smith however has stated that this story was never substantiated.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10522", "revid": "1893804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10522", "title": "EDIF", "text": "EDIF (Electronic Design Interchange Format) is a vendor-neutral format based on S-expressions in which to store electronic netlists and schematics. It was one of the first attempts to establish a neutral data exchange format for the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. The goal was to establish a common format from which the proprietary formats of the EDA systems could be derived. When customers needed to transfer data from one system to another, it was necessary to write translators from one format to other. As the number of formats (\"N\") multiplied, the translator issue became an \"N\"-squared problem. The expectation was that with EDIF the number of translators could be reduced to the number of involved systems.\nRepresentatives of the EDA companies Daisy Systems, Mentor Graphics, Motorola, National Semiconductor, Tektronix, Texas Instruments and the University of California, Berkeley established the \"EDIF Steering Committee\" in November 1983. Later Hilary Kahn, a computer science professor at the University of Manchester, joined the team and led the development from version EDIF 2 0 0 till the final version 4 0 0.\nSyntax.\nThe general format of EDIF involves using parentheses to delimit data definitions, and in this way it superficially resembles Lisp. The basic tokens of EDIF 2.0.0 were keywords (like \"library\", \"cell\", \"instance\", etc.), strings (delimited with double quotes), integer numbers, symbolic constants (e.g. \"GENERIC\", \"TIE\", \"RIPPER\" for cell types) and \"Identifiers\", which are reference labels formed from a very restricted set of characters. \nEDIF 3.0.0 and 4.0.0 dropped the symbolic constants entirely, using keywords instead.\nSo, the syntax of EDIF has a fairly simple foundation. A typical EDIF file looks like this: \n (edifLevel 0) (keywordMap (keywordLevel 0))\n (status (written (timeStamp 1995 1 1 1 1 1) (program \"xxx\" (version \"v1\"))))\n (library xxx (edifLevel 0)\n (technology (numberDefinition (scale 1 (e 1 -6) (unit distance))))\n (cell dff_4 (cellType generic)\n (view view1 (viewType netlist)\n (interface\n (port aset (direction INPUT))\n (port clok (direction INPUT))\n (cell yyy (cellType generic)\n (view schematic_ (viewType netlist)\n (interface\n (port CLEAR (direction INPUT))\n (port CLOCK (direction INPUT)) ... )\n (contents\n (instance I_36_1 (viewRef view1 (cellRef dff_4)))\n (instance (rename I_36_3 \"I$3\") (viewRef view1 (cellRef addsub_4)))\n (net CLEAR\n (joined\n (portRef CLEAR)\n (portRef aset (instanceRef I_36_1))\n (portRef aset (instanceRef I_36_3))))\nRevision history.\nEDIF Version 1 0 0 in 1985\nEDIF Version 1 1 0 in 1986\nEDIF 2 0 0.\nThe first \"real\" public release of EDIF was version 2 0 0, which was approved in March 1988 as the standard ANSI/EIA-548-1988. It is published in a single volume. This version has no formal scope statement but what it tries to capture is covered by the defined viewTypes:\nThe industry tested this release for several years, but finally only the NETLIST view was the one widely used and some EDA tools are still supporting it today for EDIF 2 0 0.\nTo overcome problems with the main 2 0 0 standard several further documents got released:\nEDIF 2 9 0.\nReleased on 15 September 1992.\nEDIF 3 0 0.\nBecause of some fundamental weaknesses in the 2 0 0 release a new not compatible release 3 0 0 was released in September 1993, given the designation of EIA standard EIA-618. It later achieved ANSI and ISO designations. It is published in 4 volumes. The main focus of this version were the viewTypes NETLIST and SCHEMATIC from 2 0 0. MASKLAYOUT, PCBLAYOUT and some other views were dropped from this release and shifted for later releases because the work for these views was not fully completed.\nEDIF 3 0 0 is available from the International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 61690-1\nEDIF 4 0 0.\nEDIF 4 0 0 was released in late August 1996, mainly to add \"Printed Circuit Board\" extensions (the original PCBLAYOUT view) to EDIF 3 0 0. This more than doubled the size of EDIF 3 0 0, and is published in HTML format on CD.\nEDIF 4 0 0 is available from the International Electrotechnical Commission as IEC 61690-2\nEvolution.\nProblems with 2 0 0.\nTo understand the problems users and vendors encountered with EDIF 2 0 0, one first has to picture all the elements and dynamics of the electronics industry. The people who needed this standard were mainly design engineers, who worked for companies whose size ranged from a house garage to multi-billion dollar facilities with thousands of engineers. These engineers worked mainly from schematics and netlists in the late 1980s, and the big push was to generate the netlists from the schematics automatically. The first suppliers were Electronic Design Automation vendors (e.g., Daisy, Mentor, and Valid formed the earliest predominating set). These companies competed vigorously for their shares of this market.\nOne of the tactics used by these companies to \"capture\" their customers was their proprietary databases. Each had special features that the others did not. Once a decision was made to use a particular vendor's software to enter a design, the customer was ever after constrained to use no other software. To move from vendor A's to vendor B's systems usually meant a very expensive re-entry of almost all design data by hand into the new system. This expense of \"migration\" was the main factor that locked design engineers into using a single vendor.\nBut the \"customers\" had a different desire. They saw immediately that while vendor A might have a really nice analog simulation environment, vendor B had a much better PCB or silicon layout auto-router. And they wished that they could pick and choose amongst the different vendors.\nEDIF was mainly supported by the electronics design end-users, and their companies. The EDA vendors were involved also, but their motivation was more along the lines of wanting to not alienate their customers. Most of the EDA vendors produced EDIF 2 0 0 translators, but they were definitely more interested in generating high-quality EDIF readers, and they had absolutely no motivation at all to write any software that generated EDIF (an EDIF Writer), beyond threats from customers of mass migration to another vendor's software.\nThe result was rather interesting. Hardly any software vendor wrote EDIF 2 0 0 output that did not have severe violations of syntax or semantics. The semantics were just loose enough that there might be several ways to describe the same data. This began to be known as \"flavors\" of EDIF. The vendor companies did not always feel it important to allocate many resources to EDIF products, even if they sold a large number of them. There were several stories of active products with virtually no-one to maintain them for years. User complaints were merely gathered and prioritized. The harder it became to export customer data to EDIF, the more the vendors seemed to like it. Those who did write EDIF translators found they spent a huge amount of time and effort on generating sufficiently powerful, forgiving, artificially intelligent readers, that could handle and piece together the poor-quality code produced by the extant EDIF 2 0 0 writers of the day.\nIn designing EDIF 3 0 0, the committees were well aware of the faults of the language, the calumny heaped on EDIF 2 0 0 by the vendors and the frustration of the end users. So, to tighten the semantics of the language, and provide a more formal description of the standard, the revolutionary approach was taken to provide an information model for EDIF, in the information modeling language EXPRESS. This helped to better document the standard, but was done more as an afterthought, as the syntax crafting was done independently of the model, instead of being generated from the model. Also, even though the standard says that if the syntax and model disagree, the model is the standard, this is not the case in practice. The BNF description of the syntax is the foundation of the language inasmuch as the software that does the day-to-day work of producing design descriptions is based on a fixed syntax. The information model also suffered from the fact that it was not (and is not) ideally suited to describing EDIF. It does not describe such concepts as name spaces very well at all, and the differences between a definition and a reference is not clearly describable either. Also, the constructs in EXPRESS for describing constraints might be formal, but constraint description is a fairly complicated matter at times. So, most constraints ended up just being described as comments. Most of the others became elaborate formal descriptions which most readers will never be able to decipher, and therefore may not stand up to automated debugging/compiling, just as a program might look good in review, but a compiler might find some interesting errors, and actually running the program written might find even more interesting errors. (Additionally, analogous EXPRESS compilers/executors didn't exist when the standard was written, and may not still exist today!)\nSolutions to EDIF 2 0 0 problems.\nThe solution to the \"flavor\" problem of EDIF 2 0 0 was to develop a more specific semantic description in EDIF 3 0 0 (1993). Indeed, reported results of people generating EDIF 3 0 0 translators was that the writers were now \"much\" more difficult to get right, due to the great number of semantic restrictions, and the readers are comparatively trivial to develop.\nThe solution to vendor \"conflict of interest\" was neutral third-party companies, who could provide EDIF products based on vendor interfaces. This separation of the EDIF products from direct vendor control was critical to providing the end-user community with tools that worked well. It formed naturally and without comment. Engineering DataXpress was perhaps the first such company in this realm, with Electronic Tools Company seeming to have captured the market in the mid to late 1990s. Another dynamic in this industry is EDIF itself. Since they have grown to a rather large size, generating readers and writers has become a very expensive proposition. Usually the third-party companies have congregated the necessary specialists and can use this expertise to more efficiently generate the software. They are also able to leverage code sharing and other techniques an individual vendor could not. By 2000, almost no major vendor produced its own EDIF tools, choosing instead to OEM third-party tools.\nSince the release of EDIF 4 0 0, the entire EDIF standards organisation has essentially dissolved. There have been no published meetings of any of the technical subcommittees, the EDIF Experts group, etc. Most of the individuals involved have moved on to other companies or efforts. The newsletter was abandoned, and the Users' Group no longer holds yearly meetings. EDIF 3 0 0 and 4 0 0 are now ANSI, IEC and European (EN) standards. EDIF Version 3 0 0 is IEC/EN 61690-1, and EDIF Version 4 0 0 is IEC/EN 61690-2."}

{"id": "10528", "revid": "2164108", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10528", "title": "Essential tremor", "text": "Movement disorder that causes involuntary tremors\nMedical condition&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Infobox/styles-images.css\" /&gt;\nEssential tremor (ET), also called benign tremor, familial tremor, and idiopathic tremor, is a medical condition characterized by involuntary rhythmic contractions and relaxations (oscillations or twitching movements) of certain muscle groups in one or more body parts of unknown cause. It is typically symmetrical, and affects the arms, hands, or fingers; but sometimes involves the head, vocal cords, or other body parts. Essential tremor is either an \"action\" (intention) tremor\u2014it intensifies when one tries to use the affected muscles during voluntary movements such as eating and writing\u2014or it is a \"postural\" tremor, which occurs when holding arms outstretched and against gravity. This means that it is distinct from a resting tremor, such as that caused by Parkinson's disease, which is not correlated with movement. Unlike Parkinson's disease, essential tremor may worsen with action.\nEssential tremor is a progressive neurological disorder, and the most common movement disorder. Though not life-threatening, it can certainly be debilitating. Its onset is usually between 40 and 50 years of age, but it can occur at any age. The cause is poorly understood. Diagnosis is made by observing the typical pattern of the tremor coupled with the exclusion of known causes of such a tremor. There is currently no medical test available to identify an essential tremor.\nWhile essential tremor is distinct from Parkinson's disease, which causes a resting tremor, essential tremor is nevertheless sometimes misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease. Some patients have been found to have both essential tremors and resting tremors.\nTreatments for essential tremor include medications, typically given sequentially to determine which provides the most efficacy with least side effects. \"Clostridium botulinum\" toxin (Botox) injections and ultrasound are also sometimes used for cases refractory to medications.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe tremors linked with essential tremor are generally action tremors, which means they occur during intentional movements rather than when the body is at rest.\nIn mild cases, ET can manifest as the inability to stop the tongue or hands from shaking, the ability to sing only in vibrato, and difficulty doing small, precise tasks such as threading a needle. Even simple tasks such as cutting in a straight line or using a ruler can range from difficult to impossible, depending on the severity of the condition. In disabling cases, ET can interfere with a person's activities of daily living, including feeding, dressing, and taking care of personal hygiene. Essential tremor generally presents as a rhythmic tremor (4\u201312 Hz) that occurs only when the affected muscle is exerting effort. Any sort of physical or mental stress tends to make the tremor worse.\nThe tremor may also occur in the head (neck), jaw, and voice, as well as other body regions, with the general pattern being that the tremor begins in the arms and then spreads to these other regions in some people. Women are more likely to develop the head tremor than are men, and it is also found to be more severe in women than men. In people with essential tremor (ET), the head tremor can be either vertical (\"yes-yes\") or horizontal (\"no-no\") and is typically accompanied by tremors in the hands or voice. Other types of tremor may also occur, including postural tremor of the outstretched arms, intention tremor of the arms, and rest tremor in the arms. In one study, men had more severe postural hand tremor when compared to women. Some people may have unsteadiness and problems with gait and balance. Abnormal tandem gait was more commonly observed in older ET people and those with more than 5 years of disease duration.\nET-related tremors do not occur during sleep, but people with ET sometimes complain of an especially coarse tremor upon awakening that becomes noticeably less coarse within the first few minutes of wakefulness. Tremor and disease activity can intensify in response to fatigue, strong emotions, low blood sugar, extreme cold and heat, caffeine, lithium salts, some antidepressants, stress, and other factors.\nParkinson's disease and parkinsonism can also occur simultaneously with ET. The degree of tremor, rigidity, and functional disability did not differ from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Hand tremor predominated (as it did in Parkinson's disease), and occurred in nearly all cases, followed by head tremor, voice tremor, neck, face, leg, tongue, and trunk tremor. Most other tremors occurred in association with hand tremor. More severe tremors, a lower sleep disorder frequency, and a similar prevalence of other non-motor symptoms also can occur. A non-motor feature such as hearing impairment has been shown to have higher prevalence in those with ET compared with those that are healthy or with Parkinson's. Cochlear pathologies which affect the inner ear are proposed as the potential cause, but there is still insufficient information regarding retrocochlear pathologies (affects central or neural nerve) and central auditory processing.\nWalking difficulties in essential tremor are common. About half of patients have associated dystonia, including cervical dystonia, writer's cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and cranial dystonia, and 20% of the patients had associated parkinsonism. Olfactory dysfunction (loss of sense of smell) is common in Parkinson's disease, and has also been reported to occur in patients with essential tremor. A number of patients with essential tremor also exhibit many of the same neuropsychiatric disturbances seen in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The similarity in characteristics between parkinsonism and essential tremor can make it difficult to distinguish between the two at times.\nEssential tremor with tremor onset after the age of 65 has been associated with mild cognitive impairment, as well as dementia, although the link between these conditions, if any, is still not understood. Familial cases of ET tend to present at younger ages, whereas older ages of onset are linked to faster progression of the disease.\nEssential tremor has two tremor components, central and peripheral. These two tremor components were identified by measuring the tremor of ET patients once with no weights on their hands and then with 1-pound weights on their hands. The addition of the weights resulted in a tremor spectrum with two peaks, one that maintained the same frequency (the central tremor) and one that decreased in frequency (the peripheral tremor). Only with the addition of the weights was the peripheral tremor distinguishable from the central tremor.\nThe frequency of essential tremor is 4 to 12\u00a0Hz, depending on which body segment is affected. Previously, it was 4 to 11\u00a0Hz according to the American Family Physician on Classification of Tremors and Treatment Update. Proximal segments are affected at lower frequencies, and distal segments are affected at higher frequencies.\nCause.\nEssential tremor was once thought to be a single disease state, however, research shows that there are multiple factors that are associated with causing essential tremor. This leads to the consideration that essential tremor is more akin to a family of diseases, due to the presence of both genetic (familial) and sporadic essential tremors. Currently, there are multiple main hypotheses behind essential tremor, being the degeneration of the cerebellum, inheriting the tremor, ingestion of toxins, or the presence of Lewy Bodies in the brainstem. However, \"post mortem\" studies showed that only a small number of patients had Lewy Bodies, and was more common for patients not to exhibit them.\nCerebellar\nIt is unknown how the degeneration of the cerebellum leads to essential tremor, however, it is hypothesized that it may be due to the loss of Purkinje cells, as they release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter meant to control the firing of neurons in the cerebellum. In certain essential tremor clinical studies which augment the GABA pathway, only some participants exhibited a reduction of tremor. Some patients have responded to alcohol, claiming alcohol has reduced the tremor, however the reduction is only short term. However, alcohol might only be beneficial for those with an impacted GABA pathway, and may not be benefit patients who developed the tremor via other pathways.\nGenetic.\nThe main underlying cause of essential tremor is not clear, but many cases seem to be familial. About half of the cases are due to a genetic mutation and the pattern of inheritance is most consistent with autosomal dominant transmission, meaning patients with essential tremor have around a 50% chance to pass it on to their children. There are multiple gene mutations and presentations on various chromosomes that lead to essential tremor. These include genes present on chromosomes 1\u20133, 6, 11, and 16. Each presentation or mutation of different genes were associated with families from different regions. For example, presentation of a gene associated with essential tremor on chromosome 6 has been noted in North American families, while a Canadian family was noted with mutations in the fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) gene. Other mutations in genes such as the HTRA Serine Peptidase 2 (HTRA2) and the teneurin transmembrane protein 4 (TENM4), have been observed in a Turkish family and the Spanish population respectively. Recent \"post mortem\" studies have displayed alterations in the leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing protein 1 (\"LINGO1\") gene and GABA receptors in the cerebellum of people with essential tremor. \"HAPT1 \"mutations have also been linked to ET, as well as to Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.\nPoisons and toxins.\nSome environmental poisons, including toxins, are also under active investigation, as they may play a role in the disease's cause. Exposure to heavy metals, specifically lead, has been associated with causation of ET. Lead is a heavy metal that can cross the central nervous system's (CNS) main line of defense, the blood\u2013brain barrier, even increasing its permeability, allowing other harmful substances to access the CNS. This allows lead access to the CNS, permitting it to disturb processes that utilize calcium, including synaptic activity, and causes intracellular disruption, both of which may lead to irreversible damage to the CNS. This would include cerebellar damage which could cause ET. There are other poisons that work in a similar manner to lead such as other heavy metals like mercury and aluminum, as well as toxic chemicals like certain pesticides and alcohol. In particular, excessive alcohol consumption can worsen essential tremor due to damage to the cerebellum.\nPathophysiology.\nEssential tremor is one of the most prevalent and poorly-understood neurological disorders. Clinical, physiological and imaging studies point to involvement of the cerebellum and/or cerebellothalamocortical circuits. The traditional model for essential tremor, the olivary hypothesis, suggests that ET is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the inferior olivary nucleus. This activity makes neurons fire in a regular, synchronized way, which then disrupts signals to the cerebellum and leads to tremors. However, recent studies, especially those examining brain tissue, propose a new hypothesis that ET may be a neurodegenerative disease focused in the cerebellum, differing from the old theory. Changes in the cerebellum could also be mediated by alcoholic beverage consumption. Purkinje cells are especially susceptible to ethanol excitotoxicity. Impairment of Purkinje synapses is a component of cerebellar degradation that could underlie essential tremor. Some cases have Lewy bodies in the locus ceruleus. ET cases that progress to Parkinson's disease are less likely to have had cerebellar problems. Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that the efficiency of the overall brain functional network in ET is disrupted.\nIn 2012, the National Toxicology Program concluded that sufficient evidence exists of an association between blood lead exposure at levels &gt;10 \u03bcg/dl and essential tremor in adults, and limited evidence at blood lead levels &gt;5 \u03bcg/dl.\nDiagnosis.\nUsually, the diagnosis is established on clinical grounds. Although ET was long considered a single-symptom illness, recent studies have shown that some patients also experience other additional motor symptoms and non-motor features. According to recent medical literature, besides isolated essential tremor, there are two additional classifications: 'ET plus' and 'ET-PD.' 'ET plus' is diagnosed when patients show cognitive impairments or other motor symptoms like ataxia, dystonia, or resting tremor. 'ET-PD' is used for those who meet the criteria for both ET and Parkinson's disease. The clinical features of tremor in a patient include medical history (such as age of onset, family history, progression over time, and exposure to drugs or toxins), tremor characteristics (like which parts of the body are affected, when the tremor occurs, and its frequency), and any associated signs (such as signs of systemic illness, neurological signs, and soft signs). For some types of tremors, additional tests like recording tremor frequency, imaging for lesions, receptor imaging, and biomarkers in blood or tissue may help identify the cause. Tremors can start at any age, from birth through advanced ages (senile tremor). Any voluntary muscle in the body may be affected, although the tremor is most commonly seen in the hands and arms and slightly less commonly in the neck (causing the person's head to shake), tongue, and legs. A resting tremor of the hands is sometimes present. Tremor occurring in the legs might be diagnosable as orthostatic tremor. Tremors in the lower limbs are quite rare in ET and are more likely to indicate Parkinson's disease.\nET occurs within multiple neurological disorders besides Parkinson's disease. This includes migraine disorders, where co-occurrences between ET and migraines have been examined.\nTreatment.\nTreatment approaches.\nCurrently, most treatments and therapies available for essential tremors are only treating symptoms since there is no cure available. Medical treatments for tremors are based on shared decisions between patients and their providers. The choices of treatments depended on tremor severity, affected body parts, and the impacts of tremor on the patient's physical, psychological, and quality of life. People with mild tremors that do not interfere with daily activities and psychological well-being do not require pharmacological treatments. People with persistent tremors which impact daily functions and social interactions should be treated with the appropriate pharmacological therapies.\nNon-pharmacological Treatment.\n\"Focused Ultrasound\" is a treatment that was approved for coverage in the U.S. in 2022 for those with Medicare insurance. Totally non-surgical, the treatment process is performed on a conscious patient and takes 2 to 3 hours.\nThe first approach in helping people to improve tremor symptoms is the discontinuation of triggering and exacerbating factors like medications including certain antidepressants, anti-epileptics, beta-agonists; or substances like caffeine. In addition, getting adequate sleep and utilizing relaxation techniques can also help improve and reduce tremor symptoms in individuals who reported an increase in tremors following physical activities.\nSince tremors can affect different parts of the body (like limbs, head, chin/jaw, and vocal), different non-pharmacological therapeutic techniques are available that can support patients with the management of tremors including occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychotherapy. Occupational therapy provides support to help people manage everyday tasks more easily through different approaches and interventions. Speech therapy is helpful in people with vocal tremor to help manage and maintain the vocal changes associated with tremor symptoms. Psychological impacts like embarrassment and anxiety are also important concerns of many people with ET which can lead to social isolation and depression. Psychotherapy can be very beneficial and play a key role in helping to improve the mental health of people with ET.\nAlcohol.\nAlcohol had been known to help provide short-term relief of tremor symptoms in some people; however, the therapeutic effects of alcohol on ET had not been studied in many clinical trials. It has been proposed that alcohol can help reduce tremors through the agonism mechanism of the gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAergic. Since GABA can decrease neural activity, it is believed that alcohol can increase the activity of GABA which then can reduce involuntary muscle movements or tremors. However, the duration of action of alcohol on ET is around 3\u20134 hours, alcohol also had been associated with the rebound of tremor, not to mention the risk of development of long-term alcohol consumption and abuse. The use of alcohol as a possible treatment for ET is not recommended by healthcare providers.\nPharmacological treatments.\nCurrently, the available pharmacological therapy options for ET are Beta-adrenergic blockers, Anticonvulsants, Benzodiazepines/GABAergic agents, Calcium channel blockers, and Atypical neuroleptic agents. The two most effective medications which had been approved by the FDA as first line agents for the treatment of ET are propranolol and primidone.\nBeta-adrenergic Blockers.\nWhen symptoms are sufficiently troublesome to warrant treatment, the first choice medication is propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, which has been shown effective in reducing tremor by 70% in 50% of patients in clinical studies. Based on the guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the Italian Movement Disorders Association, propranolol is most effective in limb tremors, also there is little to no effect on head tremors. The recommended doses of propranolol range from 60 to 360\u00a0mg daily, and it is based on the patient's specific factors. The commonly reported side effects of propranolol are bradycardia, bronchospasm, fatigue, and hypotension. In patients that have contraindicated comorbidities to propranolol, other beta-blockers such as Atenolol, pindolol, Sotalol, and nadolol have shown some potential efficacy, but they are not very well studied and have limited evidence in their efficacy on the treatment of ET.\nAnticonvulsants.\nPrimidone is another first line agent recommended in the treatment of ET. Primidone is an anticonvulsant which metabolized into phenobarbital and phenylethymalnonamide. This medication has shown the same beneficial effects in reducing tremors as propranolol and is recommended for use based on guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology and the MDS Task Force on Tremor. The initial dose of primidone is recommended at 25\u00a0mg per day and should be increased up to the maximum dose of 250\u00a0mg per day. This strategy was recommended to help avoid the possible side effects of nausea, vomiting, and excessive sedation of primidone. Primidone is the preferred medication for the treatment of ET in the geriatric population compared to propranolol. In addition, Combination therapy of both Propranolol and Primidone is recommended for people who do not show benefits from either propranolol or primidone as monotherapy.\nTopiramate is an antiepileptic medication which had been studied to assess the efficacy and safety in the treatment of ET. Overall, it is considered a second-line therapy alone or in combination with other medications when first-line treatments fail to show improvement or medication intolerance. Topiramate has been shown effective in reducing limb tremors at the maximum dose of 200\u00a0mg, however, there was a higher risk for the development of adverse effects including weight loss, anorexia, cognitive impairment, and kidney stones.\nOther second-line medications.\nAdditional medications that have been reported to show efficacy in treating ET are gabapentin, benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, clonazepam, and zonisamide, and pregabalin. However, most of the medications have limited evidence-based to support their clinical usage as treatments for ET. Some systematic reviews of medications for the treatment of ET have been conducted. A 2017 review of topiramate found limited data and low-quality evidence to support its efficacy and the occurrence of treatment-limiting adverse effects, a 2017 review of zonisamide found insufficient information to assess efficacy and safety, and a 2016 review of pregabalin determined the effects to be uncertain due to the low quality of evidence.\nBotulinum Toxin (BoNT).\nBotulinum toxin is a neurotoxin produced by a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria called Clostridium botulinum. BoNT works by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the presynaptic terminal by inactivating the SNARE proteins (SNAP-25), which interfere with muscle contraction. BoNT type A injections have shown benefits in several clinical trials for the treatments of limb, voice, and head. However, the associated side effects included muscle weakness, stiffness reported within studies of limb tremors, and neck muscle pain, weakness, and dysphagia in clinical trials of head tremors. Botulinum toxin type A has been found to be helpful in treating voice tremors.\nAdditional procedures.\nUltrasound.\nAdditionally, MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound is a nonsurgical treatment option for people with essential tremor who are medication refractory. MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound does not achieve healing, but can improve the quality of life by reducing the tremor manifestation. While its long-term effects are not yet established, the improvement in tremor score from baseline was durable at 1 year and 2 years following the treatment. To date, reported adverse events and side effects have been mild to moderate. Possible adverse events include gait difficulties, balance disturbances, paresthesias, headache, skin burns with ulcerations, skin retraction, scars, and blood clots. This procedure is contraindicated in pregnant women, persons who have non-MRI compatible implanted metallic devices, allergy to MR contrast agents, cerebrovascular disease, abnormal bleeding, hemorrhage and/or blood clotting disorders, advanced kidney disease or on dialysis, heart conditions, severe hypertension, and ethanol or substance abuse, among others. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Insightec's Exablate Neuro system to treat essential tremor in 2016.\nDeep Brain Stimulation (DBS).\nAnother invasive surgical treatment of essential tremor is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS is a surgical procedure that involves the placement of a permanent electrode with 4-8 contacts within the brain with connecting wires connected to a pulse stimulator implanted near the patient's collarbone. In the treatment of tremor, the electrodes are placed in the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus.\nThe pulse stimulator delivers constant electrical pulses to the target area, which interfere with activity of the target area, which has been shown to improve tremor symptoms. At one year following the surgical intervention with DBS, patients showed 66% improvement and 48% improvement at 10 years. DBS is considered an effective surgical treatment of ET, but there are associated side effects and complications that have been reported with DBS in clinical trials, including imbalance or gait instability, dystonia, paresthesia, hemorrhage.\nElectrical Stimulation of Peripheral Limbs.\nAnother nonsurgical treatment option that has been suggested as a less invasive alternative to DBS is electrically stimulating the peripheral limbs most affected by ET. This stimulation has been explored using different stimulation intensities, either above the motoneuron activation threshold (thus directly activating the muscles in peripheral limbs), or below the motoneuron activation threshold but above the sensory afferent neuron threshold. While electrical stimulation above the activation motoneuron threshold can reduce tremor by up to 73%, it causes muscle fatigue and discomfort. Stimulating below the motoneuron activation threshold on the other hand requires precise timing to counteract the descending pathological neuronal signals driving ET in the peripheral limbs. Thus, while this treatment option shows promise it still requires rigorous investigation.\nPrognosis.\nAlthough essential tremor is often mild, people with severe tremor have difficulty performing many of their routine activities of daily living. ET is generally progressive in most cases (sometimes rapidly, sometimes very slowly), and can be disabling in severe cases.\nEpidemiology.\nEssential tremor (ET) is a common neurological disorder, affecting up to 5% of the global population, with approximately 24.91 million people affected worldwide in 2020. The prevalence of ET increases significantly with age, particularly in individuals aged 60 and above. It affects around 4% of people aged 40 and older, and the prevalence rises to 2.87% in those over 80, reaching up to 20% in individuals in their 90s and beyond. ET is more common in males than females across all age groups.\nFamily history plays a significant role in the development of ET, with around 50% of cases being hereditary and a 90% concordance rate in identical twins. While the likelihood of developing ET increases with age, it can also occur in younger individuals, especially if there is a family history of the disorder. ET is one of the most common types of tremor, aside from enhanced physiological tremor, and is among the most frequently observed movement disorders. Although not all studies show this trend; the majority of studies (70%) indicate that there are no sex differences in prevalence.\nSociety and culture.\nActress Katharine Hepburn (1907\u20132003) had an essential tremor, possibly inherited from her grandfather, that caused her head\u2014and sometimes her hands\u2014to shake. The tremor was noticeable by the time of her performance in the 1979 film \"The Corn Is Green\", when critics mentioned the \"palsy that kept her head trembling\". Hepburn's tremor worsened in her later life.\nCharles M. Schulz, American cartoonist and creator of the \"Peanuts\" comic strip, was affected during the last two decades of his life.\nWest Virginia Senator Robert Byrd also had essential tremor.\nIn 2010, musician Daryl Dragon of The Captain and Tennille was diagnosed with essential tremor; the condition became so severe that he was no longer able to play the keyboards.\nDirector-writer-producer-comedian Adam McKay was diagnosed with essential tremor.\n\"Downton Abbey\" creator Julian Fellowes has the condition, as does Jim Carter the show's character Charlie Carson.\nIn 2022, Matthew Caws of Nada Surf and his son made a PSA called \"Living with a Mild Essential Tremor\".\nResearch.\nHarmaline is a widely used model of essential tremor (ET) in rodents. Harmaline is thought to act primarily on neurons in the inferior olive. Olivocerebellar neurons exhibit rhythmic excitatory action when harmaline is applied locally. Harmane or harmaline has been implicated not only in essential tremors, but is also found in greater quantities in the brain fluid of people with Parkinson's disease and cancer. Higher levels of the neurotoxin are associated with greater severity of the tremors. Harmane is particularly abundant in meats, and certain cooking practices (e.g., long cooking times) increase its concentration, but at least one study has shown that harmane blood concentrations do not go up after meat consumption in ET patients with already elevated harmane levels, whereas the control group's harmane levels increase accordingly, suggesting that another factor, such as a metabolic defect, may be responsible for the higher harmane levels in ET patients.\nCaprylic acid is being researched as a possible treatment for essential tremor. It has currently been approved by the FDA and designated as GRAS, and is used as a food additive and has been studied as part of a ketogenic diet for treatment of epilepsy in children. Research on caprylic acid as a possible treatment for ET began because researchers recognized that ethanol was effective in reducing tremor, and because of this, they looked into longer-chain alcohols reducing tremor. They discovered that 1-octanol reduced tremor and did not have the negative side effects of ethanol. Pharmacokinetic research on 1-octanol lead to the discovery that 1-octanol metabolized into caprylic acid in the body and that caprylic acid actually was the tremor-reducing agent. Many studies of the effects of caprylic acid on essential tremor have been done, including a dose-escalation study on ET patients and a study testing the effects of caprylic acid on central and peripheral tremor. The dose-escalation study examined doses of 8\u00a0mg/kg to 128\u00a0mg/kg and determined that these concentrations were safe with mild side effects. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this study. The study testing the effects of caprylic acid on central and peripheral tremors determined that caprylic acid reduced both.\nTerminology.\nThis type of tremor is often referred to as \"kinetic tremor\". Essential tremor has been known as \"benign essential tremor\", but the adjective \"benign\" has been removed in recognition of the sometimes disabling nature of the disorder.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to the text it was written by Enos, a Nephite prophet. Most scholars believe it to be a 19th century work by Joseph Smith.\nIdentity of Enos.\nAccording to the Book of Mormon, Jacob had a son named \"Enos\" (see Jacob 7:27) and the Book of Enos follows immediately after the Book of Jacob in the manuscripts of the Book of Mormon and all printed editions. (See Jacob 7:27 to Enos 1:1.) However, in the opening verse of the Book of Enos (Enos 1:1), Enos mentions only his \"father\" and does not expressly affirm that his father was Jacob or that his uncle was Nephi. It is a reasonable assumption that Enos was the son of Jacob (of Jacob 7:27); but that relationship is not established in the text.\nGiven the issues that have been debated about how it could have been fully 179 years between the time when Lehi (and Nephi) left Jerusalem and when Enos \"began to be old\" (Enos 1:25) and was \"soon\" to \"go to the place of [his] rest\" (Enos 1:27), it is possible either that Jacob and Enos each lived to about 95 years of age, with Jacob fathering Enos late in life, or that Jacob had one son named Enos (as stated in Jacob 7:27) and yet that the Enos of the Book of Enos was another Enos altogether, perhaps, for example, a grandson or even great-grandson of Jacob. The identity of Enos of the Book of Enos is not necessarily established as the son of Jacob and grandson of Lehi and Sariah. Clearly, however, Enos's ancestry leads directly to Lehi and Sariah through Jacob.\nSummary of the Book of Enos.\nThis short book consists of a single chapter, relating Enos' conversion after praying all day and all night, following with his subsequent dialogue with the Lord. It also discusses the redemption of the Nephites and their enemies, the Lamanites, and contains prophecies of future Nephite and Lamanite generations. Additionally, it contains descriptions of the Lamanites. The style of Enos resembles that of Erich Auerbach in his \"\" and that of Nephi, Enos's ancestor and the Book of Mormon's opening narrator.\nNarrative.\nEnos hunts in the woods and remembers the gospel that his father taught him; as a result, he kneels and cries all day and during the night for the salvation of his soul. Then the voice of God tells Enos that he is forgiven of his sins. Enos believes the voice, but he wonders how the forgiveness is actually accomplished. In response, God explains that Enos is forgiven because he has faith in Jesus Christ, even though he has never seen or heard Christ.\nEnos then prays for the salvation of the Nephites, but God says they will be blessed or punished according to their obedience. Enos, fearing that the Nephites will refuse to obey the commandments of God, then prays for the Lamanites who oppress them; he asks God for the Lamanites' preservation. Additionally, he prays that God will preserve a record of the Nephites so that someday the Lamanites too might be brought to salvation. Only faith in Christ will save them, but God makes a covenant with Enos that he will bring the records of the Nephites to the Lamanites in due time.\nAfter this experience, Enos takes up the mantle of prophet and preaches among the Nephites, fearing their destruction. In the record, Enos does not say whether he is successful at converting the Nephites, but he does say the Nephites fail to convert the Lamanites. Before Enos dies he gives the records to his son Jarom.\nPortrayal of Lamanites.\nThroughout the narrative, Enos characterizes the Lamanites as possessing an unmoving hatred. According to Enos, the Lamanites become a wild, idolatrous, and bloodthirsty people, eating predatory animals. They live in tents, wander around in the wilderness, wear loincloths, shave their heads, and often eat raw meat. Enos explains that they are skilled with bows, cimeters, and axes and continually seek to destroy the Nephites.\nFatimah Salleh and Margaret Olsen Hemming noticed that Enos implies that Lamanite practices, like eating raw meat, connote corruption, even though the same behavior had no negative connotations earlier in the Book of Mormon when the Nephites and Lamanites were still one people. Thus, Enos demonstrates \"writer's bias.\" Hemming and Salleh concluded that Enos's criticism of the Lamanites is based more on prejudice and what is culturally acceptable to the Nephite rather than based on a charge from God.\nBook of Enos interpretation.\nEnos begins his account in a manner that is similar to Nephi's: he mentions parental influence, passed on through religious counsel. The narrative not only begins with this but also ends with it. A difference from the style of Nephi is that Enos does not quote scripture in his narrative. Terryl L. Givens also argues that Enos' intended literary audience leans toward the Lamanites, as the Nephites will eventually be destroyed.\nAccording to author Dennis Largey, the style of the Book of Enos implies that Enos did not narrate it over a long period of time but may have narrated it shortly before he died. On another note, literary critic Richard Rust compares the style and syntax of the Book of Enos and that of Erich Auerbach's \"\" account of when Abraham is about to sacrifice Isaac. Specifically, Rust noticed in both accounts similar uses of modifiers as well as \u201cand.\u201d Additionally, Enos fills his narrative with words such as \"wrestling\" that generally appeal to a reader's emotions, says Protestant theologian John Christopher Thomas. The familial and covenantal responsibilities that Enos feels bring a serious but personal flavor into the narrative, according to BYU English professor Sharon J. Harris.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "10530", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10530", "title": "Environmental skepticism", "text": "Skepticism of environmentalism\nEnvironmental skepticism is the belief that statements by environmentalists, and the environmental scientists who support them, are false or exaggerated. The term is also applied to those who are critical of environmentalism in general. It can additionally be defined as doubt about the authenticity or severity of environmental degradation. Environmental skepticism is closely linked with anti-environmentalism and climate change denial. Environmental skepticism can also be the result of cultural and lived experiences.\nAbout.\nEnvironmental skeptics have argued that the extent of harm coming from human activities is less certain than scientists and scientific bodies say, or that it is too soon to be introducing curbs in these activities on the basis of existing evidence, or that further discussion is needed regarding who should pay for such environmental initiatives. One of the themes the movement focuses on is the idea that environmentalism is a growing threat to social and economic progress and the civil liberties.\nThe popularity of the term was enhanced by Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg's 2001 book \"The Skeptical Environmentalist\". Lomborg approached environmental claims from a statistical and economic standpoint, and concluded that often the claims made by environmentalists were overstated. Lomborg argued, on the basis of cost\u2013benefit analysis, that few environmentalist claims warranted serious concern. The book came under criticism by scientists noting that Lomborg misinterpreted or misrepresented data, criticized misuse of data while committing similar mistakes himself, examined issues supporting his thesis while ignoring information contrary to it, cherry picks literature, oversimplifies, fails to discuss uncertainty or subjectivity, cites mostly media sources, and largely ignores ecology.\nMichael Shermer, who debated Lomborg on several topics from his book, notes that despite the scientific consensus many people are driven to environmental skepticism by the extremism inherent in both sides of the debate and not having been exposed to a sufficiently succinct and visual presentation of the available evidence.\nIn 2010, Lomborg refined his position and stated that he believes in the need for \"tens of billions of dollars a year to be invested in tackling climate change\" and declared global warming to be \"undoubtedly one of the chief concerns facing the world today\" and \"a challenge humanity must confront\". He summarized his position, saying \"Global warming is real - it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.\"\nA 2014 study of individuals from 32 countries found that environmental skepticism stems from insufficient education, self-assessed knowledge, religious/conservative values, lack of trust in society, mistrust of science, and other concerns trumping environmental concern.\nClimate change skepticism.\nAccording to an annual poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, global warming has been a low public priority, ranking 29 out of 30 in the top priorities for the United States President and Congress. Additionally, in a list of 20 policy priorities, it ranks 19th.\nClimate skeptics represent about a third of Americans according to national polls. This number makes it challenging for decision-makers who hesitate to implement environmental policies related to global warming and climate change. Anthony Leiserowitz, a professor from Yale, determined that the American community's attitude towards climate change fall on a scale from concerned or alarmed to disengaged or dismissive. The term climate skeptic is made up of numerous components such as dubious, doubtful, dismissive, and denial. It does not describe simply a non-believer. In a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 61% of the public believed there was evidence of global warming. However, 35% of the public still believed there was no significant evidence for global temperature rise.\nClimate skepticism is considered to be strictly an American belief constructed of governmental fear, scientific distrust, and interests in resource extraction that support a dominant Western lifestyle. Academics argue that we need to understand Americans underlying ideologies before we denote someone as a skeptic.\nA cultural study on Maryland's Eastern Shore helped discern some of the differing beliefs of Americans about environmental change. The study included three groups of residents who are dependent on the Eastern Shore of Maryland: commercial fishermen, farmers, and recent migrants. The research conducted was determined to gain a consensus of shared knowledge between the subgroups in regard to the changing environment. Along the scale from denial to concerned, it was found that a majority of respondents noticed climate change but believed that humans were not the cause of it. About a third of the respondents were unaware of it, while the rest of the interlocutors were either dismissive of it or somewhat concerned.\nOne of the cultural models found in this research was that climate change was natural. The respondents interpreted the changes such as rising sea-levels and drought as cycles of nature. They explained them as natural processes in the Earth's evolution not affected by humans. They expressed doubt about human induced climate change but acknowledged the changing environment around them. The residents of the Eastern Shore question the legitimacy of the buildup of greenhouse gases from our use of fossil fuels, which cause sea level rise or glacial melting. Part of this hesitation comes from the knowledge passed down through their families and the stories of weather cycles from previous relatives, all who lived in the same area for generations. This concept of nature going through cycles is culturally significant to the groups living in the area.\nThe respondents also make note that climate change may have been newly identified by scientists but has been a phenomenon that has been with us from the beginning of time and not with the onset of the industrial revolution. This reinforces the belief that climate change is happening, just not because of humans. Therefore, when contemporary theories of climate change challenge respondents\u2019 longstanding traditional cultural models, the latter tends to emerge as the more likely outcome.\nThe respondents also believe that if climate change becomes apparent to politicians as a human-induced problem, that will lead to regulations being placed on them. They do not believe that climate policies will benefit them and are therefore unlikely to support such programs. They are concerned more with policies and regulations rather than climate change in the area. They see themselves as living with the climate instead of the common approach of overcoming or conquering it. Living with the climate is viewed as nature and society being connected and sharing a relationship where humans must change their activities to fit the changing climate.\nCommunicating with people who are labeled as skeptics can help create policies that may not be rejected. These beliefs are deeply rooted in longstanding traditions and not influenced by right wing think tanks or other media platforms. Therefore, communicating and working with these people may help reduce the amount of time it will take for policies to be accepted and approved by them. For policy makers to be effective, they should consider the knowledge that these people have and work with them instead of imposing a top-down approach for climate change policy.\nCriticism.\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", such widespread skeptical doubts have not developed independently, but have been \"encouraged by lobbying and PR campaigns financed by the polluting industries\". Supporters of environmentalists argue that \"skepticism\" implies a form of denialism, and that, in the US particularly, \"large donations [have been made] to Senators and Congressmen and [have] sponsored neoliberal think tanks and contrarian scientific research. ExxonMobil, the oil major, has been accused by Friends of the Earth and others of giving millions of dollars to a long list of think-tanks and lobbyists opposed to Kyoto.\"\nA study from 2008 showed that the overwhelming majority of environmentally skeptical books published since the 1970s were either written or published by authors or institutions affiliated with right-wing think tanks. It concludes that \"scepticism is a tactic of an elite-driven counter-movement designed to combat environmentalism, and that the successful use of this tactic has contributed to the weakening of US commitment to environmental protection.\"\nPeter Jacques wrote, \"The skeptical environmental counter-movement is a civic problem and in dealing with the propositions from the counter-movement we are forced to reach down to the bedrock issues of epistemology, identities, articulation and other core work for politics. To use scientism as a hammer against the screw of skepticism will split the wood of public life into splinters or it will immobilize the hammer. Scientism is a modernist tool that will haplessly reshuffle the old excursions - and we all know the 'master's tools will not dismantle the master's house\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "10553", "revid": "13286072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10553", "title": "Flute", "text": "Woodwind instrument\nThe flute is a member of a family of musical instruments in the woodwind group. Like all woodwinds, flutes are aerophones, producing sound with a vibrating column of air. Flutes produce sound when the player's air flows across an opening. In the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs classification system, flutes are edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the flute is called a flautist or flutist.\nPaleolithic flutes with hand-bored holes are the earliest known identifiable musical instruments. A number of flutes dating to about 53,000 to 45,000 years ago have been found in the Swabian Jura region of present-day Germany, indicating a developed musical tradition from the earliest period of modern human presence in Europe. While the oldest flutes currently known were found in Europe, Asia also has a long history with the instrument. A playable bone flute discovered in China is dated to about 9,000 years ago. The Americas also had an ancient flute culture, with instruments found in Caral, Peru, dating back 5,000 years and in Labrador dating back about 7,500 years.\nThe bamboo flute has a long history, especially in China and India. Flutes have been discovered in historical records and artworks starting in the Zhou dynasty (c.1046\u2013256 BC). The oldest written sources reveal the Chinese were using the kuan (a reed instrument) and x\u012bao (an end-blown flute, often of bamboo) in the 12th\u201311th centuries BC, followed by the chi (or ch'ih) in the 9th century BC and the y\u00fceh in the 8th century BC. Of these, the bamboo chi is the oldest documented transverse flute.\nMusicologist Curt Sachs called the cross flute (Sanskrit: v\u0101\u1e43\u015b\u012b) \"the outstanding wind instrument of ancient India\", and said that religious artwork depicting \"celestial music\" instruments was linked to music with an \"aristocratic character\". The Indian bamboo cross flute, Bansuri, was sacred to Krishna, who is depicted with the instrument in Hindu art. In India, the cross flute appeared in reliefs from the 1st century AD at Sanchi and Amaravati from the 2nd\u20134th centuries AD.\nAccording to historian Alexander Buchner, there were flutes in Europe in prehistoric times, but they disappeared from the continent until flutes arrived from Asia by way of \"North Africa, Hungary, and Bohemia\". The end-blown flute began to be seen in illustration in the 11th century. Transverse flutes entered Europe through Byzantium and were depicted in Greek art about 800 AD. The transverse flute had spread into Europe by way of Germany, and was known as the German flute.\nEtymology and terminology.\nThe word \"flute\" first appeared in the English language during the Middle English period, as \"floute\", \"flowte\", or \"flo(y)te\", possibly from Old French \"flaute\" and Old Proven\u00e7al \"fla\u00fct\", or possibly from Old French \"fle\u00fcte\", \"fla\u00fcte\", \"flahute\" via Middle High German \"floite\" or Dutch \"fluit\". The English verb \"flout\" has the same linguistic root, and the modern Dutch verb \"fluiten\" still shares the two meanings. Attempts to trace the word back to the Latin \"flare\" (to blow, inflate) have been called \"phonologically impossible\" or \"inadmissable\". The first known use of the word \"flute\" was in the 14th century. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", this was in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Hous of Fame\", c.\u20091380.\nA musician who plays any instrument in the flute family can be called a flutist, flautist, or flute player. \"Flutist\" dates back to at least 1603, the earliest quotation cited by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\". \"Flautist\" was used in 1860 by Nathaniel Hawthorne in \"The Marble Faun\", after being adopted during the 18th century from Italy (\"flautista\", itself from \"flauto\"), like many musical terms in England since the Italian Renaissance. Other English terms, now virtually obsolete, are \"fluter\" (15th\u201319th centuries) and \"flutenist\" (17th and 18th centuries).\nHistory.\nA fragment of a juvenile cave bear's femur, with two to four holes, was found at Divje Babe in Slovenia and dated to about 43,000 years ago. It may be the oldest flute discovered, but this has been disputed. In 2008, a flute dated to at least 35,000 years ago was discovered in Hohle Fels cave near Ulm, Germany. It is a five-holed flute with a V-shaped mouthpiece and was made from a vulture wing bone. The discovery was published in the journal \"Nature\", in August 2009. This was the oldest confirmed musical instrument ever found, until a redating of flutes found in Gei\u00dfenkl\u00f6sterle cave revealed them to be older, at 42,000 to 43,000 years.\nThe Hohle Fels flute is one of several found in the Hohle Fels cavern next to the Venus of Hohle Fels and a short distance from the oldest known human carving. On announcing the discovery, scientists suggested that the \"finds demonstrate the presence of a well-established musical tradition at the time when modern humans colonized Europe\". Scientists have also suggested that this flute's discovery may help to explain \"the probable behavioural and cognitive gulf between\" Neanderthals and early modern human.\nAn 18.7\u00a0cm flute with three holes, made from a mammoth tusk and dated to 30,000\u201337,000 years ago, was found in 2004 in the Gei\u00dfenkl\u00f6sterle cave near Ulm, in the southern German Swabian Alb. Two flutes made from swan bones were excavated a decade earlier from the same cave and dated to about 36,000 years ago.\nA playable 9,000-year-old Chinese Gudi (literally, \"bone flute\") was excavated from a tomb in Jiahu along with 29 similar specimens. They were made from the wing bones of red-crowned cranes and each has five to eight holes.\nThe earliest extant Chinese transverse flute is a \"chi\" (\u7bea) flute discovered in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng at the Suizhou site, Hubei province, China, dating from 433 BC, during the later Zhou dynasty. It is fashioned of lacquered bamboo with closed ends and has five stops on the flute's side instead of the top. \"Shi Jing\", traditionally said to have been compiled and edited by Confucius, mentions chi flutes. \nThe earliest written reference to a flute is from a Sumerian-language cuneiform tablet dated to c. 2600\u20132700 BC.\nFlutes are mentioned in a recently translated tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem whose development spanned the period from about 2100\u2013600 BC. A set of cuneiform tablets knows as the \"\"musical texts\" provide precise tuning instructions for seven scales of a stringed instrument (assumed to be a Babylonian lyre). One of those scales is named \"emb\u016bbum\"\", which is an Akkadian word for \"flute\".\nThe Bible, in Genesis 4:21, cites Jubal as being the \"father of all those who play the \"ugab\" and the \"kinnor\"\". The former Hebrew term is believed by some to refer to a wind instrument, or wind instruments in general, the latter to a stringed instrument, or stringed instruments in general. As such, Jubal is regarded in the Judeo-Christian tradition as the inventor of the flute (a word used in some translations of this biblical passage). In other sections of the Bible (1 Samuel 10:5, 1 Kings 1:40, Isaiah 5:12 and 30:29, and Jeremiah 48:36) the flute is referred to as \"chalil\", from the root word for \"hollow\". Archeological digs in the Holy Land have discovered flutes from the Bronze Age (c. 4000\u20131200 BC) and the Iron Age (1200\u2013586 BC), the latter era \"witness[ing] the creation of the Israelite kingdom and its separation into the two kingdoms of Israel and Judea.\"\nSome early flutes were made out of tibias (shin bones). The flute has also always been an essential part of Indian culture, and the cross flute believed by several accounts to originate in India as Indian literature from 1500 BC has made vague references to the cross flute.\nAcoustics.\nA flute produces sound when a stream of air directed across a hole in the instrument creates a vibration of air at the hole. The airstream creates a Bernoulli or siphon. This excites the air contained in the resonant cavity (usually cylindrical) within the flute. The flutist changes the pitch of the sound produced by opening and closing holes in the body of the instrument, thus changing the effective length of the resonator and its corresponding resonant frequency. By varying the air pressure, a flutist can also change the pitch by causing the air in the flute to resonate at a harmonic rather than the fundamental frequency without opening or closing any of the holes.\nHead joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus among manufacturers on a particular shape. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most critical parameter. Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: the length of the chimney (the hole between the lip-plate and the head tube), chimney diameter, and radii or curvature of the ends of the chimney and any designed restriction in the \"throat\" of the instrument, such as that in the Japanese Nohkan flute.\nA study in which professional flutists were blindfolded could find no significant differences between flutes made from a variety of metals. In two different sets of blind listening, no flute was correctly identified in a first listening, and in a second, only the silver flute was identified. The study concluded that there was \"no evidence that the wall material has any appreciable effect on the sound color or dynamic range\".\nMaterials.\nHistorically, flutes were most commonly made of reed, bamboo, wood, or other organic materials. They were also made of glass, bone, and nephrite. Most modern flutes are made of metal, primarily silver and nickel. Silver is less common than silver alloys. Other materials used for flutes include gold, platinum, grenadilla and copper.\nTypes.\nIn its most basic form, a flute is an open tube which is blown into. After focused study and training, players use controlled air-direction to create an airstream in which the air is aimed downward into the tone hole of the flute's headjoint. There are several broad classes of flutes. With most flutes, the musician blows directly across the edge of the mouthpiece, with 1/4 of their bottom lip covering the embouchure hole. However, some flutes, such as the whistle, gemshorn, flageolet, recorder, tin whistle, tonette, fujara, and ocarina have a duct that directs the air onto the edge (an arrangement that is termed a \"fipple\"). These are known as fipple flutes. The fipple gives the instrument a distinct timbre which is different from non-fipple flutes and makes the instrument easier to play, but takes a degree of control away from the musician.\nAnother division is between side-blown (or transverse) flutes, such as the Western concert flute, piccolo, fife, dizi and bansuri; and end-blown flutes, such as the ney, xiao, kaval, danso, shakuhachi, Anasazi flute and quena. The player of a side-blown flute uses a hole on the side of the tube to produce a tone, instead of blowing on an end of the tube. End-blown flutes should not be confused with fipple flutes such as the recorder, which are also played vertically but have an internal duct to direct the air flow across the edge of the tone hole.\nFlutes may be open at one or both ends. The ocarina, xun, pan pipes, police whistle, and bosun's whistle are closed-ended. Open-ended flutes such as the concert flute and the recorder have more harmonics, and thus more flexibility for the player, and brighter timbres. An organ pipe may be either open or closed, depending on the sound desired.\nFlutes may have any number of pipes or tubes, though one is the most common number. Flutes with multiple resonators may be played one resonator at a time (as is typical with pan pipes) or more than one at a time (as is typical with double flutes).\nFlutes can be played with several different air sources. Conventional flutes are blown with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, are blown by bellows or fans.\nWestern transverse.\nWooden one-keyed.\nUsually starting from d1, wooden transverse flutes were played in European classical music mainly in the period from the early 18th century to the early 19th century. As such, the instrument is often indicated as baroque flute. Gradually marginalized by the Western concert flute in the 19th century, baroque flutes were again played from the late 20th century as part of the historically informed performance practice.\nConcert.\nThe Western concert flute, a descendant of the medieval German flute, is a transverse treble flute that is closed at the top. An \"embouchure hole\" is positioned near the top, and the flutist blows across it. The flute has circular tone holes larger than the finger holes of its baroque predecessors. The size and placement of tone holes, key mechanism, and fingering system used to produce the notes in the flute's range were evolved from 1832 to 1847 by Theobald Boehm, who helped greatly improve the instrument's dynamic range and intonation over its predecessors. With some refinements (and the rare exception of the Kingma system and other custom adapted fingering systems), Western concert flutes typically conform to Boehm's design, known as the Boehm system. Beginner's flutes are made of nickel, silver, or brass that is silver-plated, while professionals use solid silver, gold, and sometimes even platinum flutes. There are also modern wooden-bodied flutes usually with silver or gold keywork. The wood is usually African Blackwood.\nThe standard concert flute is pitched in C and has a range of three octaves starting from middle C or one half step lower when a B foot is attached. This means that the concert flute is one of the highest-pitched common orchestra and concert band instruments.\nConcert variants.\nThe piccolo plays an octave higher than the regular treble flute. Lower members of the flute family include the G alto and C bass flutes that are used occasionally, and are pitched a perfect fourth and an octave below the concert flute, respectively. The contra-alto, contrabass, subcontrabass, double contrabass, and hyperbass flutes are other rare forms of the flute pitched up to four octaves below middle C.\nOther sizes of flutes and piccolos are used from time to time. A rarer instrument of the modern pitching system is the G treble flute. Instruments made according to an older pitch standard, used principally in wind-band music, include D\u266d piccolo, E\u266d soprano flute (Keyed a minor 3rd above the standard C flute), F alto flute, and B\u266d bass flute.\nIndian.\nThe bamboo flute is an important instrument in Indian classical music, and developed independently of the Western flute. The Hindu God Lord Krishna is traditionally considered a master of the bamboo flute. The Indian flutes are very simple compared to the Western counterparts; they are made of bamboo and are keyless.\nTwo main varieties of Indian flutes are currently used. The first, the Bansuri (\u092c\u093e\u0902\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940), has six finger holes and one embouchure hole, and is used predominantly in the Hindustani music of Northern India. The second, the Venu or Pullanguzhal, has eight finger holes, and is played predominantly in the Carnatic music of Southern India. Presently, the eight-holed flute with cross-fingering technique is common among many Carnatic flutists. Prior to this, the South Indian flute had only seven finger holes, with the fingering standard developed by Sharaba Shastri, of the Palladam school, at the beginning of the 20th century.\nThe quality of the flute's sound depends somewhat on the specific bamboo used to make it, and it is generally agreed that the best bamboo grows in the Nagercoil area of South India.\nIn 1998 Bharata Natya Shastra Sarana Chatushtai, Avinash Balkrishna Patwardhan developed a methodology to produce perfectly tuned flutes for the ten 'thatas' currently present in Indian Classical Music.\nIn a regional dialect of Gujarati, a flute is also called Pavo. Some people can also play pair of flutes (Jodiyo Pavo) simultaneously.\nChinese.\nIn China there are many varieties of dizi (\u7b1b\u5b50), or Chinese flute, with different sizes, structures (with or without a resonance membrane) and number of holes (from 6 to 11) and intonations (different keys). Most are made of bamboo, but can come in wood, jade, bone, and iron. One peculiar feature of the Chinese flute is the use of a resonance membrane mounted on one of the holes that vibrates with the air column inside the tube. This membrane is called a \"di mo\", which is usually a thin tissue paper. It gives the flute a bright sound.\nCommonly seen flutes in the modern Chinese orchestra are the bangdi (\u6886\u7b1b), qudi (\u66f2\u7b1b), xindi (\u65b0\u7b1b), and dadi (\u5927\u7b1b). The bamboo flute played vertically is called the xiao (\u7c2b), which is a different category of wind instrument in China.\nKorean.\nThe Korean flute, called the daegeum, \ub300\uae08, is a large bamboo transverse flute used in traditional Korean music. It has a buzzing membrane that gives it a unique timbre.\nJapanese.\nThe Japanese flute, called the fue, (hiragana: ), encompasses a large number of musical flutes from Japan, include the end-blown shakuhachi and hotchiku, as well as the transverse gakubue, komabue, ry\u016bteki, n\u014dkan, shinobue, kagurabue and minteki.\nSodina and suling.\nThe sodina is an end-blown flute found throughout the island state of Madagascar, located in the Indian Ocean off southeastern Africa. One of the oldest instruments on the island, it bears close resemblance to end-blown flutes found in Southeast Asia and particularly Indonesia, where it is known as the \"suling\", suggesting the predecessor to the sodina was carried to Madagascar in outrigger canoes by the island's original settlers emigrating from Borneo. An image of the most celebrated contemporary sodina flutist, Rakoto Frah (d. 2001), was featured on the local currency.\nSring.\nThe sring (also called \"blul\") is a relatively small, end-blown flute with a nasal tone quality found in the Caucasus region of Eastern Armenia. It is made of wood or cane, usually with seven finger holes and one thumb hole, producing a diatonic scale. One Armenian musicologist believes the sring to be the most characteristic of national Armenian instruments.\n\u1eccj\u00e0.\nThe \u1eccj\u00e0 is a traditional musical instrument utilized by the Igbo people, who are indigenous to Nigeria. The \u1ecdj\u00e0 (flute) is used during cultural activities or events where Igbo music is played. It is skillfully carved from wood/bamboo or metal and is played by blowing air into one end while covering and uncovering holes along the body to create different notes.\nBreathing techniques.\nThere are several means by which flautists breathe to blow air through the instrument and produce sound. They include diaphragmatic breathing and circular breathing. Diaphragmatic breathing optimizes inhalation, minimizing the number of breaths. Circular breathing brings air in through the nose and out through the mouth, enabling a continuous sound.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250\u00a0million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.\nAssociation football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is in circumference. The two teams compete to score goals by getting the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and fully across the goal line). When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may also use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball; the head, chest, and thighs are commonly used. Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, but they may use their hands only within their own penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared with 1 point awarded to each team, or the game may go into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.\nInternationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA. National associations (e.g. the FA in England, U.S. Soccer in the United States, etc.) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most prestigious senior international competition is the FIFA World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games. The most prestigious competition in European club football is the UEFA Champions League, which attracts an extensive television audience worldwide. The final of the men's Champions League is the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.\nName.\nAssociation football is part of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. The word \"association\" in this term refers to the Football Association (the FA), founded in London in 1863, which published the first set of rules for the sport that same year. The term was coined to distinguish the type of football played in accordance with the FA rules from other types that were gaining popularity at the time, particularly rugby football.\nThe term \"soccer\" comes from Oxford \"-er\" slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875, and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School. Initially spelt \"assoccer\" (a shortening of \"association\"), it was later reduced to the modern spelling. Early alternative spellings included \"socca\" and \"socker\". This form of slang also gave rise to \"rugger\" for rugby football, \"fiver\" and \"tenner\" for five pound and ten pound notes, and the now-archaic \"footer\" that was also a name for association football.\nWithin the English-speaking world, association football is now usually called simply \"football\" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it \"soccer\" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster), and the United States. A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, \"football\" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.\nHistory.\nAssociation football in itself does not have a classical history. Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world, FIFA has described that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England.\nAncient precursors.\nKicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures. The Chinese competitive game ' (, literally \"kickball\"; also known as \"tsu chu\") resembles modern association football as well as a mix of basketball and volleyball. This is the earliest form of a kicking game for which there is historical evidence. The game was first recorded as in exercise in the Zhan Guo Ce, a military history from the Han dynasty. ' players would pass the ball around, having to avoid it touching the ground at any point. It was then passed to a designated player, who attempted to kick it through the \"fengliu yan\", a circular goal atop 10\u201311 meter poles. During the Han dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 220 CE), ' games were standardised and rules were established. The Silk Road facilitated the transmission of \"cuju\" outside of China, especially the form of the game popular in the Tang dynasty, the period when the inflatable ball was invented and replaced the stuffed ball. Other East Asian games include ' in Japan and ' in Korea, both influenced by \"cuju\". ' originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period. It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a \"mari\", a ball made of animal skin. In North America, was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as \"almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals\".\n' and ' were Greek ball games. An image of an ' player depicted in low relief on a stele of c.\u2009375\u2013400 BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy. Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game '. ' and ' were played involving hands and violence. They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling, and volleyball more than what is recognisable as modern football.\nMedieval precursors.\nIn the Middle Ages, one notable game with similarities to modern football was \"calcio storico fiorentino\", which originated in Florence, Italy. Another medieval sport that can be considered a form of early football is \"la soule\" (or \"choule\"), played in France from the 12th century, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks. As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these medieval games involved more handling of the ball than kicking it.\nModern era.\nThe Cambridge rules, first drawn up at the University of Cambridge in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to the formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.\nThese ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of the Football Association (the FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London. The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemasons' Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of the FA between October and December 1863; the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named Laws of the Game, forming modern football. The laws included bans on running with the ball in hand and hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Eleven clubs, under the charge of FA secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley, ratified the original thirteen laws of the game. The sticking point was hacking, which a twelfth club at the meeting, Blackheath FC, had wanted to keep, resulting in their withdrawal from the FA. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, and instead in 1871, along with Blackheath, formed the Rugby Football Union. The 1863 FA rules included handling of the ball by \"marks\" and the lack of a crossbar, making the game remarkably similar to Victorian rules football, which was being developed around the same time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.\nThe world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W. Alcock, and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of Alcock. England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor. The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.\nThe Laws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). The board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association. The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913. The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.\nContemporary era.\nFor most of the 20th century, Europe and South America were the dominant regions in association football. The FIFA World Cup, inaugurated in 1930, became the main stage for players of both continents to show their worth and the strength of their national teams. In the second half of the century, the European Cup and the Copa Libertadores were created, and the champions of these two club competitions would contest the Intercontinental Cup to prove which team was the best in the world.\nIn the 21st century, South America has continued to produce some of the best footballers in the world, but its clubs have fallen behind the still dominant European clubs, which often sign the best players from Latin America and elsewhere. Meanwhile, football has improved in Africa, Asia and North America, and nowadays, these regions are at least on equal grounds with South America in club football. When it comes to national teams, countries in the Caribbean and Oceania regions (excluding Australia) have yet to make a mark in international football, while Europeans and South Americans continue to dominate the men's FIFA World Cup, as no team from any other region has managed to even reach the final.\nFootball is played at a professional level all over the world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. A very large number of people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240\u00a0million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.\nIn many parts of the world, football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans, local communities, and even nations. Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski says that Europeans who are polite, modest, or humble fall easily into rage when playing or watching football games. The Ivory Coast national football team helped secure a truce to the nation's civil war in 2006 and it helped further reduce tensions between government and rebel forces in 2007 by playing a match in the rebel capital of Bouak\u00e9, an occasion that brought both armies together peacefully for the first time. By contrast, football is widely considered to have been the final proximate cause for the Football War in June 1969 between El Salvador and Honduras. The sport also exacerbated tensions at the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence of the 1990s, when a match between Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade degenerated into rioting in May 1990.\nWomen's association football.\nWomen's association football has historically seen opposition, with national associations severely curbing its development and several outlawing it completely. Nevertheless, women have been playing football and similar games for as long as such games have existed. Frescoes from the Han dynasty (25\u2013220 CE) depict female figures playing the ancient Chinese game \"cuju\". There are also reports of annual football matches played by women in Midlothian, Scotland, during the 1790s.\nOrigins and restrictions.\nThere is documented evidence of women's early involvement in association football. Informal matches between Scotland and England are reported to have taken place in 1881, but are not officially recognised by the respective football associations. The first women's match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.\nThe best-documented early European team was founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894: the British Ladies' Football Club. Honeyball considered women's involvement in football as part of the emancipation movement. She and others like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the \"masculinity\" of the game.\nWomen's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the First World War, when female employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men decades earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr Ladies F.C. of Preston, England. They played in one of the first women's international matches against a French XI team in 1920, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in the same year, winning 22\u20130. In the early 20th century, women's football in the United Kingdom was mostly associated with charity matches.\nDespite being more popular than some men's football events, with one match seeing a 53,000 strong crowd in 1920, women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when the Football Association outlawed the playing of the game on association members' pitches, stating that \"the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged\". Players and football writers have argued that this ban was, in fact, due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted, and because the FA had no control over the money made from the women's game. The FA ban led to the formation of the short-lived English Ladies Football Association and play moved to rugby grounds. Women's football also faced bans in several other countries, notably in Brazil from 1941 to 1979, in France from 1941 to 1970, and in West Germany from 1955 to 1970.\nRevival and ongoing growth.\nIn spite of the resistance from governing bodies, British women continued to play football. Restrictions against female participation in the sport began to be reduced in the late 1960s and the 1970s. The Italian women's football league was established in 1968. In December 1969, the Women's Football Association was formed in England, with the sport eventually becoming the most prominent team sport for women in the United Kingdom. Two unofficial women's World Cups were organised by the FIEFF in 1970 and in 1971. Also in 1971, UEFA members voted to officially recognise women's football, while the Football Association rescinded the ban that prohibited women from playing on association members' pitches in England. The first Asian Women's Championship happened in 1975, initially without the approval of the AFC, but later recognised by them.\nWomen's football still faces many struggles, but its worldwide growth has seen major competitions being launched at both the national and international levels, mirroring the men's competitions. The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991: the first tournament was held in China, featuring 12 teams from the six confederations. The World Cup has been held every four years since; by 2019, it had expanded to 24 national teams, and 1.12\u00a0billion viewers watched the competition. Four years later, FIFA targeted the 32-team 2023 Women's World Cup at an audience of 2\u00a0billion, while more than 1.5\u00a0million tickets were sold, setting a Women's World Cup record. Women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996.\nNorth America is the dominant region in women's football, with the United States winning the most FIFA Women's World Cups and Olympic tournaments. Europe and Asia come second and third in terms of international success, and the women's game has been improving in South America.\nGameplay.\nAssociation football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game. The game is played using a spherical ball of circumference, known as the \"football\" (or \"soccer ball\"). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an offside call or a foul in the build-up to the goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.\nThe primary law is that players other than goalkeepers may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a throw-in restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, \"heading\" with the forehead) other than their hands or arms. Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an offside position.\nDuring gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the referee for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.\nAt a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the 2022\u201323 season of the English Premier League produced an average of 2.85 goals per match. The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper.\nThese positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends the most time. For example, there are central defenders and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of a team's players is known as a \"formation\". Defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager.\nLaws.\nThere are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulations and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football for both sexes, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the IFAB. In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of association football. Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s, and the NFHS and NCAA still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.\nPlayers, equipment, and officials.\nEach team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.\nThe basic equipment or \"kit\" players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. Wearing an athletic supporter with protective cup is recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of equipment, but players may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.\nA number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is five in 90 minutes, with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time; the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in friendly matches. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or timewasting at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match. IFAB recommends \"that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team\". Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.\nA game is officiated by a referee, who has \"full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed\" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees. In many high-level games there is also a fourth official who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.\nGoal line technology is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining whether a goal has been scored or not; this was brought in to prevent controversy. Video assistant referees (VAR) have also been increasingly introduced in high-level matches to assist officials through video replays to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the build-up, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.\nBall.\nThe ball is spherical with a circumference of between , a weight in the range of , and a pressure between at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.\nPitch.\nAs the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.\nThe length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of and the width is in the range of . Fields for non-international matches may be in length and in width, provided the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of long and wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.\nThe longer boundary lines are \"touchlines\", while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are \"goal lines\". A rectangular goal is positioned on each goal line, midway between the two touchlines. The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.\nIn front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line from the goalposts and extending into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.\nDuration and tie-breaking methods.\n90-minute ordinary time.\nA standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called \"additional time\" in FIFA documents, but is most commonly referred to as \"stoppage time\" or \"injury time\", while \"lost time\" can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is out of play, and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of \"effective playing time\". The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half, the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time they intend to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1\u20130 with two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty kick. Villa's goalkeeper deliberately kicked the ball far out of play; by the time it was recovered, the clock had run out and the game was over, leaving Stoke unable to attempt the penalty. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until a penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed; thus, no game can end with an uncompleted penalty.\nDue to the relatively high ambient temperatures in some regions of the planet, cooling breaks for the players were introduced. Breaks could take place at the referee's discretion after the 30th minute of each half if the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature exceeded ; the breaks would last 3 minutes, with this time made up by an extended period of stoppage time at the end of the half.\nTie-breaking.\nIn league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required, various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke replays. A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of penalty shoot-outs (previously known in the Laws of the Game as \"kicks from the penalty mark\") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament or be the champion. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament, with goals scored in a penalty shoot-out not making up part of the final score.\nIn competitions using two-legged matches, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shoot-out are required.\nBall in and out of play.\nUnder the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are \"ball in play\" and \"ball out of play\". From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:\nMisconduct.\nOn-field.\nA foul occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of \"penal fouls\", punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an indirect free kick.\nThe referee may punish a player's or substitute's misconduct by a caution (yellow card) or dismissal (red card). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been \"booked\", the referee writing the player's name in their official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of \"unsporting behaviour\" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute, substituted player, and to non-players such as managers and support staff.\nRather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \"playing an advantage\". The referee may \"call back\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within \"a few seconds\". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.\nThe referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final. The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including whether a goal was awarded or not) were incorrect.\nOff-field.\nAlong with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud and match fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.\nSanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, point deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English Football League deduct 12 points from any team that enters financial administration. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that forfeit a game or are forfeited against are awarded a technical loss or win.\nGoverning bodies.\nThe recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as futsal and beach soccer) is FIFA. The FIFA headquarters are located in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:\nNational associations (or national federations) oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states (for example, the Cameroonian Football Federation in Cameroon), but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example, the Scottish Football Association in Scotland). 211 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations. Other national associations may be members of continental confederations but otherwise not participate in FIFA competitions.\nWhile FIFA is responsible for organising international competitions and enforcing most international regulations, the Laws of the Game are set by the IFAB, where each of the four UK associations holds one vote and FIFA collectively holds four votes.\nInternational competitions.\nInternational competitions in association football principally consist of two varieties: competitions involving representative national teams or those involving clubs based in multiple nations and national leagues. \"International football\", without qualification, most often refers to the former. In the case of international club competition, it is the country of origin of the clubs involved, not the nationalities of their players, that renders the competition international in nature.\nThe major international competition in football and the most prestigious is the World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition has taken place every four years since 1930, with the exception of the 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled because of World War II. As of 2022, over 200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament involved 32 national teams (expanding to 48 teams for the 2026 tournament) competing over a four-week period. The World Cup is the world's most widely viewed and most followed sporting event, with the 2022 tournament estimated to be watched by 5\u00a0billion people, more than 60% of the global population. The 1958 World Cup saw the emergence of Pel\u00e9 as a global sporting star, a period that coincided with \"the explosive spread of television, which massively amplified his presence everywhere\". The current champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 tournament in Qatar. The FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament's current format that was expanded in 2023, national teams vie for 31 slots in a three-year qualification phase, while the host nation's team enters automatically as the 32nd slot. The current champions are Spain, after winning their first title in the 2023 tournament.\nThere has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles when FIFA and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had disagreed over the status of amateur players. Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only. As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC allowed professional players to compete. Since 1992, male competitors must be under 23 years old, although since 1996, three players over the age of 23 have been allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.\nAfter the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the European Championship (UEFA), the Copa Am\u00e9rica (CONMEBOL), the Africa Cup of Nations (CAF), the Asian Cup (AFC), the Gold Cup (CONCACAF) and the Nations Cup (OFC). These competitions are not strictly limited to members of the continental confederations, with guest teams from other continents sometimes invited to compete. The FIFA Confederations Cup was contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current FIFA World Cup champions, and the country which was hosting the next World Cup. This was generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and did not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The tournament was discontinued following the 2017 edition, with its calendar slot replaced by an expanded FIFA Club World Cup. The Finalissima was revived in 2022, and is contested between the Copa Am\u00e9rica and European Championship winners. The UEFA Nations League and the CONCACAF Nations League were introduced in the late 2010s to replace international friendlies during the two-year cycle between major tournaments.\nThe most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example, the UEFA Champions League in Europe and the Copa Libertadores in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the FIFA Intercontinental Cup, held annually, and the FIFA Club World Cup, held once every four years.\nDomestic competitions.\nIn each country, football clubs are usually federated in associations or leagues that organise official tournaments among themselves, from which the champion of each country and the teams that will participate in international club tournaments emerge. There is no single system of competitions, and each national league organises them according to its own traditions.\nThe governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results, usually three points for a win, one for a draw and zero for a defeat. Teams are put into tables, placed in order according to points accrued. In the Old World (Africa, Asia and Europe), it is common for each team to play every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, which typically runs from August to May, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division.\nSome exceptions to this system occur in the New World (Americas) and Australia:\nThe teams finishing at the top of a country's league may also be eligible to play in international club competitions in the following season. Most countries supplement the league system with one or more \"cup\" competitions organised on a knock-out basis. These include the domestic cup, which may be open to all eligible teams in a country's league system\u2014both professional and amateur\u2014and is organised by the national federation.\nSome countries' top divisions feature highly-paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and many women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The top five European leagues \u2013 Premier League (England), Bundesliga (Germany), La Liga (Spain), Serie A (Italy), and Ligue 1 (France) \u2013 attract most of the world's best players and, during the 2006\u201307 season, each of these leagues had a total wage cost in excess of \u20ac600\u00a0million. These leagues also generated a combined \u20ac17.2\u00a0billion in revenue in the 2021\u201322 season from television contracts, matchday tickets, sponsorships, and other sources. In the 2022\u201323 season, clubs in Europe's \"big five\" leagues had an aggregate wage cost of \u20ac13\u00a0billion, with each league spending more than \u20ac1.8\u00a0billion in wages. In contrast, the combined revenue of these leagues was \u20ac19.6\u00a0billion.\nVariants and casual play.\nVariants of association football have been codified for teams of reduced size, such as five-a-side football; for non-traditional playing environments, including beach soccer, futsal and indoor soccer; and for athletes with disabilities (Paralympic football).\nStreet football can be played with only minimal equipment \u2013 a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball made from almost any material and items to mark the positions of the goalposts. Such informal games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the corporate successor to his earlier Greater New York Film Rental Company and Box Office Attraction Company (founded 1913).\nThe company's first film studios were set up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, but in 1917, William Fox sent Sol M. Wurtzel to Hollywood, California, to oversee the studio's new West Coast production facilities, where the climate was more hospitable for filmmaking. On July 23, 1926, Fox Studios bought the patents of the Movietone sound system for recording sound onto film.\nAfter the Wall Street crash of 1929, William Fox lost control of the company in 1930, during a hostile takeover. Under new president Sidney R. Kent, the new owners merged the company with Twentieth Century Pictures to form Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation in 1935.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nWilliam Fox entered the film industry in 1904 when he purchased a one-third share of a Brooklyn nickelodeon for $1,667. He reinvested his profits from that initial location, expanding to fifteen similar venues in the city, and purchasing prints from the major studios of the time: Biograph, Essanay, Kalem, Lubin, Path\u00e9, Selig, and Vitagraph. After experiencing further success presenting live vaudeville routines along with motion pictures, he expanded into larger venues beginning with his purchase of the disused Gaiety theater, and continuing with acquisitions throughout New York City and New Jersey, including the Academy of Music.\nFox invested further in the film industry by founding the Greater New York Film Rental Company as a film distributor. The major film studios responded by forming the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 and the General Film Company in 1910, in an effort to create a monopoly on the creation and distribution of motion pictures. Fox refused to sell out to the monopoly, and sued under the Sherman Antitrust Act, eventually receiving a $370,000 settlement, and ending restrictions on the length of films and the prices that could be paid for screenplays.\nIn 1914, reflecting the broader scope of his business, he renamed it the Box Office Attraction Company. He entered into a contract with the Balboa Amusement Producing Company film studio, purchasing all of their films for showing in his New York area theaters and renting the prints to other exhibitors nationwide. He also continued to distribute material from other sources, such as Winsor McCay's early animated film \"Gertie the Dinosaur\". Later that year, Fox concluded that it was unwise to be so dependent on other companies, so he purchased the \u00c9clair studio facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey, along with property in Staten Island, and arranged for actors and crew. The company became a film studio, using the name Box Office Attraction Company; its first release was \"Life's Shop Window\".\nFox Film Corporation.\nAlways more of an entrepreneur than a showman, Fox concentrated on acquiring and building theaters; pictures were secondary. The company's first film studios were set up in Fort Lee where it and many other early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the 20th century.\nThat same year, in 1914, Fox Film began making motion pictures in California, and in 1915 decided to build its own permanent studio. The company leased the Los Angeles Edendale studio of the Selig Polyscope Company until its own studio, located at Western Avenue and Sunset Boulevard, was completed in 1916. In 1917, William Fox sent Sol M. Wurtzel to Hollywood to oversee the studio's West Coast production facilities where a more hospitable and cost-effective climate existed for filmmaking. Between 1915 and 1919, Fox Films earned millions of dollars through films featuring Theda Bara, known as \"The Vamp\" due to her unique ability to display exoticism. Fox also produced 85 films featuring lead Western actor Tom Mix, who joined Fox in 1917. The popularity of Mix's Western films earned Fox large sums of money, and he eventually was paid $17,000 per week.\nWith the introduction of sound technology, Fox moved to acquire the rights to a sound-on-film process. In the years 1925\u201326, Fox purchased the rights to the work of Freeman Harrison Owens, the U.S. rights to the Tri-Ergon system invented by three German inventors, and the work of Theodore Case. This resulted in the Movietone sound system later known as \"Fox Movietone\" developed at the Movietone Studio. Later that year, the company began offering films with a music-and-effects track, and the following year Fox began the weekly \"Fox Movietone News\" feature, that ran until 1963. The growing company needed space, and in 1926 Fox acquired 300\u00a0acres\u00a0(1.2\u00a0km2) in the open country west of Beverly Hills and built \"Movietone City\", the best-equipped studio of its time.\nBecause William Fox opted to remain in New York, much of the Hollywood filmmaking at the Fox Film Corporation was instead managed by Fox's movie makers. Janet Gaynor would also become one of the company's most prominent stars by the late 1920s.\nDecline.\nWhen rival Marcus Loew died in 1927, Fox offered to buy the Loew family's holdings. Loew's Inc. controlled more than 200 theaters, as well as the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio. The Loew family agreed to the sale, and the merger of Fox and Loew's Inc. was announced in 1929. However, MGM studio bosses Louis B. Mayer and Irving Thalberg were not included in the deal; despite their status at MGM, they were only employees. Meyer and Thalberg fought back with their powerful political connections. Mayer called upon the Justice Department's antitrust unit to delay giving final approval to the merger. William Fox was badly injured in a car crash in the summer of 1929, and by the time he recovered, he had lost most of his fortune in the stock market crash of 1929, ending any chance of the Fox/Loew's merger being approved, even without the Justice Department's objections.\nOverextended and close to bankruptcy, Fox was stripped of his empire in 1930 and later ended up in jail on bribery and perjury charges. Fox Film, with more than 500 theatres, was placed in receivership. A bank-mandated reorganization propped the company up for a time, but it soon became apparent that despite its size, Fox could not stand on its own. William Fox resented the way he was forced out of his company and portrayed it as an active conspiracy against him in the 1933 book \"Upton Sinclair Presents William Fox\".\nMerger.\nUnder new president Sidney Kent, the new owners began negotiating with the upstart, but powerful independent Twentieth Century Pictures in the early spring of 1935. Twentieth Century had begun in the Samuel Goldwyn Studios in 1932 under founders Joseph Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck. \nThe two companies merged that spring of 1935 and became Twentieth Century-Fox. The company was purchased by News Corporation in 1985, becoming \"20th Century Fox\" without the hyphen, and in 2019 was acquired by The Walt Disney Company as part of Disney's purchase of 20th Century Fox's owner and was renamed 20th Century Studios in 2020. For many years, 20th Century-Fox claimed to have been founded in 1915; for instance, it marked 1945 as its 30th anniversary. However, in recent years it has claimed the 1935 merger as its founding, marking its 75th rather than 95th anniversary in 2010.\nProducts.\nFeature films.\nA 1937 fire in a Fox film storage facility destroyed over 40,000 reels of negatives and prints, including the best-quality copies of every Fox feature produced prior to 1932; although copies located elsewhere allowed many to survive in some form, over 75% of Fox's feature films from before 1930 are completely lost.\nNewsreels.\nIn 1919, Fox began a series of silent newsreels, competing with existing series such as \"Hearst Metrotone News\", \"International Newsreel\", and \"Path\u00e9 News\". \"Fox News\" premiered on October 11, 1919, with subsequent issues released on the Wednesday and Sunday of each week. \"Fox News\" gained an advantage over its more established competitors when President Woodrow Wilson endorsed the newsreel in a letter, in what may have been the first time an American president commented on a film. In subsequent years, \"Fox News\" remained one of the major names in the newsreel industry by providing often-exclusive coverage of major international events, including reporting on Pancho Villa, the airship \"Roma\", the Ku Klux Klan, and a 1922 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The silent newsreel series continued until 1930.\nIn 1926, a subsidiary, Fox Movietone Corporation, was created, tasked with producing newsreels using Fox's recently acquired sound-on-film technology. The first of these newsreels debuted on January 21, 1927. Four months later, the May 25 release of a sound recording of Charles Lindbergh's departure on his transatlantic flight was described by film historian Raymond Fielding as the \"first sound news film of consequence\". \"Movietone News\" was launched as a regular newsreel feature December 3 of that year. Production of the series continued after the merger with Twentieth Century Pictures, until 1963, and continued to serve 20th Century Fox after that, as a source for film industry stock footage.\nUnlike Fox's early feature films, the \"Fox News\" and \"Fox Movietone News\" libraries have largely survived. The earlier series and some parts of its sound successor are now held by the University of South Carolina, with the remaining \"Fox Movietone News\" still held by the company.\nSerials.\nFox Film briefly experimented with serial films, releasing the 15-episode \"Bride 13\" and the 20-episode \"Fant\u00f4mas\" in 1920. William Fox was unwilling to compromise on production quality in order to make serials profitable, however, and none were produced subsequently.\nShort films.\nHundreds of one- and two-reel short films of various types were also produced by Fox. Beginning in 1916, the Sunshine Comedy division created two-reel comedy shorts. Many of these, beginning with 1917's \"Roaring Lions and Wedding Bliss\", starring Lloyd Hamilton, were slapstick, intended to compete with Mack Sennett's popular offerings. Sunshine releases continued until the introduction of sound. Other short film series included \"Imperial Comedies\", \"Van Bibber Comedies\" (with Earle Foxe), \"O'Henry\", \"Married Life of Helen and Warren\", and \"Fox Varieties\". Fox's expansion into Spanish-language films in the early 1930s also included shorts.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1917 as First National Exhibitors' Circuit, Inc., an association of independent theatre owners in the United States, and became the country's largest theater chain. Expanding from exhibiting movies to distributing them, the company reincorporated in 1919 as \"Associated First National Theatres, Inc.\", and \"Associated First National Pictures, Inc.\" In 1924 it expanded to become a motion picture production company as \"First National Pictures, Inc.\", and became an important studio in the film industry. In September 1928, control of First National passed to Warner Bros., into which it was completely absorbed on November 4, 1929. A number of Warner Bros. films were thereafter branded First National Pictures until July 1936, when First National Pictures, Inc., was dissolved.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly history.\nThe First National Exhibitors' Circuit was founded in 1917 by the merger of 26 of the biggest first-run cinema chains in the United States. It eventually controlled over 600 cinemas, more than 200 of them first-run houses (as opposed to the less lucrative second-run or neighbourhood theatres to which films moved when their initial box office receipts dwindled).\nFirst National was the brainchild of Thomas L. Tally, who was reacting to the overwhelming influence of Paramount Pictures, which dominated the market. In 1912, he thought that a conglomerate of theatres throughout the nation could buy or produce and distribute its own films. In 1917 Tally and J. D. Williams formed First National Exhibitors' Circuit.\nThe first film released through First National was the 1916 British film \"The Mother of Dartmoor\". Between 1917 and 1918, the company made contracts with Mary Pickford and Charlie Chaplin, the first million-dollar deals in the history of film.\nChaplin's contract allowed him to produce his films without a set release schedule. However, the production of the feature film \"The Kid\" ran so long that the company started to complain.\nTo address their concerns, Chaplin invited the exhibitors to the studio, and they were so impressed by the project and charmed by the players, especially co-star Jackie Coogan, that they agreed to be patient. That patience was ultimately rewarded when \"The Kid\" became a major critical and box office success.\nFirst National's distribution of films by independent producers is credited with launching careers including that of Louis B. Mayer.\nFirst National Exhibitors' Circuit was reincorporated in 1919 as Associated First National Pictures, Inc., and its subsidiary, Associated First National Theatres, Inc., with 5,000 independent theater owners as members.\nAssociated First National Pictures expanded from only distributing films to producing them in 1924 and changed its corporate name to First National Pictures, Inc. It built its studio lot in Burbank in 1926. The Motion Picture Theatre Owners of America and the Independent Producers' Association declared war in 1925 on what they termed a common enemy\u2014the \"film trust\" of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount, and First National, which they claimed dominated the industry not only by producing and distributing motion pictures but also by entering into exhibition as well.\nJacob Fabian, movie magnate known for pioneering the establishment of large motion picture theaters, starting in New Jersey, was Vice-President of Associated First National Pictures Producers, which evolved to First National Pictures, Inc. in 1924. He was an original franchise-holder of the organization as owner of the New Jersey First National Exchange.\nIn March 1926, Fabian and sons acquired a large block of stock in West Coast Theatres, Inc.\nBy May 1926, a merger took place with the Stanley Company, headed by Jules E. Mastbaum, creating an unbroken chain of theaters from Massachusetts to Virginia called the Stanley Company of America.\nFollowing the passing of Mastbaum in December 1926, a $100 Million consolidation merger occurred between First National Pictures, The Stanley Company of America, and West Coast Theatres, creating the largest theater holding company in the world. During this time, a block of theaters were sold to the Warner Brothers Pictures, who would later pioneer sound to film (talkies) with \"The Jazz Singer\" in late 1927.\nIn July 1928, the Stanley Company elected a new Board of Directors, including Jacob Fabian and his son Simon H. Fabian.\nAcquisition by Warner Bros..\nWarner Bros. held 42,000 shares of common stock out of 72,000 outstanding shares while Fox Pictures held 21,000 shares; 12,000 shares were publicly held. Warner Bros. acquired access to First National's affiliated chain of theatres, while First National acquired access to Vitaphone sound equipment. Warner Bros. and First National continued to operate as separate entities. As a result of Warner Brothers acquiring one of the major film studios in First National, Warner Brothers became one of the largest producing, distributing, and exhibiting companies in Hollywood.\nOn November 4, 1929, Fox sold its interest in First National to Warner Bros. for $10 million. The First National studio in Burbank became the official home of Warner Bros.\u2013First National Pictures. Thereafter, First National Pictures became a trade name for the distribution of a designated segment of Warner Bros. product. 45 of the 86 Warner Bros. feature films released in 1929 were branded as First National Pictures. Half of the 60 feature films Warner Bros. announced for release in 1933\u20131934 were to be First National Pictures.\nAlthough both studios produced \"A\" and \"B\" budget pictures, generally the prestige productions, costume dramas, and musicals were made by Warner Bros., while First National specialized in modern comedies, dramas, and crime stories. Short subjects were made by yet another affiliated company, The Vitaphone Corporation (which took its name from the sound process).\nIn July 1936, stockholders of First National Pictures, Inc. (primarily Warner Bros.) voted to dissolve the corporation and distribute its assets among the stockholders in line with a new tax law which provided for tax-free consolidations between corporations.\nFrom 1929 to 1958, most Warner Bros. films and promotional posters bore the trademark and copyright credits \"A Warner Bros.\u2013First National Picture\" in their opening and closing sequences.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
