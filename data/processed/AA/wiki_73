Beginning with \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1739\u201340), Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Hume followed John Locke in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, concluding that all human knowledge derives solely from experience; this places him amongst such empiricists as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley.\nHume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be justified rationally; instead, they result from custom and mental habit. People never actually perceive that one event causes another but only experience the \"constant conjunction\" of events. This problem of induction means that to draw any causal inferences from past experience, it is necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past; this metaphysical presupposition cannot itself be grounded in prior experience.\nAn opponent of philosophical rationalists, Hume held that passions rather than reason govern human behaviour, famously proclaiming that \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.\" Hume was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment rather than abstract moral principle. He maintained an early commitment to naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena and is usually accepted by historians of European philosophy to have first clearly expounded the is\u2013ought problem, or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never give rise to a normative conclusion of what \"ought\" to be done.\nHume denied that people have an actual conception of the self, positing that they experience only a bundle of sensations and that the self is nothing more than this bundle of perceptions connected by an association of ideas. Hume's compatibilist theory of free will takes causal determinism as fully compatible with human freedom. His philosophy of religion, including his rejection of miracles and critique of the argument from design, was especially controversial. Hume left a legacy that affected utilitarianism, logical positivism, the philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive science, theology and many other fields and thinkers. Immanuel Kant credited Hume as the inspiration that had awakened him from his \"dogmatic slumbers.\"\nEarly life.\nDavid Hume was born on 7 May 1711 [OS 26 April 1711], as David Home, in a tenement on the north side of Edinburgh's Lawnmarket. He was the second of two sons born to Catherine Home (n\u00e9e Falconer; daughter of Sir David Falconer of Newton, Midlothian, and his wife, Mary Falconer (n\u00e9e Norvell), and Joseph Home of Chirnside in the County of Berwick, an advocate of Ninewells. Joseph died just after David's second birthday. Catherine, who never re-married, raised the two brothers and their sister on her own.\nHume changed his family name's spelling in 1734 because the surname 'Home' (pronounced 'Hume') was not well known in England. Hume never married and lived partly at his Chirnside family home in Berwickshire, which had belonged to the family since the 16th century. His finances as a young man were very \"slender\", as his family was not rich; as a younger son he had little patrimony to live on.\nHume attended the University of Edinburgh at an unusually early age\u2014either 12 or possibly as young as 10\u2014at a time when 14 was the typical age. Initially, Hume considered a career in law, because of his family. However, in his words, he came to have:\nan insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of Philosophy and general Learning; and while [my family] fanceyed I was poring over Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the Authors which I was secretly devouring.\nHe had little respect for the professors of his time, telling a friend in 1735 that \"there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books\". He did not graduate.\n\"Disease of the learned\".\nAt around age 18, Hume made a philosophical discovery that opened up to him \"a new Scene of Thought\", inspiring him \"to throw up every other Pleasure or Business to apply entirely to it\". As he did not recount what this scene exactly was, commentators have offered a variety of speculations. One prominent interpretation among contemporary Humean scholarship is that this new \"scene of thought\" was Hume's realisation that Francis Hutcheson's theory of \"moral sense\" could be applied to the understanding of morality as well.\nFrom this inspiration, Hume set out to spend a minimum of 10 years reading and writing. He soon came to the verge of a mental breakdown, first starting with a coldness\u2014which he attributed to a \"Laziness of Temper\"\u2014that lasted about nine months. Scurvy spots later broke out on his fingers, persuading Hume's physician to diagnose him with the \"Disease of the Learned\".\nHume wrote that he \"went under a Course of Bitters and Anti-Hysteric Pills\", taken along with a pint of claret every day. He also decided to have a more active life to better continue his learning. His health improved somewhat, but in 1731, he was afflicted with a ravenous appetite and palpitations. After eating well for a time, he went from being \"tall, lean and raw-bon'd\" to being \"sturdy, robust [and] healthful-like.\" Indeed, Hume would become well known for being obese and having a fondness for good port and cheese, often using them as philosophical metaphors for his conjectures.\nCareer.\nDespite having noble ancestry, Hume had no source of income and no learned profession by age 25. As was common at his time, he became a merchant's assistant, despite having to leave his native Scotland. He travelled via Bristol to La Fl\u00e8che in Anjou, France. There he had frequent discourse with the Jesuits of the College of La Fl\u00e8che and is likely to have used the college's extensive library.\nHume was derailed in his attempts to start a university career by protests over his alleged \"atheism\", also lamenting that his literary debut, \"A Treatise of Human Nature\", \"fell dead-born from the press\". However, he found literary success in his lifetime as an essayist and historian, and a career as a librarian at the Advocates Library for the Faculty of Advocates. These successes provided him much needed income at the time. His tenure there, and the access to research materials it provided, resulted in Hume's writing the massive six-volume \"The History of England\", which became a bestseller and the definitive history of England. For over 60 years, Hume was the dominant interpreter of English history. He described his \"love for literary fame\" as his \"ruling passion\" and judged his two late works, the so-called \"first\" and \"second\" enquiries, \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" and \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\", as his greatest literary and philosophical achievements. He would ask of his contemporaries to judge him on the merits of the later texts alone, rather than on the more radical formulations of his early, youthful work, dismissing his philosophical debut as juvenilia: \"A work which the Author had projected before he left College.\" Despite Hume's protestations, a consensus exists today that his most important arguments and philosophically distinctive doctrines are found in the original form they take in the \"Treatise\". Though he was only 23 years old when starting this work, it is now regarded as one of the most important in the history of western philosophy.\n1730s.\nHume worked for four years on his first major work, \"A Treatise of Human Nature\", subtitled \"Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects\", completing it in 1738 at age 28. Books 1 and 2 of his treatise were intended to \"try the taste of the public\", leading to Book 3 \"Of Morals\" being published after his feeling that he had \"met with success\".\nAlthough many scholars today consider the \"Treatise\" to be Hume's most important work and one of the most important books in Western philosophy, critics in Great Britain at the time described it as \"abstract and unintelligible\". As Hume had spent most of his savings during those four years, he resolved \"to make a very rigid frugality supply [his] deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired [his] independency, and to regard every object as contemptible except the improvements of [his] talents in literature\".\nDespite the disappointment, Hume later wrote: \"Being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I soon recovered from the blow and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country.\" There, in an attempt to make his larger work better known and more intelligible, he published the \"An Abstract of a Book lately Published\" as a summary of the main doctrines of the \"Treatise\", without revealing its authorship. This work contained the same ideas, but with a shorter and clearer explanation. Although there has been some academic speculation as to the pamphlet's true author, it is generally regarded as Hume's creation.\n1740s.\nAfter the publication of \"Essays Moral and Political\" in 1741\u2014included in the later edition as \"Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary\"\u2014Hume applied for the Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. However, the position was given to William Cleghorn after Edinburgh ministers petitioned the town council not to appoint Hume because he was seen as an atheist.\nIn 1745, during the Jacobite risings, Hume tutored the Marquess of Annandale, an engagement that ended in disarray after about a year. The Marquess could not follow with Hume's lectures, his father saw little need for philosophy, and on a personal level, the Marquess found Hume's dietary tendencies to be bizarre. Hume then started his great historical work, \"The History of England\", which took fifteen years and ran to over a million words. During this time, he was also involved with the Canongate Theatre through his friend John Home, a preacher.\nIn this context, he associated with Lord Monboddo and other thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment in Edinburgh. From 1746, Hume served for three years as secretary to General James St Clair, who was envoy to the courts of Turin and Vienna. At that time Hume wrote \"Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding\", later published as \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\". Often called the \"First Enquiry\", it proved little more successful than the \"Treatise\", perhaps because of the publication of his short autobiography \"My Own Life\", which \"made friends difficult for the first Enquiry\". By the end of this period Hume had attained his well-known corpulent stature; \"the good table of the General and the prolonged inactive life had done their work\", leaving him \"a man of tremendous bulk\".\nIn 1749 he went to live with his brother in the countryside, although he continued to associate with the aforementioned Scottish Enlightenment figures.\n1750s\u20131760s.\nHume's religious views were often suspect and, in the 1750s, it was necessary for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of heresy, specifically in an ecclesiastical court. However, he \"would not have come and could not be forced to attend if he said he was not a member of the Established Church\". Hume failed to gain the chair of philosophy at the University of Glasgow due to his religious views. By this time he had published the \"Philosophical Essays\", which were decidedly anti-religious. This represented a turning point in his career and the various opportunities made available to him. Even Adam Smith, his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern that public opinion would be against it. In 1761 all his works were banned on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.\nHume returned to Edinburgh in 1751, and in the following year the Faculty of Advocates hired him to be their Librarian, a job in which he would receive little to no pay, but which nonetheless gave him \"the command of a large library\". This resource enabled him to continue historical research for \"The History of England\". Hume's volume of \"Political Discourses\", written in 1749 and published by Kincaid &amp; Donaldson in 1752, was the only work he considered successful on first publication.\nIn 1753 Hume moved from his house on Riddles Court on the Lawnmarket to a house on the Canongate at the other end of the Royal Mile. Here he lived in a tenement known as Jack's Land, immediately west of the still-surviving Shoemakers Land.\nEventually, with the publication of his six-volume \"The History of England\" between 1754 and 1762, Hume achieved the fame that he coveted. The volumes traced events from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution of 1688 and was a bestseller in its day. Hume was also a longtime friend of the bookseller Andrew Millar, who sold Hume's \"History\" (after acquiring the rights from Scottish bookseller Gavin Hamilton), although the relationship was sometimes complicated. Letters between them illuminate both men's interest in the success of the \"History\". In 1762 Hume moved from Jack's Land on the Canongate to James Court on the Lawnmarket. He sold the house to James Boswell in 1766.\nLater life.\nParis and Rousseau.\nFrom 1763 to 1765 Hume was invited to attend Lord Hertford in Paris, where he became secretary to the British embassy in France. Hume was well received among Parisian society, and while there he met Isaac de Pinto. In 1765 Hume served as a charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Paris, writing \"despatches to the British Secretary of State\". He wrote of his Paris life, \"I really wish often for the plain roughness of The Poker Club of Edinburgh... to correct and qualify so much lusciousness.\"\nIn January 1766 Hume left Paris to accompany Jean-Jacques Rousseau to England. Once there, he and Rousseau fell out, leaving Hume sufficiently worried about the damage to his reputation from the quarrel with Rousseau that he would author an account of the dispute, titling it \"A concise and genuine account of the dispute between Mr. Hume and Mr. Rousseau\".\nSlavery.\nIn 2014, the University of Cambridge academic Felix Waldmann published a previously unknown letter from Hume to his patron Francis Seymour-Conway, Lord Hertford of 20 March 1766, in which Hume communicated a proposal to Hertford from George Colebrooke, Sir James Cockburn and John Stewart to acquire a half-share of slave plantations in Grenada, an island ceded to Britain after the Treaty of Paris (1763) with the other Windward Islands.\n\"To day, Sir George Colebroke spoke to me of a Business, which he desird me to communicate to your Lordship. It seems Sir George, with two Partners, Sir James Cockburn &amp; Mr Stewart the Wine Merchant, had a great Undertaking in Dominica, to which Place they sent over an Overseer, one Mr Nalson, a very honest Man and a Man of Substance. Mr Nalson was oblig\u2019d on some Affair to go to the Granadoes, where the Offer of the most advantageous Bargain, that had been made for a long time in America, had engagd him to make in their Name &amp; his own a Purchase of some Plantations to the Amount of 60.000 Pounds Sterling. They had no Intention to have gone farther than the first Project but rather than the poor Man shoud be ruind or hurt by his Rashness, they were willing to take the half of the Bargain. Hearing that your Lordship had once entertaind Thoughts of making some Purchase in these new Conquests, [deleted: they] Sir George desird me to make an Offer in his Name of the other half, which may be manag\u2019d by common Stock and at common Risque with him and his Partners. As these People are Men of Substance and Character, I thought it possible that your Lordship might give Ear to this Proposal; and if your Lordship think it worthy of your Attention, Sir George says, that he will write you a full Relation of the whole. He read me Nalson\u2019s Letter, by which it appears, that this Purchase is much more advantageous, than that made by Mr Maclane which it seems your Lordship declin\u2019d.\" \u2014\u200aDavid Hume to Francis Seymour Conway, Lord Hertford, 20 March 1766\nWaldmann observed that the previously unknown letter explicated a letter of 20 June 1766 among Hume's papers in the National Library of Scotland, until then miscatalogued as a letter from a man named \"d'Ennesy\", but in fact from the Governor of Martinique, Victor-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Charpentier (1732\u201376), marquis d\u2019Ennery. In the letter, d'Ennery thanked Hume for a letter of 2 February 1766 on behalf of Stewart, Nelson and possibly Alexander Burnet of Grenada (d. 1790), all evidently involved in the purchase of slave plantations:\n\"jay recu la lettre que vous m\u2019avez fait l\u2019honneur de m\u2019ecrire de londres le 2 fevrier de cette anne\u00e9 pour me recomander les interets de M. Stewart represent\u00eaz par Mrs. Nelson et Burnet; je leur rendray, vous pouvez en etre assur\u00e9 tous les services qui dependront de moy, ils y peuvent compter, je le leur ay dit\"\n[Translation: I have received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me from London on the 2nd of February of this year to recommend to me the interests of Mr. Stewart, represented by Messrs. Nelson and Burnet. I will render them, you may be assured, all the services that depend on me; they can count on it, and I have told them so.] \u2014\u200aVictor-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Charpentier, marquis d'Ennery to David Hume, 20 June 1766\nAs Waldmann noted, Hume\u2019s Coutts Bank ledger records that he lent \u00a3400 to Stewart on 8 February 1766 and \"it is not inconceivable that this money was invested in a plantation\". On 25 June 1766, Hume received \u00a36 3s 4d interest for a loan of \"4 mon: 19 days\" from \"Archibald Stewart &amp; Co.\", the firm that John Stewart co-administered with his father Archibald Stewart (Lord Provost). An indenture for a plantation purchased by Stewart, Nelson, and Colebrooke in Grenada reveals that it held 42 slaves by 3 November 1767. As Waldmann recorded, the evidence of Hume's involvement in the slave trade was considerably clearer than the biographical tradition that had associated his early employment in Bristol with a sugar merchant.\nContrary to Waldmann's claims, Peter Hutton and David Ashton have asserted that \"nowhere\u2014absolutely \"nowhere\"\u2014in this letter does Hume 'encourage' Lord Hertford to buy...\". Alan Bailey similarly suggests: \"it is plain that it is Sir George, rather than Hume, who is intent on persuading Lord Hertford to invest\". Hutton and Ashton claim that Hertford chose not to invest in the plantations, but there is no extant evidence of Hertford's response.\nJames Fieser contends that Hume goes beyond merely conveying information: that, by vouching for the partners as 'Men of Substance and Character', attesting to their integrity, Hume \"adds to the merit of the deal by essentially putting his own reputation at stake\". Moreover, in suggesting that the opportunity was more financially \"advantageous\" than a previous plantation investment considered by Hertford, \"his letter reads more like Hume is encouraging the purchase, rather than just dutifully conveying Colebrook's offer\".\nCommenting on Hume's letter to d'Ennery, Hutton and Ashton, noting that Hume's letter is no longer extant, point out that it is not known what he wrote, and assert that the reply \"provides no evidence to suggest that Hume was actively attempting to facilitate investment in a plantation\" and that Hume \"may have simply been providing confirmation of Stewart's personal integrity\". They also assert that \"Waldmann's (2020) insinuation\" that money provided by Hume was \"used to aid the purchase of a slave plantation, is a baseless speculation\" and suggest it was most likely intended to assist in the purchase of a property for Rousseau., although they provide no evidence for this claim or refer to the status of the money provided to Stewart as a loan at commercial interest.\nFieser notes that the \"precise service that d'Ennery performed for Stewart and his representatives\" is a matter of speculation, and any documentation \"that explicitly states the intended purpose of Hume's loan to Stewart\" is not extant. Fieser does, however, observe that \"the timing of the loan and Hume's letter to d'Ennery are too close for us to reasonably think it was for a different project\"; the loan to Stewart of \"approximately \u00a375,000\" in 2022 currency, repaid with interest of \"approximately \u00a31,000\", \"\"\"was likely more of a loan to a friend rather than as a pure business venture\", although, as Waldmann first acknowledged, \"the purpose of the loan is not recorded\".\nBailey notes that \"nothing in the letter [to Hertford] indicates that Hume ... had any pecuniary interest in the matter\" and, he contends, there is \"no compelling evidence\" that Hume ever \"personally profited ... from the institution of plantation slavery\". However, Waldmann has argued that \"Hume sought to benefit\" from slavery, a reference to Hertford's role as Hume's patron and his brother Henry Seymour Conway's role as Hume's employer; by 1769 the family had procured a substantial pension for Hume.\nBailey describes Hume's March letter to Lord Hertford as the document that \"comes closest to raising serious doubts about the sincerity of Hume's published disavowals of chattel slavery\". He suggests that the letter \"might perhaps be seen as an instance of Hume allowing social convention and his personal obligations ... to lure him into an inappropriate degree of collusion with this scheme\". Danielle Charette describes the incident as one of \"personal hypocrisy\".\nAs to the charge of racism, based on the footnote Hume appended to his essay \"On National Characters\" in 1753, and had amended as an endnote for a posthumous 1777 edition, Hutton and Ashton acknowledge that its content is \"especially shocking\u2014and deeply puzzling\". Bailey describes it as \"highly prejudicial speculation\". Fieser suggests that Kendra Asher's discussion \"is the only one to date suggesting that the footnote might not represent Hume's true views\". Fieser suggests that Asher's interpretation \"must be taken seriously\", but stresses the need to \"address head on\" the indications that Hume both 'encouraged' and 'assisted' friends in the investment in a slave plantation.\nFinal years.\nIn 1767 Hume was appointed Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department. Here, he wrote that he was given \"all the secrets of the Kingdom\". In 1769 he returned to James' Court in Edinburgh, where he would live from 1771 until his death in 1776. Hume's nephew and namesake, David Hume of Ninewells (1757\u20131838), was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. He was a Professor of Scots Law at Edinburgh University and rose to be Principal Clerk of Session in the Scottish High Court and Baron of the Exchequer. He is buried with his uncle in Old Calton Cemetery.\nAutobiography.\nIn the last year of his life, Hume wrote an extremely brief autobiographical essay titled \"My Own Life\", summing up his entire life in \"fewer than 5 pages\"; it contains many judgements that have been of enduring interest to subsequent readers of Hume. Donald Seibert (1984), a scholar of 18th-century literature, judged it a \"remarkable autobiography, even though it may lack the usual attractions of that genre. Anyone hankering for startling revelations or amusing anecdotes had better look elsewhere.\"\nDespite condemning vanity as a dangerous passion, in his autobiography Hume confesses his belief that the \"love of literary fame\" had served as his \"ruling passion\" in life, and claims that this desire \"never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments\". One such disappointment Hume discusses in this account is in the initial literary reception of the \"Treatise\", which he claims to have overcome by means of the success of the \"Essays\": \"the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment\". Hume, in his own retrospective judgement, argues that his philosophical debut's apparent failure \"had proceeded more from the manner than the matter\". He thus suggests that \"I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early.\"\nHume also provides an unambiguous self-assessment of the relative value of his works: that \"my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject) is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best.\" He also wrote of his social relations: \"My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary\", noting of his complex relation to religion, as well as to the state, that \"though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury\". He goes on to profess of his character: \"My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct.\" Hume concludes the essay with a frank admission:\nI cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.\nDeath.\nThe diarist and biographer James Boswell saw Hume a few weeks before his death from a form of abdominal cancer. Hume told him that he sincerely believed it a \"most unreasonable fancy\" that there might be life after death. Hume asked for his body to be interred in a \"simple Roman tomb\", requesting in his will for it to be inscribed only with his name and the year of his birth and death, \"leaving it to Posterity to add the Rest\".\nHume died at the southwest corner of St Andrew's Square in Edinburgh's New Town, at what is now 21 Saint David Street. A popular story, consistent with some historical evidence and with the help of coincidence, suggests that the street was named after Hume.\nHis tomb stands, as he wished it, on the southwestern slope of Calton Hill, in the Old Calton Cemetery. Adam Smith later recounted Hume's amusing speculation that he might ask Charon, Hades' ferryman, to allow him a few more years of life in order to see \"the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition\". The ferryman replied, \"You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred years... Get into the boat this instant.\"\nWritings.\n\"A Treatise of Human Nature\" begins with the introduction: \"'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, more or less, to human nature... Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man.\" The science of man, as Hume explains, is the \"only solid foundation for the other sciences\" and that the method for this science requires both experience and observation as the foundations of a logical argument. In regards to this, philosophical historian Frederick Copleston (1999) suggests that it was Hume's aim to apply to the science of man the method of experimental philosophy (the term that was current at the time to imply natural philosophy), and that \"Hume's plan is to extend to philosophy in general the methodological limitations of Newtonian physics.\"\nUntil recently, Hume was seen as a forerunner of logical positivism, a form of anti-metaphysical empiricism. According to the logical positivists (in summary of their verification principle), unless a statement could be verified by experience, or else was true or false by definition (i.e., either tautological or contradictory), then it was meaningless. Hume, on this view, was a proto-positivist, who, in his philosophical writings, attempted to demonstrate the ways in which ordinary propositions about objects, causal relations, the self, and so on, are semantically equivalent to propositions about one's experiences.\nMany commentators have since rejected this understanding of Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that it is our knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.\nImpressions and ideas.\nA central doctrine of Hume's philosophy, stated in the very first lines of the \"Treatise of Human Nature\", is that the mind consists of perceptions, or the mental objects which are present to it, and which divide into two categories: \"All the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds, which I shall call impressions and ideas.\" Hume believed that it would \"not be very necessary to employ many words in explaining this distinction\", which commentators have generally taken to mean the distinction between \"feeling\" and \"thinking\". Controversially, Hume, in some sense, may regard the distinction as a matter of degree, as he takes \"impressions\" to be distinguished from ideas on the basis of their force, liveliness, and vivacity\u2014what Henry E. Allison (2008) calls the \"FLV criterion.\" \"Ideas\" are therefore \"faint\" impressions. For example, experiencing the painful sensation of touching a hot pan's handle is more forceful than simply thinking about touching a hot pan. According to Hume, \"impressions\" are meant to be the original form of all our ideas. From this, Don Garrett (2002) has coined the term \"copy principle,\" referring to Hume's doctrine that all ideas are ultimately copied from some original impression, whether it be a passion or sensation, from which they derive.\nSimple and complex.\nAfter establishing the forcefulness of impressions and ideas, these two categories are further broken down into \"simple\" and \"complex\": \"simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such as admit of no distinction nor separation\", whereas \"the complex are the contrary to these, and may be distinguished into parts\". When looking at an apple, a person experiences a variety of colour-sensations\u2014what Hume notes as a complex impression. Similarly, a person experiences a variety of taste-sensations, tactile-sensations, and smell-sensations when biting into an apple, with the overall sensation\u2014again, a complex impression. Thinking about an apple allows a person to form complex ideas, which are made of similar parts as the complex impressions they were developed from, but which are also less forceful. Hume believes that complex perceptions can be broken down into smaller and smaller parts until perceptions are reached that have no parts of their own, and these perceptions are thus referred to as simple.\nPrinciples of association.\nRegardless of how boundless it may seem; a person's imagination is confined to the mind's ability to recombine the information it has already acquired from the body's sensory experience (the ideas that have been derived from impressions). In addition, \"as our imagination takes our most basic ideas and leads us to form new ones, it is directed by three principles of association, namely, resemblance, contiguity, and cause and effect\":\nHume elaborates more on the last principle, explaining that, when somebody observes that one object or event consistently produces the same object or event, that results in \"an expectation that a particular event (a 'cause') will be followed by another event (an 'effect') previously and constantly associated with it\". Hume calls this principle \"custom\", or \"habit\", saying that \"custom...renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past\". However, even though custom can serve as a guide in life, it still only represents an expectation. In other words:\nExperience cannot establish a necessary connection between cause and effect, because we can imagine without contradiction a case where the cause does not produce its usual effect...the reason why we mistakenly infer that there is something in the cause that necessarily produces its effect is because our past experiences have habituated us to think in this way. \nContinuing this idea, Hume argues that \"only in the pure realm of ideas, logic, and mathematics, not contingent on the direct sense awareness of reality, [can] causation safely...be applied\u2014all other sciences are reduced to probability\". He uses this scepticism to reject metaphysics and many theological views on the basis that they are not grounded in fact and observations, and are therefore beyond the reach of human understanding.\nInduction and causation.\nThe cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the problem of induction. This may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human powers of reason is most pronounced. The problem revolves around the plausibility of inductive reasoning, that is, reasoning from the observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go \"beyond the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory\". Hume argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner, meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into the future, and throughout the unobserved present. Hume's argument is that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties\u2014demonstrative reasoning and probable reasoning\u2014and both of these are inadequate. With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is \"consistent and conceivable\" that nature might stop being regular. Turning to probable reasoning, Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform because it has been in the past. As this is using the very sort of reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be circular reasoning. Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our inductive inferences.\nHume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences. He asserts that \"Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable [\"sic\"] necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel.\" In 1985, and in agreement with Hume, John D. Kenyon writes:\nReason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment\u00a0... but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief.\nOthers, such as Charles Sanders Peirce, have demurred from Hume's solution, while some, such as Kant and Karl Popper, have thought that Hume's analysis has \"posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims\".\nThe notion of causation is closely linked to the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis of our concept of causation. At least three interpretations of Hume's theory of causation are represented in the literature:\nHume acknowledged that there are events constantly unfolding, and humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by prior events or are independent instances. He opposed the widely accepted theory of causation that 'all events have a specific course or reason'. Therefore, Hume crafted his own theory of causation, formed through his empiricist and sceptic beliefs. He split causation into two realms: \"All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact.\" Relations of Ideas are \"a priori\" and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed \"causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience\". He goes on to say that, even with the perspective of the past, humanity cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited, compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume's separation between Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas is often referred to as \"Hume's fork.\"\nHume explains his theory of causation and causal inference by division into three different parts. In these three branches he explains his ideas and compares and contrasts his views to his predecessors. These branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief. In the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors' theories of causation. Next, he uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader may have had while observing the Critical Phase. \"Habit or Custom\" mends the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realising it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It \"makes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past\". However, Hume says that this association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and distant future. This leads him to the third branch of causal inference, Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of the future is based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of causal inference, Hume is arguing that the future is not certain to be repetition of the past and that the only way to justify induction is through uniformity.\nThe logical positivist interpretation is that Hume analyses causal propositions, such as \"A causes B\", in terms of regularities in perception: \"A causes B\" is equivalent to \"Whenever A-type events happen, B-type ones follow\", where \"whenever\" refers to all possible perceptions. In his \"Treatise of Human Nature\", Hume wrote:\nPower and necessity...are...qualities of perceptions, not of objects...felt by the soul and not perceiv'd externally in bodies.\nThis view is rejected by sceptical realists, who argue that Hume thought that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of events. Hume said that, when two events are causally conjoined, a necessary connection underpins the conjunction:\nShall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means...there is a \"necessary connexion\" to be taken into consideration.\nAngela Coventry writes that, for Hume, \"there is nothing in any particular instance of cause and effect involving external objects which suggests the idea of power or necessary connection\" and \"we are ignorant of the powers that operate between objects\". However, while denying the possibility of knowing the powers between objects, Hume accepted the causal principle, writing: \"I never asserted so absurd a proposition as that something could arise without a cause.\"\nIt has been argued that, while Hume did not think that causation is reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully-fledged realist either. Simon Blackburn calls this a quasi-realist reading, saying that \"Someone talking of cause is voicing a distinct mental set: he is by no means in the same state as someone merely describing regular sequences.\" In Hume's words, \"nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation, which they occasion\".\n'Self'.\nEmpiricist philosophers, such as Hume and George Berkeley, favoured the bundle theory of personal identity. In this theory, \"the mind itself, far from being an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' without unity or cohesive quality\". The self is nothing but a bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. According to Hume:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by sound sleep; so long I am insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist.\u2014\u200a\nThis view is supported by, for example, positivist interpreters, who have seen Hume as suggesting that terms such as \"self\", \"person\", or \"mind\" refer to collections of \"sense-contents\". A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by Derek Parfit in his \"Reasons and Persons\".\nHowever, some philosophers have criticised Hume's bundle-theory interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can have perceptions that stand in relation to similarity and causality. Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct \"bundles\" before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality. In other words, the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an ontological question, philosophers like Galen Strawson see Hume as not very concerned with such questions and have queried whether this view is really Hume's. Instead, Strawson suggests that Hume might have been answering an epistemological question about the causal origin of our concept of the self. In the Appendix to the \"Treatise\", Hume declares himself dissatisfied with his earlier account of personal identity in Book 1. Corliss Swain notes that \"Commentators agree that if Hume did find some new problem\" when he reviewed the section on personal identity, \"he wasn't forthcoming about its nature in the Appendix.\" One interpretation of Hume's view of the self, argued for by the philosopher and psychologist James Giles, is that Hume is not arguing for a bundle theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative view of the self. Rather than reducing the self to a bundle of perceptions, Hume rejects the idea of the self altogether. On this interpretation, Hume is proposing a \"no-self theory\" and thus has much in common with Buddhist thought (see \"anatt\u0101\"). The psychologist Alison Gopnik has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought during his time in France in the 1730s.\nPractical reason.\n\"Practical reason\" relates to whether standards or principles exist that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people's intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume is not so much of an anti-rationalist as he is just a sceptic of practical reason.\nHume denied the existence of practical reason as a principle because he claimed reason does not have any effect on morality, since morality is capable of producing effects in people that reason alone cannot create. As Hume explains in \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" (1740):\nMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.\"\nSince practical reason is supposed to regulate our actions (in theory), Hume denied practical reason on the grounds that reason cannot directly oppose passions. As Hume puts it, \"Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\" Reason is less significant than any passion because reason has no original influence, while \"A passion is an original existence, or, if you will, modification of existence.\"\nPractical reason is also concerned with the value of actions rather than the truth of propositions, so Hume believed that reason's shortcoming of affecting morality proved that practical reason could not be authoritative for all rational beings, since morality was essential for dictating people's intentions and actions.\nEthics.\nHume's writings on ethics began in the 1740 \"Treatise\" and were refined in his \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals\" (1751). He understood \"feeling\", rather than \"knowing\", as that which governs ethical actions, stating that \"moral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment.\" Arguing that reason cannot be behind morality, he wrote:\nMorals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore, are not conclusions of our reason.\nHume's \"moral sentimentalism\" was shared by his close friend Adam Smith, and the two were mutually influenced by the moral reflections of their older contemporary, Francis Hutcheson. Peter Singer claims that Hume's argument that morals cannot have a rational basis alone \"would have been enough to earn him a place in the history of ethics.\"\nHume also put forward the \"is\u2013ought problem\", later known as \"Hume's Law\", denying the possibility of logically deriving what \"ought\" to be from what \"is\". According to the \"Treatise\" (1740), in every system of morality that Hume has read, the author begins by stating facts about the world as it \"is\" but always ends up suddenly referring to what \"ought\" to be the case. Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring what \"ought to be\" the case, from \"what is\" the case. This is because it \"seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others.\"\nHume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern-day meta-ethical theory, helping to inspire emotivism, and ethical expressivism and non-cognitivism, as well as Allan Gibbard's general theory of moral judgement and judgements of rationality.\nAesthetics.\nHume's ideas about aesthetics and the theory of art are spread throughout his works, but are particularly connected with his ethical writings, and also the essays \"Of the Standard of Taste\" and \"Of Tragedy\" (1757). His views are rooted in the work of Joseph Addison and Francis Hutcheson. In the \"Treatise\" (1740), he touches on the connection between beauty and deformity and vice and virtue. His later writings on the subject continue to draw parallels of beauty and deformity in art with conduct and character.\nIn \"Standard of Taste\", Hume argues that no rules can be drawn up about what is a tasteful object. However, a reliable critic of taste can be recognised as objective, sensible and unprejudiced, and as having extensive experience. \"Of Tragedy\" addresses the question of why humans enjoy tragic drama. Hume was concerned with the way spectators find pleasure in the sorrow and anxiety depicted in a tragedy. He argued that this was because the spectator is aware that he is witnessing a dramatic performance. There is pleasure in realising that the terrible events that are being shown are actually fiction. Furthermore, Hume laid down rules for educating people in taste and correct conduct, and his writings in this area have been very influential on English and Anglo-Saxon aesthetics.\nFree will, determinism, and responsibility.\nHume, along with Thomas Hobbes, is cited as a classical compatibilist about the notions of freedom and determinism. \"Compatibilism\" seeks to reconcile human freedom with the mechanist view that human beings are part of a deterministic universe, which is completely governed by physical laws. On this point, Hume was influenced greatly by the scientific revolution, particularly by Isaac Newton. Hume argued that the dispute between freedom and determinism continued over 2000 years due to ambiguous terminology. He wrote: \"From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot...we may presume that there is some ambiguity in the expression\", and that different disputants use different meanings for the same terms.\nHume defines the concept of necessity as \"the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together\", and liberty as \"a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will\". He then argues that, according to these definitions, not only are the two compatible, but liberty \"requires\" necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense, they would \"have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other\". But, if our actions are not thus connected to the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of \"chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence\". The philosopher John Passmore writes that confusion has arisen because \"necessity\" has been taken to mean \"necessary connexion\". Once this has been abandoned, Hume argues, \"liberty and necessity will be found not to be in conflict one with another\".\nMoreover, Hume goes on to argue that, in order to be held morally responsible, it is required that our behaviour be caused or necessitated, for:\nActions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some \"cause\" in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil.\nHume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity.\nEducation writer Richard Wright considers that Hume's position rejects a famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The Buridan's ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has separate bales of hay on both sides, which are of equal distances from him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy. The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However, Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not made on the basis of chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.\nHume's argument is supported by modern-day compatibilists such as R. E. Hobart, a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller. However, P. F. Strawson argued that the issue of whether we hold one another morally responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on such theses.\nReligion.\nThe philosopher Paul Russell (2005) contends that Hume wrote \"on almost every central question in the philosophy of religion\", and that these writings \"are among the most important and influential contributions on this topic.\" Touching on the philosophy, psychology, history, and anthropology of religious thought, Hume's 1757 dissertation \"The Natural History of Religion\" argues that the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all derive from earlier polytheistic religions. He went on to suggest that all religious belief \"traces, in the end, to dread of the unknown\". Hume had also written on religious subjects in the first \"Enquiry\", as well as later in the \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\".\nReligious views.\nAlthough he wrote a great deal about religion, Hume's personal views have been the subject of much debate. Some modern critics have described Hume's religious views as agnostic or have described him as a \"Pyrrhonian skeptic\". Contemporaries considered him to be an atheist, or at least un-Christian, enough so that the Church of Scotland seriously considered bringing charges of infidelity against him. Evidence of his un-Christian beliefs can especially be found in his writings on miracles, in which he attempts to separate historical method from the narrative accounts of miracles. Nevertheless, modern scholars have tended to dismiss the claims of Hume's contemporaries describing him as an atheist as coming from religiously intolerant people who did not understand Hume's philosophy. The fact that contemporaries suspected him of atheism is exemplified by a story Hume liked to tell:\nThe best theologian he ever met, he used to say, was the old Edinburgh fishwife who, having recognized him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull him out of the bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.\nHowever, in works such as \"Of Superstition and Enthusiasm\", Hume specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the Catholic Church, dismissing it with the standard Protestant accusations of superstition and idolatry, as well as dismissing as idolatry what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs. He also considered extreme Protestant sects, the members of which he called \"enthusiasts\", to be corrupters of religion. By contrast, in \"The Natural History of Religion\", Hume presents arguments suggesting that polytheism had much to commend it over monotheism. Additionally, when mentioning religion as a factor in his \"History of England\", Hume uses it to show the deleterious effect \"superstition and fanaticism\" has on human progress. In his \"Treatise of Human Nature\", Hume wrote: \"Generally speaking, the errors in religions are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.\"\nLou Reich (1998) argues that Hume was a religious naturalist and rejects interpretations of Hume as an atheist. Paul Russell (2008) writes that Hume was plainly sceptical about religious belief, although perhaps not to the extent of complete atheism. He suggests that Hume's position is best characterised by the term \"irreligion,\" while philosopher David O'Connor (2013) argues that Hume's final position was \"weakly deistic\". For O'Connor, Hume's \"position is deeply ironic. This is because, while inclining towards a weak form of deism, he seriously doubts that we can ever find a sufficiently favourable balance of evidence to justify accepting any religious position.\" He adds that Hume \"did not believe in the God of standard theism ... but he did not rule out all concepts of deity\", and that \"ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion\".\nDesign argument.\nOne of the traditional topics of natural theology is that of the existence of God, and one of the \"a posteriori\" arguments for this is the \"argument from design\" or the teleological argument. The argument is that the existence of God can be proved by the design that is obvious in the complexity of the world, which \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" states is \"the most popular\", because it is:\n...the most accessible of the theistic arguments ... which identifies evidences of design in nature, inferring from them a divine designer ... The fact that the universe as a whole is a coherent and efficiently functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine intelligence behind it.\nIn \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\", Hume wrote that the design argument seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents \"always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled\". The philosopher Louise E. Loeb (2010) notes that Hume is saying that only experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume:\nWe observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes.\nHume also criticised the argument in his \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\" (1779). Hume proposes a finite universe with a finite number of particles. Given infinite time, these particles could randomly fall into any arrangement, including our seemingly designed world.https://\nA century later, the idea of order without design was rendered more plausible by Charles Darwin's discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life result from the natural selection of inherited characteristics. For philosopher James D. Madden, it is \"Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition\".\nFinally, Hume discussed a version of the anthropic principle, which is the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the need to allow for man's existence in it as an observer. Hume has his sceptical mouthpiece Philo suggest that there may have been many worlds, produced by an incompetent designer, whom he called a \"stupid mechanic\". In his \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\", Hume wrote:\nMany worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity, ere this system was struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials made: and a slow, but continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of world-making.\nThe philosopher Daniel Dennett suggested that this mechanical explanation of teleology, although \"obviously\u00a0... an amusing philosophical fantasy\", anticipated the notion of natural selection, the 'continued improvement' being like \"any Darwinian selection algorithm\".\nArgument against miracles.\nIn his discussion of miracles, Hume argues that we should not believe miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with any reason to think God exists. In \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as \"a transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent\". Hume says we believe an event that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take into account those instances where the event did not occur:\nA wise man ... considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments. ... A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments ... and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.\nHume discusses the testimony of those who report miracles. He wrote that testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the facts themselves are not credible: \"[T]he evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual.\"\nAlthough Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history. He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even when false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in \"ignorant and barbarous nations\" and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Hume recognises that over a long period of time, various coincidences can provide the appearance of intention. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.\nHume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his \"Enquiry\". He states, \"I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures.\" Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of belief systems. It is a commonsense notion of veracity based upon epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality, proportionality and reasonability.\nThe criterion for assessing Hume's belief system is based on the balance of probability whether something is more likely than not to have occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of miracles.\nDespite all this, Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and that \"the gazing populace... receive greedily, without examination, whatever soothes superstition, and promotes wonder.\"\nCritics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise \u2013 to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers and those who have little to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many have argued that miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that \"there must be an ordinary course of nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream before anything can be interrupted.\" They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially problematic.\nLittle appreciated is the voluminous literature either foreshadowing Hume, in the likes of Thomas Sherlock or directly responding to and engaging with Hume\u2014from William Paley, William Adams, John Douglas, John Leland and George Campbell, among others. Regarding the latter, it is rumoured that, having read Campbell's Dissertation, Hume remarked that \"the Scotch theologue had beaten him.\"\nHume's main argument concerning miracles is that miracles by definition are singular events that differ from the established laws of nature. Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences. Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience should always be judged to be less than the probability that either one's senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous occurrence is lying or mistaken, Hume would say, all of which he had past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who, having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has frozen. By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the prince \"reasoned justly;\" it is presumably only when he has had extensive experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that the event could occur.\nSo, for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that anyone who \"is moved by faith to assent\" to revealed testimony \"is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.\" Hume writes that \"All the testimony whichever was really given for any miracle, or ever will be given, is a subject of derision.\"\nAs a historian of England.\nFrom 1754 to 1762 Hume published \"The History of England\", a six-volume work which extended (according to its subtitle) \"from the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688\". Inspired by Voltaire's sense of the breadth of history, Hume widened the focus of the field away from merely kings, parliaments, and armies, to literature and science as well. He argued that the quest for liberty was the highest standard for judging the past, and concluded that after considerable fluctuation, England at the time of his writing had achieved \"the most entire system of liberty that was ever known amongst mankind\". It \"must be regarded as an event of cultural importance. In its own day, moreover, it was an innovation, soaring high above its very few predecessors.\" Hume's \"History of England\" made him famous as a historian before he was ever considered a serious philosopher. In this work, Hume uses history to tell the story of the rise of England and what led to its greatness and the disastrous effects that religious fanaticism had on its progress. For Hume, the history of England's rise may give a template for others who would also like to rise to its current greatness.\nHume's \"The History of England\" was profoundly impacted by his Scottish background. The science of sociology, which is rooted in Scottish thinking of the eighteenth century, had never before been applied to British philosophical history. Because of his Scottish background, Hume was able to bring an outsider's lens to English history that the insulated English Whigs lacked.\nHume's coverage of the political upheavals of the 17th century relied in large part on the Earl of Clarendon's \"History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England\" (1646\u201369). Generally, Hume took a moderate royalist position and considered revolution unnecessary to achieve necessary reform. Hume was considered a Tory historian and emphasised religious differences more than constitutional issues. Laird Okie explains that \"Hume preached the virtues of political moderation, but\u00a0... it was moderation with an anti-Whig, pro-royalist coloring.\" For \"Hume shared the\u00a0... Tory belief that the Stuarts were no more high-handed than their Tudor predecessors\". \"Even though Hume wrote with an anti-Whig animus, it is, paradoxically, correct to regard the \"History\" as an establishment work, one which implicitly endorsed the ruling oligarchy\".\nHistorians have debated whether Hume posited a universal unchanging human nature, or allowed for evolution and development.\nThe debate between Tory and the Whig historians can be seen in the initial reception to Hume's \"History of England\". The Whig-dominated world of 1754 overwhelmingly disapproved of Hume's take on English history. In later editions of the book, Hume worked to \"soften or expunge many villainous Whig strokes which had crept into it.\"\nHume did not consider himself a pure Tory. Before 1745, he was more akin to an \"independent whig.\" In 1748, he described himself as \"a whig, though a very skeptical one\". This description of himself as in between Whiggism and Toryism, helps one understand that his \"History of England\" should be read as his attempt to work out his own philosophy of history.\nRobert Roth argues that Hume's histories display his biases against Presbyterians and Puritans. Roth says his anti-Whig pro-monarchy position diminished the influence of his work, and that his emphasis on politics and religion led to a neglect of social and economic history.\nHume was an early cultural historian of science. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change. He developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other. He covers over forty scientists, with special attention paid to Francis Bacon, Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton. Hume particularly praised William Harvey, writing about his treatise of the circulation of the blood: \"Harvey is entitled to the glory of having made, by reasoning alone, without any mixture of accident, a capital discovery in one of the most important branches of science.\"\nThe \"History\" became a best-seller and made Hume wealthy. It was influential for nearly a century, despite competition from imitations by Tobias Smollett (1757), Oliver Goldsmith (1771) and others. By 1894 there were at least 50 editions as well as abridgements for students, and illustrated pocket editions, probably produced specifically for women.\nPolitical theory.\nMany of Hume's political ideas, such as limited government, private property when there is scarcity, and constitutionalism, are first principles of liberalism. Thomas Jefferson banned the \"History\" from the University of Virginia, feeling that it had \"spread universal toryism over the land\". By comparison, Samuel Johnson thought Hume to be \"a Tory by chance [...] for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a Hobbist.\" A major concern of Hume's political philosophy is the importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political essays the importance of moderation in politics, public spirit, and regard to the community.\nThroughout the period of the American Revolution, Hume had varying views. For instance, in 1768 he encouraged total revolt on the part of the Americans. In 1775 he became certain that a revolution would take place and said that he believed in the American principle and wished the British government would let them be. Hume's influence on some of the American Founding Fathers can be seen in Benjamin Franklin's suggestion at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 that no high office in any branch of government should receive a salary, which is a suggestion Hume had made in his emendation of James Harrington's \"The Commonwealth of Oceana\".\nThe legacy of religious civil war in 18th-century Scotland, combined with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings, had fostered in Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and factionalism. These appeared to him to threaten the fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was deeply politically and religiously divided. Hume thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he also clarified that a republic must produce laws, while \"monarchy, when absolute, contains even something repugnant to law\".\nHume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious tyranny. However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two political parties, the Whigs and the Tories, explaining that \"my views of \"things\" are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of \"persons\" to Tory prejudices\".\nJerry Z. Muller argues that Hume's political thoughts have characteristics that later became typical for American and British conservatism, which contain more positive views of capitalism than conservatism does elsewhere. Neil McArthur writes that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. He characterises Hume as a \"precautionary conservative\", whose actions would have been \"determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate\". Hume supported the liberty of the press, and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. Douglass Adair has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for James Madison's writings, and the essay \"Federalist No. 10\" in particular.\nHume offered his view on the best type of society in an essay titled \"Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth\", which lays out what he thought was the best form of government. He hoped that \"in some future age, an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to form a new one, in some distant part of the world\". He defended a strict separation of powers, decentralisation, extending the franchise to anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the clergy. The system of the Swiss militia was proposed as the best form of protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and representatives were to be unpaid. The political philosophers Leo Strauss and Joseph Cropsey, writing of Hume's thoughts about \"the wise statesman\", say that he \"will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age\". Also, if he wishes to improve a constitution, his innovations will take account of the \"ancient fabric\", in order not to disturb society.\nIn the political analysis of the philosopher George Holland Sabine, the scepticism of Hume extended to the doctrine of government by consent. He notes that \"allegiance is a habit enforced by education and consequently as much a part of human nature as any other motive.\"\nIn the 1770s Hume was critical of British policies towards the American colonies and advocated for American independence. He wrote in 1771 that \"our union with America...in the nature of things, cannot long subsist.\"\nContributions to economic thought.\nHume expressed his economic views in his \"Political Discourses\", which were incorporated in \"Essays and Treatises\" as Part II of \"Essays, Moral and Political\". To what extent he was influenced by Adam Smith is difficult to assess; however, both of them had similar principles supported from historical events. At the same time Hume did not demonstrate concrete system of economic theory which could be observed in Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\". However, he introduced several new ideas around which the \"classical economics\" of the 18th century was built. Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are prevalent in the field of economics. This includes ideas on private property, inflation, and foreign trade. Referring to his essay \"Of the Balance of Trade\", the economist Paul Krugman (2012) has remarked that \"David Hume created what I consider the first true economic model.\"\nIn contrast to Locke, Hume believes that private property is not a natural right. Hume argues it is justified, because resources are limited. Private property would be an unjustified, \"idle ceremonial,\" if all goods were unlimited and available freely. Hume also believed in an unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus lead to impoverishment.\nDavid Hume anticipated modern monetarism. First, Hume contributed to the theory of quantity and of interest rate. Hume has been credited with being the first to prove that, on an abstract level, there is no quantifiable amount of nominal money that a country needs to thrive. Second, Hume has a theory of causation which fits in with the Chicago-school \"black box\" approach. According to Hume, cause and effect are related only through correlation. Hume shared the belief with modern monetarists that changes in the supply of money can affect consumption and investment. Lastly, Hume was a vocal advocate of a stable private sector, though also having some non-monetarist aspects to his economic philosophy. Having a stated preference for rising prices, for instance, Hume considered government debt to be a sort of substitute for actual money, referring to such debt as \"a kind of paper credit.\" He also believed in heavy taxation, believing that it increases effort.\nLegacy.\nDue to Hume's vast influence on contemporary philosophy, a large number of approaches in contemporary philosophy and cognitive science are today called \"Humean\".\nThe writings of Thomas Reid, a Scottish philosopher and contemporary of Hume, were often critical of Hume's scepticism. Reid formulated his \"common sense\" philosophy, in part, as a reaction against Hume's views.\nHume influenced, and was influenced by, the Christian philosopher Joseph Butler. Hume was impressed by Butler's way of thinking about religion, and Butler may well have been influenced by Hume's writings.\nAttention to Hume's philosophical works grew after the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, in his \"Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics\" (1783), credited Hume with awakening him from his \"dogmatic slumber\".\nAccording to Arthur Schopenhauer, \"there is more to be learned from each page of David Hume than from the collected philosophical works of Hegel, Herbart and Schleiermacher taken together\".\nA. J. Ayer, while introducing his classic exposition of logical positivism in 1936, claimed that his views were \"the logical outcome of the empiricism of Berkeley and David Hume\".\nAlbert Einstein, in 1915, wrote that he was inspired by Hume's positivism when formulating the theory of special relativity.\nHume's problem of induction was also of fundamental importance to the philosophy of Karl Popper. In his autobiography, \"Unended Quest\", he wrote: \"Knowledge\u00a0... is \"objective\"; and it is hypothetical or conjectural. This way of looking at the problem made it possible for me to reformulate Hume's \"problem of induction\".\" This insight resulted in Popper's major work \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\". In his \"Conjectures and Refutations\", he wrote that he \"approached the problem of induction through Hume\", since Hume was \"perfectly right in pointing out that induction cannot be logically justified\".\nHume's rationalism in religious subjects influenced, via the German-Scottish theologian Johann Joachim Spalding, the German neology school and rational theology, and contributed to the transformation of German theology in the Age of Enlightenment. Hume pioneered a comparative history of religion, tried to explain various rites and traditions as being based on deception and challenged various aspects of rational and natural theology, such as the argument from design.\nThe Danish theologian and philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard adopted \"Hume's suggestion that the role of reason is not to make us wise but to reveal our ignorance\", though taking it as a reason for the necessity of religious faith, or \"fideism\". The \"fact that Christianity is contrary to reason...is the necessary precondition for true faith\". The political theorist Isaiah Berlin, who has also pointed out the similarities between the arguments of Hume and Kierkegaard against rational theology, has written about Hume's influence on what Berlin calls the \"counter-Enlightenment\" and on German anti-rationalism. Berlin has also once said of Hume that \"no man has influenced the history of philosophy to a deeper or more disturbing degree\".\nIn 2003 the philosopher Jerry Fodor described Hume's \"Treatise\" as \"the founding document of cognitive science\".\nHume engaged with contemporary intellectuals including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, James Boswell and Adam Smith (who acknowledged Hume's influence on his economics and political philosophy). Morris and Brown write that Hume is \"generally regarded as one of the most important philosophers to write in English\".\nIn September 2020 the David Hume Tower, a University of Edinburgh building, was renamed to 40 George Square. This was following a campaign led by students of the university to rename it, in objection to Hume's writings related to race.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the Hollywood Ten, he refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1947 during the committee's investigation of Communist influences in the motion picture industry.\nTrumbo, the other members of the Hollywood Ten, and hundreds of other professionals in the industry were blacklisted by Hollywood. He continued working clandestinely on major films, writing under pseudonyms or other authors' names. His uncredited work won two Academy Awards for Best Story: for \"Roman Holiday\" (1953), which was presented to a front writer, and for \"The Brave One\" (1956), which was awarded to a pseudonym used by Trumbo. When he was given public screen credit for both \"Exodus\" and \"Spartacus\" in 1960, it marked the beginning of the end of the Hollywood Blacklist for Trumbo and other affected screenwriters. He finally was given full credit by the Writers' Guild for \"Roman Holiday\" in 2011, nearly 60 years after the fact, and 35 years after his death.\nOrigins.\nTrumbo was born in Montrose, Colorado, on December 9, 1905, the son of Orus Bonham Trumbo and Maud (n\u00e9e Tillery) Trumbo. His family moved to Grand Junction, Colorado, in 1908.\nHis paternal immigrant ancestor, a Protestant of Swiss origin named Jacob Trumbo, settled in the colony of Virginia in 1736. Orus Trumbo worked variously as a shoe clerk and collection agent, never earning enough to keep the family far from poverty.\nTrumbo graduated from Grand Junction High School. While still in high school, he worked for Walter Walker as a cub reporter for the \"Grand Junction Daily Sentinel,\" covering courts, the high school, the mortuary and civic organizations. He attended the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1924 and 1925, working as a reporter for the \"Boulder Daily Camera\" and contributing to the school's humor magazine, yearbook, and newspaper. He was a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity.\nIn 1924, Orus Trumbo relocated the family to California. Shortly after, he fell ill and died, leaving Dalton to support his mother and siblings. For nine years after his father died, Trumbo worked the night shift wrapping bread at a Los Angeles bakery and attended the University of California, Los Angeles (1926) and the University of Southern California (1928\u20131930). During this time, he wrote movie reviews, 88 short stories, and six novels, all of which were rejected for publication.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nTrumbo began his professional writing career in the early 1930s, when several of his articles and stories were published in mainstream magazines, including \"McCall's\", \"Vanity Fair\", the \"Hollywood Spectator\" and \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Trumbo was hired as managing editor of the \"Hollywood Spectator\" in 1934. Later he left the magazine to become a reader in the story department at Warner Bros. studio.\nHis first published novel, \"Eclipse\" (1935), was released during the Great Depression. Writing in the social realist style, Trumbo drew on his years in Grand Junction to portray a town and its people. The book was controversial in his hometown, where many people took issue with his fictional portrayal.\nTrumbo started working in movies in 1937 but continued writing prose. His anti-war novel \"Johnny Got His Gun\" won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1939. It was inspired by an article Trumbo had read several years earlier: an account of a hospital visit by the Prince of Wales to a Canadian soldier who had lost all his limbs in World War I.\nDuring the late 1930s and early 1940s, Trumbo became one of Hollywood's highest-paid screenwriters, at about $4,000 per week while on assignment, and earning as much as $80,000 in one year. He worked on such films as \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" (1944), \"Our Vines Have Tender Grapes\" (1945), and \"Kitty Foyle\" (1940), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\nPolitical advocacy and blacklisting.\nAligned with the Communist Party USA before the 1940s, Trumbo was an isolationist. He joined the Communist Party in 1943, and remained active until 1947. He reaffiliated himself with the party in 1954. His novel \"The Remarkable Andrew\" featured the ghost of President Andrew Jackson appearing to caution the United States against getting involved in World War II and in support of the Nazi-Soviet pact.\nShortly after Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Trumbo and his publisher decided to suspend reprinting \"Johnny Got His Gun\" until the end of the war. During the war, Trumbo received letters from individuals \"denouncing Jews\" and using \"Johnny\" to support their arguments for \"an immediate negotiated peace\" with Nazi Germany; Trumbo reported these correspondents to the FBI. Trumbo regretted this decision, which he called \"foolish\". After two FBI agents showed up at his home, he understood that \"their interest lay not in the letters but in me\".\nIn a 1946 article titled \"The Russian Menace\" published in Rob Wagner's \"Script Magazine\", Trumbo wrote from the perspective of a post-World War II Russian citizen. He argued that Russians were likely fearful of the mass of U.S. military power that surrounded them, at a time when any sympathetic view toward Communist countries was viewed with suspicion. He ended the article by stating, \"If I were a Russian ... I would be alarmed, and I would petition my government to take measures at once against what would seem an almost certain blow aimed at my existence. This is how it must appear in Russia today\". He argued that the U.S. was a \"menace\" to Russia, rather than the more popular American view of Russia as the \"red menace\". According to author Kenneth Billingsley, Trumbo had bragged in \"The Daily Worker\" that Communist influence in Hollywood had prevented films from being made from anti-Communist books, such as Arthur Koestler's \"Darkness at Noon\" and \"The Yogi and the Commissar\".\nWilliam R. Wilkerson, publisher and founder of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", published a July 29, 1946, \"TradeView\" column entitled \"A Vote For Joe Stalin\". It named Trumbo and several others as Communist sympathizers, the first persons identified on what became known as \"Billy's Blacklist\". In October 1947, drawing upon these names, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) summoned Trumbo and nine others to testify for their investigation as to whether Communist agents and sympathizers had surreptitiously planted propaganda in U.S. films. The writers refused to give information about their own or any other person's involvement and were convicted for contempt of Congress. They appealed the conviction to the Supreme Court on First Amendment grounds and lost. Trumbo served eleven months in the federal penitentiary in Ashland, Kentucky, in 1950. In the 1976 documentary \"Hollywood On Trial\", Trumbo said: \"As far as I was concerned, it was a completely just verdict. I had contempt for that Congress and have had contempt for it ever since. And on the basis of guilt or innocence, I could never really complain very much. That this was a crime or misdemeanor was the complaint, my complaint.\"\nThe MPAA issued a statement that Trumbo and his compatriots would not be permitted to work in the industry unless they disavowed Communism under oath. After completing his sentence, Trumbo sold his ranch and moved his family to Mexico City with Hugo Butler and his wife Jean Rouverol, who had also been blacklisted. In Mexico, Trumbo wrote 30 scripts (under pseudonyms) for B-movie studios such as King Brothers Productions. In the case of \"Gun Crazy\" (1950), adapted from a short story by MacKinlay Kantor, Kantor agreed to be the front for Trumbo's screenplay. Trumbo's role in the screenplay was not revealed until 1992.\nDuring this blacklist period, Trumbo also wrote \"The Brave One\" (1956) for the King Brothers. Like \"Roman Holiday\", it received an Academy Award for Best Story he could not claim. The script was credited to Robert Rich, a name borrowed from a nephew of the producers. Trumbo recalled earning an average fee of $1,750 per film for 18 screenplays written in two years and said, \"None was very good\".\nHe published \"The Devil in the Book\", an analysis of the conviction of 14 California Smith Act defendants, in 1956. The statute set criminal penalties for advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government and required all non-citizen adult residents to register with the government.\nLater career.\nIngo Preminger, the brother of producer-director Otto Preminger, was Dalton Trumbo's agent. Otto Preminger hired Trumbo to write a screenplay for the film he intended to adapt from Leon Uris' 1958 novel \"Exodus\" when the script he had commissioned from Uris was deemed unusable. The producer-director decided to give Trumbo the screen credit. Shortly thereafter, actor Kirk Douglas announced Trumbo had written the screenplay for Stanley Kubrick's film \"Spartacus\" (also 1960), adapted from the 1951 novel by Howard Fast. With these actions, Preminger and Douglas helped end the power of the blacklist.\nTrumbo was reinstated into the Writers Guild of America, West and was credited on all subsequent scripts. The guild finally gave him full credit for the script of the 1953 film \"Roman Holiday\" in 2011. Trumbo directed the 1971 film adaptation of his novel \"Johnny Got His Gun\", starring Timothy Bottoms, Diane Varsi, Jason Robards and Donald Sutherland. One of the last films Trumbo wrote, \"Executive Action\" (1973), was based on the John F. Kennedy assassination. The Academy officially recognized Trumbo as the winner of the Oscar for the 1956 film \"The Brave One\" in 1975, presenting him with a statuette.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1938, Trumbo married Cleo Fincher, who was born in Fresno, California, on July 17, 1916, and had moved with her divorced mother and her brother and sister to Los Angeles. The Trumbos had three children: Nikola Trumbo (1939\u20132018), who became a psychotherapist; Christopher Trumbo (1940\u20132011), a filmmaker and screenwriter who became an expert on the Hollywood blacklist; and Melissa Trumbo (1945), known as Mitzi, a photographer. Mitzi Trumbo dated comedian Steve Martin when they were both in their early 20s, which is recounted in Martin's 2007 book \"Born Standing Up\". Martin wrote of her: \"Mitzi became my official photographer, and she snapped dozens of rolls of film, all to find the perfect publicity photo.\"\nCleo Trumbo died of natural causes at the age of 93 on October 9, 2009, at the home she shared with Mitzi Trumbo in Los Altos, California.\nDeath and legacy.\nTrumbo died in 1976, in Los Angeles of a heart attack at the age of 70. He donated his body to scientific research.\nIn 1993, Trumbo was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for writing \"Roman Holiday\" (1953). The screen credit and award were previously given to Ian McLellan Hunter, who had been a front for Trumbo. A new statue was made for this award because Hunter's son refused to hand over the one his father had received.\nIn 2003, Christopher Trumbo mounted an Off-Broadway play based on his father's letters, called \"Trumbo: Red, White and Blacklisted\", in which a wide variety of actors played his father during the run, including Nathan Lane, Tim Robbins, Brian Dennehy, Ed Harris, Chris Cooper and Gore Vidal. He adapted it as the documentary \"Trumbo\" (2007), which added archival footage and new interviews.\nA dramatization of Trumbo's life, also called \"Trumbo\", was released in November 2015. It starred Bryan Cranston in the title role and was directed by Jay Roach. For his portrayal of Trumbo, Cranston was nominated for Best Actor at the 88th Academy Awards.\nThe moving image collection of Trumbo is held at the Academy Film Archive and consists primarily of extensive 35\u00a0mm production materials relating to the 1971 anti-war film \"Johnny Got His Gun\". In 2016, more than a hundred years after his birth, Trumbo was honored by the installation of a statue of him in front of the Avalon Theater on Main Street in Grand Junction, Colorado, his home town. He was depicted writing a screenplay in a bathtub.\nTrumbo is featured in the 2024 biographical historical drama \"Reagan\" about U.S. president Ronald Reagan. He is portrayed by Sean Hankinson.\nWorks.\nSelected film works\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNovels, plays and essays\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNon-fiction\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7930", "revid": "51059816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7930", "title": "Delaware", "text": "U.S. state\nDelaware ( ) is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic regions of the United States. It borders Maryland to its south and west, Pennsylvania to its north, New Jersey to its northeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east. The state's name derives from the adjacent Delaware Bay, which in turn was named after Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and the Colony of Virginia's first colonial-era governor.\nDelaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula, and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. It is the second-smallest and sixth-least populous state, but also the sixth-most densely populated. Delaware's most populous city is Wilmington, and the state's capital is Dover, the second-most populous city in Delaware. The state is divided into three counties, the fewest number of counties of any of the 50 U.S. states; from north to south, the three counties are: New Castle County, Kent County, and Sussex County. The southern two counties, Kent and Sussex, have historically been predominantly agrarian economies. New Castle is more urbanized and is considered part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Delaware is considered part of the Southern United States by the U.S. Census Bureau, but the state's geography, culture, and history are a hybrid of the Mid-Atlantic, Northeastern, and Southern regions of the country.\nBefore the Delaware coastline was explored and developed by Europeans in the 17th century, the state was inhabited by several Native American tribes, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south. The state was first colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near present-day Lewes, Delaware, in 1631. Delaware was one of the Thirteen Colonies that participated in the American Revolution against Great Britain, which established the United States as an independent nation. On December 7, 1787, Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution of the United States, earning it the nickname \"The First State\".\nSince the turn of the 20th century, Delaware has become an onshore corporate haven whose corporate laws are deemed appealing to corporations; over half of all New York Stock Exchange-listed corporations and over three-fifths of the \"Fortune\" 500 are legally incorporated in Delaware. Over 90% of all U.S. based companies that went public in 2021 incorporated themselves in Delaware.\nEtymology.\nDelaware was named after its location on the Delaware Bay, which in turn derived its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (1577\u20131618), the first governor of the Colony of Virginia. The Delaware people, a name used by Europeans for Lenape people Indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.\nThe name \"de La Warr\" was derived from Sussex and is of Anglo-French origin. It came probably from a Norman lieu-dit \"La Guerre\". This toponymic likely derived from Latin \"ager\", the Breton \"gwern\" or from the Late Latin (fallow). The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire, (the sound [\u00e4] often mutated in [\u00e6]) also appear in historical texts cited by Lucien Musset, where the word \"ga(i)ra\" means gore. It could also be linked with a patronymic from the Old Norse \"verr\".\nHistory.\nNative Americans.\nBefore Delaware was settled by European colonists, the present-day state was home to the Eastern Algonquian tribes known as the Unami Lenape, or Delaware, who lived mostly along the coast, and the Nanticoke who occupied much of the southern Delmarva Peninsula. John Smith also shows two Iroquoian tribes, the Kuskarawock and Tockwogh, living north of the Nanticoke\u2014they may have held small portions of land in the western part of the state before migrating across the Chesapeake Bay. The Kuskarawocks were most likely the Tuscarora.\nThe Unami Lenape in the Delaware Valley were closely related to Munsee Lenape tribes along the Hudson River. They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or Susquehannock. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the Iroquois of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the Allegheny Mountains by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.\nColonial Delaware.\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at Zwaanendael, near the site of Lewes in 1631. Within a year, all the settlers were killed in a dispute with Native American tribes living in the area. In 1638, New Sweden, a Swedish trading post and colony, was established at Fort Christina (now in Wilmington) by Peter Minuit at the head of a group of Swedes, Finns and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years. In 1651, the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of Peter Stuyvesant, established a fort at present-day New Castle and, in 1655, they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch New Netherland. Only nine years later, in 1664, the Dutch were conquered by a fleet of English ships by Sir Robert Carr under the direction of James, the Duke of York. Fighting off a prior claim by Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, Proprietor of Maryland, the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to William Penn in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his Pennsylvania province and leased what then came to be known as the \"Lower Counties on the Delaware\" from the Duke.\nPenn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the province of Pennsylvania had grown so large their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties, and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at Philadelphia, and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique; from 1703 to 1738, New York and New Jersey shared a governor. Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.\nDependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English immigrants decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.\nAmerican Revolution.\nLike the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with Britain. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.\nNew Castle lawyer Thomas McKean denounced the Stamp Act in the strongest terms, and Kent County native John Dickinson became the \"Penman of the Revolution\". Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, Patriot leaders Thomas McKean and Caesar Rodney convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware's majority, George Read, could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.\nInitially led by John Haslet, Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the Continental Army, known as the \"Delaware Blues\" and nicknamed the \"Blue Hen's Chicks\". In August 1777 General Sir William Howe led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the Battle of Brandywine and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the Battle of Cooch's Bridge, fought on September 3, 1777, at Cooch's Bridge in New Castle County, although there was a minor Loyalist rebellion in 1778.\nFollowing the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and State President John McKinly was taken prisoner. The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active Loyalist portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.\nFollowing the American Revolution, statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.\nSlavery and race.\nMany colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, where the population had been increasing rapidly. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on labor-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African slaves because of a decline in working class immigrants from England. Most of the English colonists had arrived as indentured servants (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid.\nMost of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men. Under slavery law, children took the social status of their mothers, so children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, just as children born to enslaved women were born into slavery. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened.\nBy the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves' labor. In addition local Methodists and Quakers encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810, three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves. In 1840, Delaware's population was 78,085 of whom 2,605 were slaves. By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves.\nAlthough attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice. By the 1860 census on the verge of the Civil War, 91.7% of the black population were free; 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 \"free colored persons\".\nAn independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave Peter Spencer as the \"Union Church of Africans\". This followed the 1793 establishment in Philadelphia of the African Methodist Episcopal Church by Richard Allen, which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816. Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination. This was renamed as the African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection, more commonly known as the A.U.M.P. Church. In 1814, Spencer called for the first annual gathering, known as the Big August Quarterly, which continues to draw members of this denomination and their descendants together in a religious and cultural festival.\nDelaware voted against secession on January 3, 1861, and so remained in the Union. While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in Maryland and Virginia Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. Delaware essentially freed the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War but rejected the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869. Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments on February 12, 1901, decades after they had already come into force.\nReconstruction and industrialization.\nDuring the Reconstruction Era that followed the Civil War, Democratic Redeemer governments led by the South's Bourbon aristocracy continued to dominate the region and imposed explicitly white supremacist regimes in the former slave states. The Delaware legislature declared Black people to be second-class citizens in 1866, and restricted their voting rights despite the 15th Amendment, ensuring continued Democratic success in the state throughout most of the 19th century. Fearful that the 1875 Civil Rights Act passed by Congress might establish racial equality, Delaware legislators passed Jim Crow laws that mandated segregation in public facilities. The state's educational system was segregated by operation of law. Delaware's segregation was written into the state constitution, which, while providing at Article X, Section 2, that \"no distinction shall be made on account of race or color\", nonetheless required that \"separate schools for white and colored children shall be maintained.\"\nBeginning in the late 19th century, the Wilmington area grew into a manufacturing center. Investment in manufacturing in the city grew from $5.5\u00a0million in 1860 to $44\u00a0million in 1900. The most notable manufacturer in the state was the chemical company DuPont, which to this day is heavily credited with making the state what it is today in many ways. Because of Wilmington's growth, local politicians from the city and New Castle County pressured the state government to adopt a new constitution providing the north with more representation. However, the subsequent 1897 constitution did not proportionally represent the north and continued to give the southern counties disproportionate influence.\nAs manufacturing expanded, businesses became major players in state affairs and funders of politicians through families such as the Du Ponts. Republican John Addicks attempted to buy a US Senate seat multiple times in a rivalry with the Du Ponts until the passage of the 17th Amendment. The allegiance of industries with the Republican party allowed them to gain control of the state's governorship throughout most of the 20th century. The GOP ensured black people could vote because of their general support for Republicans and thus undid restrictions on Black suffrage.\nDelaware benefited greatly from World War I because of the state's large gunpowder industry. DuPont, the most dominant business in the state by WWI, produced an estimated 40% of all gunpowder used by the Allies during the war. It produced nylon in the state after the war and began investments into General Motors. Additionally, the company invested heavily in the expansion of public schools in the state and colleges such as the University of Delaware in the 1910s and 1920s. This included primary and secondary schools for Black people and women. Delaware suffered less during the Great Depression than other states, but the depression spurred further migration from the rural south to urban areas.\nWorld War II to present.\nLike in World War I, the state enjoyed a big stimulus to its gunpowder and shipyard industries in World War II. New job opportunities during and after the war in the Wilmington area coaxed Black people from the southern counties to move to the city. The proportion of blacks constituting the city's population rose from 15% in 1950 to over 50% by 1980. The surge of Black migrants to the north sparked white flight, in which middle class whites moved from the city to suburban areas, leading to \"de facto\" segregation of Northern Delaware's society. In the 1940s and 1950s, Delaware attempted to integrate its schools, although the last segregated school in the state did not close until 1970. The University of Delaware admitted its first black student in 1948, and local courts ruled that primary schools had to be integrated. Delaware's integration efforts partially inspired the US Supreme Court's decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", which found racial segregation in United States public schools to be unconstitutional. The result of the \"Brown\" ruling was that Delaware became fully integrated, albeit with time and much effort.\nIn October 1954, the city of Milford became the scene of one of the country's first pro-segregation boycotts after eleven Black students were enrolled in the previously all-white Milford High School. Mass protests continued in Milford; the school board eventually ceded to the protestors, expelling the Black students. The ensuing unrest, which included cross burnings, rallies, and pro-segregation demonstrations, contributed to desegregation in most of Southern Delaware being delayed for another ten years. Sussex County did not start closing or integrating its segregated schools until 1965, 11 years after the \"Brown\" ruling. Throughout the state, integration only encouraged more white flight, and poor economic conditions for the black population led to some violence during the 1960s. Riots broke out in Wilmington in 1967 and again in 1968 in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, after which the National Guard occupied the city for nine months to prevent further violence.\nSince WWII, the state has been generally economically prosperous and enjoyed relatively high per capita income because of its location between major cities like Philadelphia, New York, and Washington, DC. Its population grew rapidly, particularly in the suburbs in the north where New Castle county became an extension of the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Americans, including migrants from Puerto Rico, and immigrants from Latin America flocked to the state. By 1990, only 50% of Delaware's population consisted of natives to the state.\nGeography.\nDelaware is long and ranges from across, with a land area of and a total area of , making it the second-smallest state by either metric in the United States after Rhode Island. Delaware is bounded to the north by Pennsylvania; to the east by the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, New Jersey, and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west and south by Maryland. Small portions of Delaware are also situated on the eastern side of the Delaware River sharing land boundaries with New Jersey. The state of Delaware, together with the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and two counties of Virginia, form the Delmarva Peninsula, which stretches down the Mid-Atlantic Coast.\nThe definition of the northern boundary of the state is unusual. Most of the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania was originally defined by an arc extending from the cupola of the courthouse in the city of New Castle. This boundary is often referred to as the Twelve-Mile Circle. Although the Twelve-Mile Circle is often claimed to be the only territorial boundary in the U.S. that is a true arc, the Mexican boundary with Texas includes several arcs, and many cities in the South (such as Plains, Georgia) also have circular boundaries.\nThis border extends all the way east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then continues south along the shoreline until it again reaches the arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way in the middle of the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River.\nOn the west, Delaware and Maryland are mostly separated by a line running from the midpoint of the Transpeninsular Line, going slightly west of due north up to its tangent point on the Twelve-Mile Circle. The border follows the Circle for a short distance and then continues in a straight line due north until reaching the southern border of Pennsylvania. The Wedge of land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed.\nTopography.\nDelaware is on a level plain, with the lowest mean elevation of any state in the nation. Its highest elevation, located at Ebright Azimuth, near Concord High School, is less than above sea level. The northernmost part of the state is part of the Piedmont Plateau with hills and rolling surfaces.\nThe Atlantic Seaboard fall line approximately follows the Robert Kirkwood Highway between Newark and Wilmington; south of this road is the Atlantic Coastal Plain with flat, sandy, and, in some parts, swampy ground. A ridge about high extends along the western boundary of the state and separates the watersheds that feed Delaware River and Bay to the east and the Chesapeake Bay to the west.\nClimate.\nSince almost all of Delaware is a part of the Atlantic coastal plain, the effects of the ocean moderate its climate. The state lies in the humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfa\") zone. Despite its small size (roughly from its northernmost to southernmost points), there is significant variation in mean temperature and amount of snowfall between Sussex County and New Castle County. Moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay, the southern portion of the state has a milder climate and a longer growing season than the northern portion of the state.\nSummers are long, hot, and humid in Delaware, often with intense (but brief) late day thundershowers. Delaware averages 2,300 hrs of sunshine annually (higher than the USA average). Winters are modestly cool to cold in northern Delaware, and cool to mild in southern Delaware. The normal seasonal snowfall ranges from about 20.0 inches in Wilmington to only 10.0 inches in Lewes. In many winters no snow will fall in coastal Delaware. Northern Delaware falls into USDA Garden Zone 7a, while southern and coastal areas fall into USDA zone 7b and 8a. The milder climate in southern Delaware allows for subtropical flora such as the windmill palm, needle palm, and dwarf palmetto.\nDelaware's all-time record high of was recorded at Millsboro on July 21, 1930. The all-time record low of was also recorded at Millsboro, on January 17, 1893. The hardiness zones are 7B and 8A at the Delaware Beaches.\nEnvironment.\nThe transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation. In the northern third of the state are found Northeastern coastal forests and mixed oak forests typical of the northeastern United States. In the southern two-thirds of the state are found Middle Atlantic coastal forests. Trap Pond State Park, along with areas in other parts of Sussex County, for example, support the northernmost stands of bald cypress trees in North America.\nEnvironmental management.\nDelaware provides government subsidy support for the clean-up of property \"lightly contaminated\" by hazardous waste, the proceeds for which come from a tax on wholesale petroleum sales.\nMunicipalities.\nWilmington is the state's most populous city (70,635) and its economic hub. It is located within commuting distance of both Philadelphia and Baltimore. Dover is the state capital and the second most populous city (38,079).\nUnincorporated places.\nThe table below lists the ten largest municipalities in the state based on the 2020 United States census.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe United States Census Bureau determined that the population of Delaware was 989,948 on April 1, 2020, an increase from the 2010 census figure of 897,934.\nDelaware's history as a border state has led it to exhibit characteristics of both the Northern and the Southern regions of the United States. Generally, the rural Southern (or \"Slower Lower\") regions of Delaware below the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal embody a Southern culture, while densely populated Northern Delaware above the canal\u2014particularly Wilmington, a part of the Philadelphia metropolitan area\u2014has more in common with that of the Northeast and the North. The U.S. Census Bureau designates Delaware as one of the South Atlantic States, but it is commonly associated with the Mid-Atlantic States or northeastern United States by other federal agencies, the media, and some residents.\nDelaware is the sixth most densely populated state, with a population density of 442.6 people per square mile, 356.4 per square mile more than the national average, and ranking 45th in population. Delaware is one of five U.S. states (Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming) that do not have a single city with a population over 100,000 as of the 2010 census. The center of population of Delaware is in New Castle County, in the town of Townsend.\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,369 homeless people in Delaware.\nRace and ethnicity.\nAccording to the 2010 United States census, the racial composition of the state was 68.9% White American (65.3% Non-Hispanic White, 3.6% White Hispanic), 21.4% Black or African American, 0.5% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian American, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 3.4% some other race, and 2.7% of multiracial origin. People of Hispanic or Latino origin, of any race, made up 8.2% of the population.\nThe 2022 American Community Survey estimated the state had a racial and ethnic makeup of 60.6% non-Hispanic whites, 23.6% Black or African American, 0.7% American Indian or Alaska Native, 4.2% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 2.9% multiracial, and 10.1% Hispanic or Latin American of any race.\nIn the Native American community, the state has a Native American group, called in their own language Lenape, which was influential in the colonial period of the United States and is today headquartered in Cheswold, Kent County, Delaware. A band of the Nanticoke tribe of American Indians today resides in Sussex County and is headquartered in Millsboro, Sussex County, Delaware.\nDelaware's population mainly consisted of people from the British Isles, African slaves, Germans and a few remaining Native Americans during the colonial era. Irish, Germans, Italians, Poles, and Russian Jewish immigrants were attracted by the industries in the Wilmington area. In the late 20th century a Puerto Rican community formed in Wilmington. Guatemalan people migrated to Sussex county to work in Delaware's poultry industry. A group of Native Americans in Delaware of mixed ethnicity, the Moors, live in Cheswold. The descendants of the Nanticoke people live around Millsboro. There is also a small numbers of Asians in New Castle county who work as scientific and engineering professionals.\nThe top countries of origin for Delaware's immigrants in 2018 were Mexico, India, Guatemala, China, and Jamaica.\nBirth data.\n\"Note: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\"\nLanguages.\nIn 2000, 91% of Delaware residents of age5 and older spoke only English at home; 5% spoke Spanish. French was the third most spoken language, used by 0.7% of the population, followed by Chinese (0.5%) and German (0.5%). Legislation has been proposed in both the House and the Senate in Delaware to designate English as the official language. Neither bill was passed in the legislature.\nSexual orientation.\nA 2012 Gallup poll found that Delaware's proportion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender adults stood at 3.4% of the population. This constitutes a total LGBT adult population estimate of 23,698 people. The number of same-sex couple households in 2010 stood at 2,646. This grew by 41.65% from a decade earlier. On July 1, 2013, same-sex marriage was legalized, and all civil unions were converted into marriages.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe predominant religion practiced in Delaware is Christianity. A 2014 estimate by the Pew Research Center found that members of Protestant churches accounted for almost half of the population, though the Roman Catholic Church was the largest single denomination in the state. By 2020, the Public Religion Research Institute determined 61% of the population was Christian. In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute's survey revealed 60% were Christian, followed by Jews (3%), Hindus (1%), and New Agers (1%).\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives reported in 2010 that the three largest Christian denominational groups in Delaware by number of adherents are the Catholic Church at 182,532 adherents, the United Methodist Church with 53,656 members reported, and non-denominational evangelical Protestants, who numbered 22,973. In 2020, the Association of Religion Data Archives reported the largest Christian denominations were the Catholic Church with 197,094; non-denominational Protestants with 49,392, and United Methodists with 39,959.\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington and the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware oversee the parishes within their denominations. The A.U.M.P. Church, the oldest African-American denomination in the nation, was founded in Wilmington. It still has a substantial presence in the state. Reflecting new immigrant populations, an Islamic mosque has been built in the Ogletown area, and a Hindu temple in Hockessin.\nDelaware is home to an Amish community which resides west of Dover in Kent County, consisting of nine church districts and about 1,650 people. The Amish first settled in Kent County in 1915. In recent years, increasing development has led to the decline in the number of Amish living in the community.\nA 2012 survey of religious attitudes in the United States found that 34% of Delaware residents considered themselves \"moderately religious\", 33% \"very religious\", and 33% as \"non-religious\". At the 2014 Pew Research survey, 23% of the population were irreligious; the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute's survey determined 31% of the population were irreligious. In 2022, the same study showed 33% of the population as irreligious.\nEconomy.\nAffluence.\nAccording to a 2020 study by Kiplinger, Delaware had the 17th most millionaires per capita in the United States; altogether, there were 25,937 such individuals. The median income for Delaware households as of 2020 was $64,805.\nAgriculture.\nDelaware's agricultural output consists of poultry, nursery stock, soybeans, dairy products and corn.\nIndustries.\nAs of October\u00a02019[ [update]], the state's unemployment rate was 3.7%.\nThe state's largest employers are:\nIndustrial decline.\nSince the mid-2000s, Delaware has seen the departure of the state's automotive manufacturing industry (General Motors Wilmington Assembly and Chrysler Newark Assembly), the corporate buyout of a major bank holding company (MBNA), the departure of the state's steel industry (Evraz Claymont Steel), the bankruptcy of a fiber mill (National Vulcanized Fiber), and the diminishing presence of AstraZeneca in Wilmington.\nIn late 2015, DuPont announced that 1,700 employees, nearly a third of its footprint in Delaware, would be laid off in early 2016. The merger of E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. and Dow Chemical Company into DowDuPont took place on September 1, 2017.\nIncorporation in Delaware.\nMore than half of all U.S. publicly traded companies, and 63% of the Fortune 500, are incorporated in Delaware. The state's attractiveness as a corporate haven is largely because of its business-friendly corporation law. Franchise taxes on Delaware corporations supply about a fifth of the state's revenue. Although \"USA (Delaware)\" ranked as the world's most opaque jurisdiction on the Tax Justice Network's 2009 Financial Secrecy Index, the same group's 2011 Index ranks the U.S. fifth and does not specify Delaware. In Delaware, there are more than a million registered corporations, meaning there are more corporations than people.\nFood and drink.\n stipulates that alcoholic liquor be sold only in specifically licensed establishments, and only between 9:00a.m. and 1:00a.m. Until 2003, Delaware was among the several states enforcing blue laws and banned the sale of liquor on Sunday.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nTwo daily newspapers are based in Delaware, the \"Delaware State News\", based in Dover and covering the two southern counties, and \"The News Journal\" covering Wilmington and northern Delaware. The state is also served by several weekly, monthly and online publications.\nTelevision.\nNo standalone television stations are based solely in Delaware. The northern part of the state is served by network stations in Philadelphia and the southern part by network stations in Salisbury, Maryland. Philadelphia's ABC affiliate, WPVI-TV, maintains a news bureau in downtown Wilmington. Salisbury's CBS affiliate, WBOC-TV, maintains bureaus in Dover and Milton. Three Philadelphia-market stations\u2014PBS member WHYY-TV, Ion affiliate WPPX, and MeTV affiliate WDPN-TV\u2014all have Wilmington as their city of license, but maintain transmitters at the market antenna farm in Roxborough, Philadelphia and do not produce any Delaware-centric programming.\nRadio.\nThere are a numerous radio stations licensed in Delaware. WDDE 91.1 FM, WDEL 1150AM, WHGE-LP 95.3 FM, WILM 1450 AM, WVCW 99.5, WMPH 91.7 FM, WSTW 93.7 FM, WTMC 1380 AM and WWTX 1290AM are licensed from Wilmington. WRDX 92.9 FM is licensed from Smyrna. WDOV 1410AM, WDSD 94.7 FM and WRTX 91.7 FM are licensed from Dover.\nTourism.\nDelaware is home to First State National Historical Park, a National Park Service unit composed of historic sites across the state including the New Castle Court House, Green, and Sheriff's House, Dover Green, Beaver Valley, Fort Christina, Old Swedes' Church, John Dickinson Plantation, and the Ryves Holt House. Delaware has several museums, , , , , and other .\nRehoboth Beach, together with the towns of Lewes, Dewey Beach, Bethany Beach, South Bethany, and Fenwick Island, comprise Delaware's beach resorts. Rehoboth Beach often bills itself as \"The Nation's Summer Capital\" because it is a frequent summer vacation destination for Washington, D.C., residents as well as visitors from Maryland, Virginia, and in lesser numbers, Pennsylvania. Vacationers are drawn for many reasons, including the town's charm, artistic appeal, nightlife, and tax-free shopping. According to SeaGrant Delaware, the Delaware beaches generate $6.9billion annually and over $711million in tax revenue.\nDelaware is home to several festivals, fairs, and events. Some of the more notable festivals are the Riverfest held in Seaford, the World Championship Punkin Chunkin formerly held at various locations throughout the state since 1986, the Rehoboth Beach Chocolate Festival, the Bethany Beach Jazz Funeral to mark the end of summer, the Apple Scrapple Festival held in Bridgeville, the Clifford Brown Jazz Festival in Wilmington, the Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival, the Sea Witch Halloween Festival and Parade in Rehoboth Beach, the Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival, the Nanticoke Indian Pow Wow in Oak Orchard, Firefly Music Festival, and the Return Day Parade held after every election in Georgetown.\nIn 2015, tourism in Delaware generated $3.1billion, which makes up five percent of the state's GDP. Delaware saw 8.5million visitors in 2015, with the tourism industry employing 41,730 people, making it the 4th largest private employer in the state. Major origin markets for Delaware tourists include Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Harrisburg, with 97% of tourists arriving to the state by car and 75% of tourists coming from a distance of or less.\nDelaware is also home to two large sporting venues. Dover Motor Speedway is a race track in Dover, and Frawley Stadium in Wilmington is the home of the Wilmington Blue Rocks, a Minor League Baseball team that is currently affiliated with the Washington Nationals.\nEducation.\nIn the early 1920s, Pierre S. du Pont served as president of the state board of education. At the time, state law prohibited money raised from white taxpayers from being used to support the state's schools for black children. Appalled by the condition of the black schools, du Pont donated four million dollars to construct 86 new school buildings.\nDelaware was the origin of \"Belton v. Gebhart\" (1952), one of the four cases which were combined into \"Brown v. Board of Education\", the Supreme Court of the United States decision that led to the end of officially segregated public schools. Significantly, \"Belton\" was the only case in which the state court found for the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation is unconstitutional.\nUnlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions. This centralized system, combined with the small size of the state, likely contributed to Delaware becoming the first state, after completion of a three-year, $30million program ending in 1999, to wire every K-12 classroom in the state to the Internet.\nAs of 2011[ [update]], the Delaware Department of Education had authorized the founding of 25 charter schools in the state, one of them being all-girls.\nIn 2010, Delaware had the largest percentage of students attending private schools of places within the United States.\nAll teachers in the State's public school districts are unionized. As of January 2012[ [update]], none of the State's charter schools are members of a teachers union. One of the State's teachers' unions is Delaware State Education Association (DSEA).\nTransportation.\nThe transportation system in Delaware is under the governance and supervision of the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT). Funding for DelDOT projects is drawn, in part, from the Delaware Transportation Trust Fund, established in 1987 to help stabilize transportation funding; the availability of the Trust led to a gradual separation of DelDOT operations from other Delaware state operations. DelDOT manages programs such as a Delaware Adopt-a-Highway program, major road route snow removal, traffic control infrastructure (signs and signals), toll road management, Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles, the Delaware Transit Corporation (branded as \"DART First State\", the state government public transportation organization), and others.\nIn 2009, DelDOT maintained 13,507 lane-miles, totaling 89 percent of the state's public roadway system, the rest being under the supervision of individual municipalities. This far exceeds the national average (20 percent) for state department of transportation maintenance responsibility.\nRoads.\nOne major branch of the U.S. Interstate Highway System, Interstate95 (I-95), crosses Delaware southwest-to-northeast across New Castle County. Two Auxiliary Interstate Highway routes are also located in the state. Interstate 495 (I-495) is an eastern bypass of Wilmington. Interstate 295 (I-295) is a bypass of Philadelphia which begins south of Wilmington. In addition to Interstate highways, there are six U.S. highways that serve Delaware: U.S.9, U.S.13, U.S.40, U.S.113, U.S.202, and U.S.301. There are also several state highways that cross the state of Delaware; a few of them include DE1, DE9, and DE404. U.S.13 and DE1 are primary north\u2013south highways connecting Wilmington and Pennsylvania with Maryland, with DE1 serving as the main route between Wilmington and the Delaware beaches. DE9 is a north\u2013south highway connecting Dover and Wilmington via a scenic route along the Delaware Bay. U.S.40 is a primary east\u2013west route, connecting Maryland with New Jersey. DE404 is another primary east\u2013west highway connecting the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland with the Delaware beaches. The state also operates three toll highways, the Delaware Turnpike, which is I-95, between Maryland and New Castle; the Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, which is DE1, between Wilmington and Dover; and the U.S. 301 toll road between the Maryland border and DE1 in New Castle County.\nA bicycle route, Delaware Bicycle Route\u00a01, spans the north\u2013south length of the state from the Maryland border in Fenwick Island to the Pennsylvania border north of Montchanin. It is the first of several signed bike routes planned in Delaware.\nDelaware has about 875 bridges, 95 percent of which are under the supervision of DelDOT. About 30 percent of all Delaware bridges were built before 1950, and about 60 percent of the number are included in the National Bridge Inventory. Some bridges not under DelDOT supervision includes the four bridges on the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, which are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which is under the bi-state Delaware River and Bay Authority.\nIt has been noted that the tar and chip composition of secondary roads in Sussex County makes them more prone to deterioration than are the asphalt roadways in almost the rest of the state. Among these roads, Sussex (county road) 236 is among the most problematic.\nFerries.\nThree ferries operate in the state of Delaware:\nRail and bus.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Routemap/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAmtrak has two stations in Delaware along the Northeast Corridor; the relatively quiet Newark Rail Station in Newark, and the busier Wilmington Station in Wilmington. The Northeast Corridor is also served by SEPTA's Wilmington/Newark Line, part of SEPTA Regional Rail, which serves Claymont, Wilmington, Churchmans Crossing, and Newark.\nTwo Class I railroads, Norfolk Southern and CSX, provide freight rail service in northern New Castle County. Norfolk Southern provides freight service along the Northeast Corridor and to industrial areas in Edgemoor, New Castle, and Delaware City. CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision passes through northern New Castle County parallel to the Amtrak Northeast Corridor. Multiple short-line railroads provide freight service in Delaware. The Delmarva Central Railroad operates the most trackage of the short-line railroads, running from an interchange with Norfolk Southern in Porter south through Dover, Harrington, and Seaford to Delmar, with another line running from Harrington to Frankford and branches from Ellendale to Milton and from Georgetown to Gravel Hill. The Delmarva Central Railroad connects with the Maryland and Delaware Railroad, which serves local customers in Sussex County. CSX connects with the freight/heritage operation, the Wilmington and Western Railroad, based in Wilmington and the East Penn Railroad, which operates a line from Wilmington to Coatesville, Pennsylvania.\nThe last north\u2013south passenger trains through the main part of Delaware was the Pennsylvania Railroad's local Wilmington-Delmar train in 1965. This was a successor to the \"Del-Mar-Va Express\" and \"Cavalier\", which had run from Philadelphia through the state's interior, to the end of the Delmarva Peninsula until the mid-1950s.\nThe DART First State public transportation system was named \"Most Outstanding Public Transportation System\" in 2003 by the American Public Transportation Association. Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties. The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and paratransit modes. The paratransit system, consisting of a statewide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled, has been described by a Delaware state report as \"the most generous paratransit system in the United States\". As of 2012[ [update]], fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988.\nAir.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], Delaware is served exclusively by Avelo Airlines out of Wilmington Airport, launching five routes to Florida on February 1. This put an end to an eight-month period during which Delaware had no scheduled air service, one of several since 1991. Various airlines had served Wilmington Airport, the latest departure being Frontier Airlines in June 2022.\nDelaware is centrally situated in the Northeast megalopolis region of cities along I-95. Therefore, Delaware commercial airline passengers most frequently use Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use Wicomico Regional Airport (SBY), as it is located less than from the Delaware border. Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) are also within a radius of New Castle County.\nOther general aviation airports in Delaware include Summit Airport near Middletown, Delaware Airpark near Cheswold, and Delaware Coastal Airport near Georgetown.\nDover Air Force Base, one of the largest in the country, is home to the 436th Airlift Wing and the 512th Airlift Wing. In addition to its other responsibilities in the Air Mobility Command, it serves as the entry point and mortuary for U.S. military personnel (and some civilians) who die overseas.\nLaw and government.\nDelaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.\nLegislative branch.\nThe Delaware General Assembly consists of a House of Representatives with 41 members and a Senate with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.\nDelaware's U.S. Senators are Lisa Blunt Rochester (Democrat) and Chris Coons (Democrat). Delaware's single U.S. Representative is Sarah McBride (Democrat).\nJudicial branch.\nThe Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:\nMinor non-constitutional courts include the Justice of the Peace Courts and Aldermen's Courts.\nSignificantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of Chancery in the nation, which has jurisdiction over equity cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to mergers and acquisitions. The Court of Chancery and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning corporate law which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law, which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are incorporated in Delaware, including 60% of the companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nDelaware was the last U.S. state to use judicial corporal punishment, in 1952.\nExecutive branch.\nThe executive branch is headed by the Governor of Delaware. The current governor is Matt Meyer (Democrat), who took office January 21, 2025. The lieutenant governor is Kyle Evans Gay. The governor presents a \"State of the State\" speech to a joint session of the Delaware legislature annually.\nThe executive branch also consists of the Attorney General of Delaware currently held by Kathy Jennings, the State Treasurer currently held by Colleen Davis, the Auditor of Accounts currently held by Lydia York and the Insurance Commissioner currently held by Trinidad Navarro.\nCounties.\nDelaware is subdivided into three counties; from north to south they are New Castle, Kent and Sussex. This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as County Council, and in Kent County as Levy Court), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states\u2014such as court and law enforcement\u2014have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into hundreds, which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions.\nPolitics.\nThe Democratic Party holds a plurality of registrations in Delaware. Currently, Democrats hold all positions of authority in Delaware, as well as majorities in the state Senate and House. The Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won any statewide offices in 2014, State Auditor and State Treasurer.\nDuring the First and Second Party Systems, Delaware was a stronghold for the Federalist and Whig Parties, respectively. After a relatively brief adherence to the Democratic Solid South following the US Civil War, Delaware became a Republican-leaning state from 1896 through 1948, voting for losing Republicans Charles Evans Hughes in 1916, Herbert Hoover in 1932, and Thomas Dewey in 1948.\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, Delaware was a bellwether state, voting for the winner of every presidential election from 1952 through 1996. Delaware's bellwether status came to an end when Delaware voted for Al Gore in 2000 by 13%. Subsequent elections have continued to demonstrate Delaware's current strong Democratic lean: John Kerry carried the First State by 8% in 2004; Barack Obama carried it by 25% and by 19% in his two elections of 2008 and 2012; and Hillary Clinton carried it by 11% as she lost the Electoral College in 2016. In 2020, Delaware native (and Barack Obama's former vice president and running mate) Joe Biden headed the Democratic ticket; he carried his home state by just shy of 19% en route to a national 4.5% win.\nThe dominant factor in Delaware's political shift has been the strong Democratic trend in heavily urbanized New Castle County, home to 55% of Delaware's population. New Castle County has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988, and has given Democrats over 60% of its vote in every election from 2004 on. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double digits each time in New Castle County, which was a large enough margin to tip the state to the Democrats. New Castle County also elects a substantial majority of the state legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle County.\nIn a 2020 study, Delaware was ranked as the 18th hardest state for citizens to vote in.\nFreedom of information.\nEach of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government. In 2011 Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer than this time to produce. A bill aimed at restricting Freedom of Information Act requests, Senate Bill 155, was discussed in committee.\nTaxation.\nTax is collected by the Delaware Division of Revenue.\nDelaware has six different income tax brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess sales tax on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.\nDelaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. Real estate is subject to county property taxes, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.\nGambling provides significant revenue to the state. For instance, the casino at Delaware Park Racetrack provided more than $100million to the state in 2010.\nIn June 2018, Delaware became the first U.S. state to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court ruling to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA).\nCulture.\nSports.\nAs Delaware has no franchises in the major American professional sports leagues, many Delawareans follow either Philadelphia or Baltimore teams. In the WNBA, the Washington Mystics enjoy a major following due to the presence of Wilmington native and University of Delaware product Elena Delle Donne. The University of Delaware's football team has a large following throughout the state, with the Delaware State University and Wesley College teams also enjoying a smaller degree of support.\nDelaware is home to Dover Motor Speedway and Bally's Dover. Dover Motor Speedway, also known as the \"Monster Mile\", is one of only 10 tracks in the nation to have hosted 100 or more NASCAR Cup Series races. Bally's Dover is a popular harness racing facility. It is the only co-located horse- and car-racing facility in the nation, with the Bally's Dover track located inside the Dover Motor Speedway track.\nDelaware is represented in rugby by the Delaware Black Foxes, a 2015 expansion club.\nDelaware has been home to two professional wrestling outfits: Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) and its Tournament of Death, and ECWA with its annual Super8 Tournament.\nDelaware's official state sport is bicycling.\nForeign affairs.\nSister state.\nDelaware has had a foreign sister state in Japan, named Miyagi Prefecture. These two have shared relations since 1997, and have had exchange programs available for students that were briefly paused in wake of the earthquake and the tsunami that ensued in the prefecture during March 2011.\nDelawareans.\nProminent Delawareans include the du Pont family of politicians and businesspersons, and the 46th president of the United States Joe Biden. Biden's family moved to Delaware during his childhood, and he later represented Delaware for 36 years in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009, before being 47th vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7931", "revid": "38455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7931", "title": "Dictionary", "text": "Collection of words and their meanings\nA dictionary is a listing of lexemes from the lexicon of one or more specific languages, often arranged alphabetically (or by consonantal root for Semitic languages or radical and stroke for logographic languages), which may include information on definitions, usage, etymologies, pronunciations, translation, etc. It is a lexicographical reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.\nA broad distinction is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a comprehensive range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.\nThere is also a contrast between \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\" dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. \"informal\" or \"vulgar\") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.\nThe first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times around 2300 BCE, in the form of bilingual dictionaries, and the oldest surviving monolingual dictionaries are Chinese dictionaries c.\u20093rd century BCE. The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was \"A Table Alphabeticall\", written in 1604, and monolingual dictionaries in other languages also began appearing in Europe at around this time. The systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest arose as a 20th-century enterprise, called lexicography, and largely initiated by Ladislav Zgusta. The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, with the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of having an \"astonishing lack of method and critical self-reflection\".\nHistory.\nThe oldest known dictionaries were cuneiform tablets with bilingual Sumerian\u2013Akkadian wordlists, discovered in Ebla (modern Syria) and dated to roughly 2300 BCE, the time of the Akkadian Empire. The early 2nd millennium BCE \"Urra=hubullu\" glossary is the canonical Babylonian version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A Chinese dictionary, the c.\u20093rd century BCE \"Erya\", is the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; some sources cite the \"Shizhoupian\" (probably compiled sometime between 700 BCE to 200 BCE, possibly earlier) as a \"dictionary\", although modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of Chinese characters from Zhou dynasty bronzes. Philitas of Cos (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary \"Disorderly Words\" (\u1f0c\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b3\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9, \"\") which explained the meanings of rare Homeric and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms. Apollonius the Sophist (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon. The first Sanskrit dictionary, the Amarako\u015ba, was written by Amarasimha c.\u20094th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the , the first Japanese dictionary was the long-lost 682 CE \"Niina\" glossary of Chinese characters. Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi's 8th century \"Kitab al-'Ayn\" is considered the first dictionary of Arabic. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the c.\u2009835 CE \"Tenrei Bansh\u014d Meigi\", was also a glossary of written Chinese. In \"Frahang-i Pahlavig\", Aramaic heterograms are listed together with their translation in the Middle Persian language and phonetic transcription in the Pazend alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, Sanas Cormaic, contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In the 12th century, The Karakhanid-Turkic scholar Mahmud Kashgari finished his work \"Divan-u L\u00fcgat'it T\u00fcrk\", a dictionary about the Turkic dialects, but especially Karakhanid Turkic. His work contains about 7500 to 8000 words and it was written to teach non Turkic Muslims, especially the Abbasid Arabs, the Turkic language. Al-Zamakhshari wrote a small Arabic dictionary called \"Mu\u1e33addimet\u00fc'l-edeb\" for the Turkic-Khwarazm ruler Atsiz. In the 14th century, the Codex Cumanicus was finished and it served as a dictionary about the Cuman-Turkic language. While in Mamluk Egypt, Eb\u00fb Hayy\u00e2n el-Endel\u00fcs\u00ee finished his work \"Kit\u00e2b\u00fc'l-\u0130dr\u00e2k li-lis\u00e2ni'l-Etr\u00e2k\", a dictionary about the Kipchak and Turcoman languages spoken in Egypt and the Levant. A dictionary called \"Bah\u015fayi\u015f L\u00fcgati\", which is written in old Anatolian Turkish, served also as a dictionary between Oghuz Turkish, Arabic and Persian. But it is not clear who wrote the dictionary or in which century exactly it was published. It was written in old Anatolian Turkish from the Seljuk period and not the late medieval Ottoman period. In India around 1320, Amir Khusro compiled the Khaliq-e-bari, which mainly dealt with Hindustani and Persian words.\nArabic dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the radicals, or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the Qur'an and hadith, while most general use dictionaries, such as the \"Lisan al-`Arab\" (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and \"al-Qamus al-Muhit\" (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The \"Qamus al-Muhit\" is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the \"Lisan\" and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\".\nIn medieval Europe, glossaries with equivalents for Latin words in vernacular or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the Leiden Glossary). The \"Catholicon\" (1287) by Johannes Balbus, a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 Ambrogio Calepino's \"Dictionarium\" was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 Robert Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae latinae\" and in 1572 his son Henri Estienne published the \"Thesaurus linguae graecae\", which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual Spanish dictionary written was Sebasti\u00e1n Covarrubias's \"Tesoro de la lengua castellana o espa\u00f1ola\", published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain. In 1612 the first edition of the \"Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca\", for Italian, was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in Rotterdam was published, posthumously, the \"Dictionnaire Universel\" by Antoine Fureti\u00e8re for French. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the (still published, with the ninth edition not complete as of 2021[ [update]]). Between 1712 and 1721 was published the \"Vocabulario portughez e latino\" written by Raphael Bluteau. The Royal Spanish Academy published the first edition of the (still published, with a new edition about every decade) in 1780; their \"Diccionario de Autoridades\", which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The \"Totius Latinitatis lexicon\" by Egidio Forcellini was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.\nThe first edition of \"A Greek-English Lexicon\" by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch by the Brothers Grimm; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the \"Dizionario della lingua italiana\" by Niccol\u00f2 Tommaseo. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of \"A magyar nyelv sz\u00f3t\u00e1ra\" (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and J\u00e1nos Fogarasi. \u00c9mile Littr\u00e9 published the between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the \"Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal\" which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl published the \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language\". The Duden dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the prescriptive source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the \"Svenska Akademiens ordbok\" was taken in 1787.\nEnglish dictionaries in Britain.\nThe earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word \"dictionary\" was invented by an Englishman called John of Garland in 1220\u00a0\u2013 he had written a book \"Dictionarius\" to help with Latin \"diction\". An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the \"Elementarie\", created by Richard Mulcaster in 1582.\nThe first purely English alphabetical dictionary was \"A Table Alphabeticall\", written by English schoolteacher Robert Cawdrey in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is \"a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no\u2026 standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title.\"\nIn 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his \"English Expositor\". \"Glossographia\" by Thomas Blount, published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. Edward Phillips wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled \"The New World of English Words: Or a General Dictionary\" which boldly plagiarized Blount's work, and the two criticized each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. John Wilkins' 1668 essay on philosophical language contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by William Lloyd. Elisha Coles published his \"English Dictionary\" in 1676.\nIt was not until Samuel Johnson's \"A Dictionary of the English Language\" (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy. By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first \"modern\" dictionary.\nJohnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the Oxford University Press began writing and releasing the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" in short fascicles from 1884 onwards. A complete ten-volume first edition was not released until 1928. \nThe OED remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months.\nAmerican English dictionaries.\nIn 1806, American Noah Webster published his first dictionary, \"\". In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, \"An American Dictionary of the English Language;\" it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including Old English (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and Sanskrit.\nWebster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the University of Cambridge. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a spelling reformer, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced spellings that became American English, replacing \"colour\" with \"color\", substituting \"wagon\" for \"waggon\", and printing \"center\" instead of \"centre\". He also added American words, like \"skunk\" and \"squash\", which did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes. Webster's dictionary was acquired by G &amp; C Merriam Co. in 1843, after his death, and has since been published in many revised editions. Merriam-Webster was acquired by Encyclopedia Britannica in 1964.\nControversy over the lack of usage advice in the 1961 \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" spurred publication of the 1969 \"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\", the first dictionary to use corpus linguistics.\nTypes.\nIn a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.\nIn many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the undeclined or unconjugated form appears as the headword in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like StarDict and the \"New Oxford American Dictionary\" are dictionary software running on PDAs or computers. There are also many online dictionaries accessible via the Internet.\nSpecialized dictionaries.\nAccording to the \"Manual of Specialized Lexicographies\", a specialized dictionary, also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field, as opposed to a dictionary that comprehensively contains words from the lexicon of a specific language or languages. Following the description in \"The Bilingual LSP Dictionary\", lexicographers categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A multi-field dictionary broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a business dictionary), a single-field dictionary narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a sub-field dictionary covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language Inter-Active Terminology for Europe is a multi-field dictionary, the American National Biography is a single-field, and the African American National Biography Project is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between \"minimizing dictionaries\" and \"maximizing dictionaries\", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, \"Oxford Dictionary of World Religions\" and \"Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms\") whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (\"The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology\").\nAnother variant is the glossary, an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine (medical dictionary).\nDefining dictionaries.\nThe simplest dictionary, a defining dictionary, provides a core glossary of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English idioms and metaphors, can be defined.\nPrescriptive vs. descriptive.\nLexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: \"prescriptive\" or \"descriptive\". Noah Webster, intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why American English now uses the spelling \"color\" while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers \"colour\". (Similarly, British English subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at American and British English spelling differences.)\nLarge 20th-century dictionaries such as the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED) and \"Webster's Third\" are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, provide information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused. \"Merriam-Webster\" is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, \"sometimes offensive\" or \"stand\" (nonstandard). \"American Heritage\" goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous \"usage notes.\" \"Encarta\" provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, \"an offensive term for...\" or \"a taboo term meaning...\".\nBecause of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day. As Jorge Luis Borges says in the prologue to \"El otro, el mismo\": \"It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.\"\nSometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, the \"Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary\" is \"at war with itself\": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its vocalization is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as \"hi tahar\u00f3g ot\u00ed kshetir\u00e9 me as\u00edti lamkhon\u00edt\" (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas \"hi tahar\u00f3g ot\u00ed\", literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, \"me\" (a variant of \"ma\" 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.\nHistorical dictionaries.\nA historical dictionary is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.\nDictionaries for natural language processing.\nIn contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for natural language processing (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see Diathesis alternation). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control machine translations or cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.\nPronunciation.\nIn many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word \"dictionary\" might be followed by the International Phonetic Alphabet spelling (in British English) or (in American English). American English dictionaries often use their own pronunciation respelling systems with diacritics, for example \"dictionary\" is respelled as \"d\u012dk\u2032sh\u0259-n\u0115r\u2032\u0113\" in the American Heritage Dictionary. The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, \"dictionary\" may be respelled as or on Wikipedia. Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.\nExamples.\nDictionaries of other languages.\nHistories and descriptions of the dictionaries of other languages on Wikipedia include:\nOnline dictionaries.\nThe age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. David Skinner in 2013 noted that \"Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are \"holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric\" and \"bourgeois.\" Teaching users about words they don't already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well.\"\nThere exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of neologisms. Some of the more notable examples are given in List of online dictionaries and .\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Described by Walter Block as a \"free-market anarchist\" theorist, Friedman has also authored several other books and articles, including \"Price Theory: An Intermediate Text\" (1986), \"Law's Order: What Economics Has to Do with Law and Why It Matters\" (2000), \"Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life\" (1996), and \"Future Imperfect\" (2008).\nLife and work.\nDavid Friedman is the son of economists Rose and Milton Friedman.

He later earned a master's in 1967, and a PhD in 1971 in theoretical physics from the University of Chicago. Despite his later career, he never took a class for credit in either economics or law. He was a professor of law at Santa Clara University from 2005 to 2017, and a contributing editor for \"Liberty\" magazine. He is currently a Professor Emeritus. He is an atheist. His son, Patri Friedman, has also written about libertarian theory and market anarchism, particularly seasteading.\n\"The Machinery of Freedom\".\nIn his book \"The Machinery of Freedom\" (1973), Friedman sketched a form of anarcho-capitalism where all goods and services including law itself can be produced by the free market. Friedman advocates an incrementalist approach to achieve anarcho-capitalism by gradual privatization of areas that government is involved in, ultimately privatizing the law itself. In the book, he states his opposition to violent anarcho-capitalist revolution.\nHe advocates a consequentialist version of anarcho-capitalism, arguing for it on a cost\u2013benefit analysis of state versus no state. It is contrasted with the natural-rights approach as propounded most notably by economist and libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard.\nNon-academic interests.\nFriedman is a longtime member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, where he is known as \"Duke Cariadoc of the Bow\". He is known throughout the worldwide society for his articles on the philosophy of recreationism and practical historical recreations, especially those relating to the medieval Middle East. His work is compiled in the popular \"Cariadoc's Miscellany\". He is sometimes credited with founding the largest and longest-running SCA event, the Pennsic War; as king of the Middle Kingdom he challenged the East Kingdom, and later as king of the East accepted the challenge and lost (to himself).\nHe was a teenage wargamer who taught his school friend, Jack Radey, founder of People's War Games, how to play such wargames as \"Tactics II\". Radey relates how Friedman and himself wrote to Charles S. Roberts claiming that they had found a first turn winning strategy for each of the two sides. Roberts replied that their interpretation of the rules was valid.\nHe is a long-time science fiction fan, and has written three novels. \"Harald\" (Baen Books, 2006) is set in an invented world drawn from European history.\n\"Salamander\" (2011) and its sequel \"Brothers\" (2020) are fantasy.\nHe has spoken in favor of a non-interventionist foreign policy.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If a diatomic molecule consists of two atoms of the same element, such as hydrogen () or oxygen (), then it is said to be homonuclear. Otherwise, if a diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms, such as carbon monoxide () or nitric oxide (), the molecule is said to be heteronuclear. The bond in a homonuclear diatomic molecule is non-polar.\nThe only chemical elements that form stable homonuclear diatomic molecules at standard temperature and pressure (STP) (or at typical laboratory conditions of 1 bar and 25\u00a0\u00b0C) are the gases hydrogen (), nitrogen (), oxygen (), fluorine (), and chlorine (), and the liquid bromine ().\nThe noble gases (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon) are also gases at STP, but they are monatomic. The homonuclear diatomic gases and noble gases together are called \"elemental gases\" or \"molecular gases\", to distinguish them from other gases that are chemical compounds.\nAt slightly elevated temperatures, the halogens bromine () and iodine () also form diatomic gases. All halogens have been observed as diatomic molecules, except for astatine and tennessine, which are uncertain.\nOther elements form diatomic molecules when evaporated, but these diatomic species repolymerize when cooled. Heating (\"cracking\") phosphorus gives diphosphorus (). Sulfur vapor is mostly disulfur (). Dilithium () and disodium () are known in the gas phase. Ditungsten () and dimolybdenum () form with sextuple bonds in the gas phase. Dirubidium () is diatomic.\nHeteronuclear molecules.\nAll other diatomic molecules are chemical compounds of two different elements. Many elements can combine to form heteronuclear diatomic molecules, depending on temperature and pressure.\nExamples are gases carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\nMany 1:1 binary compounds are not normally considered diatomic because they are polymeric at room temperature, but they form diatomic molecules when evaporated, for example gaseous MgO, SiO, and many others.\nOccurrence.\nHundreds of diatomic molecules have been identified in the environment of the Earth, in the laboratory, and in interstellar space. About 99% of the Earth's atmosphere is composed of two species of diatomic molecules: nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The natural abundance of hydrogen (H2) in the Earth's atmosphere is only of the order of parts per million, but H2 is the most abundant diatomic molecule in the universe. The interstellar medium is dominated by hydrogen atoms.\nMolecular geometry.\nAll diatomic molecules are linear and characterized by a single parameter which is the bond length or distance between the two atoms. Diatomic nitrogen has a triple bond, diatomic oxygen has a double bond, and diatomic hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, iodine, and bromine all have single bonds.\nHistorical significance.\nDiatomic elements played an important role in the elucidation of the concepts of element, atom, and molecule in the 19th century, because some of the most common elements, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, occur as diatomic molecules. John Dalton's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another. For example, Dalton assumed water's formula to be HO, giving the atomic weight of oxygen as eight times that of hydrogen, instead of the modern value of about 16. As a consequence, confusion existed regarding atomic weights and molecular formulas for about half a century.\nAs early as 1805, Gay-Lussac and von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water's composition, based on what is now called Avogadro's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules. However, these results were mostly ignored until 1860, partly due to the belief that atoms of one element would have no chemical affinity toward atoms of the same element, and also partly due to apparent exceptions to Avogadro's law that were not explained until later in terms of dissociating molecules.\nAt the 1860 Karlsruhe Congress on atomic weights, Cannizzaro resurrected Avogadro's ideas and used them to produce a consistent table of atomic weights, which mostly agree with modern values. These weights were an important prerequisite for the discovery of the periodic law by Dmitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer.\nExcited electronic states.\nDiatomic molecules are normally in their lowest or ground state, which conventionally is also known as the formula_1 state. When a gas of diatomic molecules is bombarded by energetic electrons, some of the molecules may be excited to higher electronic states, as occurs, for example, in the natural aurora; high-altitude nuclear explosions; and rocket-borne electron gun experiments. Such excitation can also occur when the gas absorbs light or other electromagnetic radiation. The excited states are unstable and naturally relax back to the ground state. Over various short time scales after the excitation (typically a fraction of a second, or sometimes longer than a second if the excited state is metastable), transitions occur from higher to lower electronic states and ultimately to the ground state, and in each transition results a photon is emitted. This emission is known as fluorescence. Successively higher electronic states are conventionally named formula_2, formula_3, formula_4, etc. (but this convention is not always followed, and sometimes lower case letters and alphabetically out-of-sequence letters are used, as in the example given below). The excitation energy must be greater than or equal to the energy of the electronic state in order for the excitation to occur.\nIn quantum theory, an electronic state of a diatomic molecule is represented by the molecular term symbol\nformula_5\nwhere formula_6 is the total electronic spin quantum number, formula_7 is the total electronic angular momentum quantum number along the internuclear axis, and formula_8 is the vibrational quantum number. formula_7 takes on values 0, 1, 2, ..., which are represented by the electronic state symbols formula_10, formula_11, formula_12, ...\nFor example, the following table lists the common electronic states (without vibrational quantum numbers) along with the energy of the lowest vibrational level (formula_13) of diatomic nitrogen (N2), the most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere. \nThe subscripts and superscripts after formula_7 give additional quantum mechanical details about the electronic state. The superscript formula_15 or formula_16 determines whether reflection in a plane containing the internuclear axis introduces a sign change in the wavefunction. The sub-script formula_17 or formula_18 applies to molecules of identical atoms, and when reflecting the state along a plane perpendicular to the molecular axis, states that does not change are labelled formula_17 (gerade), and states that change sign are labelled formula_18 (ungerade).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe aforementioned fluorescence occurs in distinct regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, called \"emission bands\": each band corresponds to a particular transition from a higher electronic state and vibrational level to a lower electronic state and vibrational level (typically, many vibrational levels are involved in an excited gas of diatomic molecules). For example, N2 formula_2-formula_1 emission bands (a.k.a. Vegard-Kaplan bands) are present in the spectral range from 0.14 to 1.45 \u03bcm (micrometres). A given band can be spread out over several nanometers in electromagnetic wavelength space, owing to the various transitions that occur in the molecule's rotational quantum number, formula_23. These are classified into distinct sub-band branches, depending on the change in formula_23. The formula_25 branch corresponds to formula_26, the formula_27 branch to formula_28, and the formula_29 branch to formula_30. Bands are spread out even further by the limited spectral resolution of the spectrometer that is used to measure the spectrum. The spectral resolution depends on the instrument's point spread function.\nEnergy levels.\nThe molecular term symbol is a shorthand expression of the angular momenta that characterize the electronic quantum states of a diatomic molecule, which are also eigenstates of the electronic molecular Hamiltonian. It is also convenient, and common, to represent a diatomic molecule as two-point masses connected by a massless spring. The energies involved in the various motions of the molecule can then be broken down into three categories: the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies. The theoretical study of the rotational energy levels of the diatomic molecules can be described using the below description of the rotational energy levels. While the study of vibrational energy level of the diatomic molecules can be described using the harmonic oscillator approximation or using the quantum vibrational interaction potentials. These potentials give more accurate energy levels because they take multiple vibrational effects into account.\nConcerning history, the first treatment of diatomic molecules with quantum mechanics was made by Lucy Mensing in 1926.\nTranslational energies.\nThe translational energy of the molecule is given by the kinetic energy expression:\nformula_31\nwhere formula_32 is the mass of the molecule and formula_8 is its velocity.\nRotational energies.\nClassically, the kinetic energy of rotation is\nformula_34\nwhere\nFor microscopic, atomic-level systems like a molecule, angular momentum can only have specific discrete values given by\nformula_37\nwhere formula_38 is a non-negative integer and formula_39 is the reduced Planck constant.\nAlso, for a diatomic molecule the moment of inertia is\nformula_40\nwhere\nSo, substituting the angular momentum and moment of inertia into \"E\"rot, the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are given by:\nformula_43\nVibrational energies.\nAnother type of motion of a diatomic molecule is for each atom to oscillate\u2014or vibrate\u2014along the line connecting the two atoms. The vibrational energy is approximately that of a quantum harmonic oscillator:\nformula_44\nwhere\nComparison between rotational and vibrational energy spacings.\nThe spacing, and the energy of a typical spectroscopic transition, between vibrational energy levels is about 100 times greater than that of a typical transition between rotational energy levels.\nHund's cases.\nThe good quantum numbers for a diatomic molecule, as well as good approximations of rotational energy levels, can be obtained by modeling the molecule using Hund's cases.\nMnemonics.\nThe mnemonics \"BrINClHOF\", pronounced \"Brinklehof\", \"HONClBrIF\", pronounced \"Honkelbrif\", \u201cHOBrFINCl\u201d, pronounced \u201cHoberfinkel\u201d, and \"HOFBrINCl\", pronounced \"Hofbrinkle\", have been coined to aid recall of the list of diatomic elements. Another method, for English-speakers, is the sentence: \"Never Have Fear of Ice Cold Beer\" as a representation of Nitrogen, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Oxygen, Iodine, Chlorine, Bromine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7939", "revid": "42528017", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7939", "title": "Duopoly", "text": "Type of oligopoly\nA duopoly (from Greek , 'two'; and , 'to sell') is a type of oligopoly where two firms have dominant or exclusive control over a market, and most (if not all) of the competition within that market occurs directly between them.\nDuopoly is the most commonly studied form of oligopoly due to its simplicity. Duopolies sell to consumers in a competitive market where the choice of an individual consumer choice cannot affect the firm in a duopoly market, as the defining characteristic of duopolies is that decisions made by each seller are dependent on what the other competitor does. Duopolies can exist in various forms, such as Cournot, Bertrand, or Stackelberg competition. These models demonstrate how firms in a duopoly can compete on output or price, depending on the assumptions made about firm behavior and market conditions.\nSimilar features are discernible in national political systems of party duopoly.\nDuopoly models in economics and game theory.\nCournot duopoly.\nCournot model in game theory.\nIn 1838, Antoine Augustin Cournot published a book titled \"Researches Into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth\" in which he introduced and developed this model for the first time. As an imperfect competition model, Cournot duopoly (also known as Cournot competition), in which two firms with identical cost functions compete with homogenous products in a static context, is also known as Cournot competition. The Cournot model, shows that two firms assume each other's output and treat this as a fixed amount, and produce in their own firm according to this. The Cournot duopoly model relies on the following assumptions:\nIn this model, two companies, each of which chooses its own quantity of output, compete against each other while facing constant marginal and average costs. The market price is determined by the sum of the output of two companies. formula_1 is the equation for the market demand function.\nformula_2\nThe general process for obtaining a Nash equilibrium of a game using the best response functions is followed in order to discover a Nash equilibrium of Cournot's model for a specific cost function and demand function. A Nash Equilibrium of the Cournot model is a such that\nFor a given formula_3 solves:\nformula_4\nGiven the other firm's optimal quantity, each firm maximizes its profit over the residual inverse demand. In equilibrium, no firm can increase profits by changing its output level. The two first order conditions equal to zero are the best response.\nCournot's duopoly marked the beginning of the study of oligopolies, and specifically duopolies, as well as the expansion of the research of market structures, which had previously focussed on the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly. In the Cournot duopoly model, firms choose the quantity of output they produce simultaneously, taking into consideration the quantity produced by their competitor. Each firm's profit depends on the total output produced by both firms, and the market price is determined by the sum of their outputs. The goal of each firm is to maximize its profit given the output produced by the other firm. This process continues until both firms reach a Nash equilibrium, where neither firm has an incentive to change its output level given the output of the other firm.\nBertrand duopoly.\nBertrand model in game theory.\nThe Bertrand competition was developed by a French mathematician called Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand after investigating the claims of the Cournot model in \"Researches into the mathematical principles of the theory of wealth, 1838\". According to the Cournot model, firms in a duopoly would be able to keep prices above marginal cost and hence be extremely profitable. Bertrand took issue with this. In this market structure, each firm could only choose whole amounts and each firm receives zero payoffs when the aggregate demand exceeds the size of the amount that they share with each other. The market demand function is formula_5. The Bertrand model has similar assumptions to the Cournot model:\nThe Bertrand model, in which, in a game of two firms, competes in price instead of output. Each one of them will assume that the other will not change prices in response to its price cuts. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a Nash equilibrium.\nLet pm be the monopoly price, formula_7\nformula_8\nFor rival prices above cost, each firm has incentive to undercut rival to get the whole demand. If rival prices below cost, firms make losses when it attracts demand; firm better off charging at cost level. Nash equilibrium is \"p\"1 = \"p\"2 = \"c\".\nBertrand paradox.\nUnder static price competition with homogenous products and constant, symmetric marginal cost, firms price at the level of marginal cost and make no economic profits. In contrast to the Cournot model, the Bertrand duopoly model assumes that firms compete on price rather than quantity. Each firm sets its price simultaneously, anticipating that the other firm will not change its price in response. When both firms use this logic, they will reach a Nash equilibrium, where neither firm has an incentive to change its price given the price set by the other firm. In this model, firms tend to price their products at the level of their marginal cost, resulting in zero economic profits, a phenomenon known as the Bertrand paradox.\nQuality standards.\nIn a duopoly, quality standards can play a significant role in the competitive dynamics between the two firms. A low-quality manufacturer may benefit from a slightly stringent quality standard in the absence of sunk costs, whereas a high-quality producer may suffer from it. Consumer welfare improves if the firm generating the higher quality does not considerably enhance its quality in response to its competitor's increase in quality. Exit from the industry is triggered by a sufficiently strict requirement. The high-quality producer exits first when there are no sunk costs. In some cases, firms may engage in a quality competition, attempting to outdo one another by improving their products or services to attract more customers.\nPolitics.\nLike a market, a political system can be dominated by two groups, which exclude other parties or ideologies from participation. This is known as a two-party system. In such a system, one party or the other tends to dominate government at any given time (the Majority party), while the other has only limited power (the Minority party). According to Duverger's law, this tends to be caused by a simple winner-take-all voting system without runoffs or ranked choices. The United States and many Latin American countries, such as Costa Rica, Guyana, and the Dominican Republic have two-party government systems.\nDuopoly in Danish court politics.\nThe prime minister-finance minister duopoly is an unusual form of court politics. There have been few other countries where the prime minister and the Treasury have had such a tumultuous relationship as Australia and the United Kingdom. There have been some confrontations in the past when the Finance ministry did not have the full support of the prime minister, leading to internal ministerial battles over economic strategy. A permanent civil service is a basic requirement for the duopoly system to function properly. The permanent civil service in general, and the Socialist Party in particular, are critical to the duopoly's effective operation. The conventional inter-governmental duopoly is carried by civil servants. The duopoly is confronted with some quandaries, such as tensions between different groups in the office over their relative positions. Departmental budget cuts are being made across the board. The prime ministerial-finance-ministry duopoly requires more credibility. Trust is a rare commodity among Australians and Britons. Denmark has a lot to offer. The Danish duopoly works together. Australia and the United Kingdom have competitive duopolies, and competitive duopolies are unstable.\nTypes of duopoly.\nCournot duopoly.\nA Cournot duopoly is a model of strategic interaction between two firms where they simultaneously choose their output levels, assuming the rival's output level is fixed. The firms compete on quantity, and each firm attempts to maximize its profit given the other firm's output level. This leads to a Nash equilibrium where neither firm has an incentive to change its output, given the other firm's output.\nBertrand duopoly.\nIn a Bertrand duopoly, two firms compete on price instead of quantity. Each firm assumes that its rival's price is fixed and chooses its own price to maximize profit. This model predicts that, under certain conditions, firms will set prices equal to marginal cost, leading to perfect competition.\nStackelberg duopoly.\nA Stackelberg duopoly is a model where one firm (the leader) chooses its output level first, followed by the other firm (the follower). The follower observes the leader's output decision and adjusts its own output to maximize profit. The Stackelberg model often results in a higher total output and lower market price than the Cournot and Bertrand models.\nExamples in business.\nA commonly cited example of a duopoly is that involving Visa and Mastercard, who between them control a large proportion of the electronic payment processing market. In 2000 they were the defendants in a United States Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. An appeal was upheld in 2004.\nOther examples where two companies control an overwhelming proportion of a market are:\nMedia.\nIn Finland, the state-owned broadcasting company Yleisradio and the private broadcaster Mainos-TV had a legal duopoly (in the economists' sense of the word) from the 1950s to 1993. No other broadcasters were allowed. Mainos-TV operated by leasing air time from Yleisradio, broadcasting in reserved blocks between Yleisradio's own programming on its two channels. This was a unique phenomenon in the world. Between 1986 and 1992 there was an independent third channel but it was jointly owned by Yle and M-TV; only in 1993 did M-TV get its own channel.\nIn Kenya, mobile service providers Safaricom and Airtel in Kenya form a duopoly in the Kenyan telecommunications industry.\nIn Singapore, the mass media industry is presently dominated by two players, namely Mediacorp and SPH Media Trust.\nIn the United Kingdom, the BBC and ITV formed an effective duopoly (with Channel 4 originally being economically dependent on ITV) until the development of multichannel from the 1990s onwards.\nBroadcasting.\nDuopoly is used in the United States broadcast television and radio industry to refer to a single company owning two outlets in the same city. This usage is technically incompatible with the normal definition of the word and may lead to confusion, inasmuch as there are generally more than two owners of broadcast television stations in markets with broadcast duopolies. In Canada, this definition is therefore more commonly called a \"twinstick\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7940", "revid": "935793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7940", "title": "Dungeons &amp; Dragons", "text": "Fantasy role-playing game\nDungeons &amp; Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&amp;D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) originally created and designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. The game was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the Coast, later a subsidiary of Hasbro, since 1997. The game was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game \"Chainmail\" serving as the initial rule system. \"D&amp;D\"'s publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing games and the role-playing game industry, which also deeply influenced video games, especially the role-playing video game genre.\n\"D&amp;D\" departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as referee and storyteller for the game, while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world, known as non-player characters (NPCs). The characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they solve problems, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, player characters earn experience points (XP) to level up, and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions. Players choose a class when they create their character, which gives them special perks and abilities every few levels.\nThe early success of \"D&amp;D\" led to a proliferation of similar game systems. Despite the competition, \"D&amp;D\" has remained the market leader in the role-playing game industry. In 1977, the game was split into two branches: the relatively rules-light game system of basic \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", and the more structured, rules-heavy game system of \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" (abbreviated as \"AD&amp;D\"). \"AD&amp;D\" 2nd Edition was published in 1989. In 2000, a new system was released as \"D&amp;D\" 3rd edition, continuing the edition numbering from \"AD&amp;D\"; a revised version 3.5 was released in June 2003. These 3rd edition rules formed the basis of the d20 System, which is available under the Open Game License (OGL) for use by other publishers. \"D&amp;D\" 4th edition was released in June 2008. The 5th edition of \"D&amp;D\", the most recent, was released during the second half of 2014.\nIn 2004, \"D&amp;D\" remained the best-known, and best-selling, role-playing game in the US, with an estimated 20 million people having played the game and more than US$1 billion in book and equipment sales worldwide. The year 2017 had \"the most number of players in its history\u201412 million to 15 million in North America alone\". \"D&amp;D 5th edition\" sales \"were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game's biggest sales year yet\". The game has been supplemented by many premade adventures, as well as commercial campaign settings suitable for use by regular gaming groups. \"D&amp;D\" is known beyond the game itself for other \"D&amp;D\"-branded products, references in popular culture, and some of the controversies that have surrounded it, particularly a moral panic in the 1980s that attempted to associate it with Satanism and suicide. The game has won multiple awards and has been translated into many languages.\nPlay overview.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" is a structured yet open-ended role-playing game. Typically, one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master (DM) or Game Master (GM) while the others each control a single character, representing an individual in a fictional setting. When working together as a group, the player characters (PCs) are often described as a \"party\" of adventurers, with each member often having their own area of specialty that contributes to the success of the group as a whole. During the course of play, each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game. This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players, while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills, such as logic, basic mathematics, and imagination. A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure, and longer into a series of related gaming adventures, called a \"campaign\".\nThe results of the party's choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the DM according to the rules of the game and the DM's interpretation of those rules. The DM selects and describes the various non-player characters (NPCs) that the party encounters, the settings in which these interactions occur, and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players' choices and actions. Encounters often take the form of battles with \"monsters\"\u00a0\u2013 a generic term used in \"D&amp;D\" to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals, aberrant beings, or mythical creatures. In addition to jewels and gold coins, magic items form part of the treasure that the players often seek in a dungeon. Magic items are generally found in treasure hoards, or recovered from fallen opponents; sometimes, a powerful or important magic item is the object of a quest. The game's extensive rules\u00a0\u2013 which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions, magic use, combat, and the effect of the environment on PCs\u00a0\u2013 help the DM to make these decisions. The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary.\nThe most recent versions of the game's rules are detailed in three Fifth Edition core rulebooks: The \"Player's Handbook\", the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" and the \"Monster Manual\".\nThe only items required to play the game are the rulebooks, a character sheet for each player, and a number of polyhedral dice. Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid if desired, particularly during combat. Some editions of the game presume such usage. Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game, such as expansion rulebooks, pre-designed adventures, and various campaign settings.\nGame mechanics.\nBefore the game begins, each player creates their player character and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these scores. The player then chooses a species (such as a dwarf, elf, or human \u2013 called \"race\" prior to 5e 2024), a character class (such as a fighter, rogue, or wizard), an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.\nDuring the game, players describe their PCs' intended actions to the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions, such as scaling a cliff or picking a lock, are determined by rolling dice. Different polyhedral dice are used for different actions. For example, a twenty-sided die is used to determine whether a hit is made in combat, with other dice such as four, six, eight, ten, or even twelve-sided die used to determine how much damage was dealt. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills, and the difficulty of the task. In circumstances where a character is attempting to avoid a negative outcome, such as when dodging a trap or resisting the effect of a spell, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting effect is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores. In circumstances where a character is attempting to complete a task such as picking a lock, deactivating a trap, or pushing a boulder, a Difficulty Class must be hit or exceeded. Relevant ability bonuses are added to help players succeed.\nAs the game is played, each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability. Characters gain (or sometimes lose) experience, skills and wealth, and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes, which is called \"Multiclassing\". The key way characters progress is by earning experience points (XP), which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task. Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level, which grants the character improved class features, abilities and skills. XP can be lost in some circumstances, such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy, or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost.\nHit points (HP) are a measure of a character's vitality and health and are determined by the class, level and Constitution of each character. They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm, and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game. Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels. When a PC dies, it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic, although some penalties may be imposed as a result. If resurrection is not possible or not desired, the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game.\nAdventures and campaigns.\nA typical \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" game consists of an \"adventure\", which is roughly equivalent to a single story or quest. The DM can either design an original adventure or follow one of the many premade adventures (also known as \"modules\") that have been published throughout the history of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". Published adventures typically include a background story, illustrations, maps, and goals for players to achieve. Some may include location descriptions and handouts, although they are not required for gameplay. Although a small adventure entitled \"Temple of the Frog\" was included in the \"Blackmoor\" rules supplement in 1975, the first stand-alone \"D&amp;D\" module published by TSR was 1978's \"Steading of the Hill Giant Chief\", written by Gygax.\nA linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a \"campaign\". The locations where these adventures occur, such as a city, country, planet, or entire fictional universe, are referred to as \"campaign settings\" or \"worlds.\" \"D&amp;D\" settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology. Popular commercially published campaign settings for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" include \"Greyhawk\", \"Dragonlance\", \"Forgotten Realms\", \"Mystara\", \"Spelljammer\", \"Ravenloft\", \"Dark Sun\", \"Planescape\", \"Birthright\", and \"Eberron\".\nIn addition to first-party campaigns and modules, two campaigns based on popular culture have been created. The first, based on \"Stranger Things\", was released in May 2019. A campaign based on the \"Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons and Dragons\" comic book series was later released in November 2019.\nAlternatively, DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings, either planning the adventure ahead or expanding on it as the players progress.\nMiniature figures.\nThe wargames from which \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants. \"D&amp;D\" initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors. The original \"D&amp;D\" set of 1974 required the use of the \"Chainmail\" miniatures game for combat resolution. By the publication of the 1977 game editions, combat was mostly resolved verbally. Thus, miniatures were no longer required for gameplay, although some players continued to use them as a visual reference.\nIn the 1970s, numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and similar games. Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include Grenadier Miniatures (1980\u20131983), Citadel Miniatures (1984\u20131986), Ral Partha, and TSR itself. Most of these miniatures used the 25\u00a0mm scale.\nPeriodically, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures-based wargaming. Supplements such as \"Battlesystem\" (1985 and 1989) and a new edition of \"Chainmail\" (2001) provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures.\nSources and influences.\nAn immediate predecessor of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren. These were expanded by Gary Gygax, whose additions included a fantasy supplement, before the game was published as \"Chainmail\". When Dave Wesely entered the Army in 1970, his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer Dave Arneson began a medieval variation of Wesely's Braunstein games, where players control individuals instead of armies. Arneson used \"Chainmail\" to resolve combat. As play progressed, Arneson added such innovations as character classes, experience points, level advancement, armor class, and others. Having partnered previously with Gygax on \"Don't Give Up the Ship!\", Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing \"The Fantasy Game\", the game that became \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax. The name was chosen by Gygax's two-year-old daughter Cindy; upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names, she exclaimed, \"Oh Daddy, I like Dungeons &amp; Dragons best!\", although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his then wife Mary Jo.\nMany \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" elements appear in hobbies of the mid-to-late 20th century. For example, character-based role-playing can be seen in improvisational theater. Game-world simulations were well developed in wargaming. Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in Glorantha's board games, among others. Ultimately, however, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" represents a unique blending of these elements.\nThe world of \"D&amp;D\" was influenced by world mythology, history, pulp fiction, and contemporary fantasy novels, as listed by Gygax in the Appendix N of the original \"Dungeon Master's Guide\". The importance of J.R.R. Tolkien's works \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Hobbit\" as an influence on \"D&amp;D\" is controversial. The presence in the game of halflings, elves, half-elves, dwarves, orcs, rangers, and the like, as well as the convention of diverse adventurers forming a group, draw comparisons to these works. The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from Tolkien Enterprises prompted the name changes of hobbit to 'halfling', ent to 'treant', and balrog to 'balor'. For many years, Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game. However, in an interview in 2000, he acknowledged that Tolkien's work had a \"strong impact\" though he also said that the list of other influential authors was long.\nThe \"D&amp;D\" magic system, in which wizards memorize spells that are used up once cast and must be re-memorized the next day, was heavily influenced by the \"Dying Earth\" stories and novels of Jack Vance. The original alignment system (which grouped all characters and creatures into 'Law', 'Neutrality' and 'Chaos') was derived from the novel \"Three Hearts and Three Lions\" by Poul Anderson. A troll described in this work influenced the \"D&amp;D\" definition of that monster. Writer and game designer Graeme Davis saw the Labyrinth of the Greek myth of the Minotaur as an inspiration for the game's use of dungeons as monster lairs.\nOther influences include the works of Robert E. Howard, Edgar Rice Burroughs, A. Merritt, H. P. Lovecraft, Fritz Leiber, L. Sprague de Camp, Fletcher Pratt, Roger Zelazny, and Michael Moorcock. Monsters, spells, and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works such as A. E. van Vogt's \"Black Destroyer\", Coeurl (the Displacer Beast), Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" (vorpal sword) and the Book of Genesis (the clerical spell 'Blade Barrier' was inspired by the \"flaming sword which turned every way\" at the gates of Eden).\nDevelopment history.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has gone through several revisions. Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions.\nOriginal game.\nThe original \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", now referred to as \"OD&amp;D\", is a small box set of three booklets published in 1974. With a very limited production budget of only $2000\u2014with only $100 budgeted for artwork\u2014it is amateurish in production and assumes the player is familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold in the first year, followed by 3,000 in 1975, and many more in the following years. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original \"Greyhawk\" and \"Blackmoor\" supplements (both 1975), as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many fanzines.\nTwo-pronged strategy.\nIn early 1977, TSR created the first element of a two-pronged strategy that would divide \"D&amp;D\" for nearly two decades. A \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set\" boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules, makes the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" (\"AD&amp;D\") was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the \"Basic Set\" directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.\nAs a result of this parallel development, the basic game includes many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in \"AD&amp;D\". John Eric Holmes, the editor of the basic game, preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation. \"AD&amp;D\", on the other hand, was designed to create a tighter, more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game. Between 1977 and 1979, three hardcover rulebooks, commonly referred to as the \"core rulebooks\", were released: the \"Player's Handbook\" (PHB), the \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" (DMG), and the \"Monster Manual\" (MM). Several supplementary books were published throughout the 1980s, notably \"Unearthed Arcana\" (1985), which included a large number of new rules. Confusing matters further, the original \"D&amp;D\" boxed set remained in publication until 1979, since it remained a healthy seller for TSR.\nRevised editions.\nIn the 1980s, the rules for \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and \"basic\" \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" remained separate, each developing along different paths. In 1981, the basic version of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was revised by Tom Moldvay to make it even more novice-friendly. It was promoted as a continuation of the original \"D&amp;D\" tone, whereas \"AD&amp;D\" was promoted as an advancement of the mechanics. An accompanying \"Expert Set\", originally written by David \"Zeb\" Cook, allows players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play. In 1983, revisions of those sets by Frank Mentzer were released, revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format. These were followed by \"Companion\" (1983), \"Master\" (1985), and \"Immortals\" (1986) sets. Each set covers game play for more powerful characters than the previous. The first four sets were compiled in 1991 as a single hardcover book, the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia\", which was released alongside a new introductory boxed set.\n\"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition\" was published in 1989, again as three core rulebooks; the primary designer was David \"Zeb\" Cook. The \"Monster Manual\" was replaced by the \"Monstrous Compendium\", a loose-leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover \"Monstrous Manual\" in 1993. In 1995, the core rulebooks were slightly revised, although still referred to by TSR as the 2nd Edition, and a series of \"Player's Option\" manuals were released as optional rulebooks.\nThe release of \"AD&amp;D 2nd Edition\" deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity. References to demons and devils, sexually suggestive artwork, and playable, evil-aligned character types\u00a0\u2013 such as assassins and half-orcs\u00a0\u2013 were removed. The edition moved away from a theme of 1960s and 1970s \"sword and sorcery\" fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology. The rules underwent minor changes, including the addition of non-weapon proficiencies\u00a0\u2013 skill-like abilities that appear in first edition supplements. The game's magic spells are divided into schools and spheres. A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy. This included blending fantasy with other genres, such as horror (Ravenloft), science fiction (Spelljammer), and apocalyptic (Dark Sun), as well as alternative historical and non-European mythological settings.\nWizards of the Coast.\nIn 1997, a near-bankrupt TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast. Following three years of development, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 3rd edition was released in 2000. The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game. It was the largest revision of the \"D&amp;D\" rules to date and served as the basis for a multi-genre role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the d20 System. The 3rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game, allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play. Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters. The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat. In 2003, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons v.3.5\" was released as a revision of the 3rd Edition rules. This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes, mostly minor, and expanded the core rulebooks.\nIn early 2005, Wizards of the Coast's R&amp;D team started to develop \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 4th Edition, prompted mainly by the feedback obtained from the \"D&amp;D\" playing community and a desire to make the game faster, more intuitive, and with a better play experience than under the 3rd Edition. The new game was developed through a number of design phases spanning from May 2005 until its release. \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 4th Edition was announced at Gen Con in August 2007, and the initial three core books were released June 6, 2008. 4th Edition streamlined the game into a simplified form and introduced numerous rules changes. Many character abilities were restructured into \"Powers\". These altered the spell-using classes by adding abilities that could be used at will, per encounter, or per day. Likewise, non-magic-using classes were provided with parallel sets of options. Software tools, including player character and monster-building programs, became a major part of the game. This edition added the \"D&amp;D Encounters\" program; a weekly event held at local stores designed to draw players back to the game by giving \"the busy gamer the chance to play \"D&amp;D\" once a week as their schedules allow. In the past, \"D&amp;D\" games could take months, even years, and players generally had to attend every session so that the story flow wasn't interrupted. With \"Encounters\", players can come and go as they choose and new players can easily be integrated into the story continuity\".\n5th Edition.\nOn January 9, 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced that it was working on a 5th edition of the game. The company planned to take suggestions from players and let them playtest the rules. Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012. At Gen Con 2012 in August, Mike Mearls, co-lead developer for 5th Edition, said that Wizards of the Coast had received feedback from more than 75,000 playtesters, but that the entire development process would take two years, adding, \"I can't emphasize this enough\u00a0... we're very serious about taking the time we need to get this right.\" The release of the 5th Edition, coinciding with \"D&amp;D\"'s 40th anniversary, occurred in the second half of 2014.\nSince the release of 5th edition, dozens of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" books have been published including new rulebooks, campaign guides and adventure modules. 2017 had \"the most number of players in its history\u201412 million to 15 million in North America alone\". Mary Pilon, for \"Bloomberg\", reported that sales of 5th edition \"Dungeon &amp; Dragons\" \"were up 41 percent in 2017 from the year before, and soared another 52 percent in 2018, the game's biggest sales year yet. [...] In 2017, 9 million people watched others play D&amp;D on Twitch, immersing themselves in the world of the game without ever having to pick up a die or cast a spell\". In 2018, Wizards of the Coast organized a massive live-stream event, the Stream of Many Eyes, where ten live-streamed sessions of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" were performed on Twitch over three days. This event won the Content Marketing Institute's 2019 award for best \"In-Person (Event) Content Marketing Strategy\". \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" continued to have a strong presence on Twitch throughout 2019; this included a growing number of celebrity players and dungeon masters, such as Joe Manganiello, Deborah Ann Woll and Stephen Colbert. Wizards of the Coast has created, produced and sponsored multiple web series featuring \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". These shows have typically aired on the official \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" Twitch and YouTube channels.\nIn 2020, Wizards of the Coast announced that \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" had its 6th annual year of growth in 2019 with a \"300 percent increase in sales of their introductory box sets, as well as a 65% increase on sales in Europe, a rate which has more than quadrupled since 2014\". In terms of player demographics in 2019, 39% of identified as female and 61% identified as male. 40% of players are considered Gen Z (24 years old or younger), 34% of players are in the age range of 25\u201334 and 26% of players are aged 35+. In January 2021, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that according to Liz Schuh, head of publishing and licensing for Dungeons &amp; Dragons, \"revenue was up 35% in 2020 compared with 2019, the seventh consecutive year of growth,\" and in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, \"virtual play rose 86% [...] aided by online platforms such as Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds\". Sarah Parvini, for the \"Los Angeles Times\", wrote, \"players and scholars attribute the game's resurgent popularity not only to the longueurs of the pandemic, but also to its reemergence in pop culture\u2014on the Netflix series \"Stranger Things\", whose main characters play D&amp;D in a basement; on the sitcom \"The Big Bang Theory\"; or via the host of celebrities who display their love for the game online\".\nFollowing an apology issued by Wizards of the Coast for offensive and racist material included in \"\" and the announced revisions to the product in September 2022, Chris Perkins \u2013 Wizards' game design architect \u2013 announced a new inclusion review process for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" studio in November 2022. This process will now require \"every word, illustration, and map\" to be reviewed at several steps in development \"by multiple outside cultural consultants prior to publication\". The previous process only included cultural consultants at the discretion of the product lead for a project. All products being reprinted will also go through this new review process and be updated as needed.\n2024 revision.\nIn September 2021, it was announced that a backwards compatible \"evolution\" of 5th edition would be released in 2024 to mark the 50th anniversary of the game. In August 2022, Wizards announced that the next phase of major changes for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" would occur under the \"One D&amp;D\" initiative which includes a public playtest of the next version of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and an upcoming virtual tabletop (VTT) simulator with 3D environments developed using Unreal Engine. Revised editions of the \"Player's Handbook\", \"Monster Manual\", and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" were scheduled to be released in 2024; the revised \"Player's Handbook\" and \"Dungeon Master's Guide\" were released in 2024, with the \"Monster Manual\" released in February 2025.\nIn April 2022, Hasbro announced that Wizards would acquire the D&amp;D Beyond digital toolset and game companion from Fandom; the official transfer to Wizards occurred in May 2022. At the Hasbro Investor Event in October 2022, it was announced that Dan Rawson, former COO of Microsoft Dynamics 365, was appointed to the newly created position of Senior Vice President for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" brand; Rawson will act as the new head of the franchise. Chase Carter of \"Dicebreaker\" highlighted that Rawson's role is \"part of Wizards' plans to apply more resources to the digital side of D&amp;D\" following the purchase of D&amp;D Beyond by Hasbro earlier in the year. Wizards of the Coast CEO Cynthia Williams and Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks, at a December 2022 Hasbro investor-focused web seminar, called the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" brand \"under monetized\". They highlighted the high engagement of fans with the brand, however, the majority of spending is by Dungeon Masters who are only roughly 20% of the player base. Williams commented that the increased investment in digital will \"unlock the type of recurrent spending you see in digital games\". \nAt the July 2024 Hasbro investor meeting, Cocks stated \"that digital revenue on D&amp;D Beyond 'accounts for over half' of\" the total earnings from \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". Carter, now for \"Rascal\", commented that \"we know physical books sell poorly, and even if pre-orders for the 2024 core books are, uh, 'solid', according to the CEO, it's evident that Hasbro holds little faith in analog games clotting the money bleed elsewhere in the company's structure\". The 3D VTT \"Sigil\" launched as part of D&amp;D Beyond in March 2025. Later that month, approximately 90% of the development team were laid off; in an internal communication, Hasbro Direct senior vice president Dan Rawson stated \"our aspirations for \"Sigil\" as a large, standalone game with a distinct monetization path will not be realized\". Following the release of core rulebooks for the 2024 revision, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" Creative Director Chris Perkins and Game Director Jeremy Crawford announced their departures from Wizards of the Coast. Christian Hoffer, for \"Screen Rant\", highlighted that both \"have been part of the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" design team for decades and were two of the lead designers of\" \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 5th Edition. On this change in game's leadership, he noted that VP of Franchise and Product (\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\") Jess Lanzillo \"mentioned that James Wyatt and Wes Schneider, principal designers who have been part of the \"D&amp;D\" team for years, will both have a 'bigger place at the table'\" and \"other designers, including Justice Arman, would also have progressive leadership roles as well\". In June 2025, Perkins and Crawford announced that they had joined Critical Role Productions' tabletop game imprint Darrington Press. Lin Codega of \"Rascal\" noted \"over the last two years, the tabletop titan has lost much of its veteran talent pool\" and this now includes the departures of Lanzillo and senior content marketing strategist Todd Kenreck.\nLicensing.\nEarly in the game's history, TSR took no action against small publishers' production of \"D&amp;D\" compatible material and even licensed Judges Guild to produce \"D&amp;D\" materials for several years, such as \"City State of the Invincible Overlord.\" This attitude changed in the mid-1980s when TSR took legal action to try to prevent others from publishing compatible material. This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies. Although TSR took legal action against several publishers in an attempt to restrict third-party usage, it never brought any court cases to completion, instead settling out of court in every instance. TSR itself ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases.\nWith the launch of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\"'s 3rd Edition, Wizards of the Coast made the d20 System available under the Open Game License (OGL) and d20 System trademark license. Under these licenses, authors were free to use the d20 System when writing games and game supplements. The OGL has allowed a wide range of unofficial commercial derivative work based on the mechanics of \"Dungeons and Dragons\" to be produced since 2000; it is credited with increasing the market share of d20 products\"\" and leading to a \"boom in the RPG industry in the early 2000s\".\nWith the release of the 4th Edition, Wizards of the Coast introduced its Game System License, which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as Paizo Publishing with its \"Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\") who previously produced materials in support of the \"D&amp;D\" product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as Kenzer &amp; Company, returned to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.\nDuring the 2000s, there has been a trend towards reviving and recreating older editions of \"D&amp;D\", known as the Old School Revival. This, in turn, inspired the creation of \"retro-clones\", games that more closely recreate the original rule sets, using material placed under the OGL along with non-copyrightable mechanical aspects of the older rules to create a new presentation of the games.\nAlongside the publication of the 5th Edition, Wizards of the Coast established a two-pronged licensing approach. The core of the 5th Edition rules have been made available under the OGL, while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials directly for Dungeons &amp; Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under a program called the DM's Guild. The DM's Guild does not function under the OGL, but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation among content creators.\nWizards of the Coast has started to release 5th Edition products that tie into other intellectual properties\u2014such as \"\" with the \"Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica\" (2018) and \"Mythic Odysseys of Theros\" (2020) source books. Two 5th Edition starter box sets based on TV shows, \"Stranger Things\" and \"Rick and Morty\", were released in 2019. Source books based on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" live play series have also been released: \"Acquisitions Incorporated\" (2019) and \"Explorer's Guide to Wildemount\" (2020).\nBetween November and December 2022, there was reported speculation that Wizards was planning on discontinuing the OGL for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" based on unconfirmed leaks. In response to the speculation, Wizards stated in November 2022: \"We will continue to support the thousands of creators making third-party D&amp;D content with the release of One D&amp;D in 2024.\" Limited details on the update to the OGL, including the addition of revenue reporting and required royalties, were released by Wizards in December 2022. Linda Codega, for \"Io9\" in January 2023, reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL 1.1 including updated terms such as no longer authorizing use of the OGL1.0. Codega highlighted that \"if the original license is in fact no longer viable, every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement. [...] The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand\". A week after the leak, Wizards issued a response which walked back several changes to the OGL; this response did not contain the updated OGL. The Motley Fool highlighted that \"Hasbro pulled an abrupt volte-face and had its subsidiary D&amp;D Beyond publish a mea culpa on its website\". On January 27, 2023, following feedback received during the open comment period for the draft OGL1.2, Wizards of the Coast announced that the System Reference Document 5.1 (SRD 5.1) would be released under an irrevocable Creative Commons license (CC BY 4.0) effective immediately and Wizards would no longer pursue deauthorizing the OGL1.0a. The SRD was then revised to reflect the 2024 revision to the 5th Edition ruleset; (SRD 5.2) was released under a Creative Commons license on April 22, 2025.\nReception.\nEric Goldberg reviewed \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #1 (March 1980), rating it a 6 out of 9, and commented that \"\"Dungeons and Dragons\" is an impressive achievement based on the concept alone, and also must be credited with cementing the marriage between the fantasy genre and gaming.\" Goldberg again reviewed \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #3 and commented that \"\"D&amp;D\" is the FRP game played most often in most places.\" In the 1980 book \"The Complete Book of Wargames\", game designer Jon Freeman asked, \"What can be said about a phenomenon? Aside from \"Tactics II\" and possibly \"PanzerBlitz\" (the first modern tactical wargame), this is the most significant war game since H.G. Wells.\" However, Freeman did have significant issues with the game, pointing out, \"On the other hand, beginning characters are without exception dull, virtually powerless, and so fragile\" which was not encouraging for \"newcomers.\" He also called the magic system \"stupid\" feeling that many of the spells were \"redundant\" and \"the effects of the majority are hopelessly vague.\" He found essential elements such as saving throws, hit points, and experience points \"undefined or poorly explained; the ratio of substance to \"holes\" compares unfavorably with the head of a tennis racquet.\" He also noted the rules were \"presented in the most illiterate display of poor grammar, misspellings, and typographical errors in professional wargaming.\" Despite all these issues, Freeman concluded, \"As it was given birth, it is fascinating but misshapen; in its best incarnations, it's perhaps the most exciting and attractive specimen alive.\"\nThe game had over three million players worldwide by 1981, and copies of the rules were selling at a rate of about 750,000 per year by 1984. Beginning with a French language edition in 1982, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has been translated into many languages beyond the original English. By 1992, the game had been translated into 14 languages and sold over 2 million copies in 44 countries worldwide. By 2004, consumers had spent more than $ on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" products and the game had been played by more than 20\u00a0million people. As many as six million people played the game in 2007. David M. Ewalt, in his book \"Of Dice and Men\" (2013), praised that the game allows for a personal fantastical experience and stated that \"even though it's make-believe, the catharsis is real.\"\nAcclaim.\nThe various editions of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" have won many Origins Awards, including \"All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of 1977\", \"Best Roleplaying Rules of 1989\", \"Best Roleplaying Game of 2000\" and \"Best Role Playing Game and Best Role Playing Supplement of 2014\" for the flagship editions of the game. Both \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" are Origins Hall of Fame Games inductees as they were deemed sufficiently distinct to merit separate inclusion on different occasions. The independent \"Games\" magazine placed \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" on their \"Games 100\" list from 1980 through 1983, then entered the game into the magazine's Hall of Fame in 1984. \"Games\" magazine included \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" in their \"Top 100 Games of 1980\", saying \"The more players, the merrier.\" \"Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was ranked 2nd in the 1996 reader poll of \"Arcane\" magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time. \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2016 and into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2017.\nLater editions.\nLater editions would lead to inevitable comparisons between the game series. Scott Taylor for \"Black Gate\" in 2013 rated \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" as #1 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying \"The grand-daddy of all games, \"D&amp;D\" just keeps on going, and although there might always be 'edition wars' between players, that just says that it effectively stays within the consciousness of multiple generations of players as a relevant piece of entertainment.\"\nGriffin McElroy, for \"Polygon\" in 2014, wrote: \"The game has shifted in the past four decades, bouncing between different rules sets, philosophies and methods of play. Role-playing, character customization and real-life improvisational storytelling has always been at the game's core, but how those ideas are interpreted by the game system has changed drastically edition-to-edition\". Dieter Bohn, for \"The Verge\" in 2014, wrote: \"Every few years there's been a new version of \"D&amp;D\" that tries to address the shortcomings of the previous version and also make itself more palatable to its age. [...] The third edition got a reputation (which it didn't necessarily deserve) for being too complex and rules-focused. The fourth edition got a reputation (which it didn't necessarily deserve) for being too focused on miniatures and grids, too mechanical. Meanwhile, the company that owns \"D&amp;D\" had released a bunch of its old material for free as a service to fans, and some of that was built up into a competing game called \"Pathfinder\". \"Pathfinder\" ultimately became more popular, by some metrics, than \"D&amp;D\" itself\". Bohn highlighted that the 5th Edition was \"designed for one purpose: to bring \"D&amp;D\" back to its roots and win back everybody who left during the edition wars\". Henry Glasheen, for \"SLUG Magazine\" in 2015, highlighted that after jumping ship during the 4th Edition era he was drawn back to \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" with 5th Edition and he considers it \"the new gold standard for D20-based tabletop RPGs\". Glasheen wrote \"Fifth Edition is a compelling reason to get excited about D&amp;D again\" and \"while some will welcome the simplicity, I fully expect that plenty of people will stick to whatever system suits them best. However, this edition is easily my favorite, ranking even higher than D&amp;D 3.5, my first love in D&amp;D\".\nChristian Hoffer, for \"ComicBook.com\" in 2022, highlighted the continuing fan debate on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and \"Pathfinder's\" current editions which centers on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" 5th Edition's market dominance. Hoffer wrote, \"The reality is that \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fifth Edition\" is likely the most popular tabletop roleplaying game ever made, even more so than previous editions of the games. 5E has brought millions of new players to tabletop roleplaying games. Many of those newer players have never heard of other roleplaying games, even popular ones like \"Vampire: The Masquerade\" or \"Cyberpunk\" or \"Pathfinder.\" [...] Many content creators and publishers see 5E as their main path to survival and relevance even if it's not their preferred gaming system\". In December 2023, James Whitbrook of \"Gizmodo\" highlighted \"\"D&amp;D\"'s continued social influence\" with the release of related media such as the film \"\", the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures\" FAST channel, and the video game \"Baldur's Gate 3\" with the video game's \"blockbuster success\" credited \"for a 40% increase in Wizards of the Coast's earnings over 2022\". However, Whitbrook opined that not even these successes \"could save \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" from the greed of its owners\" with the OGL controversy and major layoffs by Hasbro bookending \"what should've been one of the greatest years for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" the game has ever seen\u2014more popular than ever, more accessible than ever, more culturally relevant than ever\u2014and in doing so transformed it into a golden era sullied with dark marks, overshadowed by grim caveats, a reflection that those with the most power in these spaces never really take the lessons they espoused to learn from their mistakes\". In 2025, Harvey Randall of \"PC Gamer\" similarly noted that he has \"little confidence\" in Hasbro and its leadership knowing \"what to do with any of its [\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\"] victories\". On the 5th Edition rules revision, Randall commented, \"the fact that WoTC didn't feel confident enough to reinvent much of anything after 10 years signals how paralyzed the entire operation has become [...]. After a \"decade\" of successes, and after a massive, hobby-wide controversy seemingly couldn't sink it, D&amp;D's next big move was to equip you with basically the same game for the next 10 years. No innovation, no progression, just a slightly different angle to the wheels spinning in the dirt\".\nMoral panic.\nAt various times in its history, \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has received negative publicity, in particular from some Christian groups, for alleged promotion of such practices as devil worship, witchcraft, suicide, and murder, and for the presence of naked breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original \"AD&amp;D\" manuals (mainly monsters such as harpies, succubi, etc.). These controversies led TSR to remove many potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the 2nd Edition of \"AD&amp;D\". Many of these references, including the use of the names \"devils\" and \"demons\", were reintroduced in the 3rd edition. The moral panic over the game led to problems for fans of \"D&amp;D\" who faced social ostracism, unfair treatment, and false association with the occult and Satanism, regardless of an individual fan's actual religious affiliation and beliefs. However, the controversy was also beneficial in evoking the Streisand Effect by giving the game widespread notoriety that significantly increased sales in the early 1980s in defiance of the moral panic.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has been the subject of rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality, even leading to psychotic episodes. The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III, the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel \"Mazes and Monsters\" and later made into a TV movie in 1982 starring Tom Hanks. William Dear, the private investigator hired by the Egbert family to find their son when he went missing at college, wrote a book titled \"The Dungeon Master\" (1984) refuting any connection with D&amp;D and Egbert's personal issues. The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard, who was convicted in 1990 of murdering his stepfather. Research by various psychologists, starting with Armando Simon, has concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of \"D&amp;D\". \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" has also been cited as encouraging people to socialize weekly or biweekly, teaching problem solving skills, which can be beneficial in adult life, and teaching positive moral decisions.\nLater criticism.\n\"D&amp;D\" has been compared unfavorably to other role-playing games of its time. Writing for \"Slate\" in 2008, Erik Sofge makes unfavorable comparisons between the violent incentives of \"D&amp;D\" and the more versatile role-playing experience of \"GURPS\". He claims that \"for decades, gamers have argued that since \"D&amp;D\" came first, its lame, morally repulsive experience system can be forgiven. But the damage is still being done: New generations of players are introduced to RPGs as little more than a collective fantasy of massacre.\" This criticism generated backlash from \"D&amp;D\" fans. Writing for \"Ars Technica\", Ben Kuchera responded that Sofge had experienced a \"small-minded Dungeon Master who only wanted to kill things\", and that better game experiences are possible.\nIn 2020, \"Polygon\" reported that \"the D&amp;D team announced that it would be making changes to portions of its 5th edition product line that fans have called out for being insensitive\". Sebastian Modak, for \"The Washington Post\", reported that the tabletop community has widely approved these changes. Modak wrote that \"in its statement addressing mistakes around portrayals of different peoples in the D&amp;D universe, Wizards of the Coast highlighted its recent efforts in bringing in more diverse voices to craft the new \"D&amp;D\" sourcebooks coming out in 2021. [...] These conversations\u2014around depictions of race and alleged treatment of employees of marginalized backgrounds and identities\u2014have encouraged players to seek out other tabletop roleplaying experiences\". Matthew Gault, for \"Wired\", reported positively on the roundtable discussions Wizards of the Coast has hosted with fans and community leaders on diversity and inclusion. However, Gault also highlighted that other efforts, such as revisions to old material and the release of new material, have been less great and at times minimal. Gault wrote, \"WotC appears to be trying to change things, but it keeps stumbling, and it's often the fans who pick up the pieces. [...] WotC is trying to make changes, but it often feels like lip service. [...] The loudest voices criticizing D&amp;D right now are doing it out of love. They don't want to see it destroyed, they want it to change with the times\". However, in 2022, academic Christopher Ferguson stated that the game \"was not associated with greater ethnocentrism (one facet of racism) attitudes\" after he conducted a survey study of 308 adults (38.2% non-White, and 17% \"Dungeons and Dragons\" players). Ferguson concluded that Wizards of the Coast may be responding to a moral panic similar to that surrounding Satanism in the 1990s. In the 2024 update to 5e, character \"race\" (such as dwarf, elf, or human) was changed to \"species.\"\nBetween November and December 2022, there was reported speculation that Wizards was planning to discontinue the Open Game License for \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" based on unconfirmed leaks. Following an initial response to the speculation by Wizards in November 2022, the company released limited details on the update to the OGL in December 2022. Linda Codega, writing for \"Io9\", reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL 1.1 on January 5, 2023. Codega highlighted that \"every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement. [...] The main takeaway from the leaked OGL 1.1 draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand\". \"ICv2\" commented that the leaked OGL had several controversial parts. Following this leak, numerous news and industry-focused outlets reported on negative reactions from both fans and professional content creators. \"TheStreet\" highlighted that \"the company's main competitors\" quickly pivoted away from the OGL in the time it took Wizards to settle on a response. \"Starburst\" commented that \"historically when the owners of \"Dungeons and Dragons\" attempt to restrict what people can do with the game, it leads to a boom in other tabletop roleplaying games. This is happening right now\". \"TheStreet\" also commented that Wizards united its \"entire player base\" against it; both \"TheStreet\" and \"Io9\" highlighted the movement to boycott D&amp;D Beyond and mass subscription cancellations with \"Io9\" stating that the \"immediate financial consequences\" forced a response by Wizards. \"Io9\" reported that Wizards' internal messaging on the response to the leak was this was a fan overreaction. In the ensuing weeks, Wizards walked back changes to the OGL and solicited public feedback before pivoting away from the OGL to release the (SRD 5.1) under an irrevocable creative commons license (CC BY 4.0). Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that \"pushback from fans, who criticized WotC's response as far from an apology and a dismissal of their legitimate concerns, led WotC to backpedal further\" and that the company \"appears to have committed an irreversible act of self-sabotage in trying to replace [the OGL] \u2014 squandering the prestige accumulated over 20 years in a matter of weeks\". Both \"Io9\" and \"ComicBook.com\" called the major concessions \u2013 releasing the SRD 5.1 under the creative commons and no longer deauthorizing the OGL1.0a \u2013 announced by Wizards a \"huge victory\" for the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" community.\nLegacy and influence.\n\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" was the first modern role-playing game and it established many of the conventions that have dominated the genre. Particularly notable are the use of dice as a game mechanic, character record sheets, use of numerical attributes, and gamemaster-centered group dynamics. Within months of the release of \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", new role-playing game writers and publishers began releasing their own role-playing games, with most of these being in the fantasy genre. Some of the earliest other role-playing games inspired by \"D&amp;D\" include \"Tunnels &amp; Trolls\" (1975), \"Empire of the Petal Throne\" (1975), and \"Chivalry &amp; Sorcery\" (1976). The game's commercial success was a factor that led to lawsuits regarding the distribution of royalties between original creators Gygax and Arneson. Gygax later became embroiled in a political struggle for control of TSR which culminated in a court battle and Gygax's decision to sell his ownership interest in the company in 1985.\nThe role-playing movement initiated by \"D&amp;D\" would lead to the release of the science fiction game \"Traveller\" (1977), the fantasy game \"RuneQuest\" (1978), and subsequent game systems such as Chaosium's \"Call of Cthulhu\" (1981), \"Champions\" (1982), \"GURPS\" (1986), and \"\" (1991). \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" and the games it influenced fed back into the genre's origin\u00a0\u2013 miniatures wargames\u00a0\u2013 with combat strategy games like \"Warhammer Fantasy Battles\". \"D&amp;D\" also had a large impact on modern video games.\nDirector Jon Favreau credits \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" with giving him \"...\u00a0a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance.\" ND Stevenson and the crew of \"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power\" were strongly influenced by \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\", with Stevenson calling it basically a D&amp;D campaign, with Adora, Glimmer, and Bow falling into \"specific classes in D&amp;D\". A \"D&amp;D\" campaign held among id Software staff in the early 1990s featured a demonic invasion, a warrior named \"Quake\" and a magic item named \"Daikatana\". John Romero has credited the campaign with inspiring many of his video games of the era, including \"Doom\", \"Quake\" and \"Daikatana\".\nCurtis D. Carbonell, in the 2019 book \"Dread Trident: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Modern Fantastic\", wrote: \"Negative association with earlier niche 'nerd' culture have reversed. 5e has become inclusive in its reach of players, after years of focusing on a white, male demographic. [...] At its simplest, the game system now encourages different types of persons to form a party not just to combat evil [...] but to engage in any number of adventure scenarios\". Academic Emma French, in \"Real Life in Real Time: Live Streaming Culture\" (2023), commented on the impact of actual play on the broader \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" gaming culture \u2013 \"actual play media circumvents D&amp;D's insulated or exclusionary aspects, skewing away from 'basement dwelling nerds' in favor of a networked, global fandom. Live streaming is now a means of introducing individuals to the game, bringing it into the mainstream at a time when other geek pursuits have also achieved wider visibility and popularity\". French highlighted that in 2020 \"no actual play live streams hosted by the official DnD channel featured an all-male cast\u2014showing a massive shift from the brand ambassadors endorsed by Wizards of the Coast\" previously. French argued that not only has the more accessible and inclusive actual play landscape impacted the gaming culture but it has also impacted the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" product itself from the promotion campaign of \"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything\" featuring \"diverse nerd celebrities\" to \"direct action taken against previous exclusionary behavior\" as seen in Wizards of the Coast statements on diversity and \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". French wrote, \"as actual play live streams broaden the range of customers that D&amp;D can market itself to, it may enact real, seismic change to the mainstream perception of geek identity, and contribute to a push for diverse representation within geek subculture as a whole\".\nRelated products.\n\"D&amp;D\"'s commercial success has led to many other related products, including \"Dragon\" and \"Dungeon\" magazines, an animated television series, a film series, an off-Broadway stage , an official role-playing soundtrack, novels, both ongoing and limited series licensed comics, and numerous computer and video games. Hobby and toy stores sell dice, miniatures, adventures, and other game aids related to \"D&amp;D\" and its game offspring.\nIn November 2023, Hasbro's Entertainment One launched the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventures\" FAST channel, available on platforms such as Amazon Freevee and Plex, which features new actual play web series, reruns of the animated \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" series, and reruns of other \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" web series.\nIn popular culture.\n\"D&amp;D\" grew in popularity through the late 1970s and 1980s. Numerous games, films, and cultural references based on \"D&amp;D\" or \"D&amp;D\"-like fantasies, characters or adventures have been ubiquitous since the end of the 1970s. \"D&amp;D\" players are (sometimes pejoratively) portrayed as the epitome of geekdom, and have become the basis of much geek and gamer humor and satire. Since the release of 5th edition, actual play web series and podcasts such as \"Critical Role\", \"Dimension 20\", and \"The Adventure Zone\", among many others, have experienced a growth in viewership and popularity. According to Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner, viewers on Twitch and YouTube spent over 150 million hours watching \"D&amp;D\" gameplay in 2020.\nFamous \"D&amp;D\" players include Pulitzer Prize-winning author Junot D\u00edaz, professional basketball player Tim Duncan, comedian Stephen Colbert, and actors Vin Diesel and Robin Williams. \"D&amp;D\" and its fans have been the subject of spoof films, including \"\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnknown author\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7941", "revid": "45072423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7941", "title": "Double jeopardy", "text": "Legal defence preventing someone from being tried again on the same charges\nIn jurisprudence, double jeopardy is a procedural defence (primarily in common law jurisdictions) that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same or similar charges following an acquittal or conviction. Double jeopardy is a common concept in criminal law \u2013 in civil law, a similar concept is that of .\nA variation in common law countries is the peremptory plea, which may take the specific forms of ('previously acquitted') or ('previously convicted'). These doctrines appear to have originated in ancient Roman law, in the broader principle ('not twice against the same').\nAvailability as a legal defence.\nIf a double jeopardy issue is raised, evidence will be placed before the court, which will typically rule as a preliminary matter whether the plea is substantiated; if it is, the projected trial will be prevented from proceeding. In some countries, certain exemptions are permitted. In Scotland, a new trial can be initiated if, for example, the acquitted has made a credible admission of guilt. Part of English law for over 800 years, it was partially abolished in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 where, following demand for change, serious offences may be re-tried following an acquittal if new and compelling evidence is found, and if the trial is found to be in the public's interest. In some countries, including Canada, Mexico, and the United States, the guarantee against double jeopardy is a constitutional right. In other countries, the protection is afforded by statute.\nIn common law countries, a defendant may enter a peremptory plea of ('previously acquitted') or ('previously convicted'), with the same effect.\nDouble jeopardy is not a principle of international law. It does not apply between different countries, unless having been contractually agreed on between those countries as, for example, in the European Union (Art. 54 Schengen Convention), and in various extradition treaties between two countries.\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\nThe 72 signatories and 166 parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognise, under Article 14 (7): \"No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country.\" However, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereigns (unless the relevant extradition treaty expresses a prohibition).\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights.\nAll members of the Council of Europe (which includes nearly all European countries and every member of the European Union) have adopted the European Convention on Human Rights. The optional Protocol No. 7 to the convention, Article 4, protects against double jeopardy: \"No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an offence for which he or she has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.\"\nAll EU states ratified this optional protocol except for Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. In those member states, national rules governing double jeopardy may or may not comply with the provision cited above.\nMember states may, however, implement legislation which allows the reopening of a case if new evidence is found or if there was a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.\nIn many European countries, the prosecution may appeal an acquittal to a higher court. This is not regarded as double jeopardy, but as a continuation of the same case. The European Convention on Human Rights permits this by using the phrase \"finally acquitted or convicted\" as the trigger for prohibiting subsequent prosecution.\nBy country.\nAustralia.\nIn contrast to other common law nations, Australian double jeopardy law has been held to further prevent the prosecution for perjury following a previous acquittal where a finding of perjury would controvert the acquittal. This was confirmed in the case of \"R v Carroll\", where the police found new evidence convincingly disproving Carroll's sworn alibi two decades after he had been acquitted of murder charges in the death of Ipswich child Deidre Kennedy, and successfully prosecuted him for perjury. Public outcry following the overturn of his conviction (for perjury) by the High Court has led to widespread calls for reform of the law along the lines of the England and Wales legislation.\nDuring a Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting of 2007, model legislation to rework double jeopardy laws was drafted, but there was no formal agreement for each state to introduce it. All states have now chosen to introduce legislation that mirrors COAG's recommendations on \"fresh and compelling\" evidence.\nIn New South Wales, retrials of serious cases with a minimum sentence of 20 years or more are now possible even if the original trial preceded the 2006 reform. On 17 October 2006, the New South Wales Parliament passed legislation abolishing the rule against double jeopardy in cases where:\nOn 30 July 2008, South Australia also introduced legislation to scrap parts of its double jeopardy law, legalising retrials for serious offences with \"fresh and compelling\" evidence, or if the acquittal was tainted.\nIn Western Australia, amendments introduced on 8 September 2011 allow retrial if \"new and compelling\" evidence is found. It applies to serious offences where the penalty is life imprisonment or imprisonment for 14 years or more. Acquittal because of tainting (witness intimidation, jury tampering, or perjury) also permits retrial.\nIn Tasmania, on 19 August 2008, amendments were introduced to allow retrial in serious cases if there is \"fresh and compelling\" evidence.\nIn Victoria on 21 December 2011, legislation was passed allowing new trials where there is \"fresh and compelling DNA evidence, where the person acquitted subsequently admits to the crime, or where it becomes clear that key witnesses have given false evidence\". However, retrial applications could only be made for serious offences such as murder, manslaughter, arson causing death, serious drug offences and aggravated forms of rape and armed robbery.\nIn Queensland on 18 October 2007, the double jeopardy laws were modified to allow a retrial where fresh and compelling evidence becomes available after an acquittal for murder or a \"tainted acquittal\" for a crime carrying a 25-year or more sentence. A \"tainted acquittal\" requires a conviction for an administration of justice offence, such as perjury, that led to the original acquittal.\nCanada.\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms includes provisions such as section 11(h) prohibiting double jeopardy. However, the prohibition only applies after an accused person has been \"finally\" convicted or acquitted. Canadian law allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal based on legal errors. In rare circumstances, when a trial judge made all the factual findings necessary for a finding of guilt but misapplied the law, a court of appeal might also directly substitute an acquittal for a conviction. These cases are not considered double jeopardy because the appeal and the subsequent conviction are deemed to be a continuation of the original trial.\nFor an appeal from an acquittal to be successful, the Supreme Court of Canada requires the Crown prosecutor to show that an error in law was made during the trial and that it contributed to the verdict. It has been argued that this test is unfairly beneficial to the prosecution. For instance, in his book \"My Life in Crime and Other Academic Adventures\", Martin Friedland contends that the rule should be changed so that a retrial is granted only when the error is shown to be \"responsible\" for the verdict, not just a factor.\nThough the charter permits appeals of acquittals, there are still constitutional limits imposed on the scope of these appeals. In \"Corp. Professionnelle des M\u00e9decins v. Thibault\", the Supreme Court struck down a provision of Quebec law that allowed appellate courts to conduct a \"de novo\" review of both legal and factual findings. In doing so, it held that the scope of an appeal may not extend to challenging findings of fact where no legal error has been made. At this point, the court reasoned, the process ceases to be an appeal and instead becomes a new trial disguised as one.\nA notable example cited by critics of Canada's appeal system is the case of Guy Paul Morin, who was wrongfully convicted in his second trial after the acquittal in his first trial was vacated by the Supreme Court. Another notable use of the system occurred in the case of child murderer Guy Turcotte, the Quebec Court of Appeal overturned the initial verdict of not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder and ordered a second trial after it found that the judge had erroneously instructed the jury. Turcotte was later convicted of second-degree murder in the second trial. Another well-known example is Henry Morgentaler, whose repeated acquittals by juries were overturned on appeal in multiple provinces.\nFrance.\nOnce all appeals have been exhausted on a case, the judgement is final and the action of the prosecution is closed (code of penal procedure, art. 6), except if the final ruling was forged. Prosecution for a crime already judged is impossible even if incriminating evidence has been found. However, a person who has been convicted may request another trial on the grounds of new exculpating evidence through a procedure known as \"r\u00e9vision\".\nFrench law allows the prosecution to appeal an acquittal.\nGermany.\nThe Basic Law (\"Grundgesetz\") for the Federal Republic of Germany protects against double jeopardy if a final verdict is pronounced. A verdict is final if nobody appeals against it.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nobody shall be punished multiple times for the same crime on the basis of general criminal law.\u2014\u200a\nHowever, each trial party can appeal against a verdict in the first instance. The prosecution or the defendants can appeal against a judgement if they disagree with it. In this case, the trial starts again in the second instance, the court of appeal (\"Berufungsgericht\"), which reconsiders the facts and reasons and delivers a final judgement.\nIf one of the parties disagrees with the second instance's judgement, they can appeal it only for formal judicial reasons. The case will be checked in the third instance (\"Revisionsgericht\") to see whether all laws were correctly applied.\nThe rule applies to the whole \"historical event, which is usually considered a single historical course of actions the separation of which would seem unnatural\". This is true even if new facts come to light that indicate other crimes.\nThe Penal Procedural Code (\"Strafprozessordnung\") permits a retrial (\"Wiederaufnahmeverfahren\"), if it is in favour of the defendant or if the following events have happened:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A retrial not in favour of the defendant is permissible after a final judgement,\nIn the case of an order of summary punishment, which can be issued by the court without a trial for lesser misdemeanours, there is a further exception:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A retrial not in favour of the defendant is also permissible if the defendant has been convicted in a final order of summary punishment and new facts or evidence have been brought forward, which establish grounds for a conviction of a felony by themselves or in combination with earlier evidence.\u2014\u200a\nIn Germany, a felony is defined by \u00a7 12 (1) StGB as a crime that has a minimum of one year of imprisonment.\nIndia.\nA partial protection against double jeopardy is a Fundamental Right guaranteed under Article 20 (2) of the Constitution of India, which states \"No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once\". This provision enshrines the concept of \"autrefois convict\", that no one convicted of an offence can be tried or punished a second time. However, it does not extend to \"autrefois acquit\", and so if a person is acquitted of a crime he can be retried. In India, protection against \"autrefois acquit\" is a statutory right, not a fundamental one. Such protection is provided by provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure rather than by the Constitution.\nJapan.\nThe Constitution of Japan, which came into effect on 3 May 1947, states in Article 39 that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;No person shall be held criminally liable for an act which was lawful at the time it was committed, or of which he has been acquitted, nor shall he be placed in double jeopardy.\nHowever, in 1950, one defendant was found guilty in the District Court for crimes related to the election law and was sentenced to paying a fine. The prosecutor wanted a stronger sentence and appealed to the High Court. As a result, the defendant was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. He appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the sentence was excessive when compared with precedents and that he had been placed in double jeopardy, which was in violation of Article 39. On 27 September 1950, all fifteen judges of the Supreme Court made the Grand Bench Decision to rule against the defendant and declared that a criminal proceeding in the District Court, High Court and Supreme Court is all one case and that there is no double jeopardy. In other words, if the prosecutor appeals against a judgement of not guilty or a guilty decision that they think does not impose a severe enough sentence, the defendant will not be placed in double jeopardy.\nOn 10 October 2003, the Supreme Court made a landmark decision in the area of double jeopardy. The case involved Article 235 of the Penal Code, which addresses \"simple larceny\", and Article 2 of the Law for Prevention and Disposition of Robbery, Theft, etc., which addresses \"habitual larceny\". The Court ruled that in the event that there are two trials for separate cases of simple larceny, it will not be considered double jeopardy, even if the prosecutor could have charged both of them as a single crime of habitual larceny. The defendant in this case had committed crimes of trespassing and simple larceny on 22 occasions. The defence counsel argued that the crimes were actually one offence of habitual larceny and that charging them as separate counts was double jeopardy. The Supreme Court ruled that it was within the prosecutor's discretion as to whether to charge the defendant with one count of habitual larceny or to charge them with multiple counts of trespassing and simple larceny. In either case, it is not considered double jeopardy.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, the state prosecution can appeal a not-guilty verdict at the bench. New evidence can be applied during a retrial at a district court. Thus one can be tried twice for the same alleged crime. If one is convicted at the district court, the defence can make an appeal on procedural grounds to the supreme court. The supreme court might admit this complaint, and the case will be reopened yet again, at another district court. Again, new evidence might be introduced by the prosecution.\nOn 9 April 2013, the Dutch senate voted 36 \"yes\" versus 35 \"no\" in favour of a new law that allows the prosecutor to re-try a person who was found not guilty in court. This law is limited to offences in which the statute of limitations does not expire. These are offences that are punishable by at least 12 years of imprisonment, and other specific offences. Offences that have already expired (such as prior to the change in legislation that abolished the statute of limitations) cannot be retried. \nA retrial is only possible by ground of a 'novum': the situation in which new evidence has come to light and in which it seems that, had the judge known of this evidence, the defendant would have been prosecuted. The new evidence has to either be new technical evidence or a trustworthy confession by the defendant or their co-suspect.\nPakistan.\nArticle 13 of the Constitution of Pakistan protects a person from being punished or prosecuted more than once for the same offence. Section 403 of http:// contemplates a situation where a person having once been tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction and acquitted by such court cannot be tried again for the same offence or for any other offence based on similar facts. The scope of section 403 is restricted to criminal proceedings and not to civil proceedings and departmental inquiries.\nSerbia.\nThis principle is incorporated into the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and further elaborated in its Criminal Procedure Act.\nSouth Africa.\nThe Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa forbids a retrial when there has already been an acquittal or a conviction.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right ... not to be tried for an offence in respect of an act or omission for which that person has previously been either acquitted or convicted ...\u2014\u200a\nSouth Korea.\nArticle 13 of the South Korean constitution provides that no citizen shall be placed in double jeopardy.\nUnited Kingdom.\nEngland and Wales.\nDouble jeopardy has been permitted in England and Wales in certain (exceptional) circumstances since the Criminal Justice Act 2003.\nPre-2003.\nThe doctrines of \"autrefois acquit\" and \"autrefois convict\" persisted as part of the common law from the time of the Norman conquest of England; they were regarded as essential elements for protection of the subject's liberty and respect for due process of law in that there should be finality of proceedings. There were only three exceptions, all relatively recent, to the rules:\nIn \"Connelly v DPP\" [1964] AC 1254, the Law Lords ruled that a defendant could not be tried for any offence arising out of substantially the same set of facts relied upon in a previous charge of which he had been acquitted unless there are \"special circumstances\" proven by the prosecution. There is little case law on the meaning of \"special circumstances\", but it has been suggested that the emergence of new evidence would suffice.\nA defendant who had been convicted of an offence could be given a second trial for an aggravated form of that offence if the facts constituting the aggravation were discovered after the first conviction. By contrast, a person who had been acquitted of a lesser offence could not be tried for an aggravated form even if new evidence became available.\nPost-2003.\nFollowing the murder of Stephen Lawrence, the Macpherson Report recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases, and that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial if \"fresh and viable\" new evidence later came to light. The Law Commission later added its support to this in its report \"Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals\" (2001). A parallel report into the criminal justice system by Lord Justice Auld, a past Senior Presiding Judge for England and Wales, had also commenced in 1999 and was published as the Auld Report six months after the Law Commission report. It opined that the Law Commission had been unduly cautious by limiting the scope to murder and that \"the exceptions should [...] extend to other grave offences punishable with life and/or long terms of imprisonment as Parliament might specify.\" 1999 was also the year of a highly publicised case in which a man, David Smith, was convicted of the murder of a prostitute after having been acquitted of the \"almost identical\" murder of sex worker Sarah Crump six years previously. Because of the double jeopardy laws that existed at the time, Smith could not be re-tried for Crump's murder, despite police insisting they were not looking for anybody else and that the case was closed.\nBoth Jack Straw (then Home Secretary) and William Hague (then Leader of the Opposition) favoured the measures suggested by the Auld Report. These recommendations were implemented\u2014not uncontroversially at the time\u2014within the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and this provision came into force in April 2005. It opened certain serious crimes (including murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, rape, armed robbery, and serious drug crimes) to a retrial, regardless of when committed, with two conditions: the retrial must be approved by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Court of Appeal must agree to quash the original acquittal due to \"new and compelling evidence\". Then Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, said that he expected no more than a handful of cases to be brought in a year.\nPressure by Ann Ming, the mother of 1989 murder victim Julie Hogg\u2014whose killer, Billy Dunlop, was initially acquitted and subsequently confessed\u2014also contributed to the demand for legal change. On 11 September 2006, Dunlop became the first person to be convicted of murder following a prior acquittal for the same crime, in his case his 1991 acquittal of Hogg's murder. Some years later he had confessed to the crime, and was convicted of perjury, but was unable to be retried for the killing itself. The case was re-investigated in early 2005, when the new law came into effect, and his case was referred to the Court of Appeal, in November 2005, for permission for a new trial, which was granted. Dunlop pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a recommendation he serve no less than 17 years.\nOn 13 December 2010, Mark Weston became the first person to be retried and found guilty of murder by a jury (Dunlop having pleaded guilty). In 1996 Weston had been acquitted of the murder of Vikki Thompson at Ascott-under-Wychwood on 12 August 1995, but following the discovery in 2009 of compelling new evidence (Thompson's blood on Weston's boots) he was arrested and tried for a second time. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 13 years.\nIn December 2018, convicted paedophile Russell Bishop was also retried and found guilty by a jury for the Babes in the Wood murders of two 9-year-old girls, Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway, on 9 October 1986. At the original trial in 1987, a key piece of the prosecution's case rested on the recovery of a discarded blue sweatshirt. Under questioning, Bishop denied that the sweatshirt belonged to him, but his girlfriend, Jennifer Johnson, alleged the clothing was Bishop's, before she changed her story in the trial, telling the jury she had never seen the top before. Attributed to a series of blunders in the prosecution's case, Bishop was acquitted by the jury after two hours of deliberations. Three years later, Bishop was found guilty of the abduction, molestation, and attempted murder of a 7-year-old girl in February 1990. In 2014, re-examined by modern forensics, the sweatshirt contained traces of Bishop's DNA, and also had fibres on it from both of the girls' clothing. Tapings taken from Karen Hadaway's arm also yielded traces of Bishop's DNA. At the 2018 trial, a jury of seven men and five women returned a guilty verdict after two-and-a-half hours of deliberation.\nOn 14 November 2019, Michael Weir became the first person to be twice found guilty of a murder. He was originally convicted of the murder of Leonard Harris in 1999, but the conviction was quashed in 2000 by the Court of Appeal on a technicality. In 2018, new DNA evidence had been obtained and palm prints from both murder scenes were matched to Weir. Twenty years after the original conviction, Weir was convicted of the murder for a second time.\nIn February 2020, Merseyside Police called for further reform to the double jeopardy law in England so as to allow previously acquitted suspects to be re-interviewed by police. The force had wanted to re-interview a suspect in the unsolved case of the murders of John Greenwood and Gary Miller who had been acquitted of the crime in 1981, but were not permitted to do so. The force had also not been allowed to re-charge the man of murder in 2019, causing them to publicly request that the law be changed and stating: \"We believe being able to re-question suspects could potentially lead to being able to demonstrate the new and compelling evidence needed to reopen particular cases, including the murders of John Greenwood and Gary Miller\".\nScotland.\nThe double jeopardy rule no longer applies absolutely in Scotland since the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011 came into force on 28 November 2011. The Act introduced three broad exceptions to the rule: where the acquittal had been tainted by an attempt to pervert the course of justice; where the accused admitted their guilt after acquittal; and where there was new evidence.\nNorthern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, the Criminal Justice Act 2003, effective 18 April 2005, makes certain \"qualifying offence\" (including murder, rape, kidnapping, specified sexual acts with young children, specified drug offences, defined acts of terrorism, as well as in certain cases attempts or conspiracies to commit the foregoing) subject to retrial after acquittal (including acquittals obtained before passage of the Act) if there is a finding by the Court of Appeal that there is \"new and compelling evidence\".\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, the protection in common law against double jeopardy is maintained through the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nConversely, double jeopardy comes with a key exception. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, multiple sovereigns can indict a defendant for the same crime. The federal and state governments can have overlapping criminal laws, so a criminal offender may be convicted in individual states and federal courts for exactly the same crime or for different crimes arising out of the same facts. However, in 2016, the Supreme Court held in \"Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle\" that Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The dual sovereignty doctrine has been the subject of substantial scholarly criticism.\nAs described by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Ball v. United States\" 163 U.S. 662 (1896), one of its earliest cases dealing with double jeopardy, \"the prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial\". The Double Jeopardy Clause encompasses four distinct prohibitions: subsequent prosecution after acquittal, subsequent prosecution after conviction, subsequent prosecution after certain mistrials, and multiple punishment in the same indictment. Jeopardy \"attaches\" when the jury is impanelled, the first witness is sworn, or a plea is accepted.\nIn rare cases, double jeopardy may also apply to prosecutorial or judge misconduct in the same jurisdiction. The double jeopardy protection in criminal prosecutions bars only an identical prosecution for the same offence; however, a different offence may be charged on identical evidence at a second trial. protection is stronger \u2013 it precludes any causes of action or claims that arise from a previously litigated subject matter.\nProsecution after acquittal.\nWith two exceptions, the government is not permitted to appeal or retry the defendant once jeopardy attaches to a trial unless the case does not conclude. Conditions which constitute \"conclusion\" of a case include\nIn these cases, the trial is concluded and the prosecution is precluded from appealing or retrying the defendant over the offence to which they were acquitted.\nThis principle does not prevent the government from appealing a pre-trial motion to dismiss or other non-merits dismissal, or a directed verdict after a jury conviction, nor does it prevent the trial judge from entertaining a motion for reconsideration of a directed verdict, if the jurisdiction has so provided by rule or statute. Nor does it prevent the government from retrying the defendant after an appellate reversal other than for sufficiency, including \"habeas corpus\", or \"thirteenth juror\" appellate reversals notwithstanding sufficiency on the principle that jeopardy has not \"terminated\".\nThe dual sovereignty doctrine allows a federal prosecution of an offence to proceed regardless of a previous state prosecution for that same offence and vice versa because \"an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offence against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each\". The doctrine is solidly entrenched in the law, but there has been a traditional reluctance in the federal executive branch to gratuitously wield the power it grants, due to public opinion being generally hostile to such action.\nExceptions.\nThere are two exceptions to bans on retrying defendants. If a defendant bribed a judge into acquitting him or her, the defendant was not in jeopardy and can be retried. A member of the armed forces can be retried by court-martial in a military court, even if he or she has been previously acquitted by a civilian court. This exception was used to prosecute Timothy Hennis for the Eastburn family murders after his previous trial acquitted him.\nAn individual can be prosecuted by both the United States and an for the same acts that constituted crimes in both jurisdictions; it was established by the Supreme Court in \"United States v. Lara\" that as the two are separate sovereigns, prosecuting a crime under both tribal and federal law does not attach double jeopardy.\nMultiple punishment, including prosecution after conviction.\nIn \"Blockburger v. United States\" (1932), the Supreme Court announced the following test: the government may separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not. \"Blockburger\" is the default rule, unless the governing statute legislatively intends to depart; for example, Continuing Criminal Enterprise (CCE) may be punished separately from its predicates, as can conspiracy.\nThe \"Blockburger\" test, originally developed in the multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In \"Grady v. Corbin\" (1990), the Court held that a double jeopardy violation could lie even where the \"Blockburger\" test was not satisfied, but \"Grady\" was later distinguished in \"United States v. Felix\" (1992), when the court reverted to the \"Blockburger\" test without completely dismissing the \"Grady\" interpretation. The court eventually overruled \"Grady\" in \"United States v. Dixon\" (1993).\nProsecution after mistrial.\nThe rule for mistrials depends upon who sought the mistrial. If the defendant moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial, unless the prosecutor acted in \"bad faith\", i.e. goaded the defendant into moving for a mistrial because the government specifically wanted a mistrial. If the prosecutor moves for a mistrial, there is no bar to retrial if the trial judge finds \"manifest necessity\" for granting the mistrial. The same standard governs mistrials granted sua sponte.\nRetrials are not common, due to the legal expenses to the government. However, in the mid-1980s Georgia antique dealer James Arthur Williams was tried a record four times for murder over the shooting of Danny Hansford, and after three mistrials was finally acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. The case is recounted in the book \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\" which was adapted into a film directed by Clint Eastwood (the movie combines the four trials into one).\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nUnited Kingdom.\nResearch and Notes produced for the UK Parliament, summarising the history of legal change, views and responses, and analyses:"}

Disbarment is usually a punishment for unethical or criminal conduct but may also be imposed for incompetence or incapacity. Procedures vary depending on the law society; temporary disbarment may be called suspension.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, states regulate the Legal Profession under state law despite many participating in a uniform scheme. Admission as a lawyer is the business of the admissions board and the Supreme Court. Disciplinary proceedings may be commenced by the Bar Association, the Law Society of which one is a member, or the board itself.\nGermany.\nIn Germany, a \"Berufsverbot\" is a ban on practicing a profession, which the government can issue to a lawyer for misconduct, \"Volksverhetzung\" or for serious mismanagement of personal finances.\nIn April 1933, the Nazi government issued a \"Berufsverbot\" forbidding the practice of law by Jews, Communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the \"Frontk\u00e4mpferprivileg\".\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, the removal of the licence to practise of a barrister or Scottish advocate is called being \"disbarred\", whilst the removal of a solicitor from the rolls in England and Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland is called being \"struck off\".\nUnited States.\nOverview.\nGenerally, disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding a client's interests, commingling funds, or engaging in fraud that impedes the administration of justice. In some states, any lawyer who is convicted of a felony is automatically suspended pending further disciplinary proceedings, or, in New York, automatically disbarred. Automatic disbarment, although opposed by the American Bar Association, has been described as a convicted felon's just deserts.\nIn the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts while still being a member of the bar in another jurisdiction. However, under the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.\nDisbarment is quite rare: in 2011, only 1,046 lawyers were disbarred. Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to continue a career in law.\nBecause disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, most US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.\nNotable U.S. disbarments.\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, one former U.S. president and one former U.S. vice president have been disbarred, and another former president has been suspended from one bar and forced to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.\nFormer vice president Spiro Agnew, having pleaded no contest (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of bribery and tax evasion, was disbarred from Maryland, the state of which he had previously been governor.\nFormer president Richard Nixon was disbarred from New York in 1976 for obstruction of justice related to the Watergate scandal. He had attempted to resign from the New York bar, as he had done with California and the Supreme Court, but his resignation was not accepted as he would not acknowledge that he was unable to defend himself from the charges brought against him.\nIn 2001, following a 5-year suspension by the Arkansas bar, the United States Supreme Court suspended Bill Clinton from the United States Supreme Court bar, providing 40 days for him to contest disbarment. He resigned before the end of the 40 days, thus avoiding disbarment.\nAlger Hiss was disbarred for a felony conviction but later became the first person reinstated to the bar in Massachusetts after disbarment.\nIn 2007, Mike Nifong, the District Attorney of Durham County, North Carolina who presided over the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, was disbarred for prosecutorial misconduct related to his handling of the case.\nIn April 2012, a three-member panel appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court voted unanimously to disbar Andrew Thomas, former County Attorney of Maricopa County, Arizona, and a former close confederate of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. According to the panel, Thomas \"outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law\" while serving as Maricopa County Attorney. The panel found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Thomas brought unfounded and malicious criminal and civil charges against political opponents, including four state judges and the state attorney general. \"Were this a criminal case,\" the panel concluded, \"we are confident that the evidence would establish this conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\nJack Thompson, the Florida lawyer noted for his activism against Howard Stern, video games, and rap music, was permanently disbarred for various charges of misconduct. The action resulted from several grievances claiming that Thompson had made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass, or intimidate his opponents. The order was made on September 25, 2008, effective October 25. However, Thompson tried to appeal to the higher courts to avoid the penalty taking effect. Neither the US District Court nor the US Supreme Court would hear his appeal, rendering the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court final.\nEd Fagan, a New York lawyer who prominently represented Holocaust victims against Swiss banks, was disbarred in New York (in 2008) and New Jersey (in 2009) for failing to pay court fines and fees; and for misappropriating client and escrow trust funds.\nF. Lee Bailey, noted criminal defense attorney, was disbarred by Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment resulted from his stock handling in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book \"Florida Pulp Nonfiction\" details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case and extended interviews with Bailey, including his own defense. Bailey is also best known for representing murder suspect O. J. Simpson in 1994.\nRichard P. Liebowitz, a New York attorney focused on copyrights held by photographers, was disbarred by the state of New York in 2024 following suspension from the practice of law in the Southern District of New York. His disbarment followed what was described as a \"pattern and practice of failing to comply with court orders and making false statements to the court\" and multiple lawsuits wherein Liebowitz was sanctioned for misconduct.\nRudy Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., for false allegations about mass voter fraud and his participation in the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol to subvert the 2020 Presidential Election.\nIn 2022, Thomas Girardi was disbarred in California due to large-scale misappropriation of funds from clients.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The tags' primary use is for the identification of casualties; they have information about the individual written on them, including identification and essential basic medical information such as blood type and history of inoculations. They may indicate a religious preference as well. The term arose and became popular because of the tags' resemblance to animal registration tags. \nHistory.\nThe earliest mention of an identification tag for soldiers comes in Polyaenus (Stratagems 1.17) where the Spartans wrote their names on sticks tied to their left wrists. A type of dog tag (\"signaculum\") was given to the Roman legionary at the moment of enrollment. The legionary \"signaculum\" was a lead disk with a leather string, worn around the neck, with the name of the recruit and the indication of the legion of which the recruit was part. This procedure, together with enrollment in the list of recruits, was made at the beginning of a four-month probatory period (). The recruit obtained the military status only after the oath of allegiance () at the end of \"probatio\", meaning that from a legal point of view the \"signaculum\" was given to a subject who was no longer a civilian, but not yet in the military.\nIn more recent times, dog tags were provided to Chinese soldiers as early as the mid-19th century. During the Taiping revolt (1851\u201366), both the Imperialists (i.e., the Chinese Imperial Army regular servicemen) and those Taiping rebels wearing a uniform wore wooden dog tags at the belt, bearing the soldier's name, age, birthplace, unit, and date of enlistment.\nAmerican Civil War.\nDuring the American Civil War from 1861 to 1865, some soldiers pinned paper notes with their name and home address to the backs of their coats. Other soldiers stenciled identification on their knapsacks or scratched it in the soft lead backing of their army belt buckles.\nManufacturers of identification badges recognized a market and began advertising in periodicals. Their pins were usually shaped to suggest a branch of service, and engraved with the soldier's name and unit. \nMachine-stamped tags were also made of brass or lead with a hole and usually had (on one side) an eagle or shield, and such phrases as \"War for the Union\" or \"Liberty, Union, and Equality\". The other side had the soldier's name and unit, and sometimes a list of battles in which he had participated.\nFranco-Prussian War.\nOn a volunteer basis Prussian soldiers had decided to wear identification tags in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. However, many rejected dog tags as a bad omen for their lives. So until eight months after the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, with almost 8,900 Prussian casualties, only 429 of them could be identified. \nWith the formation of the North German Confederation in 1867 Prussian, military regulations became binding for the militaries of all North German member states via the Instruction on the Medical Corps Organisation of the Army Afield () issued on 29 April 1869. Identification tags () were to be handed out to each soldier before deployment afield. \nThe Prussian Army issued identification tags for its troops at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. They were nicknamed \"Hundemarken\" (lit.\u2009'Dog mark') and compared to a similar identification system instituted by the dog licence fee, adding tags to collars of those dogs whose owners paid the fee, in the Prussian capital city of Berlin at around the same time period.\nWorld War I.\nThe British Army introduced identity discs in place of identity cards in 1907, in the form of aluminium discs, typically made at regimental depots using machines similar to those common at fun fairs, the details being pressed into the thin metal one letter at a time.\nArmy Order 287 of September 1916 required the British Army provide all soldiers with two official tags, both made of vulcanised asbestos fibre (which were more comfortable to wear in hot climates) carrying identical details, again impressed one character at a time. \nThe first tag, an octagonal green disc, was attached to a long cord around the neck. The second tag, a circular red disc, was threaded on a 6-inch cord suspended from the first tag. The first tag was intended to remain on the body for future identification, while the second tag could be taken to record the death.\nBritish and Empire/Commonwealth forces (Australia, Canada, and New Zealand) were issued essentially identical identification discs of basic pattern during the Great War, Second World War and Korea, though official identity discs were frequently supplemented by private-purchase items such as identity bracelets, particularly favoured by sailors who believed the official discs were unlikely to survive long immersion in water.\nThe U.S. Army first authorized identification tags in War Department General Order No. 204, dated December 20, 1906, which essentially prescribes the Kennedy identification tag:An aluminum identification tag, the size of a silver half dollar and of suitable thickness, stamped with the name, rank, company, regiment, or corps of the wearer, will be worn by each officer and enlisted man of the Army whenever the field kit is worn, the tag to be suspended from the neck, underneath the clothing, by a cord or thong passed through a small hole in the tag. It is prescribed as a part of the uniform and when not worn as directed herein will be habitually kept in the possession of the owner. The tag will be issued by the Quartermaster's Department gratuitously to enlisted men and at cost price to officers.\nThe U.S. Army changed regulations on July 6, 1916, so that all soldiers were issued two tags: one to stay with the body and the other to go to the person in charge of the burial for record-keeping purposes. In 1918, the U.S. Army adopted and allotted the service number system, and name and service numbers were ordered stamped on the identification tags.\nProduction.\nDog tags are usually fabricated from a corrosion-resistant metal. \nThere is a recurring myth about the notch situated in one end of the dog tags issued to United States Army personnel during World War II, and up until the Korean War era. It was rumored that the notch's purpose was that, if a soldier found one of his comrades on the battlefield, he could take one tag to the commanding officer and stick the other between the teeth of the soldier to ensure that the tag would remain with the body and be identified.\nIn reality, the notch was used with the Model 70 Addressograph Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type imprinter used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II). American dogtags of the 1930s through 1980s were produced using a Graphotype machine, in which characters are debossed into metal plates. Some tags are still debossed, using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.\nIt appears instructions that would confirm the notch's mythical use were issued at least unofficially by the Graves Registration Service during the Vietnam War to Army troops headed overseas.\nUsage.\nMilitary.\nDog tags commonly contain two copies of the information, either in the form of a single tag that can be broken in half, or as two identical tags on the same chain. \nThis purposeful duplication allows one tag, or half-tag, to be collected from an individual's dead body for notification, while the duplicate remains with the corpse if the conditions of battle prevent it from being immediately recovered. \nAlthough typically worn around the neck, dog tags have been worn on boot laces and wristbands etc. Dog tags are traditionally part of the makeshift battlefield memorials soldiers created for their fallen comrades. The casualty's rifle with bayonet affixed is stood vertically atop the empty boots, with the helmet over the rifle's stock. The dog tags hang from the rifle's handle or trigger guard.\nNon-military.\nSome tags (along with similar items such as MedicAlert bracelets) are used also by civilians to identify their wearers and:\nMilitary personnel in some jurisdictions may wear a supplementary medical information tag.\nVariations by country.\nAustria.\nThe Austrian \"Bundesheer\" used a single long, rectangular tag, with oval ends, stamped with blood group and Rh factor at the end, with ID number underneath. Two slots and a hole stamped beneath allows the tag to be broken in halves, and the long bottom portion has both the ID number and a series of holes which allows the tag to be inserted into a dosimeter. This has been replaced with a more conventional, wider and rounded rectangle which can still be halved, but lacks the dosimeter reading holes.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian Defence Force issues soldiers two tags of different shapes, one octagonal and one circular, containing the following information:\nThe information is printed exactly the same on both discs. In the event of a casualty, the circular tag is removed from the body.\nBelgium.\nBelgian Forces identity tags are, like their Canadian and Norwegian contemporaries, designed to be broken in two in the case of a fatality; the lower half is returned to the Belgian Defence Staff, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information, with slight variation depending on the linguistic region of the soldier:\nCanada.\nCanadian Armed Forces identity discs (abbreviated \"ID discs\") are designed to be broken in two in the case of fatality; the lower half is returned to National Defence Headquarters with the member's personal documents, while the upper half remains on the body. The tags contain the following information:\nBefore the Service Number was introduced in the 1990s, military personnel were identified on the ID discs (as well as other documents) by their social insurance number.\nChina.\nThe People's Liberation Army have been issuing two long, rectangular tags () for their personnel. All information is stamped in Simplified Chinese:\nPLA is introducing a two-dimensional matrix code on the second tag, the matrix code contains a link to the official database. This allows the inquirer get more details about the military personnel and provide them resources in the battlefield.\nColombia.\nThe Ej\u00e9rcito Nacional de Colombia uses long, rectangular metal tags with oval ends tags stamped with the following information:\nDuplicate tags are issued. Often, tags are issued with a prayer inscribed on the reverse.\nCyprus.\nIn Cyprus, identification tags include the following information:\nDenmark.\nThe military of Denmark use dog tags made from small, rectangular metal plates. The tag is designed to be broken into two pieces each with the following information stamped onto it:\nAdditionally, the right hand side of each half-tag is engraved DANMARK (lit.\u2009'Denmark').\nStarting in 1985, the individual's service number (which is the same as their social security number) is included on the tag. \nIn case the individual dies, the lower half-tag is supposed to be collected, while the other will remain with the corpse. \nIn the army, navy, and air force but not in the national guard, the individual's blood type is indicated on the lower half-tag only, since this information becomes irrelevant if the individual dies. \nIn 2009, Danish dog tags were discontinued for conscripts.\nEast Germany.\nThe \"Nationale Volksarmee\" used a tag () nearly identical to that used by both the Wehrmacht and the West German Bundeswehr. \nThe oval aluminum tag was stamped \"DDR\" (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) above the personal ID number; this information was repeated on the bottom half, which was intended to be broken off in case of death. \nOddly, the tag was not worn (but would have been in case of war), but required to be kept in a plastic sleeve in the back of the WDA () identity booklet.\nEcuador.\nThe Ecuadorian dog tag () consists of two long, rectangular steel or aluminum tags with rounded corners and a single hole punched in one end. \nThe previous design is suspended by a US-type ball chain, with a shorter chain for the second tag. The information on the tag is:\nEstonia.\nEstonian dog tags are designed to be broken in two. The dog tag is a metallic rounded rectangle suspended by a ball chain. Information consists of four fields:\nExample: \nFinland.\nIn the Finnish Defence Forces, the \"identification plate\" (; WWII term \"tuntolevy\") is made of stainless steel and designed to be broken in two; however, the only text on it is the personal identification number and the letters \"FI\" or \"SF\" (lit.\u2009'Suomi Finland') in older models, within a tower stamped atop of the upper half.\nFrance.\nIn WWI and WWII, French forces used a small oval-shaped disc of metal designed to be broken in half, worn at the wrist.\nNow, France issues the dog tag () in either a metallic rounded rectangle in the army, or a pair of discs in the air force and navy. Both are designed to be broken in half, bearing family name &amp; first name above the ID number. \nFrench army tags also include blood type, \"T\" for Tetanus vaccine and \"OFF\" only for officers. \nGermany.\nGerman Bundeswehr ID tags are an oval-shaped disc designed to be broken in half. They are made of stainless steel, height and width. The two sides contain different information which are mirrored upside-down on the lower half of the ID tag. They feature the following information on segmented and numbered fields:\nOn the front:\nOn the back:\n\"Bundesamt f\u00fcr Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung\" of 2009-12-21 specifies shape, materials and characteristics for four parts:\nThe ID tag is landscape-oval, breakable in two halves with 4\u20138 manual bends. On the backside each half is 0.2\u00a0mm deep marked with \"DEU\" (), the non-magnetic type on both halves and both sides with \"NM\".\nThe metal sheet is 0.7\u00a0mm thick, material codes X5CrNi1810 or 1.4301, weighs about 16 g. NM-variant shall consist of 1.4311 or 1.4401. Sharp edges have to be smoothed, then the plate electropolished. Mechanical deburring and ball polishing is allowed.\nThe letters stamped in for the person must stay readable after a glow test for 10 minutes in air at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe ball chain is of X5CrNi1810, diameter of ball is 3.5\u00a0mm, that of the wire 1.5\u00a0mm. Closure is of 1.4301, stainless steel, too. The long chain is 680 + 30\u00a0mm long, the short one 145 + 7\u00a0mm. Breaking force of the chain including the closure must reach 100 N, after 10 min glow at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C in air at least 10 N.\nGreece.\nIn Greece, identification tags include the following information:\nHungary.\nThe Hungarian army dog tag is made out of steel, forming a 25\u00d735\u00a0mm tag designed to split diagonally. \nBoth sides contain the same information: the soldier's personal identity code, blood group and the word HUNGARIA. Some may not have the blood group on them. \nThese are only issued to soldiers who are serving outside of the country. If the soldier should die, one side is removed and kept for the army's official records, while the other side is left attached to the body.\nIraq.\nThe Saddam-era Iraqi Army used a single, long, rectangular metal tag with oval ends, inscribed (usually by hand) with Name and Number or Unit, and occasionally Blood Type.\nIsrael.\nDog tags of the Israel Defense Forces are designed to be broken in two. The information appears in three lines (twice):\nRecruits are issued with 2 Dogtags (4 halves total), one remains whole and worn on a necklace, and the second is broken into its halves and placed in each military boot for the purpose of Identifying dead soldiers (IDF Military Boots contain pouches on their inner sides at the 1/3 calf height, the pouches have holes corresponding in size and placement to those on the discs, allowing for fastening, often via small cable ties).\nOriginally the IDF issued two circular aluminum tags (1948 \u2013 late 1950s) stamped in three lines with serial number, family name, and first name. The tags were threaded together through a single hole onto a cord worn around the neck.\nItaly.\nRectangular piece, 35x45 mm, designed to be broken in two. Includes soldier's first and last name, coded date and place of birth, identification number, religious affiliation, and blood group.\nJapan.\nJapan follows a similar system to the US Army for Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel, and the appearance of the tags is similar, although laser etched. The exact information order is as follows.\nMalaysia.\nMalaysian Armed Forces have two identical oval tags with this information:\nIf more information needed, another two oval wrist tags are provided. The term \"wrist tags\" can be used to refer to the bracelet-like wristwatch. The additional tags only need to be worn on the wrist, with the main tags still on the neck. All personnel are allowed to attach a small religious pendant or locket; this makes a quick identifiable reference for their funeral services.\nMexico.\nThe Mexican Army uses two long identity tags, very similar to the ones used in the United States Army. They are rectangular metal tags with oval ends, embossed with name, serial number, and blood type, plus Rh factor.\nNetherlands.\nDutch military identity tags, like the Canadian and Norwegian ones, are designed to be broken in two in the case of a fatality; the lower end is returned to Dutch Defence Headquarters, while the upper half remains on the body.\nThe tags contain the following information:\nThere is a difference in the Army and Air Force service number and the Navy service number:\nNorway.\nNorwegian dog tags are designed to be broken in two like the Canadian and the Dutch version:\nPoland.\nThe first dog tags were issued in Poland following the order of the General Staff of December 12, 1920. The earliest design () consisted of a tin-made 30\u00d750\u00a0mm rectangular frame and a rectangular cap fitting into the frame. \nSoldiers' details were filled in a small ID card placed inside the frame, as well as on the inside of the frame itself. The dog tag was similar to the tags used by the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. In case the soldier died, the frame was left with his body, while the lid was returned to his unit together with a note on his death. The ID card was handed over to the chaplain or the rabbi.\nIn 1928, a new type of dog tag was proposed by gen. bryg. Stanis\u0142aw Rouppert, Poland's representative at the International Red Cross. It was slightly modified and adopted in 1931 under the name of \"Nie\u015bmiertelnik wz. 1931\" (lit.\u2009'Immortalizer, pattern 1931'). \nThe new design consisted of an oval piece of metal (ideally steel, but in most cases aluminum alloy was used), roughly 40 by 50 millimeters. There were two rectangular holes in the middle to allow for easier breaking of the into halves. \nThe halves contained the same set of data \u2013 name, religion, place of birth, year of birth \u2013 and were identical, except the upper half had two holes for a string or twine to go through, and the lower had one hole.\nThe 2008 pattern () specifies two Stadium-shaped 0.8mm-thick 51\u00d727mm tags with a 3mm hole, made of heat-resistant steel, engraved with:\nparallel to the long axis, and the name of Polish Armed Forces () and the Polish coat of arms on the rounded end opposite the hole.\nThe 2024 pattern () returns to a single 40\u00d750mm ellipsis with 2+1 holes, of stainless steel, 1mm thick, laser-engraved, indented across the short axis with two rectangular holes to break apart, with each half containing\nand\non the obverse. The halves are flipped with respect to each other, such that when unbroken, both sides contain all information.\nRhodesia.\nThe former Republic of Rhodesia used two WW2 British-style compressed asbestos fiber tags, a No. 1 octagonal (grey) tag and a No. 2 circular (red) tag, stamped with identical information. The red tag was supposedly fireproof and the grey tag rotproof. The following information was stamped on the tags: Number, Name, Initials, &amp; Religion; Blood Type was stamped on reverse. The air force and BSAP often stamped their service on the reverse side above the blood group.\nRussia.\nThe Russian Armed Forces use oval metal tags, similar to the dog tags of the Soviet Army. \nEach tag contains the title Armed Forces of Russia () and the individual's alphanumeric number, as shown on the photo.\nWagner Group.\nThe Wagner Group, a private militia funded by the Russian government that is currently fighting the Russo-Ukrainian War, reportedly provides its soldiers with generic 'contact us' dogtags.\nSingapore.\nThe Singapore Armed Forces-issued dog tags are inscribed (not embossed) with up to four items:\nThe dog tags consist of two metal pieces, one oval with two holes and one round with one hole. A synthetic lanyard is threaded through both holes in the oval piece and tied around the wearer's neck. The round piece is tied to the main loop on a shorter loop.\nSouth Africa.\nThe South African National Defence Force use two long, rectangular stainless steel tags with oval ends, stamped with :\nSouth Korea.\nThe South Korean army issues two long, rectangular tags with oval ends, stamped (in Korean lettering). \nThe tags are worn on the neck with a ball chain. The tags contain the information listed below:\nSouth Vietnam.\nThe South Vietnamese Army and the South Vietnamese Navy used two American-style dog tags. Some tags added religion on the back (). They were stamped or inscribed with: \nSoviet Union.\nDuring World War II, the Red Army did not issue metal dog tags to its troops. They were issued small black Bakelite cylinders containing a slip of paper with a soldier's particulars written on it. These do not hold up as well as metal dog tags.\nAfter World War II, the Soviet Army used oval metal tags, similar to today's dog tags of the Russian Armed forces. Each tag contains the title Soviet Armed Forces () and the individual's alphanumeric number.\nSpain.\nIssues a single metal oval, worn vertically, stamped \"ESPA\u00d1A\" (lit.\u2009'Spain') above and below the 3-slot horizontal break line. It is stamped in 4 lines with:\nSweden.\nSwedish identification tags are designed to be able to break apart. The information on them was prior to 2010 and are as follows:\nSwedish dog tags issued to Armed Forces personnel after 2010 are, for personal security reasons, only marked with a personal identity number.\nDuring the Cold War, dog tags were issued to everyone, often soon after birth, since the threat of total war also meant the risk of severe civilian casualties. \nHowever, in 2010, the Government decided that the dog tags were not needed anymore.\nSwitzerland.\nSwiss Armed Forces ID tag is an oval shaped non reflective plaque, containing the following information:\nOn the back side the letters CH () are engraved next to a Swiss cross.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe British Armed Forces currently use two circular non-reflecting stainless steel tags, referred to as \"ID Disks\", engraved with the following 'Big 5' details:\nThe discs are suspended from one long chain (24 inches long) and one short chain (4.5 inches long)\nDuring World War One and Two, service personnel were issued pressed fibre identity disks, one green octagonal shaped disc, and a red round disc (some army units issued a second red round disc to be attached to the service respirator). The identity disks were hand stamped with the surname, initials, service number and religion of the holder and if in the Royal Air Force, the initials RAF. The disks were worn around the neck on a 38\" length of cotton cord, this was often replaced by the wearer with a leather bootlace. One tag was suspended below the main tag.\nThe fibre identity disks in the RAF were still in use in 1999.\nFrom 1960 these were replaced with stainless steel ID tags on a green nylon cord, two circular and one oval. The oval was withdrawn around 1990.\nUnited States.\nTags are properly known as identification tags; the term \"dog tags\" has never been used in regulations.\nThe U.S. Armed Forces typically carry two identical oval dog tags containing:\nReligious designation.\nDuring World War II, an American dog tag could indicate only one of three religions through the inclusion of one letter: \"P\" for Protestant, \"C\" for Catholic, or \"H\" for Judaism (from 'Hebrew'), or (according to at least one source) \"NO\" to indicate no religious preference. Army regulations (606\u20135) soon included X and Y in addition to P, C, and H: the X indicating any religion not included in the first three, such as Islam or Eastern Orthodoxy, and the Y indicating either no religion or a choice not to list religion.\nBy the time of the Vietnam War, some IDs spelled out the broad religious choices such as PROTESTANT and CATHOLIC, rather than using initials, and also began to show individual denominations such as \"METHODIST\" or \"BAPTIST\". Tags varied by service, however, such as the use of \"CATH\" instead of \"CATHOLIC\" on some Navy tags. For those with no religious affiliation and those who chose not to list an affiliation, either the space for religion was left blank or the words \"NO PREFERENCE\" or \"NO RELIGIOUS PREF\" (or the abbreviation \"NO PREF\") were included.\nAlthough American dog tags currently include the recipient's religion as a way of ensuring that religious needs will be met (including appropriate burial rites), some personnel have them reissued without religious affiliation listed\u2014or keep two sets, one with the designation and one without\u2014out of fear that identification as a member of a particular religion could increase the danger to their welfare or their lives if they fell into enemy hands. Some Jewish personnel avoided flying over German lines during WWII with ID tags that indicated their religion, and some Jewish personnel avoid the religious designation today out of concern that they could be captured by extremists who are anti-Semitic. Additionally, when American troops were first sent to Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War there were allegations that some U.S. military authorities were pressuring Jewish military personnel to avoid listing their religions on their ID tags.\nPopular culture.\nFashion.\nOriginally worn as a part of a military uniform by youth wishing to present a tough or militaresque image, dog tags have since reached wider fashion circles, including youth fashion as military chic. \nFashionable dog tags may be inscribed with a person's details, beliefs or tastes, a favorite quote, or may bear the name or logo of a band or performer. The wearing of dog tags as a fashion accessory, however, may be considered disrespectful or as stolen valour by some military personnel.\nGaza war hostage crisis.\nAfter the October 7 attacks, in which over 250 hostages were kidnapped, people in Israel and elsewhere wore specially made vanity dog tags to raise awareness of the plight of the hostages being held in the Gaza Strip. Proceeds from sales of the vanity dog tags went to fund causes such as the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7950", "revid": "50812529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7950", "title": "Drum", "text": "Type of musical instrument of the percussion family\nThe drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments. In the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone. Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound. There is usually a resonant head on the underside of the drum. Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll. Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.\nDrums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way. Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by one player, such as bongo drums and timpani. A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit. Many drums are played together with other instruments.\nUses.\nDrums are usually played by striking with the hand, a beater attached to a pedal, or with one or two sticks with or without padding. A wide variety of sticks are used, including wooden sticks and sticks with soft beaters of felt on the end. In jazz, some drummers use brushes for a smoother, quieter sound. In many traditional cultures, drums have a symbolic function and are used in religious ceremonies. Drums are often used in music therapy, especially hand drums, because of their tactile nature and easy use by a wide variety of people. In the 2000s, drums have also been used as a way to engage in aerobic exercise and is called cardio drumming.\nIn popular music and jazz, \"drums\" usually refers to a drum kit or a set of drums (with some cymbals, or in the case of harder rock music genres, many cymbals), and \"drummer\" to the person who plays them.\nDrums acquired even divine status in places such as Burundi, where the \"karyenda\" was a symbol of the power of the king.\nConstruction.\nThe shell almost always has a circular opening over which the drumhead is stretched, but the shape of the remainder of the shell varies widely. In the Western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a cylinder, although timpani, for example, use bowl-shaped shells. Other shapes include a frame design (tar, Bodhr\u00e1n), truncated cones (bongo drums, Ashiko), goblet shaped (djembe), and joined truncated cones (talking drum).\nA drum contains cylindrical shells can be open at one end (as is the case with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.\nOn modern band and orchestral drums, the drumhead is placed over the opening of the drum, which in turn is held onto the shell by a \"counterhoop\" (or \"rim\"), which is then held by means of a number of tuning screws called \"tension rods\" that screw into lugs placed evenly around the circumference. The head's tension can be adjusted by loosening or tightening the rods. Many such drums have six to ten tension rods. The sound of a drum depends on many variables\u2014including shape, shell size and thickness, shell materials, counterhoop material, drumhead material, drumhead tension, drum position, location, and striking velocity and angle.\nPrior to the invention of tension rods, drum skins were attached and tuned by rope systems\u2014as on the Djembe\u2014or pegs and ropes such as on Ewe drums. These methods are rarely used today, though sometimes appear on regimental marching band snare drums. The head of a talking drum, for example, can be temporarily tightened by squeezing the ropes that connect the top and bottom heads. Similarly, the tabla is tuned by hammering a disc held in place around the drum by ropes stretching from the top to bottom head. Orchestral timpani can be quickly tuned to precise pitches by using a foot pedal.\nSounds.\nSeveral factors determine the sound a drum produces, including the type, shape and construction of the drum shell, the type of drum heads it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different drum sounds have different uses in music. For example, the modern Tom-tom drum. A jazz drummer may want drums that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock drummer may prefer drums that are loud, dry and low-pitched.\nThe drum head has the most effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of drum head serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high frequency harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. Drum heads with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the drum head slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. Drum heads with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more, while drum heads with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones. Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads, preferring single ply drum heads or drum heads with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated drum heads.\nThe second biggest factor that affects drum sound is head tension against the shell. When the hoop is placed around the drum head and shell and tightened down with tension rods, the tension of the head can be adjusted. When the tension is increased, the amplitude of the sound is reduced and the frequency is increased, making the pitch higher and the volume lower.\nThe type of shell also affects the sound of a drum. Because the vibrations resonate in the shell of the drum, the shell can be used to increase the volume and to manipulate the type of sound produced. The larger the diameter of the shell, the lower the pitch. The larger the depth of the drum, the louder the volume. Shell thickness also determines the volume of drums. Thicker shells produce louder drums. Mahogany raises the frequency of low pitches and keeps higher frequencies at about the same speed. When choosing a set of shells, a jazz drummer may want smaller maple shells, while a rock drummer may want larger birch shells.\nHistory.\nDrums made with alligator skins have been found in Neolithic cultures located in China, dating to a period of 5500\u20132350 BC. In literary records, drums manifested shamanistic characteristics and were often used in ritual ceremonies.\nThe bronze Dong Son drum was fabricated by the Bronze Age Dong Son culture of northern Vietnam. They include the ornate Ngoc Lu drum.\nAnimal drumming.\nMacaque monkeys drum objects in a rhythmic way to show social dominance and this has been shown to be processed in a similar way in their brains to vocalizations, suggesting an evolutionary origin to drumming as part of social communication. Other primates including gorillas make drumming sounds by chest beating or hand clapping, and rodents such as kangaroo rats also make similar sounds using their paws on the ground.\nTalking drums.\nDrums are used not only for their musical qualities, but also as a means of communication over great distances. The talking drums of Africa are used to imitate the tone patterns of spoken language. Throughout Sri Lankan history drums have been used for communication between the state and the community, and Sri Lankan drums have a history stretching back over 2500 years.\nDrums in art.\nDrumming may be a purposeful expression of emotion for entertainment, spiritualism and communication. Many cultures practice drumming as a spiritual or religious passage and interpret drummed rhythm similarly to spoken language or prayer. Drumming has developed over millennia to be a powerful art form. Drumming is commonly viewed as the root of music and is sometimes performed as a kinesthetic dance. As a discipline, drumming concentrates on training the body to punctuate, convey and interpret musical rhythmic intention to an audience and to the performer.\nMilitary uses.\nChinese troops used t\u00e0ig\u01d4 drums to motivate troops, to help set a marching pace, and to call out orders or announcements. For example, during a war between Qi and Lu in 684 BC, the effect of drum on soldiers' morale is employed to change the result of a major battle. Fife-and-drum corps of Swiss mercenary foot soldiers also used drums. They used an early version of the snare drum carried over the player's right shoulder, suspended by a strap (typically played with one hand using traditional grip). It is to this instrument that the English word \"drum\" was first used. Similarly, during the English Civil War rope-tension drums would be carried by junior officers as a means to relay commands from senior officers over the noise of battle. These were also hung over the shoulder of the drummer and typically played with two drum sticks. Different regiments and companies would have distinctive and unique drum beats only they recognized. In the mid-19th century, the Scottish military started incorporating pipe bands into their Highland regiments.\nDuring pre-Columbian warfare, Aztec nations were known to have used drums to send signals to the battling warriors. The Nahuatl word for drum is roughly translated as \"huehuetl\".\nThe Rig Veda, one of the oldest religious scriptures in the world, contains several references to the use of the \"Dundhubi\" (war drum). Arya tribes charged into battle to the beating of the war drum and chanting of a hymn that appears in Book VI of the Rig Veda and also the Atharva Veda. The dundhuhi was considered sacred and to capture one in battle would signal defeat of the enemy.\nTypes.\nThe miruthangam is also known as the \"Devavadyam\" which translates to the instrument of God.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7951", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7951", "title": "Delphi", "text": "Sacred site and oracle of Ancient Greece\nDelphi (; ), in legend previously called Pytho (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce), was an ancient sacred precinct in central Greece. It was the seat of Pythia, the major oracle who was consulted about important decisions throughout the ancient classical world. The ancient Greeks considered the centre of the world to be in Delphi, marked by the stone monument known as the Omphalos of Delphi. The term \"omphalos\" was the Greek word for \"navel\".\nAccording to the Suda, Delphi took its name from the Delphyne, the she-serpent (\"drakaina\") who lived there and was killed by the god Apollo (in other accounts the serpent was the male serpent (\"drakon\") Python).\nThe sacred precinct occupies a delineated region on the south-western slope of Mount Parnassus.\nIt is now an extensive archaeological site, and since 1938 a part of Parnassos National Park. The precinct is recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in having had a great influence in the ancient world, as evidenced by the various monuments built there by most of the important ancient Greek city-states, demonstrating their fundamental Hellenic unity.\nAdjacent to the sacred precinct is a small modern town of the same name.\nNames.\nDelphi shares the same root with the Greek word for womb, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2 \"delphys\".\nPytho (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce) is related to Pythia, the priestess serving as the oracle, and to Python, a serpent or dragon who lived at the site. \"Python\" is derived from the verb \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 (\"pyth\u014d\"), \"to rot\".\nDelphi and the Delphic region.\nToday Delphi is a municipality of Greece as well as a modern town adjacent to the ancient precinct. The modern town was created after removing buildings from the sacred precinct so that the latter could be excavated. The two Delphis, old and new, are located on Greek National Road 48 between Amfissa in the west and Livadeia, capital of Boeotia, in the east. The road follows the northern slope of a pass between Mount Parnassus on the north and the mountains of the Desfina Peninsula on the south. The pass is of the river Pleistos, running from east to west, forming a natural boundary across the north of the Desfina Peninsula, and providing an easy route across it.\nOn the west side the valley joins the north\u2013south valley between Amfissa and Itea.\nOn the north side of the valley junction a spur of Parnassus looming over the valley made narrower by it is the site of ancient Krisa, which once was the ruling power of the entire valley system. Both Amphissa and Krissa are mentioned in the \"Iliad's\" Catalogue of Ships. It was a Mycenaean stronghold. Archaeological dates of the valley go back to the Early Helladic. Krisa itself is Middle Helladic. These early dates are comparable to the earliest dates at Delphi, suggesting Delphi was appropriated and transformed by Phocians from ancient Krisa. It is believed that the ruins of Kirra, now part of the port of Itea, were the port of Krisa of the same name.\nArchaeology of the precinct.\nThe site was first briefly excavated in 1880 by Bernard Haussoullier (1852\u20131926) on behalf of the French School at Athens, of which he was a sometime member. The site was then occupied by the village of Kastri, about 100 houses, 200 people. Kastri (\"fort\") had been there since the destruction of the place by Theodosius I in 390. He probably left a fort to make sure it was not repopulated, however, the fort became the new village. They were mining the stone for re-use in their own buildings. British and French travelers visiting the site suspected it was ancient Delphi. Before a systematic excavation of the site could be undertaken, the village had to be relocated, but the residents resisted.\nThe opportunity to relocate the village occurred when it was substantially damaged by an earthquake, with villagers offered a completely new village in exchange for the old site. In 1893, the French Archaeological School removed vast quantities of soil from numerous landslides to reveal both the major buildings and structures of the sanctuary of Apollo and of the temple to Athena, the Athena Pronoia along with thousands of objects, inscriptions, and sculptures.\nDuring the Great Excavation architectural members from a fifth-century Christian basilica, were discovered that date to when Delphi was a bishopric. Other important Late Roman buildings are the Eastern Baths, the house with the peristyle, the Roman Agora, and the large cistern. At the outskirts of the city late Roman cemeteries were located.\nTo the southeast of the precinct of Apollo lay the so-called Southeastern Mansion, a building with a 65-meter-long fa\u00e7ade, spread over four levels, with four triclinia and private baths. Large storage jars kept the provisions, whereas other pottery vessels and luxury items were discovered in the rooms. Among the finds stands out a tiny leopard made of mother of pearl, possibly of Sassanian origin, on display in the ground floor gallery of the Delphi Archaeological Museum. The mansion dates to the beginning of the fifth century and functioned as a private house until 580, later however it was transformed into a potter workshop. It is only then, in the beginning of the sixth century, that the city seems to decline: its size is reduced and its trade contacts seem to be drastically diminished. Local pottery production is produced in large quantities: it is coarser and made of reddish clay, aiming at satisfying the needs of the inhabitants.\nThe Sacred Way remained the main street of the settlement, transformed, however, into a street with commercial and industrial use. Around the agora were built workshops as well as the only intra muros early Christian basilica. The domestic area spread mainly in the western part of the settlement. The houses were rather spacious and two large cisterns provided running water to them.\nDelphi Archaeological Museum.\nThe museum houses artifacts associated with ancient Delphi, including the earliest known notation of a melody, the Charioteer of Delphi, Kleobis and Biton, golden treasures discovered beneath the Sacred Way, the Sphinx of Naxos, and fragments of reliefs from the Siphnian Treasury. Immediately adjacent to the exit is the inscription that mentions the Roman proconsul Gallio.\nArchitecture of the precinct.\nMost of the ruins that survive today date from the most intense period of activity at the site in the sixth century BC.\nTemple of Apollo.\nAncient tradition refers to a succession of mythical temples on the site: first one built of olive branches from Tempe, then one built of beeswax and wings by bees, and thirdly one built by Hephaestus and Athena. The first archaeologically attested structure was built in the seventh century BC and is attributed in legend to the architects Trophonios and Agamedes. It burnt down in 548/7\u00a0BC and the Alcmaeonids built a new structure which itself burnt down in the fourth century BC.\nThe ruins of the Temple of Apollo that are visible today date from the fourth century\u00a0BC, and are of a peripteral Doric building. It was erected by Spintharus, Xenodoros, and Agathon.\nTreasuries.\nFrom the entrance of the upper site, continuing up the slope on the Sacred Way almost to the Temple of Apollo, are a large number of votive statues, and numerous so-called treasuries. These were built by many of the Greek city-states to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for her advice, which was thought to have contributed to those victories. These buildings held the offerings made to Apollo; these were frequently a \"tithe\" or tenth of the spoils of a battle. The most impressive is the now-restored Athenian Treasury, built to commemorate their victory at the Battle of Marathon in 490\u00a0BC.\nThe Siphnian Treasury was dedicated by the city of Siphnos, whose citizens gave a tithe of the yield from their silver mines until the mines came to an abrupt end when the sea flooded the workings.\nOne of the largest of the treasuries was that of Argos. Having built it in the late classical period, the Argives took great pride in establishing their place at Delphi amongst the other city-states. Completed in 380 BC, their treasury seems to draw inspiration mostly from the Temple of Hera located in the Argolis. However, recent analysis of the Archaic elements of the treasury suggest that its founding preceded this.\nOther identifiable treasuries are those of the Sicyonians, the Boeotians, Massaliots, and the Thebans.\nAltar of the Chians.\nLocated in front of the Temple of Apollo, the main altar of the sanctuary was paid for and built by the people of Chios. It is dated to the fifth century BC by the inscription on its cornice. Made entirely of black marble, except for the base and cornice, the altar would have made a striking impression. It was restored in 1920.\nStoa of the Athenians.\nThe stoa, or open-sided, covered porch, is placed in an approximately east\u2013west alignment along the base of the polygonal wall retaining the terrace on which the Temple of Apollo sits. There is no archaeological suggestion of a connection to the temple. The stoa opened to the Sacred Way. The nearby presence of the Treasury of the Athenians suggests that this quarter of Delphi was used for Athenian business or politics, as stoas are generally found in market-places.\nAlthough the architecture at Delphi is generally Doric, a plain style, in keeping with the Phocian traditions that were Doric, the Athenians did not prefer the Doric. The stoa was built in their own preferred style, the Ionic order, the capitals of the columns being a sure indicator. In the Ionic order they are floral and ornate, although not so much as the Corinthian, which is in deficit there. The remaining porch structure contains seven fluted columns, unusually carved from single pieces of stone (most columns were constructed from a series of discs joined). The inscription on the stylobate indicates that it was built by the Athenians after their naval victory over the Persians in 478\u00a0BC, to house their war trophies. At that time the Athenians and the Spartans were on the same side.\nThe Sibyl rock is a pulpit-like outcrop of rock between the Athenian Treasury and the Stoa of the Athenians upon the Sacred Way that leads up to the temple of Apollo in the archaeological area of Delphi. The rock is claimed to be the location from which a prehistoric Sibyl pre-dating the Pythia of Apollo sat to deliver her prophecies. Other suggestions are that the Pythia might have stood there, or an acolyte whose function was to deliver the final prophecy. The rock seems ideal for public speaking.\nTheatre.\nThe ancient theatre at Delphi was built farther up the hill from the Temple of Apollo giving spectators a view of the entire sanctuary and the valley below. It was originally built in the fourth\u00a0century\u00a0BC, but was remodeled on several occasions, particularly in 160/159 B.C. at the expenses of king Eumenes II of Pergamon and, in 67 A.D., on the occasion of emperor Nero's visit.\nThe koilon (cavea) leans against the natural slope of the mountain whereas its eastern part overrides a little torrent that led the water of the fountain Cassotis right underneath the temple of Apollo. The orchestra was initially a full circle with a diameter measuring seven meters. The rectangular scene building ended up in two arched openings, of which the foundations are preserved today. Access to the theatre was possible through the parodoi, i.e. the side corridors. On the support walls of the parodoi are engraved large numbers of manumission inscriptions recording fictitious sales of the slaves to the deity. The koilon was divided horizontally in two zones via a corridor called diazoma. The lower zone had 27 rows of seats and the upper one only eight. Six radially arranged stairs divided the lower part of the koilon in seven tiers. The theatre could accommodate approximately 4,500 spectators.\nOn the occasion of Nero's visit to Greece in 67 A.D. various alterations took place. The orchestra was paved and delimited by a parapet made of stone. The proscenium was replaced by a low pedestal, the pulpitum; its fa\u00e7ade was decorated in relief with scenes from myths about Hercules. Further repairs and transformations took place in the second century A.D. Pausanias mentions that these were carried out under the auspices of Herod Atticus. In antiquity, the theatre was used for the vocal and musical contests that formed part of the programme of the Pythian Games in the late Hellenistic and Roman period. The theatre was abandoned when the sanctuary declined in Late Antiquity. After its excavation and initial restoration it hosted theatrical performances during the Delphic Festivals organized by A. Sikelianos and his wife, Eva Palmer, in 1927 and in 1930. It has recently been restored again as the serious landslides posed a grave threat for its stability for decades.\nTholos.\nThe tholos at the sanctuary of Athena Pronaea (\u1f08\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u1fb6 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03b1, \"Athena of forethought\") is a circular building that was constructed between 380 and 360\u00a0BC. It consisted of 20 Doric columns arranged with an exterior diameter of 14.76\u00a0meters, with 10 Corinthian columns in the interior.\nThe Tholos is located approximately a half a mile (800 m) from the main ruins at Delphi (at ). Three of the Doric columns have been restored, making it the most popular site at Delphi for tourists to take photographs.\nThe architect of the \"vaulted temple at Delphi\" is named by Vitruvius, in \"De architectura\" Book VII, as Theodorus Phoceus (not Theodorus of Samos, whom Vitruvius names separately).\nGymnasium.\nThe gymnasium, which is half a mile away from the main sanctuary, was a series of buildings used by the youth of Delphi. The building consisted of two levels: a stoa on the upper level providing open space, and a palaestra, pool, and baths on lower floor. These pools and baths were said to have magical powers, and imparted the ability to communicate directly to Apollo.\nStadium.\nThe stadium is located farther up the hill, beyond the \"via sacra\" and the theatre. It was built in the fifth century\u00a0BC, but was altered in later centuries. The last major remodelling took place in the second century\u00a0AD under the patronage of Herodes Atticus when the stone seating was built and an (arched) entrance created. It could seat 6500 spectators and the track was long and wide.\nHippodrome.\nIt was at the Pythian Games that prominent political leaders, such as Cleisthenes, tyrant of Sikyon, and Hieron, tyrant of Syracuse, competed with their chariots. The hippodrome where these events took place was referred to by Pindar, and this monument was sought by archaeologists for over two centuries.\nTraces of it have recently been found at Gonia in the plain of Krisa in the place where the original stadium had been sited.\nPolygonal wall.\nA retaining wall was built to support the terrace housing the construction of the second temple of Apollo in 548\u00a0BC. Its name is taken from the polygonal masonry of which it is constructed. At a later date, from 200\u00a0BC onwards, the stones were inscribed with the manumission (liberation) contracts of slaves who were consecrated to Apollo. Approximately a thousand manumissions are recorded on the wall.\nCastalian spring.\nThe sacred spring of Delphi lies in the ravine of the Phaedriades. The preserved remains of two monumental fountains that received the water from the spring date to the Archaic period and the Roman, with the latter cut into the rock.\nRoman Agora.\nThe first set of remains that the visitor sees upon entering the archaeological site of Delphi is the Roman Agora, which was just outside the \"peribolos\", or precinct walls, of the sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi. The Roman Agora was built between the sanctuary and the Castalian Spring, approximately 500 meters away. This large rectangular paved square used to be surrounded by Ionic porticos on its three sides. The square was built in the Roman period, but the remains visible at present along the north and northwestern sides date to the Late Antique period.\nAn open market was probably established, where the visitors would buy ex-votos, such as statuettes and small tripods, to leave as offerings to the gods. It also served as an assembly area for processions during sacred festivals.\nDuring the empire, statues of the emperor and other notable benefactors were erected here as evidenced by the remaining pedestals. In late, Antiquity workshops of artisans were also created within the agora.\nAthletic statues.\nDelphi is famous for its many preserved athletic statues. It is known that Olympia originally housed far more of these statues, but time brought ruin to many of them, leaving Delphi as the main site of athletic statues. Kleobis and Biton, two brothers renowned for their strength, are modeled in two of the earliest known athletic statues at Delphi. The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother's cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. When they entered Hera's temple, they fell into a slumber and never woke, dying at the height of their admiration, the perfect gift.\nThe Charioteer of Delphi is another ancient relic that has withstood the centuries. It is one of the best known statues from antiquity. The charioteer has lost many features, including his chariot and his left arm, but he stands as a tribute to athletic art of antiquity.\nMyths regarding the origin of the precinct.\nIn the \"Iliad\", Achilles would not accept Agamemnon's peace offering even if it included all the wealth in the \"stone floor\" of \"rocky Pytho\" (I 404). In the \"Odyssey\" (\u03b8 79) Agamemnon crosses a \"stone floor\" to receive a prophecy from Apollo in Pytho, the first known of proto-history. Hesiod also refers to Pytho \"in the hollows of Parnassus\" (Theogony 498). These references imply that the earliest date of the oracle's existence is the eighth century BC, the probable date of composition of the Homeric works.\nThe main myths of Delphi are given in three literary \"loci\". H. W. Parke, the Delphi scholar, argued that the myths are self-contradictory, thereby aligning with the Plutarchian epistemology that these myths are not to be taken as literal historical accounts but as symbolic narratives meant to explain oracular traditions.\" Parke asserts that there is no Apollo, no Zeus, no Hera, and certainly never was a great, serpent-like monster, and that the myths are pure Plutarchian figures of speech, meant to be aetiologies of some oracular tradition.\nHomeric Hymn 3, \"To Apollo\", is the oldest of the three loci, dating to the seventh century BC (estimate). Apollo travels about after his birth on Delos seeking a place for an oracle. He is advised by Telephus to choose Crissa \"below the glade of Parnassus\", which he does, and has a temple built, having killed the serpent that guards the spring. Subsequently, some Cretans from Knossos sail up on a mission to reconnoitre Pylos. Changing into a dolphin, Apollo casts himself on deck. The Cretans do not dare to remove him but sail on. Apollo guides the ship around Greece, ending back at Crisa, where the ship grounds. Apollo enters his shrine with the Cretans to be its priests, worshipping him as \"Delphineus\", \"of the dolphin\".\nZeus, a Classical deity, reportedly determined the site of Delphi when he sought to find the centre of his \"Grandmother Earth\" (Gaia). He sent two eagles flying from the eastern and western extremities, and the path of the eagles crossed over Delphi where the omphalos, or navel of Gaia was found.\nAccording to Aeschylus in the prologue of the \"Eumenides\", the oracle had origins in prehistoric times and the worship of Gaia, a view echoed by H. W. Parke, who described the evolution of beliefs associated with the site. He established that the prehistoric foundation of the oracle is described by three early writers: the author of the \"Homeric Hymn to Apollo\", Aeschylus in the prologue to the \"Eumenides\", and Euripides in a chorus in the \"Iphigeneia in Tauris\". Parke goes on to say, \"This version [Euripides] evidently reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of Earth. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in the \"Homeric Hymn\", a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. The \"Homeric Hymn\", as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of Dodona: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats... [he continues on p.\u00a06] ...Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the Omphalos, an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the 'navel' (Omphalos) or center of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by Zeus who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place\". On p.\u00a07 he writes further, \"So Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or Gaia. Themis, who is associated with her in tradition as her daughter and partner or successor, is really another manifestation of the same deity: an identity that Aeschylus recognized in another context. The worship of these two, as one or distinguished, was displaced by the introduction of Apollo. His origin has been the subject of much learned controversy: it is sufficient for our purpose to take him as the \"Homeric Hymn\" represents him \u2013 a northern intruder \u2013 and his arrival must have occurred in the dark interval between Mycenaean and Hellenic times. His conflict with Ge for the possession of the cult site was represented under the legend of his slaying the serpent.\nOne tale of the sanctuary's discovery states that a goatherd, who grazed his flocks on Parnassus, one day observed his goats playing with great agility upon nearing a chasm in the rock; the goatherd noticing this held his head over the chasm causing the fumes to go to his brain; throwing him into a strange trance.\nThe Homeric Hymn to Delphic Apollo recalled that the ancient name of this site had been \"Krisa\".\nOthers relate that the site was named Pytho (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce) and that Pythia, the priestess serving as the oracle, was chosen from their ranks by the priestesses who officiated at the temple. Apollo was said to have slain Python, a \"drako\" (a male serpent or a dragon) who lived there and protected the navel of the Earth. \"Python\" (derived from the verb \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 (\"pyth\u014d\"), \"to rot\") is claimed by some to be the original name of the site in recognition of Python that Apollo defeated.\nThe name \"Delphi\" comes from the same root as \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2 \"delphys\", \"womb\" and may indicate archaic veneration of Gaia at the site. Several other scholars discuss the likely prehistoric beliefs associated with the site.\nApollo is connected with the site by his epithet \u0394\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \"Delphinios\", \"the Delphinian\". The epithet is connected with dolphins (Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03c2,-\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2) in the Homeric \"Hymn to Apollo\" (line 400), recounting the legend of how Apollo first came to Delphi in the shape of a dolphin, carrying Cretan priests on his back. The Homeric name of the oracle is \"Pytho\" (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce). Another legend held that Apollo walked to Delphi from the north and stopped at Tempe, a city in Thessaly, to pick laurel (also known as bay tree) which he considered to be a sacred plant. In commemoration of this legend, the winners at the Pythian Games received a wreath of laurel picked in the temple.\nOracle of Delphi.\nThe prophetic process.\nPerhaps Delphi is best known for its oracle, the Pythia, or sibyl, the priestess prophesying from the tripod in the sunken adyton of the Temple of Apollo. The Pythia was known as a spokesperson for Apollo. She was a woman of blameless life chosen from the peasants of the area. Alone in an enclosed inner sanctum (Ancient Greek \"adyton\" \u2013 \"do not enter\") she sat on a tripod seat over an opening in the earth (the \"chasm\"). According to legend, when Apollo slew Python its body fell into this fissure and fumes arose from its decomposing body. Intoxicated by the vapors, the sibyl would fall into a trance, allowing Apollo to possess her spirit. In this state she prophesied. The oracle could not be consulted during the winter months, for this was traditionally the time when Apollo would live among the Hyperboreans. Dionysus would inhabit the temple during his absence. Of note, release of fumes is limited in colder weather.\nThe time to consult Pythia for an oracle during the year was determined from astronomical and geological grounds related to the constellations of Lyra and Cygnus. Similar practice was followed in other Apollo oracles too.\nHydrocarbon vapors emitted from the chasm. While in a trance the Pythia \"raved\" \u2013 probably a form of ecstatic speech \u2013 and her ravings were \"translated\" by the priests of the temple into elegant hexameters. It has been speculated that the ancient writers, including Plutarch who had worked as a priest at Delphi, were correct in attributing the oracular effects to the sweet-smelling \"pneuma\" (Ancient Greek for breath, wind, or vapor) escaping from the chasm in the rock. That exhalation could have been high in the known anaesthetic and sweet-smelling ethylene or other hydrocarbons such as ethane known to produce violent trances. Although, given the limestone geology, this theory remains debatable, the authors put up a detailed answer to their critics.\nAncient sources describe the priestess using \"laurel\" to inspire her prophecies. Several alternative plant candidates have been suggested including Cannabis, Hyoscyamus, Rhododendron, and Oleander. Harissis claims that a review of contemporary toxicological literature indicates that oleander causes symptoms similar to those shown by the Pythia, and his study of ancient texts shows that oleander was often included under the term \"laurel\". The Pythia may have chewed oleander leaves and inhaled their smoke prior to her oracular pronouncements and sometimes dying from the toxicity. The toxic substances of oleander resulted in symptoms similar to those of epilepsy, the \"sacred disease\", which may have been seen as the possession of the Pythia by the spirit of Apollo.\nInfluence, devastations and a temporary revival.\nThe Delphic oracle exerted considerable influence throughout the Greek world, and she was frequently consulted before major undertakings including wars and the founding of colonies. She also was respected by the Greek-influenced countries around the periphery of the Greek world, such as Lydia, Caria, and even Egypt.\nThe oracle was also known to the early Romans. Rome's seventh and last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, after witnessing a snake near his palace, sent a delegation including two of his sons to consult the oracle.\nIn 278 BC, a Thracian (Celtic) tribe raided Delphi, burned the temple, plundered the sanctuary and stole the \"unquenchable fire\" from the altar. During the raid, part of the temple roof collapsed. The same year, the temple was severely damaged by an earthquake, thus it fell into decay and the surrounding area became impoverished. The sparse local population led to difficulties in filling the posts required. The oracle's credibility waned due to doubtful predictions.\nThe oracle flourished again in the second century AD, during the rule of emperor Hadrian, who is believed to have visited the oracle twice and offered complete autonomy to the city. By the 4th century, Delphi had acquired the status of a city.\nConstantine the Great looted several monuments in Eastern Mediterranean, including Delphi, to decorate his new capital, Constantinople. One of those famous items was the bronze column of Plataea (The Serpent Column; Ancient Greek: \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f4c\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2, Three-headed Serpent; Turkish: Y\u0131lanl\u0131 S\u00fctun, Serpentine Column) from the sanctuary (dated 479 BC), relocated there from Delphi in AD 324, which can still be seen today standing destroyed at a square of Istanbul (where once upon a time was the Hippodrome of Constantinople, built by Constantine; Ottoman Turkish: Atmeydan\u0131 \"Horse Square\") with part of one of its heads kept in the Istanbul Archaeology Museums (\u0130stanbul Arkeoloji M\u00fczeleri).\nDespite the rise of Christianity across the Roman Empire, the oracle remained a religious center throughout the fourth century, and the Pythian Games continued to be held at least until 424 AD; however, the decline continued. The attempt of Emperor Julian to revive polytheism did not survive his reign. Excavations have revealed a large three-aisled basilica in the city, as well as traces of a church building in the sanctuary's gymnasium. The site was abandoned in the sixth or seventh centuries, although a single bishop of Delphi is attested in an episcopal list of the late eighth and early ninth centuries.\nIn modern times, the structured method of communication and forecasting known as the Delphi technique takes its name from the oracle of Delphi, although some founders and early developers of the technique considered that the adoption of the name \"Delphi\" was unfortunate and undesirable.\nReligious significance of the oracle.\nDelphi became the site of a major temple to Phoebus Apollo, as well as the Pythian Games and the prehistoric oracle. Even in Roman times, hundreds of votive statues remained, described by Pliny the Younger and seen by Pausanias. Carved into the temple were three phrases: (\"gn\u014dthi seaut\u00f3n\" = \"know thyself\"), (\"m\u0113d\u00e9n \u00e1gan\" = \"nothing in excess\"), and (\"eng\u00fda p\u00e1ra d'at\u0113\" = \"make a pledge and mischief is nigh\"). In antiquity, the origin of these phrases was attributed to one or more of the Seven Sages of Greece by authors such as Plato and Pausanias. Additionally, according to Plutarch's essay on the meaning of the \"E at Delphi\"\u2014the only literary source for the inscription\u2014there was also inscribed at the temple a large letter E. Among other things epsilon signifies the number 5. However, ancient as well as modern scholars have doubted the legitimacy of such inscriptions. According to one pair of scholars, \"The actual authorship of the three maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages.\"\nAccording to the Homeric hymn to the Pythian Apollo, Apollo shot his first arrow as an infant that effectively slew the serpent Pytho, the son of Gaia, who guarded the spot. To atone the murder of Gaia's son, Apollo was forced to fly and spend eight years in menial service before he could return forgiven. A festival, the Septeria, was held every year, at which the whole story was represented: the slaying of the serpent, and the flight, atonement, and return of the god.\nThe Pythian Games took place every four years to commemorate Apollo's victory. Another regular Delphi festival was the \"Theophania\" (\u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), an annual festival in spring celebrating the return of Apollo from his winter quarters in Hyperborea. The culmination of the festival was a display of an image of the deities, usually hidden in the sanctuary, to worshippers.\nThe \"theoxenia\" was held each summer, centred on a feast for \"gods and ambassadors from other states\". Myths indicate that Apollo killed the chthonic serpent Python guarding the Castalian Spring and named his priestess Pythia after her. Python, who had been sent by Hera, had attempted to prevent Leto, while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis, from giving birth.\nThe spring at the site flowed toward the temple but disappeared beneath, creating a cleft which emitted chemical vapors that purportedly caused the oracle at Delphi to reveal her prophecies. Apollo killed Python, but had to be punished for it, since he was a child of Gaia. The shrine dedicated to Apollo was originally dedicated to Gaia and shared with Poseidon. The name Pythia remained as the title of the Delphic oracle.\nErwin Rohde wrote that the Python was an earth spirit, who was conquered by Apollo, and buried under the omphalos, and that it is a case of one deity setting up a temple on the grave of another. Another view holds that Apollo was a fairly recent addition to the Greek pantheon coming originally from Lydia.\nHistory.\nOccupation of the site at Delphi can be traced back to the Neolithic period with extensive occupation and use beginning in the Mycenaean period (1600\u20131100 BC). In Mycenaean times Krissa was a major Greek land and sea power, perhaps one of the first in Greece, if the Early Helladic date of Kirra is to be believed. The ancient sources indicate that the previous name of the Gulf of Corinth was the \"Krisaean Gulf\". Like Krisa, Corinth was a Dorian state, and Gulf of Corinth was a Dorian lake, so to speak, especially since the migration of Dorians into the Peloponnesus starting about 1000 BC. Krisa's power was broken finally by the recovered Aeolic and Attic-Ionic speaking states of southern Greece over the issue of access to Delphi. Control of it was assumed by the Amphictyonic League, an organization of states with an interest in Delphi, in the early Classical period. Krisa was destroyed for its arrogance. The gulf was given Corinth's name. Corinth by then was similar to the Ionic states: ornate and innovative, not resembling the spartan style of the Doric.\nAncient Delphi.\nEarlier myths include traditions that Pythia, or the Delphic oracle, already was the site of an important oracle in the pre-classical Greek world (as early as 1400\u00a0BC) and, rededicated from about 800\u00a0BC, when it served as the major site during classical times for the worship of the god Apollo.\nDelphi was since ancient times a place of worship for Gaia, the mother goddess connected with fertility. The town started to gain pan-Hellenic relevance as both a shrine and an oracle in the seventh century BC. Initially under the control of Phocian settlers based in nearby Kirra (currently Itea), Delphi was reclaimed by the Athenians during the First Sacred War (597\u2013585 BC). The conflict resulted in the consolidation of the Amphictyonic League, which had both a military and a religious function revolving around the protection of the Temple of Apollo. This shrine was destroyed by fire in 548 BC and then fell under the control of the Alcmaeonids who were banned from Athens. In 449\u2013448 BC, the Second Sacred War (fought in the wider context of the First Peloponnesian War between the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta and the Delian-Attic League led by Athens) resulted in the Phocians gaining control of Delphi and the management of the Pythian Games.\nIn 356 BC, the Phocians under Philomelos captured and sacked Delphi, leading to the Third Sacred War (356\u2013346 BC), which ended with the defeat of the former and the rise of Macedon under the reign of Philip II. This led to the Fourth Sacred War (339 BC), which culminated in the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC) and the establishment of Macedonian rule over Greece.\nIn Delphi, Macedonian rule was superseded by the Aetolians in 279 BC, when a Gallic invasion was repelled, and by the Romans in 191 BC. The site was sacked by Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 86 BC, during the Mithridatic Wars, and by Nero in 66 AD. Although subsequent Roman emperors of the Flavian dynasty contributed toward to the restoration of the site, it gradually lost importance.\nThe anti-pagan legislation of the late Roman Imperial era deprived ancient sanctuaries of their assets. The emperor Julian attempted to reverse this religious climate, yet his \"pagan revival\" was particularly short-lived. When the doctor Oreibasius visited the oracle of Delphi, in order to question the fate of paganism, he received a pessimistic answer:\nTell the king that the flute has fallen to the ground. Phoebus does not have a home any more, neither an oracular laurel, nor a speaking fountain, because the talking water has dried out\nIt was shut down during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire by Theodosius I in 381 AD.\nAmphictyonic Council.\nThe Amphictyonic Council was a council of representatives from six Greek tribes who controlled Delphi and also the quadrennial Pythian Games. They met biannually and came from Thessaly and central Greece. Over time, the town of Delphi gained more control of itself and the council lost much of its influence.\nThe sacred precinct in the Iron Age.\nExcavation at Delphi, which was a post-Mycenaean settlement of the late ninth\u00a0century BC, has uncovered artifacts increasing steadily in volume beginning with the last quarter of the eighth century\u00a0BC. Pottery and bronze as well as tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in contrast to Olympia. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of valuable goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, encourages that view.\nApollo's sacred precinct in Delphi was a Panhellenic Sanctuary, where every four years, starting in 586\u00a0BC athletes from all over the Greek world competed in the Pythian Games, one of the four Panhellenic Games, precursors of the Modern Olympics. The victors at Delphi were presented with a laurel crown (\"stephanos\") that was ceremonially cut from a tree by a boy who re-enacted the slaying of the Python. (These competitions are also called stephantic games, after the crown.) Delphi was set apart from the other games sites because it hosted the mousikos agon, musical competitions.\nThese Pythian Games rank second among the four stephantic games chronologically and in importance. These games, however, were different from the games at Olympia in that they were not of such vast importance to the city of Delphi as the games at Olympia were to the area surrounding Olympia. Delphi would have been a renowned city regardless of whether it hosted these games; it had other attractions that led to it being labeled the \"omphalos\" (navel) of the earth, in other words, the centre of the world.\nIn the inner \"hestia\" (hearth) of the Temple of Apollo, an eternal flame burned. After the battle of Plataea, the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the foundation stories of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi.\nAbandonment and rediscovery.\nThe Ottomans finalized their domination over Phocis and Delphi in about 1410 AD. Delphi itself remained almost uninhabited for centuries. It seems that one of the first buildings of the early modern era was the monastery of the Dormition of Mary or of Panagia (the Mother of God) built above the ancient gymnasium at Delphi. It must have been toward the end of the fifteenth or in the sixteenth century that a settlement started forming there, which eventually ended up forming the village of Kastri.\nOttoman Delphi gradually began to be investigated. The first Westerner to describe the remains in Delphi was Cyriacus of Ancona, a fifteenth-century merchant turned diplomat and antiquarian, considered the founding father of modern classical archeology. He visited Delphi in March 1436 and remained there for six days. He recorded all the visible archaeological remains based on Pausanias for identification. He described the stadium and the theatre at that date as well as some freestanding pieces of sculpture. He also recorded several inscriptions, most of which are now lost. His identifications, however, were not always correct: for example he described a round building he saw as the temple of Apollo while this was simply the base of the Argives' ex-voto. A severe earthquake in 1500 caused much damage.\nIn 1766, an English expedition funded by the Society of Dilettanti included the Oxford epigraphist Richard Chandler, the architect Nicholas Revett, and the painter William Pars. Their studies were published in 1769 under the title \"Ionian Antiquities\", followed by a collection of inscriptions, and two travel books, one about Asia Minor (1775), and one about Greece (1776). \nIn 1805 Edward Dodwell visited Delphi, accompanied by the painter Simone Pomardi. Lord Byron visited in 1809, accompanied by his friend John Cam Hobhouse:\nYet there I've wandered by the vaulted rill\nYes! Sighed o'er Delphi's long deserted shrine,\nwhere, save that feeble fountain, all is still.\nHe carved his name on the same column in the gymnasium as Lord Aberdeen, later Prime Minister, who had visited a few years before. Proper excavation did not start until the late nineteenth century (see \"Excavations\" section) after the village had moved.\nDelphi in later art.\nFrom the sixteenth century onward, woodcuts of Delphi began to appear in printed maps and books. The earliest depictions of Delphi were totally imaginary; for example, those created by Nikolaus Gerbel, who published in 1545 a text based on the map of Greece by N. Sofianos. The ancient sanctuary was depicted as a fortified city.\nThe first travelers with archaeological interests, apart from the precursor Cyriacus of Ancona, were the British George Wheler and the French Jacob Spon, who visited Greece in a joint expedition in 1675\u20131676. They published their impressions separately. In Wheler's \"Journey into Greece\", published in 1682, a sketch of the region of Delphi appeared, where the settlement of Kastri and some ruins were depicted. The illustrations in Spon's publication \"Voyage d'Italie, de Dalmatie, de Gr\u00e8ce et du Levant, 1678\" are considered original and groundbreaking.\nTravelers continued to visit Delphi throughout the nineteenth century and published their books which contained diaries, sketches, and views of the site, as well as pictures of coins. The illustrations often reflected the spirit of romanticism, as evident by the works of Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, where, apart from the landscapes (\"La Gr\u00e8ce. Vues pittoresques et topographiques\", Paris 1834) are depicted also human types (\"Costumes et usages des peuples de la Gr\u00e8ce moderne dessin\u00e9s sur les lieux\", Paris 1828). The philhellene painter W. Williams has comprised the landscape of Delphi in his themes (1829). Influential personalities such as F.Ch.-H.-L. Pouqueville, W.M. Leake, Chr. Wordsworth and Lord Byron are amongst the most important visitors of Delphi.\nAfter the foundation of the modern Greek state, the press became also interested in these travelers. Thus \"Ephemeris\" writes (17 March 1889):\nIn the \"Revues des Deux Mondes\" Paul Lefaivre published his memoirs from an excursion to Delphi. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in place the dislocated arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse. \"In Arachova the Greek type is preserved intact. The men are rather athletes than farmers, built for running and wrestling, particularly elegant and slender under their mountain gear.\" Only briefly does he refer to the antiquities of Delphi, but he refers to a pelasgian wall 80\u00a0meters long, \"on which innumerable inscriptions are carved, decrees, conventions, manumissions\".\nGradually the first travelling guides appeared. The revolutionary \"pocket\" books invented by Karl Baedeker, accompanied by maps useful for visiting archaeological sites such as Delphi (1894) and the informed plans, the guides became practical and popular. The photographic lens revolutionized the way of depicting the landscape and the antiquities, particularly from 1893 onward, when the systematic excavations of the French Archaeological School started. However, artists such as Vera Willoughby, continued to be inspired by the landscape.\nDelphic themes inspired several graphic artists. Besides the landscape, Pythia and Sibylla become illustration subjects even on Tarot cards. A famous example constitutes Michelangelo's Delphic Sibyl (1509), the nineteenth-century German engraving, Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, as well as the recent ink on paper drawing, \"The Oracle of Delphi\" (2013) by M. Lind.\nModern artists are inspired also by the Delphic Maxims. Examples of such works are displayed in the \"Sculpture park of the European Cultural Center of Delphi\" and in exhibitions taking place at the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.\nDelphi in later literature.\nDelphi inspired literature as well. In 1814 W. Haygarth, friend of Lord Byron, refers to Delphi in his work \"Greece, a Poem\". In 1888 Charles Marie Ren\u00e9 Leconte de Lisle published his lyric drama L\u2019Apollonide, accompanied by music by Franz Servais. More recent French authors used Delphi as a source of inspiration such as Yves Bonnefoy (Delphes du second jour) or Jean Sullivan (nickname of Joseph Lemarchand) in L'Obsession de Delphes (1967), but also Rob MacGregor's Indiana Jones and the Peril at Delphi (1991).\nThe presence of Delphi in Greek literature is very intense. Poets such as Kostis Palamas (The Delphic Hymn, 1894), Kostas Karyotakis (Delphic festival, 1927), Nikephoros Vrettakos (return from Delphi, 1957), Yannis Ritsos (Delphi, 1961\u201362) and Kiki Dimoula (Gas omphalos and Appropriate terrain 1988), to mention only the most renowned ones. Angelos Sikelianos wrote The Dedication (of the Delphic speech) (1927), the Delphic Hymn (1927) and the tragedy Sibylla (1940), whereas in the context of the Delphic idea and the Delphic festivals he published an essay entitled \"The Delphic union\" (1930). The nobelist George Seferis wrote an essay under the title \"Delphi\", in the book \"Dokimes\".\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitation references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "7952", "revid": "63286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7952", "title": "Digital Equipment Corporation", "text": "U.S. computer manufacturer (1957\u20131998)\nDigital Equipment Corporation (DEC ), using the trademark Digital, was a major American company in the computer industry from the 1960s to the 1990s. The company was co-founded by Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson in 1957. Olsen was president until he was forced to resign in 1992, after the company had gone into precipitous decline.\nThe company produced many different product lines over its history. It is best known for the work in the minicomputer market starting in the early 1960s. The company produced a series of machines known as the PDP line, with the PDP-8 and PDP-11 being among the most successful minis in history. Their success was only surpassed by another DEC product, the late-1970s VAX \"supermini\" systems that were designed to replace the PDP-11. Although a number of competitors had successfully competed with Digital through the 1970s, the VAX cemented the company's place as a leading vendor in the computer space. As microcomputers improved in the late 1980s, especially with the introduction of RISC-based workstation machines, the performance niche of the minicomputer was rapidly eroded.\nBy the early 1990s, the company was in turmoil as their mini sales collapsed and their attempts to address this by entering the high-end market with machines like the VAX 9000 were market failures. After several attempts to enter the workstation and file server market, the DEC Alpha product line began to make successful inroads in the mid-1990s, but was too late to save the company. DEC was acquired in June 1998 by Compaq in what was at that time the largest merger in the history of the computer industry. During the purchase, some parts of DEC were sold to other companies; the compiler business and the Hudson Fab were sold to Intel. At the time, Compaq was focused on the enterprise market and had recently purchased several other large vendors. DEC was a major player overseas where Compaq had less presence. However, Compaq had little idea what to do with its acquisitions, and soon found itself in financial difficulty of its own. Compaq was eventually bought by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in May 2002.\nHistory.\nOrigins (1944\u20131958).\nKen Olsen and Harlan Anderson were two engineers who had been working at MIT Lincoln Laboratory on the lab's various computer projects. The Lab is best known for their work on what would today be known as \"interactivity\", and their machines were among the first where operators had direct control over programs running in real-time. These had started in 1944 with the famed Whirlwind, which was originally developed to make a flight simulator for the US Navy, although this was never completed. Instead, this effort evolved into the SAGE system for the US Air Force, which used large screens and light guns to allow operators to interact with radar data stored in the computer.\nWhen the Air Force project wound down, the Lab turned their attention to an effort to build a version of the Whirlwind using transistors in place of vacuum tubes. In order to test their new circuitry, they first built a small 18-bit machine known as TX-0, which first ran in 1956. When the TX-0 successfully proved the basic concepts, attention turned to a much larger system, the 36-bit TX-2 with a then-enormous 64 kWords of core memory. Core was so expensive that parts of TX-0's memory were stripped for the TX-2, and what remained of the TX-0 was then given to MIT on permanent loan.\nAt MIT, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson noticed something odd: students would line up for hours to get a turn to use the stripped-down TX-0, while largely ignoring a faster IBM machine that was also available. The two decided that the draw of interactive computing was so strong that they felt there was a market for a small machine dedicated to this role, essentially a commercialized TX-0. They could sell this to users where the graphical output or real-time operation would be more important than outright performance. Additionally, as the machine would cost much less than the larger systems then available, it would also be able to serve users that needed a lower-cost solution dedicated to a specific task, where a larger 36-bit machine would not be needed.\nIn 1957, when the pair and Ken's brother Stan sought capital, they found that the American business community was hostile to investing in computer companies. Many smaller computer companies had come and gone in the 1950s, wiped out when new technical developments rendered their platforms obsolete, and even large companies like RCA and General Electric were failing to make a profit in the market. The only serious expression of interest came from Georges Doriot and his American Research and Development Corporation (AR&amp;D). Worried that a new computer company would find it difficult to arrange further financing, Doriot suggested the fledgling company change its business plan to focus less on computers, and even change their name from \"Digital Computer Corporation\".\nThe pair returned with an updated business plan that outlined two phases for the company's development. They would start by selling computer modules as stand-alone devices that could be purchased separately and wired together to produce a number of different digital systems for lab use. Then, if these \"digital modules\" were able to build a self-sustaining business, the company would be free to use them to develop a complete computer in its Phase II. The newly christened \"Digital Equipment Corporation\" received $70,000 from AR&amp;D for a 70% share of the company, AR&amp;D's SVP Dorothy Rowe joined as a Director and also served as Treasurer, and the company began operations in a Civil War-era textile mill in Maynard, Massachusetts, where plenty of inexpensive manufacturing space was available.\nDigital modules (1958).\nIn early 1958, DEC shipped its first products, the \"Digital Laboratory Module\" line. The Modules consisted of a number of individual electronic components and germanium transistors mounted to a circuit board, the actual circuits being based on those from the TX-2.\nThe Laboratory Modules were packaged in an extruded aluminum housing, intended to sit on an engineer's workbench, although a rack-mount bay was sold that held nine laboratory modules. They were then connected together using banana plug patch cords inserted at the front of the modules. Three versions were offered, running at 5\u00a0MHz (1957), 500\u00a0kHz (1959), or 10\u00a0MHz (1960). The Modules proved to be in high demand by other computer companies, who used them to build equipment to test their own systems. Despite the recession of the late 1950s, the company sold $94,000 worth of these modules during 1958 alone (), turning a profit at the end of its first year.\nThe original Laboratory Modules were soon supplemented with the \"Digital System Module\" line, which were identical internally but packaged differently. The Systems Modules were designed with all of the connections at the back of the module using 22-pin Amphenol connectors, and were attached to each other by plugging them into a backplane that could be mounted in a 19-inch rack. The backplanes allowed 25 modules in a single 5-1/4\u00a0inch section of rack, and allowed the high densities needed to build a computer.\nThe original laboratory and system module lines were offered in 500 kilocycle, 5 megacycle and 10 megacycle versions. In all cases, the supply voltages were -15 and +10 volts, with logic levels of -3 volts (passive pull-down) and 0 volts (active pull-up).\nDEC used the System Modules to build their \"Memory Test\" machine for testing core memory systems, selling about 50 of these pre-packaged units over the next eight years. The PDP-1 and LINC computers were also built using System Modules (see below).\nModules were part of DEC's product line into the 1970s, although they went through several evolutions during this time as technology changed. The same circuits were then packaged as the first \"R\" (red) series \"Flip-Chip\" modules. Later, other Flip-Chip module series provided additional speed, much higher logic density, and industrial I/O capabilities. DEC published extensive data about the modules in free catalogs that became very popular.\nPDP-1 family (1960).\nWith the company established and a successful product on the market, DEC turned its attention to the computer market once again as part of its planned \"Phase II\". In August 1959, Ben Gurley started design of the company's first computer, the PDP-1. In keeping with Doriot's instructions, the name was an initialism for \"Programmable Data Processor\", leaving off the term \"computer\". As Gurley put it, \"We aren't building computers, we're building 'Programmable Data Processors'.\" The prototype was first shown publicly at the Joint Computer Conference in Boston in December 1959. The first PDP-1 was delivered to Bolt, Beranek and Newman in November 1960, and formally accepted the next April. The PDP-1 sold in basic form for $120,000 (). By the time production ended in 1969, 53 PDP-1s had been delivered.\nThe PDP-1 was supplied standard with 4096 words of core memory, 18-bits per word, and ran at a basic speed of 100,000 operations per second. It was constructed using many System Building Blocks that were packaged into several 19-inch racks. The racks were themselves packaged into a single large mainframe case, with a hexagonal control panel containing switches and lights mounted to lie at table-top height at one end of the mainframe. Above the control panel was the system's standard input/output solution, a punched tape reader and writer. Most systems were purchased with two peripherals, the Type 30 vector graphics display, and a Soroban Engineering modified IBM Model B Electric typewriter that was used as a printer. The Soroban system was notoriously unreliable, and often replaced with a modified Friden Flexowriter, which also contained its own punched tape system. A variety of more-expensive add-ons followed, including magnetic tape systems, punched card readers and punches, and faster punched tape and printer systems.\nWhen DEC introduced the PDP-1, they also mentioned larger machines at 24, 30 and 36 bits, based on the same design. During construction of the prototype PDP-1, some design work was carried out on a 24-bit PDP-2, and the 36-bit PDP-3. Although the PDP-2 never proceeded beyond the initial design, the PDP-3 found some interest and was designed in full. Only one PDP-3 appears to have been built, in 1960, by the CIA's Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI) in Waltham, Massachusetts. According to the limited information available, they used it to process radar cross section data for the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft. Gordon Bell remembered that it was being used in Oregon some time later, but could not recall who was using it.\nIn November 1962, DEC introduced the $65,000 PDP-4. The PDP-4 was similar to the PDP-1 and used a similar instruction set, but used slower memory and different packaging to lower the price. Like the PDP-1, about 54 PDP-4s were eventually sold, most to a customer base similar to the original PDP-1.\nIn 1964, DEC introduced its new Flip-Chip module design, and used it to re-implement the PDP-4 as the PDP-7. The PDP-7 was introduced in December 1964, and about 120 were eventually produced. An upgrade to the Flip Chip led to the R series, which in turn led to the PDP-7A in 1965. The PDP-7 is most famous as the machine for which the Unix operating system was originally written. Unix ran only on DEC systems until the Interdata 8/32.\nA more dramatic upgrade to the PDP-1 series was introduced in August 1966, the PDP-9. The PDP-9 was instruction-compatible with the PDP-4 and \u22127, but ran about twice as fast as the \u22127 and was intended to be used in larger deployments. At only $19,900 in 1968, the PDP-9 was a big seller, eventually selling 445 machines, more than all of the earlier models combined.\nEven while the PDP-9 was being introduced, its replacement was being designed, and was introduced as 1969's PDP-15, which re-implemented the PDP-9 using integrated circuits in place of modules. Much faster than the PDP-9 even in basic form, the PDP-15 also included a floating-point unit and a separate input/output processor for further performance gains. Over 400 PDP-15's were ordered in the first eight months of production, and production eventually amounted to 790 examples in 12 basic models. However, by this time other machines in DEC's lineup could fill the same niche at even lower price points, and the PDP-15 would be the last of the 18-bit series.\nPDP-8 family (1962).\nIn 1962, Lincoln Laboratory used a selection of System Building Blocks to implement a small 12-bit machine, and attached it to a variety of analog-to-digital (A to D) input/output (I/O) devices that made it easy to interface with various analog lab equipment. The LINC proved to attract intense interest in the scientific community, and has since been referred to as the first real minicomputer, a machine that was small and inexpensive enough to be dedicated to a single task even in a small lab.\nSeeing the success of the LINC, in 1963 DEC took the basic logic design but stripped away the extensive A to D systems to produce the PDP-5. The new machine, the first outside the PDP-1 mould, was introduced at WESTCON on August 11, 1963. A 1964 ad expressed the main advantage of the PDP-5, \"Now you can own the PDP-5 computer for what a core memory alone used to cost: $27,000\". 116 PDP-5s were produced until the lines were shut down in early 1967. Like the PDP-1 before it, the PDP-5 inspired a series of newer models based on the same basic design that would go on to be more famous than its parent.\nOn March 22, 1965, DEC introduced the PDP-8, which replaced the PDP-5's modules with the new R-series modules using Flip Chips. The machine was re-packaged into a small tabletop case, which remains distinctive for its use of smoked plastic over the CPU which allowed one to easily see the logic modules plugged into the wire-wrapped backplane of the CPU. Sold standard with 4 kWords of 12-bit core memory and a Teletype Model 33 ASR for basic input/output, the machine listed for only $18,000. The PDP-8 is referred to as the first \"real\" minicomputer because of its sub-$25,000 price. Sales were, unsurprisingly, very strong, and helped by the fact that several competitors had just entered the market with machines aimed directly at the PDP-5's market space, which the PDP-8 trounced. This gave the company two years of unrestricted leadership, and eventually 1450 \"straight eight\" machines were produced before it was replaced by newer implementations of the same basic design.\nDEC hit an even lower price-point with the PDP-8/S, the S for \"serial\". As the name implies the /S used a serial arithmetic unit, which was much slower but reduced costs so much that the system sold for under $10,000. DEC then used the new PDP-8 design as the basis for a new LINC, the two-processor LINC-8. The LINC-8 used one PDP-8 CPU and a separate LINC CPU, and included instructions to switch from one to the other. This allowed customers to run their existing LINC programs, or \"upgrade\" to the PDP-8, all in software. Although not a huge seller, 142 LINC-8s were sold starting at $38,500. Like the original LINC to PDP-5 evolution, the LINC-8 was then modified into the single-processor PDP-12, adding another 1000 machines to the 12-bit family. Newer circuitry designs led to the PDP-8/I and PDP-8/L in 1968. In 1975, one year after an agreement between DEC and Intersil, the Intersil 6100 chip was launched, effectively a PDP-8 on a chip. This was a way to allow PDP-8 software to be run even after the official end-of-life announcement for the DEC PDP-8 product line.\nPDP-6 and PDP-10 families (1963 and 1968).\nWhile the PDP-5 introduced a lower-cost line, 1963's PDP-6 was intended to take DEC into the mainframe market with a 36-bit machine. However, the PDP-6 proved to be a \"hard sell\" with customers, as it offered few obvious advantages over similar machines from the better-established vendors like IBM or Honeywell, in spite of its low cost around $300,000. Only 23 were sold, or 26 depending on the source, and unlike other models the low sales meant the PDP-6 was not improved with successor versions. However, the PDP-6 is historically important as the platform that introduced \"Monitor\", an early time-sharing operating system that would evolve into the widely used TOPS-10.\nWhen newer Flip Chip packaging allowed the PDP-6 to be re-implemented at a much lower cost, DEC took the opportunity to refine their 36-bit design, introducing the PDP-10 in 1968. The PDP-10 was as much a success as the PDP-6 was a commercial failure; about 700 mainframe PDP-10s were sold before production ended in 1984. The PDP-10 was widely used in university settings, and thus was the basis of many advances in computing and operating system design during the 1970s. DEC later re-branded all of the models in the 36-bit series as the \"DECsystem-10\", and PDP-10s are generally referred to by the model of their CPU, starting with the \"KA10\", soon upgraded to the \"KI10\" (I:Integrated circuit); then to \"KL10\" (L:Large-scale integration ECL logic); also the \"KS10\" (S: Small form factor). Unified product line upgrades produced the compatible DECSYSTEM-20, along with a TOPS-20 operating system that included virtual memory support.\nThe Jupiter Project was supposed to continue the mainframe product line into the future by using gate arrays with an innovative Air Mover Cooling System, coupled with a built-in floating point processing engine called \"FBOX\". The design was intended for a top tier scientific computing niche, yet the critical performance measurement was based upon COBOL compilation which did not fully utilize the primary design features of Jupiter technology. When the Jupiter Project was cancelled in 1983, some of the engineers adapted aspects of the 36-bit design into a forthcoming 32-bit design, releasing the high-end VAX8600 in 1985.\nPDP-11 (1970).\nDEC's successful entry into the computer market took place during a fundamental shift in the underlying organization of the machines from word lengths based on 6-bit characters to those based on 8-bit words needed to support ASCII. DEC began studies of such a machine, the PDP-X, but Ken Olsen did not support it as he could not see how it offered anything their existing 12-bit or 18-bit machines didn't. This led the leaders of the PDP-X project to leave DEC and start Data General, whose 16-bit Data General Nova was released in 1969 and was a huge success.\nThe success of the Nova finally prompted DEC to take the switch seriously, and they began a crash program to introduce a 16-bit machine of their own. The new system was designed primarily by Harold McFarland, Gordon Bell, Roger Cady, and others. The project was able to leap forward in design with the arrival of Harold McFarland, who had been researching 16-bit designs at Carnegie Mellon University. One of his simpler designs became the basis for the new design, although when they first viewed the proposal, management was not impressed and almost cancelled it.\nThe result was the PDP-11, released in 1970. It differed from earlier designs considerably. In particular, the new design did not include many of the addressing modes that were intended to make programs smaller in memory, a technique that was widely used on other DEC machines and CISC designs in general. This would mean the machine would spend more time accessing memory, which would slow it down. However, the machine also extended the idea of multiple \"General Purpose Registers\" (GPRs), which gave the programmer flexibility to use these high-speed memory caches as they needed, potentially addressing the performance issues.\nA major advance in the PDP-11 design was DEC's Unibus, which supported all peripherals through memory mapping. This allowed a new device to be added easily, generally only requiring plugging a hardware interface board into the backplane and possibly adding a jumper to the wire wrapped backplane, and then installing software that read and wrote to the mapped memory to control it. The relative ease of interfacing spawned a huge market of third party add-ons for the PDP-11, which made the machine even more useful.\nThe combination of architectural innovations proved superior to competitors and the \"11\" architecture was soon the industry leader, propelling DEC back to a strong market position. The design was later expanded to allow paged physical memory and memory protection features, useful for multitasking and time-sharing. Some models supported separate instruction and data spaces for an effective virtual address size of 128\u00a0KB within a physical address size of up to 4\u00a0MB. Smaller PDP-11s, implemented as single-chip CPUs, continued to be produced until 1996, by which time over 600,000 had been sold.\nThe PDP-11 supported several operating systems, including Bell Labs' new Unix operating system as well as DEC's DOS-11, RSX-11, IAS, RT-11, DSM-11, and RSTS/E. Many early PDP-11 applications were developed using standalone paper-tape utilities. DOS-11 was the PDP-11's first disk operating system, but was soon supplanted by more capable systems. RSX provided a general-purpose multitasking environment and supported a wide variety of programming languages. IAS was a time-sharing version of RSX-11D. Both RSTS and Unix were time-sharing systems available to educational institutions at little or no cost, and these PDP-11 systems were destined to be the \"sandbox\" for a rising generation of engineers and computer scientists. Large numbers of PDP-11/70s were deployed in telecommunications and industrial control applications. AT&amp;T Corporation became DEC's largest customer.\nRT-11 provided a practical real-time operating system in minimal memory, allowing the PDP-11 to continue DEC's critical role as a computer supplier for embedded systems. Historically, RT-11 also served as the inspiration for many microcomputer OS's, as these were generally being written by programmers who cut their teeth on one of the many PDP-11 models. For example, CP/M used a command syntax similar to RT-11's, and even retained the awkward PIP program used to copy data from one computer device to another. As another historical footnote, DEC's use of \"/\" for \"switches\" (command-line options) would lead to the adoption of \"\\\" for pathnames in MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows as opposed to \"/\" in Unix.\nThe evolution of the PDP-11 followed earlier systems, eventually including a single-user deskside personal computer form, the MicroPDP-11. In total, around 600,000 PDP-11s of all models were sold, and a wide variety of third-party peripheral vendors had also entered the computer product ecosystem. It was even sold in kit form as the Heathkit H11, although it proved too expensive for Heathkit's traditional hobbyist market.\nVAX (1977).\nThe introduction of semiconductor memory in the early 1970s, and especially dynamic RAM shortly thereafter, led to dramatic reductions in the price of memory as the effects of Moore's Law were felt. Within years, it was common to equip a machine with all the memory it could address, typically 64\u00a0KB on 16-bit machines. This led vendors to introduce new designs with the ability to address more memory, often by extending the address format to 18 or 24 bits in machines that were otherwise similar to their earlier 16-bit designs.\nIn contrast, DEC decided to make a more radical departure. In 1976, they began the design of a machine whose entire architecture was expanded from the 16-bit PDP-11 to a new 32-bit basis. This would allow the addressing of very large memories, which were to be controlled by a new virtual memory system, and would also improve performance by processing twice as much data at a time. The system would, however, maintain compatibility with the PDP-11, by operating in a second mode that sent its 16-bit words into the 32-bit internals, while mapping the PDP-11's 16-bit memory space into the larger virtual 32-bit space.\nThe result was the VAX architecture, where VAX stands for Virtual Address eXtension (from 16 to 32 bits). The first computer to use a VAX CPU was the VAX-11/780, announced in October 1977, which DEC referred to as a \"superminicomputer\". Although it was not the first 32-bit minicomputer, the VAX-11/780's combination of features, price, and marketing almost immediately propelled it to a leadership position in the market after it was released in 1978. VAX systems were so successful that in 1983, DEC canceled its Jupiter project, which had been intended to build a successor to the PDP-10 mainframe, and instead focused on promoting the VAX as the single computer architecture for the company.\nSupporting the VAX's success was the VT52, one of the most successful smart terminals. Building on earlier less successful models, the VT05 and VT50, the VT52 was the first terminal that did everything one might want in a single inexpensive chassis. The VT52 was followed by the even more successful VT100 and its follow-ons, making DEC one of the largest terminal vendors in the industry. This was supported by a line of inexpensive computer printers, the DECwriter line. With the VT and DECwriter series, DEC could now offer a complete top-to-bottom system from computer to all peripherals, which formerly required collecting the required devices from different suppliers.\nThe VAX processor architecture and family of systems evolved and expanded through several generations during the 1980s, culminating in the NVAX microprocessor implementation and VAX 7000/10000 series in the early 1990s.\nEarly microcomputers (1982\u20131986).\nWhen a DEC research group demonstrated two prototype microcomputers in 1974\u2014before the debut of the MITS Altair\u2014Olsen chose to not proceed with the project. The company similarly rejected another personal computer proposal in 1977. At the time these systems were of limited utility, and Olsen famously derided them in 1977, stating \"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\" Unsurprisingly, DEC did not put much effort into the microcomputer area in the early days of the market. In 1977, the Heathkit H11 was announced; a PDP-11 in kit form. At the beginning of the 1980s, DEC built the VT180 (codenamed \"Robin\"), which was a VT100 terminal with an added Z80-based microcomputer running CP/M, but this product was initially available only to DEC employees.\nIt was only after IBM had successfully launched the IBM PC in 1981 that DEC responded with their own systems. In 1982, DEC introduced not one, but three incompatible machines which were each tied to different proprietary architectures. The first, the DEC Professional, was based on the PDP-11/23 (and later, the 11/73) running the RSX-11M+ derived, but menu-driven, P/OS (\"Professional Operating System\"). This DEC machine easily outperformed the PC, but was more expensive than, and completely incompatible with IBM PC hardware and software, offering far fewer options for customizing a system.\nUnlike CP/M and DOS microcomputers, every copy of every program for the Professional had to be provided with a unique key for the particular machine and CPU for which it was bought. At that time this was mainstream policy, because most computer software was either bought from the company that built the computer or custom-constructed for one client. However, the emerging third-party software industry disregarded the PDP-11/Professional line and concentrated on other microcomputers where distribution was easier. At DEC itself, creating better programs for the Professional was not a priority, perhaps from fear of cannibalizing the PDP-11 line. As a result, the Professional was a superior machine, running inferior software. In addition, a new user would have to learn an awkward, slow, and inflexible menu-based user interface which appeared to be radically different from PC DOS or CP/M, which were more commonly used on the 8080- and 8088-based microcomputers of the time. A second offering, the DECmate II was the latest version of the PDP-8-based word processors, but not really suited to general computing, nor competitive with Wang Laboratories' popular word processing equipment.\nThe most popular early DEC microcomputer was the dual-processor (Z80 and 8088) Rainbow 100, which ran the 8-bit CP/M operating system on the Z80 and the 16-bit CP/M-86 operating system on the Intel 8088 processor. It could also run a UNIX System III implementation called VENIX. Applications from standard CP/M could be re-compiled for the Rainbow, but by this time users were expecting custom-built (pre-compiled binary) applications such as Lotus 1-2-3, which was eventually ported along with MS-DOS 2.0 and introduced in late 1983. Although the Rainbow generated some press, it was unsuccessful due to its high price and lack of marketing and sales support. By late 1983 IBM was outselling DEC's personal computers by more than ten to one.\nA further system was introduced in 1986 as the VAXmate, which included Microsoft Windows 1.0 and used VAX/VMS-based file and print servers along with integration into DEC's own DECnet-family, providing LAN/WAN connection from PC to mainframe or supermini. The VAXmate replaced the Rainbow, and in its standard form was the first widely marketed diskless workstation.\nNetworking and clusters (1984).\nIn 1984, DEC launched its first 10\u00a0Mbit/s Ethernet. Ethernet allowed scalable networking, and VAXcluster allowed scalable computing. Combined with DECnet and Ethernet-based terminal servers (LAT), DEC had produced a networked storage architecture which allowed them to compete directly with IBM. Ethernet replaced Token Ring, and went on to become the dominant networking model in use today.\nIn September 1985, DEC became the fifth company to register a .com domain name (dec.com).\nAlong with the hardware and protocols, DEC also introduced the VAXcluster concept, which allowed several VAX machines to be tied together into a single larger storage system. VAXclusters allowed a DEC-based company to scale their services by adding new machines to the cluster at any time, as opposed to buying a faster machine and using that to replace a slower one. The flexibility this offered was compelling, and allowed DEC to attack high-end markets formerly out of their reach.\nLate 1980s diversification.\nThe PDP-11 and VAX lines continued to sell in record numbers. Better yet, DEC was competing very well against the market leader, IBM, taking an estimated $2\u00a0billion away from them in the mid-1980s. In 1986, DEC's profits rose 38% when the rest of the computer industry experienced a downturn, and by 1987 the company was threatening IBM's number one position in the computer industry. Not long thereafter came IBM's \"VAX killer\" offerings, at a time when DEC had twice the sales of IBM in the mid-range computer market.\nAt its peak, DEC was the second-largest computer company in the world, with over 100,000 employees. It was during this time that the company branched out development into a wide variety of projects that were far from its core business in computer equipment. The company invested heavily in custom software. In the 1970s and earlier, most software was custom-written to serve a specific task, but by the 1980s the introduction of relational databases and similar systems allowed powerful software to be built in a modular fashion, potentially saving enormous amounts of development time. Software companies like Oracle became the new darlings of the industry, and DEC started their own efforts in every \"hot\" niche, in some cases several projects for the same niche. Some of these products competed with DEC's own partners, notably Rdb which competed with Oracle's products on the VAX, part of a major partnership only a few years earlier.\nAlthough many of these products were well designed, most of them were DEC-only or DEC-centric, and customers frequently ignored them and used third-party products instead. This problem was further exacerbated by Olsen's aversion to traditional advertising and his belief that well-engineered products would sell themselves. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on these projects, at the same time that workstations using RISC microprocessors were starting to approach VAX CPUs in performance.\nEarly 1990s faltering and attempted turnaround.\nAs microprocessors continued to improve in the 1980s, it soon became clear that the next generation would offer performance and features equal to the best of DECs low-end minicomputer lineup. Worse, the Berkeley RISC and Stanford MIPS designs were aiming to introduce 32-bit designs that would outperform the fastest members of the VAX family, DEC's cash cow.\nThe company recognized that RISC offered at least twice as many MIPS per cost as VAX, but funded so many competing projects in reaction during the 1980s that it lost control of its strategy until the early 1990s. Constrained by the huge success of their VAX and VMS products, which followed the proprietary model, the company was very late to respond to these threats. In the early 1990s, DEC found its sales faltering and its first layoffs followed. The company that created the minicomputer, a dominant networking technology, and arguably the first computers for personal use, had abandoned the \"low end\" market, whose dominance with the PDP-8 had built the company in a previous generation. Decisions about what to do about this threat led to infighting within the company that seriously delayed their responses.\nOne group suggested that every possible development in the industry be poured into the construction of a new VAX family that would leapfrog the performance of the existing machines. This would limit the market erosion in the top-end segment, where profit margins were maximized and DEC could continue to survive as a minicomputer vendor. This line of thought led, eventually, to the VAX 9000 series, which were plagued with problems when they were first introduced in October 1989, already two years late. The problems took so long to work out, and the prices of the systems were so high, that DEC was never able to make the line the success they hoped.\nOthers within the company felt that the proper response was to introduce their own RISC designs and use those to build new machines. However, there was little official support for these efforts, and no less than four separate small projects ran in parallel at various labs around the US. Eventually these were gathered into the PRISM project, which delivered a credible 32-bit design with some unique features allowing it to serve as the basis of a new VAX implementation. Infighting with teams dedicated to DEC's big iron made funding difficult, and the design was not finalized until April 1988, and then cancelled shortly thereafter. The PRISM project was accompanied by the MICA project, which intended to consolidate VMS and ULTRIX into a single operating system.\nAnother group concluded that new workstations like those from Sun Microsystems and Silicon Graphics would take away a large part of DEC's existing customer base before the new VAX systems could address the issues, and that the company needed its own Unix workstation as soon as possible. Fed up with slow progress on both the RISC and VAX fronts, a group in Palo Alto started a skunkworks project to introduce their own systems. Selecting the MIPS processor, which was widely available, introducing the new DECstation series with the model 3100 on January 11, 1989. These systems would see some success in the market, but were later displaced by similar models running the Alpha.\n32-bit MIPS and 64-bit Alpha systems (1992).\nThe press described DECstation as a defensive product with which DEC would capture some of the inevitable migration of VAX customers to RISC, even as it and comparable products from rivals would greatly increase the migration. Eventually, in 1992, DEC launched the DECchip 21064 processor, the first implementation of their Alpha instruction set architecture, initially named Alpha\u00a0AXP; the \"AXP\" was a \"non-acronym\" and was later dropped. This was a 64-bit RISC architecture as opposed to the 32-bit CISC architecture used in the VAX. It is one of the first \"pure\" 64-bit microprocessor architectures and implementations rather than an extension of an earlier 32-bit architecture. The Alpha offered class-leading performance at its launch and was used in the massively-parallel Cray T3D. Subsequent variants continued that performance trend into the 2000s, along with the Alpha-derived Pentium Pro, II, and III CPUs. An AlphaServer SC45 supercomputer was still ranked No.\u00a06 in the world in November 2004. Alpha-based computers comprising the DEC AXP series, later the AlphaStation, and AlphaServer series respectively superseded both the VAX and MIPS architecture in DEC's product lines. They supported OpenVMS, DEC OSF/1 AXP (later known as Digital Unix or Tru64 UNIX) and Microsoft's then-new operating system, Windows NT, an operating system made possible by ex-Digital Equipment Corporation engineers.\nIn 1998, following the takeover by Compaq Computer Corporation, a decision was made that Microsoft would no longer support and develop Windows NT for the Alpha series computers, a decision that was seen as the beginning of the end for the Alpha series computers.\nStrongARM (1995).\nIn the mid-1990s, Digital Semiconductor collaborated with ARM Limited to produce the StrongARM microprocessor. This was based in part on ARM7 and in part on DEC technologies like Alpha, and was targeted at embedded systems and portable devices. It was highly compatible with the ARMv4 architecture and was very successful, competing effectively against rivals such as the SuperH and MIPS architectures in the personal digital assistant market. Microsoft subsequently dropped support for these other architectures in their Pocket PC platform. In 1997, as part of a lawsuit settlement, the StrongARM intellectual property was sold to Intel. They continued to produce StrongARM, as well as developing it into the XScale architecture. Intel subsequently sold this business to Marvell Technology Group in 2006.\nPalmer's reign (1992\u20131998).\nAt its peak in the late 1980s, DEC had $14 billion in sales and ranked among the most profitable companies in the US. With its strong staff of engineers, DEC was expected to usher in the age of personal computers, but the commonly misunderstood belief then argued by the board to its shareholders was that Mr. Olsen was openly skeptical of the desktop machines, stating \"the personal computer will fall flat on its face in business\", and regarding them as \"toys\" used for playing video games. This was made in 1977 about what could be more characterised as home automation devices.\nThe board forced Olsen to resign as president in July 1992 after two years of losses in operating income. He was replaced by Robert Palmer as the company's president. DEC's board of directors also granted Palmer the title of chief executive officer (\"CEO\"), a title that had never been used during DEC's 35-year existence. Palmer had joined DEC in 1985 to run Semiconductor Engineering and Manufacturing. His relentless campaign to be CEO, and success with the Alpha microprocessor family, made him a candidate to succeed Olsen. At the same time a more modern logo was designed. Alpha was so important to the company that \"PC Week\" wrote of its introduction, \"Beleaguered Digital Equipment Corp. will begin this week what may be the fight of its life\". DEC was, the magazine said, \"undergoing wrenching organization change, including thousands of layoffs\". By then DEC was stating when marketing DECpc that while \"the Digital of yesterday was not known for competitive prices, this new line of PC offerings is competitive in features and price\", and bragging about its more than $1 billion in annual mail order sales.\nPalmer restructured DEC into nine business units that reported directly to him. Nonetheless, DEC continued to suffer record losses, including a loss of $260.5 million for the quarter that ended on September 30, 1992. It reported $2.8 billion in losses for its fiscal year 1992. January 5, 1993, saw the retirement of John F. Smith as senior vice president of operations, the second in command at DEC, and his position was not filled. A 35-year company veteran, he had joined DEC in 1958 as the company's 12th employee, passing up a chance to work for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey to work for DEC. Smith rose to become one of the three senior vice presidents in 1987 and was widely considered among the potential successors to Ken Olsen, especially when Smith was appointed chief operating officer in 1991. Smith became a corporate spokesman on financial issues, and had filled in at trouble spots for which Olsen ordered more attention. Smith was passed over in favor of Palmer when Olsen was forced to resign in July 1992, though Smith stayed on for a time to help turn around the struggling company.\nIn June 1993, Palmer and several of his top lieutenants presented their reorganization plans to applause from the board of directors, and several weeks later DEC reported its first profitable quarter in several years. However, on April 15, 1994, DEC reported a loss of $183 million\u2014three to four times higher than the loss many people on Wall Street had predicted (compared with a loss of $30 million in the comparable period a year earlier), causing the stock price on the NYSE to plunge $5.875 to $23, a 20% drop. The losses at that point totaled $339 million for the current fiscal year. Sales of the VAX, long the company's biggest moneymaker, continued to decline, which in turn also hurt DEC's lucrative service and maintenance business (this made up more than a third of DEC's revenue of $14 billion in the 1993 fiscal year), which declined 11% year over year to $1.5 billion in the most recent quarter.\nWhen Olsen resigned, an industry analyst said \"If Alpha fails, DEC is dead\". Market acceptance of Alpha computers and chips was slower than the company had hoped, even though Alpha's sales for the quarter estimated at $275 million were up significantly from $165 million in the December quarter. DEC had also made a strong push into personal computers and workstations, which had even lower margins than Alpha computers and chips. Also, DEC was playing catchup with its own Unix offerings for client-server networks, as it long emphasized its own VMS software, while corporate computer users based their client-server networks on the industry-standard Unix software (of which Hewlett-Packard was one of the market leaders). DEC's problems were similar to that of larger rival IBM, due to the fundamental shift in the computer industry that made it unlikely that DEC could ever again operate profitably at its former size of 120,000 employees, and while its workforce had been reduced to 92,000 people many analysts expected that they would have to cut another 20,000.\nSelloffs.\nDuring the profitable years up until the early 1990s, DEC was a company that boasted that it never had a general layoff. Following the 1992 economic downturn, layoffs became regular events as the company continually downsized to try to stay afloat. Palmer was tasked with the goal of bringing DEC back to profitability, which he attempted to do by changing the established DEC business culture, hiring new executives from outside the company, and selling off various non-core business units:\nAcquisition by Compaq (1998).\nThrough 1997, DEC began discussions with Compaq on a possible merger. Several years earlier, Compaq had considered a bid for DEC but became seriously interested only after DEC's major divestments and refocusing on the Internet in 1997. At that time, Compaq was making strong moves into the enterprise market, and DEC's multivendor global services organization and customer support centers offered a real opportunity to expand their support and sales worldwide. Compaq was not interested in a number of DEC's product lines, which led to the series of sell-offs. Notable among these was DEC's Hudson Fab, which made most of their custom chips, a market that made little sense to Compaq's \"industry standard\" marketing. DEC had previously sold its semiconductor plant in South Queensferry to Motorola in 1995, with an understanding that Motorola would continue to produce Alpha processors at the facility, along with continuing a two-year foundry agreement with AMD to continue producing the Am486 processor.\nThis led to an interesting solution to the problem of selling off the division for a reasonable profit. In May 1997, DEC sued Intel for allegedly infringing on its Alpha patents in designing the original Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II chips. As part of a settlement, much of DEC's chip design and fabrication business was sold to Intel. This included DEC's StrongARM implementation of the ARM computer architecture, which Intel marketed as the XScale processors commonly used in Pocket PCs. The core of Digital Semiconductor, the Alpha microprocessor group, remained with DEC, while the associated office buildings went to Intel as part of the Hudson fab.\nOn January 26, 1998, what remained of the company was sold to Compaq in what was the largest merger up to that time in the computer industry. At the time of Compaq's acquisition announcement, DEC had a total of 53,500 employees, down from a peak of 130,000 in the 1980s, but it still employed about 65% more people than Compaq to produce about half the volume of sales revenues. After the merger closed, Compaq moved aggressively to reduce DEC's high selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs (equal to 24% of total 1997 revenues) and bring them more in line with Compaq's SG&amp;A expense ratio of 12% of revenues.\nCompaq used the acquisition to move into enterprise services and compete with IBM, and by 2001 services made up over 20% of Compaq's revenues, largely due to the DEC employees inherited from the merger. DEC's own PC manufacturing was discontinued after the merger closed. As Compaq did not wish to compete with one of its key partner suppliers, the remainder of Digital Semiconductor (the Alpha microprocessor group) was sold to Intel, which placed those employees back in their Hudson (Massachusetts) office, which they had vacated when the site was sold to Intel in 1997.\nCompaq struggled as a result of the merger with DEC, and was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2002. Compaq, and later HP, continued to sell many of the former DEC products but re-branded with their own logos. For example, HP now sells what were formerly DEC's StorageWorks disk/tape products, as a result of the Compaq acquisition.\nThe Digital logo was used up until 2004, even after the company ceased to exist, as the logo of Digital GlobalSoft, an IT services company in India (which was a 51% subsidiary of Compaq). Digital GlobalSoft was later renamed \"HP GlobalSoft\" (also known as the \"HP Global Delivery India Center\" or HP GDIC), and no longer uses the Digital logo.\nCompaq transferred the DEC company archives to the Computer History Museum in 2004.\nResearch and people.\nDEC's Research Laboratories (or Research Labs, as they were commonly known) conducted DEC's corporate research. Some of them were continued in operation by Compaq and are still operated by Hewlett-Packard. The laboratories were:\nSome of the former employees of DEC's Research Labs or DEC's R&amp;D in general include:\nSome of the former employees of Digital Equipment Corp were responsible for developing DEC Alpha and StrongARM:\nGrace Hopper worked for Digital Equipment Corporation as a consultant after her retirement from the United States Navy.\nSome of the work of the Research Labs was published in the \"Digital Technical Journal\", which was in published from 1985 until 1998. At least some of the research reports are available online.\nLegacy and accomplishments.\nAs of 2012[ [update]], decades-old hardware (including PDP-11, VAX, and AlphaServer) is being emulated to allow legacy software to run on modern hardware; funding for this is planned to last at least until 2030.\nDEC supported the ANSI standards, especially the ASCII character set, which survives in Unicode and the ISO 8859 character set family. DEC's own Multinational Character Set also had a large influence on ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) and, by extension, Unicode.\nBeyond DECsystem-10/20, PDP, VAX and Alpha, DEC was known for its work in communication subsystem designs, such as Ethernet, DNA (DIGITAL Network Architecture: predominantly DECnet products), DSA (Digital Storage Architecture: disks/tapes/controllers), and its \"dumb terminal\" subsystems including VT100 and DECserver products.\nSoftware.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Plain image with caption/styles.css\"/&gt; \nLogo of Digital Equipment Corporation's Software division \nHardware.\nDECtape.\nOne of the most unusual peripherals produced for the PDP-10 was the DECtape. The DECtape was a length of special 3/4-inch wide magnetic tape wound on 5-inch reels. The recording format was a highly reliable redundant 10-track design using fixed-length numbered data \"blocks\" organized into a standard file structure, including a directory. Files could be written, read, changed, and deleted on a DECtape as though it were a disk drive. For greater efficiency, the DECtape drive could read and write to a DECtape in both directions.\nIn fact, some PDP-10 systems had no disks at all, using DECtapes alone for their primary data storage. The DECtape was also widely used on other PDP models, since it was much easier to use than hand-loading multiple paper tapes. Primitive early time-sharing systems could use DECtapes as system devices and swapping devices. Although superior to paper tape, DECtapes were relatively slow, and were supplanted once reliable disk drives became affordable.\nMagnetic disk storage.\nDEC was both a manufacturer and a buyer of magnetic disk storage, offering more than 100 different models of hard disk drive (HDD) and floppy disk drive (FDD) during its existence. In the 1970s, it was the single largest OEM purchaser of HDDs, procuring from Diablo, Control Data Corporation, Information Storage Systems, and Memorex, among others.\nDEC's first internally developed HDD was the RS08, a 256 kWord fixed-head contact-start-stop drive using plated media; it shipped in 1969.\nBeginning in the 1970s, DEC moved first its HDD manufacturing and then its mass storage development labs to Colorado Springs.\nDEC pioneered a number of HDD technologies, including sampled data servos (RL01, 1977) and serial HDD interfaces (Standard Disk Interconnect, 1983). The last internally developed disk drive family (RA9x series) used plated media, departing from the HDD industry trend to carbon overcoated sputtered media. DEC designated a $400 million investment to bring this product line into production. The RA92 (1.5 GB) was introduced in 1992, using a 14-inch platter.\nDEC purchased its FDDs from OEMs such as Shugart Associates, Toshiba, and Sony.\nRX50.\nThe way the 400\u00a0KB DEC standard RX50 floppy disk drive supported DEC's initial offerings seemed to encapsulate their approach to the personal computer market. Although the mechanical drive hardware was nearly identical to other 5 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444\" floppy disk drives available on competing systems, DEC sought to differentiate their product by using a proprietary disk format for the data written on the disk. The DEC format had a higher capacity for data, but the RX50 drives were incompatible with other PC floppy drives. This required DEC owners to buy higher-priced, specially formatted floppy media, which was harder to obtain through standard distribution channels. DEC attempted to enforce exclusive control over its floppy media sales by copyrighting its proprietary disk format, and requiring a negotiated license agreement and royalty payments from anybody selling compatible media. The proprietary data format meant that RX50 floppies were not interchangeable with other PC floppies, further isolating DEC products from the developing de facto standard PC market. Hardware hackers and DEC enthusiasts eventually reverse-engineered the RX50 format, but the damage had already been done, in terms of market confusion and isolation.\nVideo and Interactive Information Server.\nThe video-on-demand project at DEC started in 1992, following Ken Olsen's retirement. At the time the company was rapidly downsizing under Robert Palmer, and it was difficult to gain funding for any new project. DEC's Interactive Video Information Server architecture gained traction and excelled over those of other companies, in that it was highly scalable, using a gateway to set up interactive video delivery sessions on large numbers of video and information servers. Initially high-end VAXes were used, then Alphas.\nIn 1993 the DEC video-on-demand design team developed a system with a session gateway between the users and a large number of servers. The system was successful in winning video-on-demand trials at US West and other companies. Shortly after the first patent was filed, the session gateway and session gateway and server concept was released to the public domain and proposed in the early Digital Audio Visual Council and MPEG-2 international standards deliberations, with approximately 50 companies attending. The architecture was accepted and voted into the final standards. \nIn 1993 the design team further developed a media client buffer design that used receive-side buffering for media streaming with read and write pointers. This enabled VCR-like features pause, fast forward, and rewind to be performed at the user\u2019s device, e.g. cellphone or laptop, even before the full video was downloaded. This enabled more servers to be allocated to the system, as these features did not always have to be performed at the servers.\nIn 1995 the system, renamed the \u201cVideo and Interactive Information Server\u201d, was upgraded with the capability of providing exponentially more video and information access using using a hierarchy of session gateways, session gateway proxies, and servers.\nWith this 1995 Video and Interactive Information Server design, 333,000 streams were provided by US West to set-top box users, and was used by Adlink to distribute advertising to over two million subscribers.\n The DEC video-on-demand patents portfolio has been cited over 350 times. A Google search in 2025 asking performance improvement of computers from 1995 (the date of this invention) to 2025 yielded 100-1000x performance increase, depending on the usage. Assuming the conservative value of 100x performance, the DEC Video and Interactive Information Server would be able to supply 33 million streams in 2025.\nThe scalability feature allowed it to win contracts for many of the trials in the 1993-97 timeframe, since the system could theoretically accommodate an extremely large amount of video streams and other non-video content.\nThe design was proposed and incorporated into the MPEG-2 international standard (finalized in 1995).\n Its object-oriented interface became the mandatory user-to user core interface in DSM-CC, widely used in video stream and file delivery for MPEG-2 compliant systems, and was carried forward to MPEG-3 compliant systems.\nUser organizations.\nOriginally the users' group was called DECUS (Digital Equipment Computer User Society) during the 1960s to 1990s. When Compaq acquired DEC in 1998, the users group was renamed CUO, the Compaq Users' Organisation. When HP acquired Compaq in 2002, CUO became HP-Interex, although there are still DECUS groups in several countries. In the United States, the organization is represented by the Encompass organization; currently Connect.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The band was one of the defining bands of the American punk scene during its initial eight-year run.\nInitially consisting of lead guitarist East Bay Ray, bassist Klaus Flouride, lead vocalist Jello Biafra, drummer Ted and rhythm guitarist 6025, 6025 left in 1979, and Ted left the following year after the band recorded their acclaimed first album \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\" (1980). The band's longest-serving drummer was D. H. Peligro, who replaced Ted in 1981 and remained until his death in 2022. Dead Kennedys recorded the EP \"In God We Trust Inc.\" (1981), followed by three more studio albums, \"Plastic Surgery Disasters\" (1982), \"Frankenchrist\" (1985), and \"Bedtime for Democracy\" (1986), the latter of which was recorded and released shortly after announcing their breakup in January 1986. Most of the band's recordings were released on Alternative Tentacles, an independent record label founded by Biafra and East Bay Ray.\nFollowing Dead Kennedys' dissolution, Biafra continued to run Alternative Tentacles, and went on to collaborate and record with other artists, including D.O.A., NoMeansNo and his own bands Lard and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, as well as releasing several spoken word performances. In 2000 (upheld on appeal in 2003), Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys bandmates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties. In 2001, the band reformed without Biafra; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties. Although Dead Kennedys have continued to perform over the years, they have not released any more studio albums since \"Bedtime for Democracy\".\nDead Kennedys' lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing political figures and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid-1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, which resulted in a hung jury and also hastened the band's demise.\nHistory.\nFormation of the band (1978\u20131979).\nDead Kennedys were formed in June 1978 in San Francisco, California, when East Bay Ray (Raymond Pepperell) advertised for bandmates in the newspaper \"The Recycler\". The original band lineup consisted of East Bay Ray on lead guitar, Klaus Flouride (Geoffrey Lyall) on bass, Jello Biafra (Eric Reed Boucher) on vocals, Ted (Bruce Slesinger) on drums and 6025 (Carlos Cadona) on rhythm guitar. This lineup recorded their first demos. Their first live show was on July 19, 1978 at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, California. They were the opening act on a bill that included DV8 and Negative Trend with The Offs headlining.\nDead Kennedys played numerous shows at local venues afterward. Due to the provocative name of the band, they sometimes played under pseudonyms, including \"The DK's\", \"The Sharks\", \"The Creamsicles\" and \"The Pink Twinkies\". \"San Francisco Chronicle\" columnist Herb Caen wrote in November 1978, \"Just when you think tastelessness has reached its nadir, along comes a punk rock group called 'The Dead Kennedys', which will play at Mabuhay Gardens on Nov. 22, the 15th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination.\" Despite mounting protests, the owner of Mabuhay declared, \"I can't cancel them NOW\u2014there's a contract. Not, apparently, the kind of contract some people have in mind.\" However, despite popular belief, the name was not meant to insult the Kennedy family, but according to Ray, \"the assassinations were in much more poor taste than our band. We actually respect the Kennedy family. . . . When JFK was assassinated, when Martin Luther King was assassinated, when RFK was assassinated, the American Dream was assassinated. . . . Our name is actually homage to the American Dream\".\n6025 left the band in March 1979 under somewhat unclear circumstances, generally considered to be musical differences. In June, the band released their first single, \"California \u00dcber Alles\", on Biafra and East Bay Ray's independent label, Alternative Tentacles. The band followed with a poorly attended East Coast tour, being a new and fairly unknown band at the time, without a full album release.\n\"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\" (1980\u20131981).\nIn early 1980, they recorded and released the single \"Holiday in Cambodia\". In June, the band recorded their debut album, \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\", released in September of that year on the UK label Cherry Red. The album reached number 33 on the UK Albums Chart. Since its initial release, it has been re-released by several other labels, including IRS, Alternative Tentacles, and Cleopatra. The 2005 reissue\u2014the special 25th-anniversary edition\u2014features the original artwork and a bonus 55-minute DVD documenting the making of the album as well as the band's early years.\nOn March 25, 1980, Dead Kennedys were invited to perform at the Bay Area Music Awards in an effort to give the event some \"new wave credibility\", in the words of the organizers. The day of the performance was spent practicing the song they were asked to play, the underground hit \"California \u00fcber alles\". The band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song, Biafra stopped the band\u2014in a manner reminiscent of Elvis Costello's \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance\u2014and said, \"Hold it! We've gotta prove that we're adults now. We're not a punk rock band, we're a new wave band.\" The band, all wearing white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing a new song titled \"Pull My Strings\", a barbed, satirical attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry, which contained the lyrics, \"Is my cock big enough, is my brain small enough, for you to make me a star?\". The song also referenced The Knack's song \"My Sharona\". \"Pull My Strings\" was never recorded for a studio release, though the performance at the Bay Area Music Awards, which was one of only two times that the song was ever performed, was released on the band's 1987 compilation album \"Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death\". In a 2017 interview about the show Klaus stated, \"We did one other performance of it at The Mabuhay and that was the only other time we performed it... like within a week of the Bammies\" It\u2019s unknown if this performance was ever recorded.\nIn January 1981, Ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement. He played his last concert in February 1981. His replacement was D.\u00a0H. Peligro (Darren Henley). Around the same time, East Bay Ray had tried to pressure the rest of the band to sign to the major record label Polydor Records; Biafra stated that he was prepared to leave the group if the rest of the band wanted to sign to the label, though East Bay Ray asserts that he recommended against signing with Polydor. Polydor decided not to sign the band after they learned that Dead Kennedys' next single was to be entitled \"Too Drunk to Fuck\".\nWhen \"Too Drunk to Fuck\" came out in May 1981 it caused controversy in the UK, as the BBC feared the single would reach the Top 30, which would necessitate its title being mentioned on \"Top of the Pops\". It was never played, although it was simply called \"'Too Drunk' by the Kennedys\" by presenter Tony Blackburn.\n\"In God We Trust, Inc.\", \"Plastic Surgery Disasters\" and Alternative Tentacles Records (1981\u20131985).\nAfter Peligro joined the band, the extended play \"In God We Trust, Inc.\" (1981) saw them move toward a more aggressive hardcore/thrash sound. In addition to the EP's controversial artwork depicting a gold Christ figure on a cross of dollar bills, the lyrics contained Biafra's most biting social and political commentary yet, and songs such as \"Moral Majority\", \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off!\" and \"We've Got a Bigger Problem Now\" placed Dead Kennedys as the spokesmen of social protest, while \"Dog Bite\", a cover version of \"Rawhide\" and various joke introductions showed a much more whimsical side. In 1982, they released their second studio album, \"Plastic Surgery Disasters\". The album's cover features a withered starving African child's hand being held and dwarfed by a white man's hand, a picture that had won the World Press Photo award in 1980, taken in Karamoja district in Uganda by Mike Wells.\nThe band's music had evolved considerably in a short time, moving away from hardcore formulae toward a more innovative jazz-informed style, featuring musicianship and dynamics far beyond other bands in the genre (thus effectively removing the music from that genre). By now the group had become a de facto political force, pitting itself against rising elements of American social and political life such as the religious right, Ronald Reagan and the idle rich. The band continued touring all over the United States, as well as Europe and Australia, and gained a large underground following. While they continued to play live shows during 1983 and 1984, they took a break from releasing new records to concentrate on the Alternative Tentacles record label, which would become synonymous with DIY alternative culture. The band continued to write and perform new material during this time, which would appear on their next album (some of these early performances can be seen in the \"DMPO's on Broadway\" video, originally released by Dirk Dirksen and later reissued on Rhino).\n\"Frankenchrist\" and obscenity trial (1985\u20131986).\nThe release of the album \"Frankenchrist\" in 1985 showed the band had grown in musical proficiency and lyrical maturity. While there were still a number of loud/fast songs, much of the music featured an eclectic mix of instruments including trumpets and synthesizers. Around this time Klaus Flouride released the similarly experimental solo EP \"Cha Cha Cha With Mr. Flouride\". Lyrically, the band continued their trademark social commentary, with songs such as \"MTV Get Off The Air\" and \"Jock-O-Rama (Invasion of the Beef Patrol)\" poking fun at mainstream America.\nHowever, the controversy that erupted over H.R. Giger's \"Penis Landscape\", included as an insert with the album, dwarfed the notoriety of its music. The artwork caused a furor with the newly formed Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). In December 1985 a teenage girl purchased the album at the Wherehouse Records store in Los Angeles County. The girl's mother wrote letters of complaint to the California Attorney General and to Los Angeles prosecutors. In June 1986, members of the band, along with other parties involved in the distribution of \"Frankenchrist\", were charged criminally with distribution of harmful matter to minors. The store where the teen actually purchased the album was never named in the lawsuit. The criminal charges focused on an illustration by H.R. Giger, titled \"Work 219: Landscape XX\" (also known as \"Penis Landscape\"). Included as a poster with the album, \"Penis Landscape\" depicts nine copulating penises and vaginas.\nMembers of the band and others in the chain of distribution were charged with violating the California Penal Code on a misdemeanor charge carrying a maximum penalty of up to a year in county jail and a base fine of up to $2,000. Biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home. The prosecution tried to present the poster to the jury in isolation for consideration as obscene material, but Judge Susan Isacoff ruled that the poster must be considered along with the music and lyrics. The charges against three of the original defendants, Ruth Schwartz (owner of Mordam Records), Steve Boudreau (a distributor involved in supplying \"Frankenchrist\" to the Los Angeles Wherehouse store), and Salvatore Alberti (owner of the factory where the record was pressed), were dismissed for lack of evidence.\nIn August 1987, the case went to the jury with two remaining defendants: Jello Biafra and Michael Bonanno (former Alternative Tentacles label manager). However, the criminal trial ended with a hung jury, split 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal. District Attorneys Michael Guarino and Ira Riener made a motion for a retrial which was denied by Judge Isacoff, Superior Court Judge for the County of Los Angeles. The album, however, was banned from many record stores nationwide.\nAfter the break up of the band, Jello Biafra brought up the court case on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". Biafra was on the show with Tipper Gore as part of a panel discussion on the issues of \"controversial music lyrics\" and censorship.\n\"Bedtime for Democracy\" and break-up (1986).\nIn addition to the obscenity lawsuit, the band became increasingly disillusioned with the underground scene as well. The hardcore scene, which had been a haven for free-thinking intellectuals and downtrodden nonconformists, was attracting a more violent audience that imposed an increasing level of brutality on other concertgoers and began to alienate many of the bands and individuals who had helped pioneer the movement in the early 1980s. In earlier years the band had criticized neo-Nazi skinheads for trying to ruin the punk scene, but just as big a problem was the popularity of increasingly macho hardcore bands, which brought the group (and their genre) an audience that had little to do with the ideas/ideals they stood for. Biafra penned new songs such as \"Chickenshit Conformist\" and \"Anarchy for Sale\" that articulated the band's feelings about the \"dumbing down\" of punk rock. During the summer they recorded these for their final album, \"Bedtime for Democracy\", which was released in November. The artwork, depicting a defaced Statue of Liberty overrun with Nazis, media, opportunists, Klan members, corrupt government officials, and religious zombies, echoed the idea that neither America itself nor the punk scene were safe havens any more for \"your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free\". The album contains a number of fast/short songs interspersed with jazz (\"D.M.S.O.\"), spoken word (\"A Commercial\") and psychedelia (\"Cesspools In Eden\").\nThe band decided to split up in January 1986, prior to the recording and release of \"Bedtime for Democracy\", and played their last live show with the original lineup on 21 February. Biafra went on to speak about his political beliefs on numerous television shows and he released a number of spoken-word albums. Ray, Flouride, and Peligro also went on to solo careers. As of 2025, it remains the band's final studio album.\nBand reformation and death of Peligro (2001\u2013present).\nIn 2001, Ray, Peligro, and Flouride reformed the Dead Kennedys, with former Dr. Know singer Brandon Cruz replacing Biafra on vocals. The band played under the name \"DK Kennedys\" for a few concerts, but later reverted to \"Dead Kennedys\" permanently. They played across the continental United States, Europe, Asia, South America, and Russia. Brandon Cruz left the band in May 2003 and was replaced by Jeff Penalty. The band has released two live albums of archival performances on Manifesto Records: \"Mutiny on the Bay\", compiled from various live shows including a recording from their last show with Biafra in 1986, and \"Live at the Deaf Club\", a recording of a 1979 performance at the Deaf Club in San Francisco which was greeted with more enthusiasm.\nOn October 9, 2007, a best of album titled \"Milking the Sacred Cow\" was released. It includes two previously unreleased live versions of \"Soup Is Good Food\" and \"Jock-O-Rama\", originally found on \"Frankenchrist\".\nJeff Penalty left the band in March 2008 in what he describes as a \"not amicable split.\" In a statement released, Jeff said that, following a series of disputes, the band had secretly recruited a new singer and played a gig in his neighbourhood, although he also stated he was \"really proud of what we were able to accomplish with Dead Kennedys\". He was replaced by former Wynona Riders singer Ron \"Skip\" Greer. D.\u00a0H. Peligro also left the band to \"take some personal time off\". He was replaced for a tour by Translator drummer Dave Scheff.\nOn August 21, 2008, the band announced an extended break from touring due to the health-related issues of Flouride and Peligro. They stated their plans to collaborate on new projects. The band performed a gig in Santa Rosa, California in June 2009, with Peligro returning to the drum kit.\nIn August 2010, Dead Kennedys announced plans for a short East Coast tour. The lineup assembled for this tour contained East Bay Ray, Peligro, Greer, and bassist Greg Reeves replacing Flouride, who was taking \"personal time off\" from the band. The tour dates included performances in Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Maine and Hawaii. The band has played a reworked version of their song \"MTV Get Off the Air\", re-titled \"MP3 Get Off the Web\", with lyrics criticizing music piracy during their October 16, 2010, concert at the Rock and Roll Hotel in Washington, D.C.\nDead Kennedys had world tours in 2013 and in 2014, the latter mostly in North American cities. In 2015 and 2016 they toured again, including South America, where they had not played since 2001.\nIn 2017, East Bay Ray revealed that the band and Jello Biafra had been approached by the Punk-oriented music festival Riot Fest about a potential reunion. While Ray and the rest of the band expressed interest in the concept, Biafra refused.\nOn April 26, 2019, the group released \"DK40\", a live compilation album celebrating 40 years since the band formed.\nOn October 28, 2022, D.H. Peligro died from an overdose of heroin and fentanyl, although it was initially believed to have been from possible head trauma from a fall at his home that day. Since Peligro's death, the band has performed in the UK with Santi Guardiola and the United States with Steve Wilson (who had played in D. H. Peligro's band Peligro before) filling in on drums.\nConflicts between members.\nRoyalties lawsuit.\nIn the late 1990s, former band members discovered they were being underpaid in terms of royalties from Alternative Tentacles. East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride, and D.\u00a0H. Peligro claimed that Jello Biafra had conspired to pay them lower royalty rates and then attempted to disguise the precise nature of the money owed. Biafra claimed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake.\nIn 1998, the other three members of the band sued Biafra over these allegedly unpaid royalties. A jury ruled in their favor in May 2000, finding Biafra and Alternative Tentacles \"guilty of malice, oppression and fraud\". Malice was defined for the jury as \"conduct which is intended to cause injury or despicable conduct which is carried with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights of others\". Biafra's appeal was denied in June 2003; he had to pay the outstanding royalties as well as punitive damages, and was forced to hand over the rights to the majority of Dead Kennedys' back catalogue to the Decay Music partnership.\nThis dispute caused minor waves within punk circles. Biafra claims that East Bay Ray had long expressed displeasure with Alternative Tentacles and with the amount of money he received from them, thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments. It was found out that Alternative Tentacles was paying Dead Kennedys less per CD than all the other bands, including Biafra himself, and not informing his other bandmates, which was the fraud. Biafra accused the band of wanting to license the famous Dead Kennedys song \"Holiday in Cambodia\" for use in a Levi's jeans commercial, which the band denied. However, an instrumental loop from \"Holiday in Cambodia\" was part of the 1981 black comedy feature film \"Neighbors\", though it was not included on the soundtrack. The band maintains that the Levi's story was completely fictitious and invented by Biafra to discredit them.\nDisputes over new commercial activities.\nMatters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited Jello Biafra to \"bury the hatchet\" in the form of a band reunion. Jello Biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly. In addition, Biafra was dismissive of the reunion, and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular, argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed.\nSeveral DVDs, re-issues, and live albums have been released since the departure of Biafra most recently on Manifesto Records. According to Biafra, the live albums are \"cash-ins\" on Dead Kennedys' name and his music. Biafra also accused the releases of the new live material of having poor sound quality. Furthermore, he has stated he is not receiving any royalties from the sale of any Manifesto Records releases. Consequently, he has discouraged fans from buying any Dead Kennedy reissues. The other band members denied Biafra's accusations regarding the live releases, and have defended the mixes as an effort of hard work. Biafra dismissed the new group as \"the world's greediest karaoke band.\" Nevertheless, in 2003, Klaus Flouride said of performances without the band's former frontman: \"There hasn't been a show yet that people didn't really like.\"\nBiafra further criticized them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original 1980s incarnation of the band, which he labeled as false advertising. He attacked the reformed Dead Kennedys in a song called \"Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)\", which appears on his second collaboration with sludge metal band the Melvins, \"Sieg Howdy!\"\nBiafra told an audience at a speaking gig in Trenton, New Jersey, that the remaining Dead Kennedys have licensed their single \"Too Drunk to Fuck\" to be used in a rape scene in a Robert Rodriguez movie. The reference is to a lounge cover of the song, recorded by the band Nouvelle Vague, played during a scene in the \"Planet Terror\" segment of \"Grindhouse\", although no rape takes place, and in fact the would-be rapist is killed by the would-be victim. The scene in \"Planet Terror\" has would-be rapist, \"Rapist No.\u00a01\" (Quentin Tarantino) order one-legged stripper \"Cherry Darlin\" (Rose McGowan) to get up off the floor and dance. At this point Tarantino hits play on a cassette recorder and Nouvelle Vague's cover of \"Too Drunk To Fuck\" plays. Biafra, disapproving of the situation, later wrote, \"This is their lowest point since Levi's... This goes against everything the Dead Kennedys stands for in spades... The terrified woman later 'wins' by killing Tarantino, but that excuse does not rescue this at all. I wrote every note of that song and this is not what it was meant for... Some people will do anything for money. I can't help but think back to how prudish Klaus Flouride was when he objected to H. R. Giger's painting on the \"Frankenchrist\" (sic) poster, saying he couldn't bear to show it to his parents. I'd sure love to be a fly on the wall when he tries to explain putting a song in a rape scene for money to his teenage daughter... The deal was pushed through by a new business manager the other three hired.\"\nThe reformed Dead Kennedys followed their court victory by releasing reissues of all Dead Kennedys albums (except \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\", to which they did not have the rights until 2005), releasing several new archival concert DVDs, and licensing several songs to \"The Manchurian Candidate\" remake and the \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\" video game. East Bay Ray claims he received a fax from Alternative Tentacles purporting Biafra approved the licensing for the game.\nThe band claims on their website that they still pay close attention to an anti-corporate ideology, despite performing on September 5, 2003, at a festival in Turkey that was sponsored by Coca-Cola, noting that they have since pulled out of a show in Los Angeles when they found that it was being sponsored by Coors. However, Biafra claims the previous licensing deals prove otherwise.\nIn a May 2025 interview with Guitar World, East Bay Ray discussed a potential reunion with Jello Biafra saying that he and Klaus Fluoride were open to a reunion however it would never happen and that Biafra was to blame. He said that over the years lucrative offers such as one in 2017 from Riot Fest were proposed to the band but Biafra was against it. \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue for me or Klaus. It\u2019s Biafra that turns down any offers for us to do something; we don\u2019t have any problem.\u201d East Bay Ray went on criticize Biafra's post Dead Kennedys career and how Biafra took credit for writing most of the band's songs in which he took exception to Biafra's claims by saying \u201cWe actually wrote as a band, where in effect, due to the chemistry between us, it was a case of two and two equaling five. None of us has had a solo career that was bigger than Dead Kennedys, which, to me, shows the power of a bunch of talented people getting together and creating something that was far greater than the sum of its parts. Jello didn\u2019t bring in the songs. I know he\u2019s created the myth that he wrote them all, but the question here is that if he did, why didn\u2019t he ever do anything significant after leaving the band?,\u201d adding, \u201cIggy left the Stooges and had a career; ditto Lou Reed with the Velvet Underground or Morrissey with the Smiths. Where\u2019s Biafra\u2019s solo career with a bunch of great songs? The songs were written in numerous different ways. \u201cHoliday in Cambodia\u201d started as a jam in the rehearsal studio\u201d he said.\nBiafra, in a 2012 interview with the \"Tampa Bay Times\", stated he was not happy with the current direction of his former bandmates, nor did he want to restart the Dead Kennedys for nostalgia purposes:\nWe haven't talked in a dozen years. In their hearts they've become Republicans and I just wouldn't do something like that unless we can bring back the real thing. In a way getting me back into the band would be their worst nightmare, like make them rehearse. When people tell me that I owe it to the fans to regurgitate nothing but old music with the people I used to play with, that's totally the opposite of what punk and Dead Kennedys means to me. The true spirit of the whole thing is to keep going, keep moving and make more new stuff. Nobody was more cynical than the original punks about nostalgia and retro because of all the rage on TV and people started to get nostalgic in goofy ass ways for the sixties and they were thinking, \"Yeah, that will never happen to us.\" That's not what I'm here for, sorry. It's not as if the people who come to the Guantanamo School of Medicine shows wanting nothing but old Dead Kennedys songs don't leave with a smile on their face once they've heard the new songs. It's not like I've forgot how to write this shit.\nArtistry.\nMusic and lyrics.\nDead Kennedys have been described as one of the first hardcore punk bands. They were noted for the harshness of their lyrics, which generally combined biting social satire while expressing a staunchly left-wing view of contemporary America. Unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering, Dead Kennedys' lyrics were often snide. For example, \"Holiday in Cambodia\" is a multi-layered satire targeting both yuppies and Cambodia's recently deposed Khmer Rouge regime. Or, on \"Jock-O-Rama\", featured on \"Frankenchrist\", they mock southern small towns whose residents\u2019 lives revolve around high school football.\nLogo.\nThe original logo was created by Winston Smith. He later contributed artwork for the covers of \"In God We Trust, Inc.\", \"Plastic Surgery Disasters\", \"Frankenchrist\", \"Bedtime for Democracy\", \"Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death\", the back cover of the \"Kill the Poor\" single and the Alternative Tentacles logo. When asked about the \"DK\" logo in an interview, Jello Biafra explained, \"...I wanted to make sure it was something simple and easy to spray-paint so people would graffiti it all over the place, and then I showed it to Winston Smith. He played around with it, came back with a bunch of designs that had the circle and slightly 3-D looking letters and he had ones with different patterns behind it. I liked the one with bricks, but ultimately I thought simple red behind it was the boldest and the best.\"\nInfluence.\nDead Kennedys have influenced multiple acts such as System of a Down, Green Day, Faith No More, Rage Against the Machine, Sepultura, Descendents, Bad Religion, Slayer, X, Minutemen, The Hives, Saves the Day and Screeching Weasel among others.\nMembers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7955", "revid": "43866522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7955", "title": "DNA", "text": "Molecule that carries genetic information\n \nDeoxyribonucleic acid (; DNA) is a polymer composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix. The polymer carries genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are nucleic acids. Alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), nucleic acids are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life.\nThe two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides as they are composed of simpler monomeric units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases (cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T]), a sugar called deoxyribose, and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds (known as the phosphodiester linkage) between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, the single-ringed pyrimidines and the double-ringed purines. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.\nBoth strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological information. This information is replicated when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences. The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (or \"bases\"). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription, where DNA bases are exchanged for their corresponding bases except in the case of thymine (T), for which RNA substitutes uracil (U). Under the genetic code, these RNA strands specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.\nWithin eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called chromosomes. Before typical cell division, these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of DNA replication, providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi and protists) store most of their DNA inside the cell nucleus as nuclear DNA, and some in the mitochondria as mitochondrial DNA or in chloroplasts as chloroplast DNA. In contrast, prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) store their DNA only in the cytoplasm, in circular chromosomes. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, chromatin proteins, such as histones, compact and organize DNA. These compacting structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nProperties.\nDNA is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides. The structure of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled around the same axis, and have the same pitch of . The pair of chains have a radius of . According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured wide, and one nucleotide unit measured long. The buoyant density of most DNA is 1.7g/cm3.\nDNA does not usually exist as a single strand, but instead as a pair of strands that are held tightly together. These two long strands coil around each other, in the shape of a double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside, and a base linked to a sugar and to one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A biopolymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.\nThe backbone of the DNA strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar groups. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These are known as the 3\u2032-end (three prime end), and 5\u2032-end (five prime end) carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a glycosidic bond.\nTherefore, any DNA strand normally has one end at which there is a phosphate group attached to the 5\u2032 carbon of a ribose (the 5\u2032 phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl group attached to the 3\u2032 carbon of a ribose (the 3\u2032 hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a nucleic acid double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime end (5\u2032 ), and three prime end (3\u2032), with the 5\u2032 end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3\u2032 end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the related pentose sugar ribose in RNA.\nThe DNA double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces: hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among aromatic nucleobases. The four bases found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). These four bases are attached to the sugar-phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate. Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine, forming A-T and G-C base pairs.\nNucleobase classification.\nThe nucleobases are classified into two types: the purines, A and G, which are fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the six-membered rings C and T. A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.\nNon-canonical bases.\nModified bases occur in DNA. The first of these recognized was 5-methylcytosine, which was found in the genome of \"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\" in 1925. The reason for the presence of these noncanonical bases in bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses. Modifications of the bases cytosine and adenine, the more common and modified DNA bases, play vital roles in the epigenetic control of gene expression in plants and animals.\nA number of noncanonical bases are known to occur in DNA. Most of these are modifications of the canonical bases plus uracil.\nGrooves.\nTwin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. The major groove is wide, while the minor groove is in width. Due to the larger width of the major groove, the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove. This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell \"(see below)\", but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in width that would be seen if the DNA was twisted back into the ordinary B form.\nBase pairing.\nTop, a GC base pair with three hydrogen bonds. Bottom, an AT base pair with two hydrogen bonds. Non-covalent hydrogen bonds between the pairs are shown as dashed lines.\nIn a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary base pairing. Purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix (from six-carbon ring to six-carbon ring) is called a Watson-Crick base pair. DNA with high GC-content is more stable than DNA with low GC-content. A Hoogsteen base pair (hydrogen bonding the 6-carbon ring to the 5-carbon ring) is a rare variation of base-pairing. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As a result of this base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in organisms.\nssDNA vs. dsDNA.\nMost DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart\u2014a process known as melting\u2014to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperatures, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).\nThe stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the melting temperature (also called \"Tm\" value), which is the temperature at which 50% of the double-strand molecules are converted to single-strand molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have more strongly interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have more weakly interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.\nIn the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the melting temperature \"Tm\" necessary to break half of the hydrogen bonds. When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.\nAmount.\nIn humans, the total female diploid nuclear genome per cell extends for 6.37 Gigabase pairs (Gbp), is 208.23\u00a0cm long and weighs 6.51 picograms (pg). Male values are 6.27 Gbp, 205.00\u00a0cm, 6.41 pg. Each DNA polymer can contain hundreds of millions of nucleotides, such as in chromosome 1. Chromosome 1 is the largest human chromosome with approximately 220 million base pairs, and would be long if straightened.\nIn eukaryotes, in addition to nuclear DNA, there is also mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) which encodes certain proteins used by the mitochondria. The mtDNA is usually relatively small in comparison to the nuclear DNA. For example, the human mitochondrial DNA forms closed circular molecules, each of which contains 16,569 DNA base pairs, with each such molecule normally containing a full set of the mitochondrial genes. Each human mitochondrion contains, on average, approximately 5 such mtDNA molecules. Each human cell contains approximately 100 mitochondria, giving a total number of mtDNA molecules per human cell of approximately 500. However, the amount of mitochondria per cell also varies by cell type, and an egg cell can contain 100,000 mitochondria, corresponding to up to 1,500,000 copies of the mitochondrial genome (constituting up to 90% of the DNA of the cell).\nSense and antisense.\nA DNA sequence is called a \"sense\" sequence if it is the same as that of a messenger RNA copy that is translated into protein. The sequence on the opposite strand is called the \"antisense\" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear. One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating gene expression through RNA-RNA base pairing.\nA few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.\nSupercoiling.\nDNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called DNA supercoiling. With DNA in its \"relaxed\" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound. If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by enzymes called topoisomerases. These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as transcription and DNA replication.\nAlternative DNA structures.\nDNA exists in many possible conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts depends on the hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, and the presence of polyamines in solution.\nThe first published reports of A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns\u2014and also B-DNA\u2014used analyses based on Patterson functions that provided only a limited amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA. An alternative analysis was proposed by Wilkins \"et al.\" in 1953 for the \"in vivo\" B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions. In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X-ray diffraction patterns to suggest that the structure was a double helix.\nAlthough the \"B-DNA form\" is most common under the conditions found in cells, it is not a well-defined conformation but a family of related DNA conformations that occur at the high hydration levels present in cells. Their corresponding X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns are characteristic of molecular paracrystals with a significant degree of disorder.\nCompared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider right-handed spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological conditions in partly dehydrated samples of DNA, while in the cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, the opposite of the more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.\nAlternative DNA chemistry.\nFor many years, exobiologists have proposed the existence of a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium GFAJ-1 was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of arsenic into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.\nQuadruplex structures.\nAt the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3\u2032 ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.\nThese guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases, known as a guanine tetrad, form a flat plate. These flat four-base units then stack on top of each other to form a stable G-quadruplex structure. These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and chelation of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit. Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.\nIn addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins. At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This triple-stranded structure is called a displacement loop or D-loop.\nBranched DNA.\nBranched DNA can form networks containing multiple branches.\nIn DNA, fraying occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.\nArtificial bases.\nSeveral artificial nucleobases have been synthesized, and successfully incorporated in the eight-base DNA analogue named Hachimoji DNA. Dubbed S, B, P, and Z, these artificial bases are capable of bonding with each other in a predictable way (S\u2013B and P\u2013Z), maintain the double helix structure of DNA, and be transcribed to RNA. Their existence could be seen as an indication that there is nothing special about the four natural nucleobases that evolved on Earth. On the other hand, DNA is tightly related to RNA which does not only act as a transcript of DNA but also performs as molecular machines many tasks in cells. For this purpose it has to fold into a structure. It has been shown that to allow to create all possible structures at least four bases are required for the corresponding RNA, while a higher number is also possible but this would be against the natural principle of least effort.\nAcidity.\nThe phosphate groups of DNA give it similar acidic properties to phosphoric acid and it can be considered as a strong acid. It will be fully ionized at a normal cellular pH, releasing protons which leave behind negative charges on the phosphate groups. These negative charges protect DNA from breakdown by hydrolysis by repelling nucleophiles which could hydrolyze it.\nMacroscopic appearance.\nPure DNA extracted from cells forms white, stringy clumps.\nChemical modifications and altered DNA packaging.\nBase modifications and DNA packaging.\nStructure of cytosine with and without the 5-methyl group. Deamination converts 5-methylcytosine into thymine.\nThe expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called chromatin. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of methylation of cytosine bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the histone protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see Chromatin remodeling). There is, further, crosstalk between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.\nFor one example, cytosine methylation produces 5-methylcytosine, which is important for X-inactivation of chromosomes. The average level of methylation varies between organisms\u2014the worm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" lacks cytosine methylation, while vertebrates have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine. Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can deaminate to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to mutations. Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the brain, and the glycosylation of uracil to produce the \"J-base\" in kinetoplastids.\nDamage.\nDNA can be damaged by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include oxidizing agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced depends on the type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.\nMany mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called \"intercalation\". Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, and in the case of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzo[\"a\"]pyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.\nBiological functions.\nDNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In an alternative fashion, a cell may copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.\nGenes and genomes.\nGenomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called DNA condensation, to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the cell nucleus, with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its genotype. A gene is a unit of heredity and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an open reading frame that can be transcribed, and regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers, which control transcription of the open reading frame.\nIn many species, only a small fraction of the total sequence of the genome encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding exons, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding repetitive sequences. The reasons for the presence of so much noncoding DNA in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in genome size, or \"C-value\", among species, represent a long-standing puzzle known as the \"C-value enigma\". However, some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional non-coding RNA molecules, which are involved in the regulation of gene expression.\nSome noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes. Telomeres and centromeres typically contain few genes but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes. An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation. These sequences are usually just molecular fossils, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material for the creation of new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence.\nTranscription and translation.\nA gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called \"codons\" formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g., ACT, CAG, TTT).\nIn transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by RNA polymerase. This RNA copy is then decoded by a ribosome that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to transfer RNA, which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43\u00a0combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAG, TAA, and TGA codons, (UAG, UAA, and UGA on the mRNA).\nReplication.\nCell division is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.\nExtracellular nucleic acids.\nNaked extracellular DNA (eDNA), most of it released by cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may be as high as 2 \u03bcg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 \u03bcg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.\nCell-free fetal DNA is found in the blood of the mother, and can be sequenced to determine a great deal of information about the developing fetus.\nUnder the name of environmental DNA eDNA has seen increased use in the natural sciences as a survey tool for ecology, monitoring the movements and presence of species in water, air, or on land, and assessing an area's biodiversity.\nInteractions with proteins.\nAll the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.\nDNA-binding proteins.\nStructural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter the strength of the interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.\nA distinct group of DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.\nIn contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription. Alternatively, transcription factors can bind enzymes that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.\nAs these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes. Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the signal transduction processes that control responses to environmental changes or cellular differentiation and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to \"read\" the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.\nDNA-modifying enzymes.\nNucleases and ligases.\nNucleases are enzymes that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5\u2032-GATATC-3\u2032 and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect bacteria against phage infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the restriction modification system. In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in molecular cloning and DNA fingerprinting.\nEnzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands. Ligases are particularly important in lagging strand DNA replication, as they join the short segments of DNA produced at the replication fork into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in DNA repair and genetic recombination.\nTopoisomerases and helicases.\nTopoisomerases are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.\nHelicases are proteins that are a type of molecular motor. They use the chemical energy in nucleoside triphosphates, predominantly adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands. These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.\nPolymerases.\nPolymerases are enzymes that synthesize polynucleotide chains from nucleoside triphosphates. The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains\u2014which are called \"templates\". These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3\u2032 hydroxyl group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. In the active site of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.\nIn DNA replication, DNA-dependent DNA polymerases make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a proofreading activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exonuclease activity is activated and the incorrect base removed. In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the replisome that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the DNA clamp or helicases.\nRNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which is required for the replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.\nTranscription is carried out by a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.\nGenetic recombination.\nStructure of the Holliday junction intermediate in genetic recombination. The four separate DNA strands are coloured red, blue, green and yellow.\nA DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called \"chromosome territories\". This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in chromosomal crossover which occurs during sexual reproduction, when genetic recombination occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.\nRecombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins. Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.\nThe most common form of chromosomal crossover is homologous recombination, where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. Non-homologous recombination can be damaging to cells, as it can produce chromosomal translocations and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as recombinases, such as RAD51. The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an endonuclease or damage to the DNA. A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one Holliday junction, in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA. Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north\u2013south cleavage. The north\u2013south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east\u2013west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.\nEvolution.\nDNA contains the genetic information that allows all forms of life to function, grow and reproduce. However, it is unclear how long in the 4-billion-year history of life DNA has performed this function, as it has been proposed that the earliest forms of life may have used RNA as their genetic material. RNA may have acted as the central part of early cell metabolism as it can both transmit genetic information and carry out catalysis as part of ribozymes. This ancient RNA world where nucleic acid would have been used for both catalysis and genetics may have influenced the evolution of the current genetic code based on four nucleotide bases. This would occur, since the number of different bases in such an organism is a trade-off between a small number of bases increasing replication accuracy and a large number of bases increasing the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes. However, there is no direct evidence of ancient genetic systems, as recovery of DNA from most fossils is impossible because DNA survives in the environment for less than one million years, and slowly degrades into short fragments in solution. Claims for older DNA have been made, most notably a report of the isolation of a viable bacterium from a salt crystal 250 million years old, but these claims are controversial.\nBuilding blocks of DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also been formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have been formed in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.\nAncient DNA has been recovered from ancient organisms at a timescale where genome evolution can be directly observed, including from extinct organisms up to millions of years old, such as the woolly mammoth.\nUses in technology.\nGenetic engineering.\nMethods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in recombinant DNA technology. Recombinant DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.\nDNA profiling.\nForensic scientists can use DNA in blood, semen, skin, saliva or hair found at a crime scene to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator. This process is formally termed DNA profiling, also called \"DNA fingerprinting\". In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as short tandem repeats and minisatellites, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA. However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people. DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir Alec Jeffreys, and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 Enderby murders case.\nThe development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.\nDNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents, bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.\nDNA profiling is also used in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Usually DNA sequencing are carried out after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.\nDNA enzymes or catalytic DNA.\nDeoxyribozymes, also called DNAzymes or catalytic DNA, were first discovered in 1994. They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated from a large pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction. The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which have been used to detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific). The NaA43 DNAzyme, which is reported to be more than 10,000-fold selective for sodium over other metal ions, was used to make a real-time sodium sensor in cells.\nBioinformatics.\nBioinformatics involves the development of techniques to store, data mine, search and manipulate biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science, especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database theory. String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can shed light on the evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.\nDNA nanotechnology.\nDNA nanotechnology uses the unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information. This has led to the creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the \"DNA origami\" method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins. DNA and other nucleic acids are the basis of aptamers, synthetic oligonucleotide ligands for specific target molecules used in a range of biotechnology and biomedical applications.\nHistory and anthropology.\nBecause DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This can be used in studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology.\nInformation storage.\nDNA as a storage device for information has enormous potential since it has much higher storage density compared to electronic devices. However, high costs, slow read and write times (memory latency), and insufficient reliability has prevented its practical use.\nHistory.\nDNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher who, in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages. As it resided in the nuclei of cells, he called it \"nuclein\". In 1878, Albrecht Kossel isolated the non-protein component of \"nuclein\", nucleic acid, and later isolated its five primary nucleobases.\nIn 1909, Phoebus Levene identified the base, sugar, and phosphate nucleotide unit of RNA (then named \"yeast nucleic acid\"). In 1929, Levene identified deoxyribose sugar in \"thymus nucleic acid\" (DNA). Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of four nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups (\"tetranucleotide hypothesis\"). Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order. In 1927, Nikolai Koltsov proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a \"giant hereditary molecule\" made up of \"two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template\". In 1928, Frederick Griffith in his experiment discovered that traits of the \"smooth\" form of \"Pneumococcus\" could be transferred to the \"rough\" form of the same bacteria by mixing killed \"smooth\" bacteria with the live \"rough\" form. This system provided the first clear suggestion that DNA carries genetic information.\nIn 1933, while studying virgin sea urchin eggs, Jean Brachet suggested that DNA is found in the cell nucleus and that RNA is present exclusively in the cytoplasm. At the time, \"yeast nucleic acid\" (RNA) was thought to occur only in plants, while \"thymus nucleic acid\" (DNA) only in animals. The latter was thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular pH. In 1937, William Astbury produced the first X-ray diffraction patterns that showed that DNA had a regular structure.\nIn 1943, Oswald Avery, along with co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, identified DNA as the transforming principle, supporting Griffith's suggestion (Avery\u2013MacLeod\u2013McCarty experiment). Erwin Chargaff developed and published observations now known as Chargaff's rules, stating that in DNA from any species of any organism, the amount of guanine should be equal to cytosine and the amount of adenine should be equal to thymine.\nBy 1951, Alec Todd and collaborators at the University of Cambridge had determined by biochemical methods how the backbone of DNA is structured via the successive linking of carbon atoms 3 and 5 of the sugar to phosphates. This would help to corroborate Watson and Crick's later X-ray structural work. Todd would later be awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this and other discoveries related to DNA.\nLate in 1951, Francis Crick started working with James Watson at the Cavendish Laboratory within the University of Cambridge. DNA's role in heredity was confirmed in 1952 when Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase in the Hershey\u2013Chase experiment showed that DNA is the genetic material of the enterobacteria phage T2.\nIn May 1952, Raymond Gosling, a graduate student working under the supervision of Rosalind Franklin, took an X-ray diffraction image, labeled as \"Photo 51\", at high hydration levels of DNA. This photo was given to Watson and Crick by Maurice Wilkins and was critical to their obtaining the correct structure of DNA. Franklin told Crick and Watson that the backbones had to be on the outside. Before then, Linus Pauling, and Watson and Crick, had erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards. Franklin's identification of the space group for DNA crystals proved her correct. In February 1953, Linus Pauling and Robert Corey proposed a model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside. Watson and Crick completed their model, which is now accepted as the first correct model of the double helix of DNA. On 28 February 1953 Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime at The Eagle pub in Cambridge, England to announce that he and Watson had \"discovered the secret of life\".\nThe 25 April 1953 issue of the journal \"Nature\" published a series of five articles giving the Watson and Crick double-helix structure DNA and evidence supporting it. The structure was reported in a letter titled \"\"MOLECULAR STRUCTURE OF NUCLEIC ACIDS A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\"\", in which they said, \"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.\" This letter was followed by a letter from Franklin and Gosling, which was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and of their original analysis method. Then followed a letter by Wilkins and two of his colleagues, which contained an analysis of \"in vivo\" B-DNA X-ray patterns, and which supported the presence \"in vivo\" of the Watson and Crick structure.\nIn April 2023, scientists, based on new evidence, concluded that Rosalind Franklin was a contributor and \"equal player\" in the discovery process of DNA, rather than otherwise, as may have been presented subsequently after the time of the discovery. In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery.\nIn an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the central dogma of molecular biology, which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the \"adaptor hypothesis\". Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 through the Meselson\u2013Stahl experiment. Further work by Crick and co-workers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called codons, allowing Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley, and Marshall Warren Nirenberg to decipher the genetic code. These findings represent the birth of molecular biology.\nIn 1986, DNA analysis was first used in a criminal investigation when police in the UK requested Alec Jeffreys of the University of Leicester to prove or disprove the involvement in a particular case of a suspect who claimed innocence in the matter. Although the suspect had already confessed to committing a recent rape-murder, he was denying any involvement in a similar crime committed three years earlier. Yet the details of the two cases were so alike that the police concluded both crimes had been committed by the same person. However, all charges against the suspect were dropped when Jeffreys' DNA testing exonerated the suspect \u2014 from both the earlier murder and the one to which he'd confessed. Further such DNA profiling led to positive identification of another suspect (Colin Pitchfork) who, in 1988, was found guilty of both rape-murders.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7957", "revid": "19269270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7957", "title": "Kennedy family", "text": "American political family\nThe Kennedy family () is an American political family that has long been prominent in American politics, public service, entertainment, and business. In 1884, 35 years after the family's arrival from County Wexford, Ireland, Patrick Joseph \"P. J.\" Kennedy became the first Kennedy elected to public office, serving in the Massachusetts state legislature until 1895. At least one Kennedy family member was serving in federal elective office in every year from 1947, when P. J. Kennedy's grandson John F. Kennedy became a member of Congress from Massachusetts, until 2011, when Patrick J. Kennedy II (John's nephew) retired as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Rhode Island.\nP. J.'s son Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and his wife, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, had nine children, including John F. Kennedy, who served in both houses of the United States Congress and as U.S. President; Robert F. Kennedy, who served as U.S. Attorney General and as a U.S. Senator; Ted Kennedy, who served more than 46 years in the U.S. Senate; and Jean Kennedy Smith, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ireland.\nOther Kennedy descendants include members of the U.S. House of Representatives, two U.S. ambassadors, one U.S. envoy, a lieutenant governor, three state legislators (one of whom also served in the U.S. House of Representatives), and one mayor. Joseph and Rose's daughter Eunice played a vital role in establishing the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (part of the National Institutes of Health) and the Special Olympics. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the current United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. Other descendants of Joseph and Rose Kennedy have been lawyers, authors, and activists on behalf of those with physical and intellectual disabilities.\nHistory.\nAccording to genealogist Brian Kennedy in his work \"JFK's Irish O'Kennedy Ancestors\", the Kennedys\u2014who would go on to play a significant role in the United States of America\u2014originated from an Irish clan called \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide Fionn (which, along with the \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide Donn and \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide Ruadh, were the three Irish Gaelic \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide clans who ruled the Kingdom of Ormond). In 1546, their progenitor Diarmaid \u00d3 Cinn\u00e9ide Fionn became the owner of Knigh Castle, located close to what is today Puckane, County Tipperary. In 1740, having lost out to the New English order in the Kingdom of Ireland, they moved to Dunganstown, New Ross, County Wexford. Patrick Kennedy was born there.\nPatrick Kennedy (1823\u20131858) and Bridget Murphy (1824\u20131888) sailed from Ireland to East Boston in 1849. Patrick worked in East Boston as a barrel maker, or cooper, and had five children with Bridget. Their youngest, Patrick Joseph \"P. J.\" Kennedy, went into business and served in the Massachusetts state legislature from 1884 to 1895.\nP.J. and his wife, Mary Augusta Hickey, had four children. Their oldest was Joseph Patrick \"Joe\" Kennedy Sr., a businessman who amassed a private fortune in banking and securities trading, which he further expanded by investing in filmmaking and real estate. He also founded Somerset Importers and owned Chicago's Merchandise Mart.\nIn 1914, Joseph Sr. married Rose Fitzgerald. The couple had nine children: Joseph Jr. (1915\u20131944), John (called Jack) (1917\u20131963), Rose Marie (called Rosemary) (1918\u20132005), Kathleen (called Kick) (1920\u20131948), Eunice (1921\u20132009), Patricia (1924\u20132006), Robert (called Bobby) (1925\u20131968), Jean (1928\u20132020) and Edward (called Ted) (1932\u20132009).\nJoseph Sr. was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), chairman of the Maritime Commission, and U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to 1940. He served from 1947 to 1949 on The Hoover Commission (the \"Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government\"), which was appointed by President Harry Truman to recommend administrative changes in the federal government. Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy was named Papal Countess of the Holy Roman Church by Pope Pius XII in 1951 in recognition of her \"exemplary motherhood and many charitable works.\"\nContinued public service.\nEvery Kennedy elected to public office has served as a Democrat, and other members of the family have worked for the party or held Cabinet posts in Democratic administrations. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an exception, having taken a cabinet post in a Republican administration. Many have attended Harvard University, and the family has contributed greatly to that university's John F. Kennedy School of Government.\nJoseph Sr. expected his eldest son, Joseph Jr., to go into politics and to ultimately be elected president. Joseph Jr. was elected as a Massachusetts delegate to the 1940 Democratic National Convention and enlisted in the U.S. Navy after the United States entered World War II. He was killed in 1944 when the bomber he was piloting exploded in flight. Joseph Sr.'s desire to see the family involved in politics and government then focused on John, who had considered a career as a journalist, having authored a book (\"Why England Slept\") and done some reporting for Hearst Newspapers. After returning from Navy service, John served in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Massachusetts's 11th congressional district from 1947 to 1953, and then as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. In the 1960 presidential election, John narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon.\nDuring John's administration, Robert served as attorney general, their brother-in-law Sargent Shriver served as director of the new Peace Corps, and Ted became the U.S. Senator from Massachusetts until his death in 2009. The Kennedy administration's accomplishments include the Alliance for Progress with Latin America, the establishment of the Peace Corps, a peaceful resolution to the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution ending the poll tax, the continuation of the Apollo spaceflight program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon, and the introduction of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to Congress (signed into law by Kennedy's successor Lyndon B. Johnson). The family was the subject of intense media coverage during and after Kennedy's presidency.\nTed served in the Senate with his brother Robert (1965\u20131968), and was serving in the Senate when his nephew, Joseph P. II, and his son, Patrick J., served in the U.S. House of Representatives representing Massachusetts's 8th congressional district (1987\u20131999) and Rhode Island's 1st congressional district (1995\u20132011), respectively. In November 2012, Joseph P. Kennedy III, son of former U.S. representative Joseph P. Kennedy II and grandson of former senior Robert F. Kennedy, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Massachusetts's 4th congressional district. In 2020, Joseph P. III lost the U.S. Senate primary election in Massachusetts to incumbent Ed Markey, the first Kennedy to ever lose an election in the state.\nIn the 2020s, three Kennedy family members served as U.S. ambassadors or envoys. Victoria Reggie Kennedy, second wife of Ted Kennedy, was named in 2021 by President Joe Biden as U.S. ambassador to Austria. Caroline Kennedy, daughter of President Kennedy, was named in 2022 by President Biden as U.S. ambassador to Australia; she previously served as U.S. ambassador to Japan under President Barack Obama. In the same year, Joseph P. Kennedy III was named by President Biden as U.S. special envoy to Northern Ireland.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. ran for president in the 2024 United States presidential election, originally as a Democrat, but changing his affiliation to Independent in October 2023. Family members spoke out against him, mainly due to his anti-vaccine views, and instead endorsed President Joe Biden. In August 2024, two months before the election, Robert Jr. withdrew and endorsed Republican candidate Donald Trump, who won the election. Trump nominated him to be United States Secretary of Health and Human Services and he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 52-48.\nFamily tree.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGovernment offices held.\nIn addition, some Kennedy spouses have served in government:\nThere was a member of the Kennedy family in public office nearly continuously from 1946, when John F. Kennedy was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, until early 2011, when Patrick J. Kennedy left the House. The only exception was the period between John F. Kennedy's resignation from the Senate on December 22, 1960, and his assumption of the office of President on January 20, 1961. In 2013, two years after Patrick Kennedy left the House, Joseph P. Kennedy III was elected U.S. Representative from Massachusetts and served until 2021. Below is a timeline of the Kennedys' tenure in the U.S. Congress.\nHeraldry.\nOn March 17, 1961, John F. Kennedy was presented with a grant of arms for all the descendants of Patrick Kennedy (1823\u20131858) from the Chief Herald of Ireland. The design of the arms (three gold closed helmets on a black field) strongly alludes to symbols in the coats of arms of the O'Kennedys of Ormonde and the FitzGeralds of Desmond, from whom the family is descended. The crest is an armored hand holding four arrows between two olive branches, elements taken from the coat of arms of the United States of America and also symbolic of Kennedy and his brothers.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7959", "revid": "28979433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7959", "title": "Democracy", "text": "Form of government\nDemocracy (from , from \"d\u0113mos\" 'people' and \"kr\u00e1tos\" 'rule') is a form of government in which political power is vested in the people or the population of a state. Under a minimalist definition of democracy, rulers are elected through competitive elections while more expansive or maximalist definitions link democracy to guarantees of civil liberties and human rights in addition to competitive elections.\nIn a direct democracy, the people have the direct authority to deliberate and decide legislation. In a representative democracy, the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. The definition of \"the people\" and the ways authority is shared among them or delegated by them have changed over time and at varying rates in different countries. Features of democracy often include freedom of assembly, association, personal property, freedom of religion and speech, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.\nThe notion of democracy has evolved considerably over time. Throughout history, one can find evidence of direct democracy, in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today, the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy, where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. In the common variant of liberal democracy, the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority\u2014usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, such as freedom of speech or freedom of association.\nThe term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek city-states, notably Classical Athens, to mean \"rule of the people\", in contrast to aristocracy (, \"\"), meaning \"rule of an elite\". In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class, which was later extended to all adult citizens. In most modern democracies, this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state, such as authoritarian systems. Historically a rare and vulnerable form of government, democratic systems of government have become more prevalent since the 19th century, in particular with various waves of democratization. Democracy garners considerable legitimacy in the modern world, as public opinion across regions tends to strongly favor democratic systems of government relative to alternatives, and as even authoritarian states try to present themselves as democratic. Democracy more consistently results in improved health, education and economic outcomes. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index, less than half the world's population lives in a democracy as of 2022[ [update]].\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCharacteristics.\nAlthough democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting, no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy. Karl Popper says that the \"classical\" view of democracy is, \"in brief, the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule\". One study identified 2,234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language.\nDemocratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has (in theory) equal weight, and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution, while other uses of \"democracy\" may encompass direct democracy, in which citizens vote on issues directly. According to the United Nations, democracy \"provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.\"\nOne theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles: upward control (sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority), political equality, and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality. Legal equality, political freedom and rule of law are often identified by commentators as foundational characteristics for a well-functioning democracy.\nIn some countries, notably in the United Kingdom (which originated the Westminster system), the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty, while maintaining judicial independence. In India, parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review. Though the term \"democracy\" is typically used in the context of a political state, the principles also are potentially applicable to private organisations, such as clubs, societies and firms.\nDemocracies may use many different decision-making methods, but majority rule is the dominant form. Without compensation, like legal protections of individual or group rights, political minorities can be oppressed by the \"tyranny of the majority\". Majority rule involves a competitive approach, opposed to consensus democracy, creating the need that elections, and generally deliberation, be substantively and procedurally \"fair\",\" i.e. just and equitable. In some countries, freedom of political expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed, enabling them to vote according to their own interests and beliefs.\nIt has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society. With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a form of political collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.\nRepublics, though often popularly associated with democracy because of the shared principle of rule by consent of the governed, are not necessarily democracies, as republicanism does not specify \"how\" the people are to rule.\nClassically the term \"republic\" encompassed both democracies and aristocracies. In a modern sense the republican form of government is a form of government without a monarch. Because of this, democracies can be republics or constitutional monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, where the monarch is not a ruler.\nHistory.\nDemocratic assemblies are as old as the human species and are found throughout human history, but up until the nineteenth century, major political figures have largely opposed democracy. Republican theorists linked democracy to small size: as political units grew in size, the likelihood increased that the government would turn despotic. At the same time, small political units were vulnerable to conquest. Montesquieu wrote, \"If a republic be small, it is destroyed by a foreign force; if it is large, it is ruined by an internal imperfection.\" According to Johns Hopkins University political scientist Daniel Deudney, the creation of the United States, with its large size and its system of checks and balances, was a solution to the dual problems of size. Forms of democracy occurred organically in societies around the world that had no contact with each other.\nOrigins.\nGreece and Rome.\nThe term \"democracy\" first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the city-state of Athens during classical antiquity. The word comes from \"d\u00eamos\" '(common) people' and \"kr\u00e1tos\" 'force/might'. Under Cleisthenes, what is generally held as the first example of a type of democracy in the sixth-century BC (508\u2013507 BC) was established in Athens. Cleisthenes is referred to as \"the father of Athenian democracy\". The first attested use of the word democracy is found in prose works of the 430s BC, such as Herodotus' \"Histories\", but its usage was older by several decades, as two Athenians born in the 470s were named Democrates, a new political name\u2014likely in support of democracy\u2014given at a time of debates over constitutional issues in Athens. Aeschylus also strongly alludes to the word in his play \"The Suppliants\", staged in c.463 BC, where he mentions \"the demos's ruling hand\" [\"demou kratousa cheir\"]. Before that time, the word used to define the new political system of Cleisthenes was probably isonomia, meaning political equality.\nAthenian democracy took the form of direct democracy, and it had two distinguishing features: the random selection of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices, and a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens. All eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly, which set the laws of the city-state. However, Athenian citizenship excluded women, slaves, foreigners (\u03bc\u03ad\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9 / \"m\u00e9toikoi\"), and youths below the age of military service. Effectively, only 1 in 4 residents in Athens qualified as citizens. Owning land was not a requirement for citizenship. The exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship. In most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns.\nAthenian democracy was not only \"direct\" in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also the \"most direct\" in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense (the ancient Greeks had no word for \"rights\"), those who were citizens of Athens enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.\nRange voting appeared in Sparta as early as 700 BC. The Spartan ecclesia was an assembly of the people, held once a month, in which every male citizen of at least 20 years of age could participate. In the assembly, Spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting (the vote is then decided on how loudly the crowd shouts). Aristotle called this \"childish\", as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the Athenian citizenry. Sparta adopted it because of its simplicity, and to prevent any biased voting, buying, or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections.\nEven though the Roman Republic contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy, only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of weighted voting, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. In addition, the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom was the first case in the Western world of a polity being formed with the explicit purpose of being a republic, although it did not have much of a democracy. The Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries.\nAncient India.\nVaishali, capital city of the Vajjika League (Vrijji mahajanapada) of India, is considered one of the first examples of a republic around the 6th century BC.\nAmericas.\nOther cultures, such as the Iroquois in the Americas also developed a form of democratic society between 1450 and 1660 (and possibly in 1142), well before contact with the Europeans. This democracy continues to the present day and is the world's oldest standing representative democracy.\nMiddle Ages.\nWhile most regions in Europe during the Middle Ages were ruled by clergy or feudal lords, there existed various systems involving elections or assemblies, although often only involving a small part of the population. In Scandinavia, bodies known as things consisted of freemen presided by a lawspeaker. These deliberative bodies were responsible for settling political questions, and variants included the Althing in Iceland and the L\u00f8gting in the Faeroe Islands. The veche, found in Eastern Europe, was a similar body to the Scandinavian thing. In the Roman Catholic Church, the pope has been elected by a papal conclave composed of cardinals since 1059. The first documented parliamentary body in Europe was the Cortes of Le\u00f3n. Established by Alfonso IX in 1188, the Cortes had authority over setting taxation, foreign affairs and legislating, though the exact nature of its role remains disputed. The Republic of Ragusa, established in 1358 and centered around the city of Dubrovnik, provided representation and voting rights to its male aristocracy only. Various Italian city-states and polities had republic forms of government. For instance, the Republic of Florence, established in 1115, was led by the Signoria whose members were chosen by sortition. In the 10th\u201315th century Frisia, a distinctly non-feudal society, the right to vote on local matters and on county officials was based on land size. The Kouroukan Fouga divided the Mali Empire into ruling clans (lineages) that were represented at a great assembly called the \"Gbara\". However, the charter made Mali more similar to a constitutional monarchy than a democratic republic.\nThe Parliament of England had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into Magna Carta (1215), which explicitly protected certain rights of the King's subjects and implicitly supported what became the English writ of habeas corpus, safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with the right to appeal. The first representative national assembly in England was Simon de Montfort's Parliament in 1265. The emergence of petitioning is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people. However, the power to call parliament remained at the pleasure of the monarch.\nStudies have linked the emergence of parliamentary institutions in Europe during the medieval period to urban agglomeration and the creation of new classes, such as artisans, as well as the presence of nobility and religious elites. Scholars have also linked the emergence of representative government to Europe's relative political fragmentation. Political scientist David Stasavage links the fragmentation of Europe, and its subsequent democratization, to the manner in which the Roman Empire collapsed: Roman territory was conquered by small fragmented groups of Germanic tribes, thus leading to the creation of small political units where rulers were relatively weak and needed the consent of the governed to ward off foreign threats.\nIn Poland, noble democracy was characterized by an increase in the activity of the middle nobility, which wanted to increase their share in exercising power at the expense of the magnates. Magnates dominated the most important offices in the state (secular and ecclesiastical) and sat on the royal council, later the senate. The growing importance of the middle nobility had an impact on the establishment of the institution of the land \"sejmik\" (local assembly), which subsequently obtained more rights. During the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth century, sejmiks received more and more power and became the most important institutions of local power. In 1454, Casimir IV Jagiellon granted the sejmiks the right to decide on taxes and to convene a mass mobilization in the Nieszawa Statutes. He also pledged not to create new laws without their consent.\nModern era.\nEarly modern period.\nIn 17th century England, there was renewed interest in Magna Carta. The Parliament of England passed the Petition of Right in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects. The English Civil War (1642\u20131651) was fought between the King and an oligarchic but elected Parliament, during which the idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the Putney Debates of 1647. Subsequently, the Protectorate (1653\u201359) and the English Restoration (1660) restored more autocratic rule, although Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act in 1679 which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the Bill of Rights was enacted in 1689 which codified certain rights and liberties and is still in effect. The Bill set out the requirement for regular elections, rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch, ensuring that, unlike much of Europe at the time, royal absolutism would not prevail. Economic historians Douglass North and Barry Weingast have characterized the institutions implemented in the Glorious Revolution as a resounding success in terms of restraining the government and ensuring protection for property rights.\nRenewed interest in the Magna Carta, the English Civil War, and the Glorious Revolution in the 17th century prompted the growth of political philosophy on the British Isles. Thomas Hobbes was the first philosopher to articulate a detailed social contract theory. Writing in the \"Leviathan\" (1651), Hobbes theorized that individuals living in the state of nature led lives that were \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\" and constantly waged a war of all against all. In order to prevent the occurrence of an anarchic state of nature, Hobbes reasoned that individuals ceded their rights to a strong, authoritarian power. In other words, Hobbes advocated for an absolute monarchy which, in his opinion, was the best form of government. Later, philosopher and physician John Locke would posit a different interpretation of social contract theory. Writing in his \"Two Treatises of Government\" (1689), Locke posited that all individuals possessed the inalienable rights to life, liberty and estate (property). According to Locke, individuals would voluntarily come together to form a state for the purposes of defending their rights. Particularly important for Locke were property rights, whose protection Locke deemed to be a government's primary purpose. Furthermore, Locke asserted that governments were legitimate only if they held the consent of the governed. For Locke, citizens had the right to revolt against a government that acted against their interest or became tyrannical. Although they were not widely read during his lifetime, Locke's works are considered the founding documents of liberal thought and profoundly influenced the leaders of the American Revolution and later the French Revolution. His liberal democratic framework of governance remains the preeminent form of democracy in the world.\nIn the Cossack republics of Ukraine in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Cossack Hetmanate and Zaporizhian Sich, the holder of the highest post of Hetman was elected by the representatives from the country's districts.\nIn North America, representative government began in Jamestown, Virginia, with the election of the House of Burgesses (forerunner of the Virginia General Assembly) in 1619. English Puritans who migrated from 1620 established colonies in New England whose local governance was democratic; the hard power of these local assemblies varied greatly throughout the colonial time period however officially they held only small amounts of devolved power, as ultimate authority belonged to the Crown and Parliament. The Puritans (Pilgrim Fathers), Baptists, and Quakers who founded these colonies applied the democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in worldly matters.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nThe first Parliament of Great Britain was established in 1707, after the merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland under the Acts of Union. Two key documents of the UK's uncodified constitution, the English Declaration of Right, 1689 (restated in the Bill of Rights 1689) and the Scottish Claim of Right 1689, had both cemented Parliament's position as the supreme law-making body and said that the \"election of members of Parliament ought to be free\". However, Parliament was only elected by male property owners, which amounted to 3% of the population in 1780. The first known British person of African heritage to vote in a general election, Ignatius Sancho, voted in 1774 and 1780.\nDuring the Age of Liberty in Sweden (1718\u20131772), civil rights were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament. The taxed peasantry was represented in parliament, although with little influence, but commoners without taxed property had no suffrage.\nThe creation of the short-lived Corsican Republic in 1755 was an early attempt to adopt a democratic constitution (all men and women above age of 25 could vote). This Corsican Constitution was the first based on Enlightenment principles and included female suffrage, something that was not included in most other democracies until the 20th century.\nColonial America had similar property qualifications as Britain, and in the period before 1776 the abundance and availability of land meant that large numbers of colonists met such requirements with at least 60 per cent of adult white males able to vote. The great majority of white men were farmers who met the property ownership or taxpaying requirements. With few exceptions, no blacks or women could vote. Vermont, which, on declaring independence of Great Britain in 1777, adopted a constitution modelled on Pennsylvania's citizenship and democratic suffrage for males with or without property. The United States Constitution of 1787 is the oldest surviving, still active, governmental codified constitution. The Constitution provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties, but did not end slavery nor extend voting rights in the United States, instead leaving the issue of suffrage to the individual states. Generally, states limited suffrage to white male property owners and taxpayers. At the time of the first Presidential election in 1789, about 6% of the population was eligible to vote. The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only. The Bill of Rights in 1791 set limits on government power to protect personal freedoms but had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification.\nIn 1789, Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and, although short-lived, the National Convention was elected by all men in 1792. The Polish-Lithuanian Constitution of 3 May 1791 sought to implement a more effective constitutional monarchy, introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. In force for less than 19 months, it was declared null and void by the Grodno Sejm that met in 1793. Nonetheless, the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the country's sovereignty over a century later.\nIn the United States, the 1828 presidential election was the first in which non-property-holding white males could vote in the vast majority of states. Voter turnout soared during the 1830s, reaching about 80% of the adult white male population in the 1840 presidential election. North Carolina was the last state to abolish property qualification in 1856 resulting in a close approximation to universal white male suffrage (however tax-paying requirements remained in five states in 1860 and survived in two states until the 20th century). In the 1860 United States census, the slave population had grown to four million, and in Reconstruction after the Civil War, three constitutional amendments were passed: the 13th Amendment (1865) that ended slavery; the 14th Amendment (1869) that gave black people citizenship, and the 15th Amendment (1870) that gave black males a nominal right to vote. Full enfranchisement of citizens was not secured until after the civil rights movement gained passage by the US Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nThe voting franchise in the United Kingdom was expanded and made more uniform in a series of reforms that began with the Reform Act 1832 and continued into the 20th century, notably with the Representation of the People Act 1918 and the Equal Franchise Act 1928. Universal male suffrage was established in France in March 1848 in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. During that year, several revolutions broke out in Europe as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government.\nIn 1876, the Ottoman Empire transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one, and held two elections the next year to elect members to her newly formed parliament. Provisional Electoral Regulations were issued, stating that the elected members of the Provincial Administrative Councils would elect members to the first Parliament. Later that year, a new constitution was promulgated, which provided for a bicameral Parliament with a Senate appointed by the Sultan and a popularly elected Chamber of Deputies. Only men above the age of 30 who were competent in Turkish and had full civil rights were allowed to stand for election. Reasons for disqualification included holding dual citizenship, being employed by a foreign government, being bankrupt, employed as a servant, or having \"notoriety for ill deeds\". Full universal suffrage was achieved in 1934.\nIn 1893, the self-governing colony New Zealand became the first country in the world (except for the short-lived 18th-century Corsican Republic) to establish active universal suffrage by recognizing women as having the right to vote.\n20th and 21st centuries.\n20th-century transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive \"waves of democracy\", variously resulting from wars, revolutions, decolonisation, and religious and economic circumstances. Global waves of \"democratic regression\" reversing democratization, have also occurred in the 1920s and 30s, in the 1960s and 1970s, and in the 2010s.\nWorld War I and the dissolution of the autocratic Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires resulted in the creation of new nation-states in Europe, most of them at least nominally democratic. In the 1920s democratic movements flourished and women's suffrage advanced, but the Great Depression brought disenchantment and most of the countries of Europe, Latin America, and Asia turned to strong-man rule or dictatorships. Fascism and dictatorships flourished in Nazi Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal, as well as non-democratic governments in the Baltics, the Balkans, Brazil, Cuba, China, and Japan, among others.\nWorld War II brought a definitive reversal of this trend in Western Europe. The democratisation of the American, British, and French sectors of occupied Germany (disputed), Austria, Italy, and the occupied Japan served as a model for the later theory of government change. However, most of Eastern Europe, including the Soviet sector of Germany fell into the non-democratic Soviet-dominated bloc.\nThe war was followed by decolonisation, and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions. India emerged as the world's largest democracy and continues to be so. Countries that were once part of the British Empire often adopted the British Westminster system.\nIn 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights mandated democracy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;3. The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.\nBy 1960, the vast majority of country-states were nominally democracies, although most of the world's populations lived in nominal democracies that experienced sham elections, and other forms of subterfuge (particularly in \"Communist\" states and the former colonies). A subsequent wave of democratisation brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many states, dubbed \"third wave of democracy\". Portugal, Spain, and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the 1970s and 1980s. This was followed by countries in East and South Asia by the mid-to-late 1980s. Economic malaise in the 1980s, along with resentment of Soviet oppression, contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the associated end of the Cold War, and the democratisation and liberalisation of the former Eastern bloc countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now either part of the European Union or candidate states. In 1986, after the toppling of the most prominent Asian dictatorship, the only democratic state of its kind at the time emerged in the Philippines with the rise of Corazon Aquino, who would later be known as the mother of Asian democracy.\nThe liberal trend spread to some states in Africa in the 1990s, most prominently in South Africa. Some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the Indonesian Revolution of 1998, the Bulldozer Revolution in Yugoslavia, the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon, the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, and the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia.\nAccording to Freedom House, in 2007 there were 123 electoral democracies (up from 40 in 1972). According to \"World Forum on Democracy\", electoral democracies now represent 120 of the 192 existing countries and constitute 58.2 per cent of the world's population. At the same time liberal democracies i.e. countries Freedom House regards as free and respectful of basic human rights and the rule of law are 85 in number and represent 38 per cent of the global population. Also in 2007 the United Nations declared 15 September the International Day of Democracy.\nMany countries reduced their voting age to 18 years; the major democracies began to do so in the 1970s starting in Western Europe and North America. Most electoral democracies continue to exclude those younger than 18 from voting. The voting age has been lowered to 16 for national elections in a number of countries, including Brazil, Austria, Cuba, and Nicaragua. In California, a 2004 proposal to permit a quarter vote at 14 and a half vote at 16 was ultimately defeated. In 2008, the German parliament proposed but shelved a bill that would grant the vote to each citizen at birth, to be used by a parent until the child claims it for themselves.\nAccording to Freedom House, starting in 2005, there have been 17 consecutive years in which declines in political rights and civil liberties throughout the world have outnumbered improvements, as populist and nationalist political forces have gained ground everywhere from Poland (under the Law and Justice party) to the Philippines (under Rodrigo Duterte). In a Freedom House report released in 2018, Democracy Scores for most countries declined for the 12th consecutive year. \"The Christian Science Monitor\" reported that nationalist and populist political ideologies were gaining ground, at the expense of rule of law, in countries like Poland, Turkey and Hungary. For example, in Poland, the President appointed 27 new Supreme Court judges over legal objections from the European Commission. In Turkey, thousands of judges were removed from their positions following a failed coup attempt during a government crackdown .\n\"Democratic backsliding\" in the 2010s were attributed to economic inequality and social discontent, personalism, poor government's management of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors such as manipulation of civil society, \"toxic polarization\", foreign disinformation campaigns, racism and nativism, excessive executive power, and decreased power of the opposition. Within English-speaking Western democracies, \"protection-based\" attitudes combining cultural conservatism and leftist economic attitudes were the strongest predictor of support for authoritarian modes of governance.\nTheory.\nEarly theory.\nAristotle's democratic theory contrasted rule by the many (democracy/timocracy), with rule by the few (oligarchy/aristocracy/elitism), and with rule by a single person (tyranny/autocracy/absolute monarchy). He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system (he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy).\nA common view among early and renaissance Republican theorists was that democracy could only survive in small political communities. Heeding the lessons of the Roman Republic's shift to monarchism as it grew larger or smaller, these Republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny. Democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically, as it could only survive in small political units, which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units. Montesquieu famously said, \"if a republic is small, it is destroyed by an outside force; if it is large, it is destroyed by an internal vice.\" Rousseau asserted, \"It is, therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic, of middling ones to be subject to a monarch, and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince.\"\nContemporary theory.\nAmong modern political theorists, there are different fundamental conceptions of democracy.\nAggregation.\nThe theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens' preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt. Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting, where the policy with the most votes gets implemented. Different variants of aggregative democracy exist.\nAccording to the minimalist democracy conception, elections are a mechanism for competition between politicians. Joseph Schumpeter articulated this view famously in his book \"Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy\". Contemporary proponents of minimalism include William H. Riker, Adam Przeworski, Richard Posner. \nAccording to the median voter theorem governments will tend to produce laws and policies close to the views of the median voter with half to their left and the other half to their right. Anthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individuals and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book \"An Economic Theory of Democracy\".\nAccording to the theory of direct democracy, on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Proponents view citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.\nPolyarchy.\nRobert A. Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation. Similarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that \"democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.\"\nDeliberation.\nDeliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule. Citizens assemblies are considered by many scholars as practical examples of deliberative democracy, with a recent OECD report identifying citizens assemblies as an increasingly popular mechanism to involve citizens in governmental decision-making.\nMeasurement of democracy.\nMeasurement of democracy varies according to the different fundamental conceptions of democracy. Minimalist democracy evaluations focus on free and fair elections, while maximalist democracy evaluates additional values, such as human rights, deliberation, economic outcomes or state capacity.\nTypes of governmental democracies.\nDemocracy has taken a number of forms, both in theory and practice. Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not structured to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.\nThe following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another: many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co-exist in a single system.\nBasic forms.\nSeveral variants of democracy exist, but there are two basic forms, both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is direct democracy, in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making, for example voting on policy initiatives directly. In most modern democracies, the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives; this is called a representative democracy.\nDirect.\nDirect democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decision-making personally, contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives. A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to:\nWithin modern-day representative governments, certain electoral tools like referendums, citizens' initiatives and recall elections are referred to as forms of direct democracy. However, some advocates of direct democracy argue for local assemblies of face-to-face discussion. Direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus, the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities, communities affiliated with the CIPO-RFM, the Bolivian city councils of FEJUVE, and Kurdish cantons of Rojava.\nSemi-direct.\nSome modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies, which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy, are termed \"semi-direct democracies\" or \"participatory democracies\". Examples include Switzerland and some U.S. states, where frequent use is made of referendums and initiatives.\nThe Swiss confederation is a semi-direct democracy. At the federal level, citizens can propose changes to the constitution (federal popular initiative) or ask for a referendum to be held on any law voted by the parliament. Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, to answer 103 questions (during the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums). Although in the past 120 years less than 250 initiatives have been put to referendum.\nExamples include the extensive use of referendums in the US state of California, which is a state that has more than 20 million voters.\nIn New England, town meetings are often used, especially in rural areas, to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government, with a local direct democracy and a representative state government. For example, most Vermont towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters.\nLot system.\nThe use of a lot system, a characteristic of Athenian democracy, is a feature of some versions of direct democracies. In this system, important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery.\nRepresentative.\nRepresentative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. If the head of state is also democratically elected then it is called a democratic republic. The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a plurality of the votes. Most western countries have representative systems.\nRepresentatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district (or constituency), or represent the entire electorate through proportional systems, with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy, such as referendums. A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people's interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy, pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy\nParliamentary.\nParliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by or can be dismissed by, representatives as opposed to a \"presidential rule\" wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.\nIn a parliamentary system, the prime minister may be dismissed by the legislature at any point in time for not meeting the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a vote of no confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the prime minister from office with majority support for dismissal. In some countries, the prime minister can also call an election at any point in time, typically when the prime minister believes that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies, extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the \"loyal opposition\". The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or opposition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.\nPresidential.\nPresidential democracy is a system where the public elects the president through an election. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. The legislature often has limited ability to remove a president from office. Elections typically have a fixed date and are not easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.\nThe executive usually has the responsibility to execute or implement legislation and may have the limited legislative powers, such as a veto. However, a legislative branch passes legislation and budgets. This provides some measure of separation of powers. In consequence, however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.\nA semi-presidential system is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.\nTypology.\nConstitutional monarchy.\nMany countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Scandinavian countries, Thailand, Japan and Bhutan turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs (often gradually) with limited or symbolic roles. For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. Strongly limited constitutional monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, have been referred to as crowned republics by writers such as H. G. Wells.\nIn other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece, and Egypt). An elected person, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.\nElite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many states. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British House of Lords) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the Australian Senate).\nRepublic.\nThe term \"republic\" has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected head of state, such as a president, serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary monarch as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed head of government such as a prime minister.\nThe Founding Fathers of the United States often criticised direct democracy, which in their view often came without the protection of a constitution enshrining inalienable rights; James Madison argued, especially in \"The Federalist\" No. 10, that what distinguished a direct \"democracy\" from a \"republic\" was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.\nProfessors Richard Ellis of Willamette University and Michael Nelson of Rhodes College argue that much constitutional thought, from Madison to Lincoln and beyond, has focused on \"the problem of majority tyranny\". They conclude, \"The principles of republican government embedded in the Constitution represent an effort by the framers to ensure that the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness would not be trampled by majorities.\" What was critical to American values, John Adams insisted, was that the government be \"bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.\" As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the US Constitution, Elizabeth Willing Powel asked him \"Well, Doctor, what have we got\u2014a republic or a monarchy?\". He replied \"A republic\u2014if you can keep it.\"\nLiberal.\nA liberal democracy is a representative democracy which enshrines a liberal political philosophy, where the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the rule of law, moderated by a constitution or laws such as the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and constrained on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities.\nSocialist.\nSocialist thought has several different views on democracy, for example social democracy or democratic socialism. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of participatory, industrial, economic and/or workplace democracy combined with a representative democracy.\nMarxist.\nMarxist theory supports a democratic society centering the working class. Some Marxists and Trotskyists believe in direct democracy or workers' councils (which are sometimes called soviets). This system can begin with workplace democracy and can manifest itself as soviet democracy or dictatorship of the proletariat. Trotskyist groups have interpreted socialist democracy to be synonymous with multi-party far-left representation, autonomous union organizations, worker's control of production, internal party democracy and the mass participation of the working masses. Some communist parties support a soviet republic with democratic centralism. Within democracy in Marxism there can be hostility to what is commonly called \"liberal democracy\".\nAnarchist.\nAnarchists are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a majority-rule is tyrannic or not. To many anarchists, the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous. However, anarcho-communist Murray Bookchin criticised individualist anarchists for opposing democracy, and says \"majority rule\" is consistent with anarchism.\nSome anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt-in favour of a non-majoritarian form of consensus democracy, similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.\nSortition.\nSortition is the process of choosing decision-making bodies via a random selection. These bodies can be more representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large than an elected legislature or other decision-maker. The technique was in widespread use in Athenian Democracy and Renaissance Florence and is still used in modern jury selection and citizens' assemblies.\nConsociational.\nConsociational democracy, also called consociationalism, is a form of democracy based on power-sharing formula between elites representing the social groups within the society. In 1969, Arendt Lijphart argued this would stabilize democracies with factions. A consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them. The Qualified majority voting rule in European Council of Ministers is a consociational democracy approach for supranational democracies. This system in Treaty of Rome allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. A consociational democracy requires consensus of representatives, while consensus democracy requires consensus of electorate.\nConsensus.\nConsensus democracy requires consensus decision-making and supermajority to obtain a larger support than majority. In contrast, in majoritarian democracy minority opinions can potentially be ignored by vote-winning majorities. Constitutions typically require consensus or supermajorities.\nInclusive.\nInclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for direct democracy in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, economic democracy in a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. self-management in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher Takis Fotopoulos in \"Towards An Inclusive Democracy\" and was further developed in the journal \"Democracy &amp; Nature\" and its successor \"The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy\".\nParticipatory.\nA parpolity or participatory polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a nested council structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision-making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25\u201350 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.\nA council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the tyranny of the majority, and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a participatory economy.\nRadical.\nRadical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. Radical democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes.\nCosmopolitan.\nCosmopolitan democracy, also known as \"global democracy\" or \"world federalism\", is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.\nAccording to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing international organisations, e.g., the United Nations, as well as the creation of new institutions such as a World Parliament, which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.\nCosmopolitan democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein, writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist George Monbiot, and professors David Held and Daniele Archibugi. The creation of the International Criminal Court in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.\nCreative.\nCreative democracy is advocated by American philosopher John Dewey. The main idea about creative democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of \"Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us\" and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a moral ideal requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. \"The task of democracy\", Dewey concludes, \"is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute\".\nGuided.\nGuided democracy is a form of democracy that incorporates regular popular elections, but which often carefully \"guides\" the choices offered to the electorate in a manner that may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them. Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority. Russian-style democracy has often been referred to as a \"guided democracy\". Russian politicians have referred to their government as having only one center of power/ authority, as opposed to most other forms of democracy which usually attempt to incorporate two or more naturally competing sources of authority within the same government.\nNon-governmental democracy.\nAside from the public sphere, similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups. Many non-governmental organisations decide policy and leadership by voting. Most trade unions and cooperatives are governed by democratic elections. Corporations are ultimately governed by their shareholders through shareholder democracy. Corporations may also employ systems such as workplace democracy to handle internal governance. Amitai Etzioni has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with sharia law, termed Islamic democracy or \"Islamocracy\". There is also a growing number of Democratic educational institutions such as Sudbury schools that are co-governed by students and staff.\nShareholder democracy.\nShareholder democracy is a concept relating to the governance of corporations by their shareholders. In the United States, shareholders are typically granted voting rights according to the one share, one vote principle. Shareholders may vote annually to elect the company's board of directors, who themselves may choose the company's executives. The shareholder democracy framework may be inaccurate for companies which have different classes of stock that further alter the distribution of voting rights.\nJustification.\nSeveral justifications for democracy have been postulated.\nLegitimacy.\nSocial contract theory argues that the legitimacy of government is based on consent of the governed, i.e. an election, and that political decisions must reflect the general will. Some proponents of the theory like Jean-Jacques Rousseau advocate for a direct democracy on this basis.\nBetter decision-making.\nCondorcet's jury theorem is logical proof that if each decision-maker has a better than chance probability of making the right decision, then having the largest number of decision-makers, i.e. a democracy, will result in the best decisions. This has also been argued by theories of the wisdom of the crowd. Democracy tends to improve conflict resolution.\nEconomic success.\nIn \"Why Nations Fail\", economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that democracies are more economically successful because undemocratic political systems tend to limit markets and favor monopolies at the expense of the creative destruction which is necessary for sustained economic growth.\nA 2019 study by Acemoglu and others estimated that countries switching to democratic from authoritarian rule had on average a 20% higher GDP after 25 years than if they had remained authoritarian. The study examined 122 transitions to democracy and 71 transitions to authoritarian rule, occurring from 1960 to 2010. Acemoglu said this was because democracies tended to invest more in health care and human capital, and reduce special treatment of regime allies.\nA 2023 study analyzed the long-term effects of democracy on economic prosperity using new data on GDP per capita and democracy for a dataset between 1789 and 2019. The results indicate that democracy substantially increases economic development.\nDemocratic transitions.\nA democratic transition describes a phase in a country's political system, often created as a result of an incomplete change from an authoritarian regime to a democratic one (or vice versa).\nDemocratization.\nSeveral philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy. Other commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development. In a related theory, Ronald Inglehart suggests that improved living-standards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted, leading to increased emphasis on self-expression values, which correlates closely with democracy.\nDouglas M. Gibler and Andrew Owsiak in their study argued about the importance of peace and stable borders for the development of democracy. It has often been assumed that democracy causes peace, but this study shows that, historically, peace has almost always predated the establishment of democracy.\nCarroll Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy: Democracy\u2014this scenario\u2014tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use. By the 1800s, guns were the best personal weapons available, and in the United States of America (already nominally democratic), almost everyone could afford to buy a gun, and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments could not do any better: it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns. Similarly, Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and democracy.\nOther theories stressed the relevance of education and of human capital\u2014and within them of cognitive ability to increasing tolerance, rationality, political literacy and participation. Two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished:\nEvidence consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier, more educated, or less unequal. In fact, empirical evidence shows that economic growth and education may not lead to increased demand for democratization as modernization theory suggests: historically, most countries attained high levels of access to primary education well before transitioning to democracy. Rather than acting as a catalyst for democratization, in some situations education provision may instead be used by non-democratic regimes to indoctrinate their subjects and strengthen their power.\nThe assumed link between education and economic growth is called into question when analyzing empirical evidence. Across different countries, the correlation between education attainment and math test scores is very weak (.07). A similarly weak relationship exists between per-pupil expenditures and math competency (.26). Additionally, historical evidence suggests that average human capital (measured using literacy rates) of the masses does not explain the onset of industrialization in France from 1750 to 1850 despite arguments to the contrary. Together, these findings show that education does not always promote human capital and economic growth as is generally argued to be the case. Instead, the evidence implies that education provision often falls short of its expressed goals, or, alternatively, that political actors use education to promote goals other than economic growth and development.\nSome scholars have searched for the \"deep\" determinants of contemporary political institutions, be they geographical or demographic.\nAn example of this is the disease environment. Places with different mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world. For example, in Africa, the tsetse fly\u2014which afflicts humans and livestock\u2014reduced the ability of Africans to plough the land. This made Africa less settled. As a consequence, political power was less concentrated. This also affected the colonial institutions European countries established in Africa. Whether colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths. This also affected the distribution of power and the collective actions people could take. As a result, some African countries ended up having democracies and others autocracies.\nAn example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers. This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of trade. Trade brought economic development, which in turn, broadened power. Rulers wanting to increase revenues had to protect property-rights to create incentives for people to invest. As more people had more power, more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many places this process lead to democracy. These determinants defined the structure of the society moving the balance of political power.\nRobert Michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised, democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy:\nThe peasant in the fable, when on his deathbed, tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field. After the old man's death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure. They do not find it. But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative well-being. The treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy.\nDemocracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government, and many times it has faced opposition from social elites. The implementation of a democratic government from a non-democratic state is typically brought by peaceful or violent democratic revolution.\nAutocratization.\nSteven Levitsky says: \"It's not up to voters to defend a democracy. That's asking far, far too much of voters, to cast their ballot on the basis of some set of abstract principles or procedures. With the exception of a handful of cases, voters never, ever \u2014 in any society, in any culture \u2014 prioritize democracy over all else. Individual voters worry about much more mundane things, as is their right. It is up to \u00e9lites and institutions to protect democracy \u2014 not voters.\"\nDisruption.\nSome democratic governments have experienced sudden state collapse and regime change to an undemocratic form of government. Domestic military coups or rebellions are the most common means by which democratic governments have been overthrown. (See List of coups and coup attempts by country and List of civil wars.) Examples include the Spanish Civil War, the Coup of 18 Brumaire that ended the French First Republic, and the 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat which ended the First Portuguese Republic. Some military coups are supported by foreign governments, such as the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat and the 1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat. Other types of a sudden end to democracy include:\nDemocratic backsliding can end democracy in a gradual manner, by increasing emphasis on national security and eroding free and fair elections, freedom of expression, independence of the judiciary, rule of law. A famous example is the Enabling Act of 1933, which lawfully ended democracy in Weimar Germany and marked the transition to Nazi Germany.\nTemporary or long-term political violence and government interference can prevent free and fair elections, which erode the democratic nature of governments. This has happened on a local level even in well-established democracies like the United States; for example, the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 and African-American disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era.\nInfluence of the media.\nThe theory of democracy relies on the implicit assumption that voters are well informed about social issues, policies, and candidates so that they can make a truly informed decision. Since the late 20th century there has been a growing concern that voters may be poorly informed due to the news media's focusing more on entertainment and gossip and less on serious journalistic research on political issues.\nThe media professors Michael Gurevitch and Jay Blumler have proposed a number of functions that the mass media are expected to fulfill in a democracy:\nThis proposal has inspired a lot of discussions over whether the news media are actually fulfilling the requirements that a well functioning democracy requires.\nCommercial mass media are generally not accountable to anybody but their owners, and they have no obligation to serve a democratic function. They are controlled mainly by economic market forces. Fierce economic competition may force the mass media to divert themselves from any democratic ideals and focus entirely on how to survive the competition.\nThe tabloidization and popularization of the news media is seen in an increasing focus on human examples rather than statistics and principles. There is more focus on politicians as personalities and less focus on political issues in the popular media. Election campaigns are covered more as horse races and less as debates about ideologies and issues. The dominating media focus on spin, conflict, and competitive strategies has made voters perceive the politicians as egoists rather than idealists. This fosters mistrust and a cynical attitude to politics, less civic engagement, and less interest in voting.\nThe ability to find effective political solutions to social problems is hampered when problems tend to be blamed on individuals rather than on structural causes.\nThis person-centered focus may have far-reaching consequences not only for domestic problems but also for foreign policy when international conflicts are blamed on foreign heads of state rather than on political and economic structures.\nA strong media focus on fear and terrorism has allowed military logic to penetrate public institutions, leading to increased surveillance and the erosion of civil rights.\nThe responsiveness and accountability of the democratic system is compromised when lack of access to substantive, diverse, and undistorted information is handicapping the citizens' capability of evaluating the political process.\nThe fast pace and trivialization in the competitive news media is dumbing down the political debate. Thorough and balanced investigation of complex political issues does not fit into this format. The political communication is characterized by short time horizons, short slogans, simple explanations, and simple solutions. This is conducive to political populism rather than serious deliberation.\nCommercial mass media are often differentiated along the political spectrum so that people can hear mainly opinions that they already agree with. Too much controversy and diverse opinions are not always profitable for the commercial news media.\nPolitical polarization is emerging when different people read different news and watch different TV channels. This polarization has been worsened by the emergence of the social media that allow people to communicate mainly with groups of like-minded people, the so-called echo chambers.\nExtreme political polarization may undermine the trust in democratic institutions, leading to erosion of civil rights and free speech and in some cases even reversion to autocracy.\nMany media scholars have discussed non-commercial news media with public service obligations as a means to improve the democratic process by providing the kind of political contents that a free market does not provide.\nThe World Bank has recommended public service broadcasting in order to strengthen democracy in developing countries. These broadcasting services should be accountable to an independent regulatory body that is adequately protected from interference from political and economic interests.\nPublic service media have an obligation to provide reliable information to voters. Many countries have publicly funded radio and television stations with public service obligations, especially in Europe and Japan, while such media are weak or non-existent in other countries including the US.\nSeveral studies have shown that the stronger the dominance of commercial broadcast media over public service media, the less the amount of policy-relevant information in the media and the more focus on horse race journalism, personalities, and the pecadillos of politicians. Public service broadcasters are characterized by more policy-relevant information and more respect for journalistic norms and impartiality than the commercial media. However, the trend of deregulation has put the public service model under increased pressure from competition with commercial media.\nThe emergence of the internet and the social media has profoundly altered the conditions for political communication. The social media have given ordinary citizens easy access to voice their opinion and share information while bypassing the filters of the large news media. This is often seen as an advantage for democracy. The new possibilities for communication have fundamentally changed the way social movements and protest movements operate and organize. The internet and social media have provided powerful new tools for democracy movements in developing countries and emerging democracies, enabling them to bypass censorship, voice their opinions, and organize protests.\nA serious problem with the social media is that they have no truth filters. The established news media have to guard their reputation as trustworthy, while ordinary citizens may post unreliable information. In fact, studies show that false stories are going more viral than true stories.\nThe proliferation of false stories and conspiracy theories may undermine public trust in the political system and public officials.\nReliable information sources are essential for the democratic process. Less democratic governments rely heavily on censorship, propaganda, and misinformation in order to stay in power, while independent sources of information are able to undermine their legitimacy.\nDemocracy promotion.\nDemocracy promotion can increase the quality of already existing democracies, reduce political apathy, and the chance of democratic backsliding. Democracy promotion measures include voting advice applications, participatory democracy, increasing youth suffrage, increasing civic education, reducing barriers to entry for new political parties, increasing proportionality and reducing presidentialism.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src = \"Column/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt; "}

{"id": "7962", "revid": "50435832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7962", "title": "Logical disjunction", "text": "Logical connective OR\n B, A \\downarrow B, \\overline{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;\n | XNOR | formula_1\n | \u2514 equivalent | formula_2\n | XOR | formula_3\n | \u2514 nonequivalent | formula_4\n | implies | formula_5\n | nonimplication\u00a0(NIMPLY) | formula_6\n | converse | formula_7\n | converse nonimplication | formula_8\nIn logic, disjunction (also known as logical disjunction, logical or, logical addition, or inclusive disjunction) is a logical connective typically notated as formula_9 and read aloud as \"or\". For instance, the English language sentence \"it is sunny or it is warm\" can be represented in logic using the disjunctive formula formula_10, assuming that formula_11 abbreviates \"it is sunny\" and formula_12 abbreviates \"it is warm\".\nIn classical logic, disjunction is given a truth functional semantics according to which a formula formula_13 is true unless both formula_14 and formula_15 are false. Because this semantics allows a disjunctive formula to be true when both of its disjuncts are true, it is an \"inclusive\" interpretation of disjunction, in contrast with exclusive disjunction. Classical proof theoretical treatments are often given in terms of rules such as disjunction introduction and disjunction elimination. Disjunction has also been given numerous non-classical treatments, motivated by problems including Aristotle's sea battle argument, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, as well as the numerous mismatches between classical disjunction and its nearest equivalents in natural languages.\nAn operand of a disjunction is a disjunct.\nInclusive and exclusive disjunction.\nBecause the logical \"or\" means a disjunction formula is true when either one or both of its parts are true, it is referred to as an \"inclusive\" disjunction. This is in contrast with an exclusive disjunction, which is true when one or the other of the arguments is true, but not both (referred to as \"exclusive or\", or \"XOR\").\nWhen it is necessary to clarify whether inclusive or exclusive \"or\" is intended, English speakers sometimes use the phrase \"and/or\". In terms of logic, this phrase is identical to \"or\", but makes the inclusion of both being true explicit.\nNotation.\nIn logic and related fields, disjunction is customarily notated with an infix operator formula_16 (Unicode ). Alternative notations include formula_17, used mainly in electronics, as well as formula_18 and formula_19 in many programming languages. The English word \"or\" is sometimes used as well, often in capital letters. In Jan \u0141ukasiewicz's prefix notation for logic, the operator is formula_20, short for Polish \"alternatywa\" (English: alternative).\nIn mathematics, the disjunction of an arbitrary number of elements formula_21 can be denoted as an iterated binary operation using a larger \u22c1 (Unicode ):\nformula_22\nClassical disjunction.\nSemantics.\nIn the semantics of logic, classical disjunction is a truth functional operation which returns the truth value \"true\" unless both of its arguments are \"false\". Its semantic entry is standardly given as follows:\n formula_23 \u00a0 \u00a0 if \u00a0 \u00a0 formula_24 \u00a0 \u00a0 or \u00a0 \u00a0 formula_25 \u00a0 \u00a0 or \u00a0 \u00a0 both\nThis semantics corresponds to the following truth table:\nDefined by other operators.\nIn classical logic systems where logical disjunction is not a primitive, it can be defined in terms of the primitive \"and\" (formula_26) and \"not\" (formula_27) as:\nformula_28.\nAlternatively, it may be defined in terms of \"implies\" (formula_29) and \"not\" as:\nformula_30.\nThe latter can be checked by the following truth table:\nIt may also be defined solely in terms of formula_29:\nformula_32.\nIt can be checked by the following truth table:\nProperties.\nThe following properties apply to disjunction:\nformula_36\nformula_37\nformula_38\nformula_41\nApplications in computer science.\nOperators corresponding to logical disjunction exist in most programming languages.\nBitwise operation.\nDisjunction is often used for bitwise operations. Examples:\nThe codice_1 operator can be used to set bits in a bit field to 1, by codice_1-ing the field with a constant field with the relevant bits set to 1. For example, codice_3 will force the final bit to 1, while leaving other bits unchanged.\nLogical operation.\nMany languages distinguish between bitwise and logical disjunction by providing two distinct operators; in languages following C, bitwise disjunction is performed with the single pipe operator (codice_4), and logical disjunction with the double pipe (codice_5) operator.\nLogical disjunction is usually short-circuited; that is, if the first (left) operand evaluates to codice_6, then the second (right) operand is not evaluated. The logical disjunction operator thus usually constitutes a sequence point.\nIn a parallel (concurrent) language, it is possible to short-circuit both sides: they are evaluated in parallel, and if one terminates with value true, the other is interrupted. This operator is thus called the \"parallel or\".\nAlthough the type of a logical disjunction expression is Boolean in most languages (and thus can only have the value codice_6 or codice_8), in some languages (such as Python and JavaScript), the logical disjunction operator returns one of its operands: the first operand if it evaluates to a true value, and the second operand otherwise. This allows it to fulfill the role of the Elvis operator.\nConstructive disjunction.\nThe Curry\u2013Howard correspondence relates a constructivist form of disjunction to tagged union types.\nSet theory.\nThe membership of an element of a union set in set theory is defined in terms of a logical disjunction: formula_42. Because of this, logical disjunction satisfies many of the same identities as set-theoretic union, such as associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and de Morgan's laws, identifying logical conjunction with set intersection, logical negation with set complement.\nNatural language.\nDisjunction in natural languages does not precisely match the interpretation of formula_16 in classical logic. Notably, classical disjunction is inclusive while natural language disjunction is often understood exclusively, as the following English example typically would be.\n* Mary is eating an apple or a pear.\nThis inference has sometimes been understood as an entailment, for instance by Alfred Tarski, who suggested that natural language disjunction is ambiguous between a classical and a nonclassical interpretation. More recent work in pragmatics has shown that this inference can be derived as a conversational implicature on the basis of a semantic denotation which behaves classically. However, disjunctive constructions including Hungarian \"vagy... vagy\" and French \"soit... soit\" have been argued to be inherently exclusive, rendering ungrammaticality in contexts where an inclusive reading would otherwise be forced.\nSimilar deviations from classical logic have been noted in cases such as free choice disjunction and simplification of disjunctive antecedents, where certain modal operators trigger a conjunction-like interpretation of disjunction. As with exclusivity, these inferences have been analyzed both as implicatures and as entailments arising from a nonclassical interpretation of disjunction.\n* You can have an apple or a pear.\nformula_44 You can have an apple and you can have a pear (but you cannot have both)\nIn many languages, disjunctive expressions play a role in question formation.\n* Is Mary a philosopher or a linguist?\nFor instance, while the above English example can be interpreted as a polar question asking whether it's true that Mary is either a philosopher or a linguist, it can also be interpreted as an alternative question asking which of the two professions is hers. The role of disjunction in these cases has been analyzed using nonclassical logics such as alternative semantics and inquisitive semantics, which have also been adopted to explain the free choice and simplification inferences.\nIn English, as in many other languages, disjunction is expressed by a coordinating conjunction. Other languages express disjunctive meanings in a variety of ways, though it is unknown whether disjunction itself is a linguistic universal. In many languages such as Dyirbal and Maricopa, disjunction is marked using a verb suffix. For instance, in the Maricopa example below, disjunction is marked by the suffix \"\u0161aa\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

If it is known that at least one of two statements is true, and that it is not the former that is true; we can infer that it has to be the latter that is true. Equivalently, if \"P\" is true or \"Q\" is true and \"P\" is false, then \"Q\" is true. The name \"disjunctive syllogism\" derives from its being a syllogism, a three-step argument, and the use of a logical disjunction (any \"or\" statement.) For example, \"P or Q\" is a disjunction, where P and Q are called the statement's \"disjuncts\". The rule makes it possible to eliminate a disjunction from a logical proof. It is the rule that\nformula_1\nwhere the rule is that whenever instances of \"formula_2\", and \"formula_3\" appear on lines of a proof, \"formula_4\" can be placed on a subsequent line.\nDisjunctive syllogism is closely related and similar to hypothetical syllogism, which is another rule of inference involving a syllogism. It is also related to the law of noncontradiction, one of the .\nFormal notation.\nFor a logical system that validates it, the \"disjunctive syllogism\" may be written in sequent notation as\n formula_5\nwhere formula_6 is a metalogical symbol meaning that formula_4 is a syntactic consequence of formula_2, and formula_9.\nIt may be expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem in the object language of propositional logic as\nformula_10\nwhere formula_11, and formula_4 are propositions expressed in some formal system.\nNatural language examples.\nHere is an example:\nHere is another example:\nStrong form.\n\"Modus tollendo ponens\" can be made stronger by using exclusive disjunction instead of inclusive disjunction as a premise:\nformula_13\nRelated argument forms.\nUnlike \"modus ponens\" and \"modus ponendo tollens\", with which it should not be confused, disjunctive syllogism is often not made an explicit rule or axiom of logical systems, as the above arguments can be proven with a combination of reductio ad absurdum and disjunction elimination.\nOther forms of syllogism include:\nDisjunctive syllogism holds in classical propositional logic and intuitionistic logic, but not in some paraconsistent logics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7964", "revid": "18481282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7964", "title": "Definition", "text": "Statement that attaches a meaning to a term\nA definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories: intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term), and extensional definitions (which try to list the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\nIn mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what the mathematical term is and is not. Definitions and axioms form the basis on which all of modern mathematics is to be constructed.\nBasic terminology.\nIn modern usage, a definition is something, typically expressed in words, that attaches a meaning to a word or group of words. The word or group of words that is to be defined is called the \"definiendum\", and the word, group of words, or action that defines it is called the \"definiens\". For example, in the definition \"An elephant is a large gray animal native to Asia and Africa\", the word \"elephant\" is the \"definiendum\", and everything after the word \"is\" is the \"definiens\".\nThe \"definiens\" is not \"the meaning\" of the word defined, but is instead something that \"conveys the same meaning\" as that word.\nThere are many sub-types of definitions, often specific to a given field of knowledge or study. These include, \"lexical definitions\", or the common dictionary definitions of words already in a language; \"demonstrative definitions\", which define something by pointing to an example of it (\"\"This,\" [said while pointing to a large grey animal], \"is an Asian elephant.\"\"); and \"precising definitions\", which reduce the vagueness of a word, typically in some special sense (\"'Large', among female Asian elephants, is any individual weighing over 5,500 pounds.\").\nIntensional definitions vs extensional definitions.\nAn \"intensional definition\", also called a \"connotative\" definition, specifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing to be a member of a specific set. Any definition that attempts to set out the essence of something, such as that by genus and differentia, is an intensional definition.\nAn \"extensional definition\", also called a \"denotative\" definition, of a concept or term specifies its \"extension\". It is a list naming every object that is a member of a specific set.\nThus, the \"seven deadly sins\" can be defined \"intensionally\" as those singled out by Pope Gregory I as particularly destructive of the life of grace and charity within a person, thus creating the threat of eternal damnation. An \"extensional\" definition, on the other hand, would be the list of wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. In contrast, while an intensional definition of \"prime minister\" might be \"the most senior minister of a cabinet in the executive branch of parliamentary government\", an extensional definition is not possible since it is not known who the future prime ministers will be (even though all prime ministers from the past and present can be listed).\nClasses of intensional definitions.\nA \"genus\u2013differentia definition\" is a type of intensional definition that takes a large category (the \"genus\") and narrows it down to a smaller category by a distinguishing characteristic (i.e. the \"differentia\").\nMore formally, a genus\u2013differentia definition consists of:\nFor example, consider the following genus\u2013differentia definitions:\nThose definitions can be expressed as a genus (\"a plane figure\") and two \"differentiae\" (\"that has three straight bounding sides\" and \"that has four straight bounding sides\", respectively).\nIt is also possible to have two different genus\u2013differentia definitions that describe the same term, especially when the term describes the overlap of two large categories. For instance, both of these genus\u2013differentia definitions of \"square\" are equally acceptable:\nThus, a \"square\" is a member of both genera (the plural of \"genus\"): the genus \"rectangle\" and the genus \"rhombus\".\nClasses of extensional definitions.\nOne important form of the extensional definition is \"ostensive definition\". This gives the meaning of a term by pointing, in the case of an individual, to the thing itself, or in the case of a class, to examples of the right kind. For example, one can explain who \"Alice\" (an individual) is, by pointing her out to another; or what a \"rabbit\" (a class) is, by pointing at several and expecting another to understand. The process of ostensive definition itself was critically appraised by Ludwig Wittgenstein.\nAn \"enumerative definition\" of a concept or a term is an \"extensional definition\" that gives an explicit and exhaustive listing of all the objects that fall under the concept or term in question. Enumerative definitions are only possible for finite sets (and only practical for small sets).\n\"Divisio\" and \"partitio\".\n\"Divisio\" and \"partitio\" are classical terms for definitions. A \"partitio\" is simply an intensional definition. A \"divisio\" is not an extensional definition, but an exhaustive list of subsets of a set, in the sense that every member of the \"divided\" set is a member of one of the subsets. An extreme form of \"divisio\" lists all sets whose only member is a member of the \"divided\" set. The difference between this and an extensional definition is that extensional definitions list \"members\", and not \"subsets\".\nNominal definitions vs real definitions.\nIn classical thought, a definition was taken to be a statement of the essence of a thing. Aristotle had it that an object's essential attributes form its \"essential nature\", and that a definition of the object must include these essential attributes.\nThe idea that a definition should state the essence of a thing led to the distinction between \"nominal\" and \"real\" essence\u2014a distinction originating with Aristotle. In the Posterior Analytics, he says that the meaning of a made-up name can be known (he gives the example \"goat stag\") without knowing what he calls the \"essential nature\" of the thing that the name would denote (if there were such a thing). This led medieval logicians to distinguish between what they called the \"quid nominis\", or the \"whatness of the name\", and the underlying nature common to all the things it names, which they called the \"quid rei\", or the \"whatness of the thing\". The name \"hobbit\", for example, is perfectly meaningful. It has a \"quid nominis\", but one could not know the real nature of hobbits, and so the \"quid rei\" of hobbits cannot be known. By contrast, the name \"man\" denotes real things (men) that have a certain \"quid rei\". The meaning of a name is distinct from the nature that a thing must have in order that the name apply to it.\nThis leads to a corresponding distinction between \"nominal\" and \"real\" definitions. A nominal definition is the definition explaining what a word means (i.e., which says what the \"nominal essence\" is), and is definition in the classical sense as given above. A real definition, by contrast, is one expressing the real nature or \"quid rei\" of the thing.\nThis preoccupation with essence dissipated in much of modern philosophy. Analytic philosophy, in particular, is critical of attempts to elucidate the essence of a thing. Russell described essence as \"a hopelessly muddle-headed notion\".\nMore recently Kripke's formalisation of possible world semantics in modal logic led to a new approach to essentialism. Insofar as the essential properties of a thing are \"necessary\" to it, they are those things that it possesses in all possible worlds. Kripke refers to names used in this way as rigid designators.\nOperational vs. theoretical definitions.\nA definition may also be classified as an operational definition or theoretical definition.\nTerms with multiple definitions.\nHomonyms.\nA homonym is, in the strict sense, one of a group of words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings. Thus homonyms are simultaneously homographs (words that share the same spelling, regardless of their pronunciation) \"and\" homophones (words that share the same pronunciation, regardless of their spelling). The state of being a homonym is called \"homonymy\". Examples of homonyms are the pair \"stalk\" (part of a plant) and \"stalk\" (follow/harass a person) and the pair \"left\" (past tense of leave) and \"left\" (opposite of right). A distinction is sometimes made between \"true\" homonyms, which are unrelated in origin, such as \"skate\" (glide on ice) and \"skate\" (the fish), and polysemous homonyms, or polysemes, which have a shared origin, such as \"mouth\" (of a river) and \"mouth\" (of an animal).\nPolysemes.\nPolysemy is the capacity for a sign (such as a word, phrase, or symbol) to have multiple meanings (that is, multiple semes or sememes and thus multiple senses), usually related by contiguity of meaning within a semantic field. It is thus usually regarded as distinct from homonymy, in which the multiple meanings of a word may be unconnected or unrelated.\nIn logic, mathematics and computing.\nIn mathematics, definitions are generally not used to describe existing terms, but to describe or characterize a concept. For naming the object of a definition mathematicians can use either a neologism (this was mainly the case in the past) or words or phrases of the common language (this is generally the case in modern mathematics). The precise meaning of a term given by a mathematical definition is often different from the English definition of the word used, which can lead to confusion, particularly when the meanings are close. For example, a set is not exactly the same thing in mathematics and in common language. In some case, the word used can be misleading; for example, a real number has nothing more (or less) real than an imaginary number. Frequently, a definition uses a phrase built with common English words, which has no meaning outside mathematics, such as primitive group or irreducible variety.\nIn first-order logic definitions are usually introduced using extension by definition (so using a metalogic). On the other hand, lambda-calculi are a kind of logic where the definitions are included as the feature of the formal system itself.\nClassification.\nAuthors have used different terms to classify definitions used in formal languages like mathematics. Norman Swartz classifies a definition as \"stipulative\" if it is intended to guide a specific discussion. A stipulative definition might be considered a temporary, working definition, and can only be disproved by showing a logical contradiction. In contrast, a \"descriptive\" definition can be shown to be \"right\" or \"wrong\" with reference to general usage.\nSwartz defines a \"precising definition\" as one that extends the descriptive dictionary definition (lexical definition) for a specific purpose by including additional criteria. A precising definition narrows the set of things that meet the definition.\nC.L. Stevenson has identified \"persuasive definition\" as a form of stipulative definition which purports to state the \"true\" or \"commonly accepted\" meaning of a term, while in reality stipulating an altered use (perhaps as an argument for some specific belief). Stevenson has also noted that some definitions are \"legal\" or \"coercive\"\u00a0\u2013 their object is to create or alter rights, duties, or crimes.\nRecursive definitions.\nA recursive definition, sometimes also called an \"inductive\" definition, is one that defines a word in terms of itself, so to speak, albeit in a useful way. Normally this consists of three steps:\nFor instance, we could define a natural number as follows (after Peano): \nSo \"0\" will have exactly one successor, which for convenience can be called \"1\". In turn, \"1\" will have exactly one successor, which could be called \"2\", and so on. The second condition in the definition itself refers to natural numbers, and hence involves self-reference. Although this sort of definition involves a form of circularity, it is not vicious, and the definition has been quite successful.\nIn the same way, we can define ancestor as follows:\nOr simply: an ancestor is a parent or a parent of an ancestor.\nIn medicine.\nIn medical dictionaries, guidelines and other consensus statements and classifications, definitions should as far as possible be:\nProblems.\nCertain rules have traditionally been given for definitions (in particular, genus-differentia definitions).\nLimitations of definition.\nGiven that a natural language such as English contains, at any given time, a finite number of words, any comprehensive list of definitions must either be circular or rely upon primitive notions. If every term of every \"definiens\" must itself be defined, \"where at last should we stop?\" A dictionary, for instance, insofar as it is a comprehensive list of lexical definitions, must resort to circularity.\nMany philosophers have chosen instead to leave some terms undefined. The scholastic philosophers claimed that the highest genera (called the ten \"generalissima\") cannot be defined, since a higher genus cannot be assigned under which they may fall. Thus being, unity and similar concepts cannot be defined. Locke supposes in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" that the names of simple concepts do not admit of any definition. More recently Bertrand Russell sought to develop a formal language based on logical atoms. Other philosophers, notably Wittgenstein, rejected the need for any undefined simples. Wittgenstein pointed out in his \"Philosophical Investigations\" that what counts as a \"simple\" in one circumstance might not do so in another. He rejected the very idea that every explanation of the meaning of a term needed itself to be explained: \"As though an explanation hung in the air unless supported by another one\", claiming instead that explanation of a term is only needed to avoid misunderstanding.\nLocke and Mill also argued that individuals cannot be defined. Names are learned by connecting an idea with a sound, so that speaker and hearer have the same idea when the same word is used. This is not possible when no one else is acquainted with the particular thing that has \"fallen under our notice\". Russell offered his theory of descriptions in part as a way of defining a proper name, the definition being given by a definite description that \"picks out\" exactly one individual. Saul Kripke pointed to difficulties with this approach, especially in relation to modality, in his book \"Naming and Necessity\".\nThere is a presumption in the classic example of a definition that the \"definiens\" can be stated. Wittgenstein argued that for some terms this is not the case. The examples he used include \"game\", \"number\" and \"family\". In such cases, he argued, there is no fixed boundary that can be used to provide a definition. Rather, the items are grouped together because of a family resemblance. For terms such as these it is not possible and indeed not necessary to state a definition; rather, one simply comes to understand the \"use\" of the term.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7966", "revid": "35498457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7966", "title": "Disco", "text": "Music genre\nDisco is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the late 1960s from the United States' urban nightlife scene, particularly in African-American, Italian-American, Latino and queer communities. Its sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats, syncopated basslines, string sections, brass and horns, electric pianos, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars.\nDiscoth\u00e8ques as a venue were mostly a French invention, imported to the United States with the opening of Le Club, a members-only restaurant and nightclub located at 416 East 55th Street in Manhattan, by French expatriate Olivier Coquelin, on New Year's Eve 1960.\nDisco music as a genre started as a mixture of music from venues popular among African Americans, Latino Americans, and Italian Americans in New York City (especially Brooklyn) and Philadelphia during the late 1960s to the mid-to-late 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction by the 1960s counterculture to both the dominance of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music at the time. Several dance styles were developed during the period of '70s disco's popularity in the United States, including \"the Bump\", \"the Hustle\", \"the Watergate\", \"the Continental\", and \"the Busstop\".\nDuring the 1970s, disco music was developed further, mainly by artists from the United States as well as from Europe. While performers garnered public attention, record producers working behind the scenes played an important role in developing the genre. By the late 1970s, most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, and DJs would mix dance records at clubs such as Studio 54 in Manhattan, a venue popular among celebrities. Nightclub-goers often wore expensive, extravagant outfits, consisting predominantly of loose, flowing pants or dresses for ease of movement while dancing. There was also a thriving drug subculture in the disco scene, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as cocaine and quaaludes, the latter being so common in disco subculture that they were nicknamed \"disco biscuits\". Disco clubs were also associated with promiscuity as a reflection of the sexual revolution of this era in popular history. Films such as \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) and \"Thank God It's Friday\" (1978) contributed to disco's mainstream popularity.\nDisco declined as a major trend in popular music in the United States following the infamous Disco Demolition Night on July 12, 1979, and it continued to sharply decline in popularity in the U.S. during the early 1980s; however, it remained popular in Italy and some European countries throughout the 1980s, and during this time also started becoming trendy in places elsewhere including India and the Middle East, where aspects of disco were blended with regional folk styles such as \"ghazals\" and belly dancing. Disco would eventually become a key influence in the development of electronic dance music, house music, hip-hop, new wave, dance-punk, and post-disco. The style has had several revivals since the 1990s, and the influence of disco remains strong across American and European pop music. A revival has been underway since the early 2010s, coming to great popularity in the early 2020s. Modern day artists have continued the genre's popularity, bringing it to a whole new younger generation.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"disco\" is shorthand for the word \"discoth\u00e8que\", a French word for \"library of phonograph records\" derived from \"biblioth\u00e8que\". The word \"discotheque\" had the same meaning in English in the 1950s. \"Discoth\u00e8que\" became used in French for a type of nightclub in Paris, after they had resorted to playing records during the Nazi occupation in the early 1940s. Some clubs used it as their proper name. In 1960, it was also used to describe a Parisian nightclub in an English magazine.\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines \"Discotheque\" as \"A dance hall, nightclub, or similar venue where recorded music is played for dancing, typically equipped with a large dance floor, an elaborate system of flashing coloured lights, and a powerful amplified sound system. \" Its earliest example is use as the name of a particular venue in 1952, and other examples date from 1960 onwards. The entry is annotated as \"Now somewhat dated\". It defines \"Disco\" as \"A genre of strongly rhythmical pop music mainly intended for dancing in nightclubs and particularly popular in the mid to late 1970s.\", with use from 1975 onwards, describing the origin of the word as a shortened form of \"discotheque\".\nIn the summer of 1964, a short sleeveless dress called the \"discotheque dress\" was briefly very popular in the United States. The earliest known use for the abbreviated form \"disco\" described this dress and has been found in \"The Salt Lake Tribune\" on July 12, 1964; \"Playboy\" magazine used it in September of the same year to describe Los Angeles nightclubs.\nVince Aletti was one of the first to describe disco as a sound or a music genre. He wrote the 13 September 1973 feature article \"Discotheque Rock '72: Paaaaarty!\" that appeared in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.\nMusical characteristics.\nThe music typically layered soaring, often-reverberated vocals, often doubled by horns, over a background \"pad\" of electric pianos and \"chicken-scratch\" rhythm guitars played on an electric guitar. Lead guitar features less frequently in disco than in rock. \"The \"rooster scratch\" sound is achieved by lightly pressing the guitar strings against the fretboard and then quickly releasing them just enough to get a slightly muted poker [sound] while constantly strumming very close to the bridge.\" Other backing keyboard instruments include the piano, electric organ (during early years), string synthesizers, and electromechanical keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes electric piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, and Hohner Clavinet. Donna Summer's 1977 song \"I Feel Love\", produced by Giorgio Moroder with a prominent Moog synthesizer on the beat, was one of the first disco tracks to use the synthesizer.\nThe rhythm is laid down by prominent, syncopated basslines (with heavy use of broken octaves, that is, octaves with the notes sounded one after the other) played on the bass guitar and by drummers using a drum kit, African/Latin percussion, and electronic drums such as Simmons and Roland drum modules. In Philly dance and Salsoul disco, the sound was enriched with solo lines and harmony parts played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as violin, viola, cello, trumpet, saxophone, trombone, flugelhorn, French horn, English horn, oboe, flute, timpani and synth strings, string section or a full string orchestra.\nMost disco songs have a steady four-on-the-floor beat set by a bass drum, a quaver or semi-quaver hi-hat pattern with an open hissing hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. A recording error in the 1975 song \"Bad Luck\" by Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes where Earl Young's hi-hat was too loud in the recording is said to have established loud hi-hats in disco. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba, and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin polyrhythms, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar and may be implied rather than explicitly present.\nSongs often use syncopation, which is the accenting of unexpected beats. In general, the difference between disco, or any dance song, and a rock or pop song is that in dance music the bass drum hits \"four to the floor\", at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure). Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes (as shown in the second drum pattern in the picture above, after a typical rock drum pattern).\nThe orchestral sound usually known as \"disco sound\" relies heavily on string sections and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background \"pad\" sound defining the harmony progression. Typically, all of the doubling of parts and use of additional instruments creates a rich \"wall of sound\". There are, however, more minimalist flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation.\nHarmonically, disco music typically contains major and minor seven chords, which are found more often in jazz than pop music.\nProduction.\nThe \"disco sound\" was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece-band sound of funk, soul music of the late 1960s or the small jazz organ trios, disco music often included a large band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a horn section, a string orchestra, and a variety of \"classical\" solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).\nDisco songs were arranged and composed by experienced arrangers and orchestrators, and record producers added their creative touches to the overall sound using multitrack recording techniques and effects units. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a conductor, copyists, record producers, and mixing engineers. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process because disco songs used as many as 64 tracks of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers and record producers, under the direction of arrangers, compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with builds and breaks. Mixing engineers and record producers helped to develop the \"disco sound\" by creating a distinctive-sounding, sophisticated disco mix.\nEarly records were the \"standard\" three-minute version until Tom Moulton came up with a way to make songs longer so that he could take a crowd of dancers at a club to another level and keep them dancing longer. He found that it was impossible to make the 45-RPM vinyl singles of the time longer, as they could usually hold no more than five\u00a0minutes of good-quality music. With the help of Jos\u00e9 Rodriguez, his remaster/mastering engineer, he pressed a single on a 10\" disc instead of 7\". They cut the next single on a 12\" disc, the same format as a standard album. Moulton and Rodriguez discovered that these larger records could have much longer songs and remixes. 12\" single records, also known as \"Maxi singles\", quickly became the standard format for all DJs of the disco genre.\nClub culture.\nNightclubs.\nBy the late 1970s, most major US cities had thriving disco club scenes. The largest scenes were most notably in New York City but also in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Miami, and Washington, D.C. The scene was centered on discotheques, nightclubs and private loft parties.\nIn the 1970s, notable discos included \"Crisco Disco\", \"The Sanctuary\", \"Leviticus\", \"Studio 54\", and \"Paradise Garage\" in New York, \"Artemis\" in Philadelphia, \"Studio One\" in Los Angeles, \"Dugan's Bistro\" in Chicago, and \"The Library\" in Atlanta.\nIn the late 1970s, Studio 54 in Midtown Manhattan was arguably the best-known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and nightclub culture in general. It was operated by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager and was notorious for the hedonism that went on within: the balconies were known for sexual encounters and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the \"Man in the Moon\" that included an animated cocaine spoon.\nThe \"Copacabana\", another New York nightclub dating to the 1940s, had a revival in the late 1970s when it embraced disco; it would become the setting of a Barry Manilow song of the same name.\nIn Washington, D.C., large disco clubs such as \"The Pier\" (\"Pier 9\") and \"The Other Side\", originally regarded exclusively as \"gay bars\", became particularly popular among the capital area's gay and straight college students in the late '70s.\nBy 1979 there were 15,000-20,000 disco nightclubs in the US, many of them opening in suburban shopping centers, hotels, and restaurants. The 2001 Club franchises were the most prolific chain of disco clubs in the country. Although many other attempts were made to franchise disco clubs, 2001 was the only one to successfully do so in this time frame.\nSound and light equipment.\nPowerful, bass-heavy, hi-fi sound systems were viewed as a key part of the disco club experience. The Loft party host David Mancuso introduced the technologies of tweeter arrays (clusters of small loudspeakers, which emit high-end frequencies, positioned above the floor) and bass reinforcements (additional sets of subwoofers positioned at ground level) at the start of the 1970s to boost the treble and bass at opportune moments, and by the end of the decade sound engineers such as Richard Long had multiplied the effects of these innovations in venues such as the Garage.\"\nTypical lighting designs for disco dance floors include multi-colored lights that swirl around or flash to the beat, strobe lights, an illuminated dance floor, and a mirror ball.\nDJs.\nDisco-era disc jockeys (DJs) would often remix existing songs using reel-to-reel tape machines, and add in percussion breaks, new sections, and new sounds. DJs would select songs and grooves according to what the dancers wanted, transitioning from one song to another with a DJ mixer and using a microphone to introduce songs and speak to the audiences. Other equipment was added to the basic DJ setup, providing unique sound manipulations, such as reverb, equalization, and echo effects unit. Using this equipment, a DJ could do effects such as cutting out all but the bassline of a song and then slowly mixing in the beginning of another song using the DJ mixer's crossfader. Notable U.S. disco DJs include Francis Grasso of The Sanctuary, David Mancuso of The Loft, Frankie Knuckles of the Chicago Warehouse, Larry Levan of the Paradise Garage, Nicky Siano of The Gallery, Walter Gibbons, Karen Mixon Cook, Jim Burgess, John \"Jellybean\" Benitez, Richie Kulala of Studio 54, and Rick Salsalini.\nSome DJs were also record producers who created and produced disco songs in the recording studio. Larry Levan, for example, was a prolific record producer as well as a DJ. Because record sales were often dependent on dance floor play by DJs in the nightclubs, DJs were also influential in the development and popularization of certain types of disco music being produced for record labels.\nDance.\nIn the early years, dancers in discos danced in a \"hang loose\" or \"freestyle\" approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the \"Bump\", \"Penguin\", \"Boogaloo\", \"Watergate\", and \"Robot\". By October 1975 the Hustle reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated, and overtly sexual. Variations included the Brooklyn Hustle, New York Hustle, and Latin Hustle.\nDuring the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free dance lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as \"touch dancing\", \"the hustle\", and \"the cha cha\". The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book \"The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing\" (Warner Books 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as dance forms and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner, and line dances. The book hit the \"New York Times\" bestseller list for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German, and French.\nIn Chicago, the \"Step By Step\" disco dance TV show was launched with the sponsorship support of the Coca-Cola company. Produced in the same studio that Don Cornelius used for the nationally syndicated dance/music television show, \"Soul Train\", \"Step by Step\"'s audience grew and the show became a success. The dynamic dance duo of Robin and Reggie led the show. The pair spent the week teaching disco dancing to dancers in the disco clubs. The instructional show aired on Saturday mornings and had a strong following. Its viewers would stay up all night on Fridays so they could be on the set the next morning, ready to return to the disco on Saturday night knowing with the latest personalized steps. The producers of the show, John Reid and Greg Roselli, routinely made appearances at disco functions with Robin and Reggie to scout out new dancing talent and promote upcoming events such as \"Disco Night at White Sox Park\".\nIn Sacramento, California, Disco King Paul Dale Roberts danced for the Guinness Book of World Records. He danced for 205 hours, the equivalent of 8\u00bd days. Other dance marathons took place afterward and Roberts held the world record for disco dancing for a short period of time.\nDisco was influenced by art with the atypical song \"Bend It\" (1969) by British artists Gilbert &amp; George. With the song comes special dance moves that blurrs the distinction between art and pop culture in a way never seen before.\nSome notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included Pan's People and Hot Gossip. For many dancers, a key source of inspiration for 1970s disco dancing was the film \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977). Further influence came from the music and dance style of such films as \"Fame\" (1980), \"Disco Dancer\" (1982), \"Flashdance\" (1983), and \"The Last Days of Disco\" (1998). Interest in disco dancing also helped spawn dance competition TV shows such as \"Dance Fever\" (1979).\nFashion.\nDisco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discoth\u00e8que-goers often wore glamorous, expensive, and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco club. Some women would wear sheer, flowing dresses, such as Halston dresses, or loose, flared pants. Other women wore tight, revealing, sexy clothes, such as backless halter tops, disco pants, \"hot pants\", or body-hugging spandex bodywear or \"catsuits\". Men would wear shiny polyester Qiana shirts with colorful patterns and pointy, extra wide collars, preferably open at the chest. Men often wore Pierre Cardin suits, three piece suits with a vest, and double-knit polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the leisure suit. Men's leisure suits were typically form-fitted to some parts of the body, such as the waist and bottom while the lower part of the pants were flared in a bell bottom style, to permit freedom of movement.\nDuring the disco era, men engaged in elaborate grooming rituals and spent time choosing fashion clothing, activities that would have been considered \"feminine\" according to the gender stereotypes of the era. Women dancers wore glitter makeup, sequins, or gold lam\u00e9 clothing that would shimmer under the lights. Bold colors were popular for both genders. Platform shoes and boots for both genders and high heels for women were popular footwear. Necklaces and medallions were a common fashion accessory. Less commonly, some disco dancers wore outlandish costumes, dressed in drag, covered their bodies with gold or silver paint, or wore very skimpy outfits leaving them nearly nude; these uncommon get-ups were more likely to be seen at invitation-only New York City loft parties and disco clubs.\nDrug subculture.\nIn addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving club drug subculture, particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud, bass-heavy music and the flashing colored lights, such as cocaine (nicknamed \"blow\"), amyl nitrite (\"poppers\"), and the \"...\u00a0other quintessential 1970s club drug Quaalude, which suspended motor coordination and gave the sensation that one's arms and legs had turned to 'Jell-O.'\" Quaaludes were so popular at disco clubs that the drug was nicknamed \"disco biscuits\".\nPaul Gootenberg states that \"[t]he relationship of cocaine to 1970s disco culture cannot be stressed enough...\" During the 1970s, the use of cocaine by well-to-do celebrities led to its \"glamorization\" and to the widely held view that it was a \"soft drug\". LSD, marijuana, and \"speed\" (amphetamines) were also popular in disco clubs, and the use of these drugs \"...contributed to the hedonistic quality of the dance floor experience.\" Since disco dances were typically held in liquor licensed-nightclubs and dance clubs, alcoholic drinks were also consumed by dancers; some users intentionally combined alcohol with the consumption of other drugs, such as Quaaludes, for a stronger effect.\nEroticism and sexual liberation.\nAccording to Peter Braunstein, the \"massive quantities of drugs ingested in discoth\u00e8ques produced the next cultural phenomenon of the disco era: rampant promiscuity and public sex. While the dance floor was the central arena of seduction, actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit stairwells, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of 'main course' in a hedonist's menu for a night out.\" At The Saint nightclub, a high percentage of the gay male dancers and patrons would have sex in the club; they typically had unprotected sex, because in 1980, HIV-AIDS had not yet been identified. At The Saint, \"dancers would elope to an unpoliced upstairs balcony to engage in sex.\" The promiscuity and public sex at discos was part of a broader trend towards exploring a freer sexual expression in the 1970s, an era that is also associated with \"swingers clubs, hot tubs, [and] key parties.\"\nIn his paper, \"In Defense of Disco\" (1979), Richard Dyer claims eroticism as one of the three main characteristics of disco. As opposed to rock music which has a very phallic centered eroticism focusing on the sexual pleasure of men over other persons, Dyer describes disco as featuring a non-phallic full body eroticism. Through a range of percussion instruments, a willingness to play with rhythm, and the endless repeating of phrases without cutting the listener off, disco achieved this full-body eroticism by restoring eroticism to the whole body for both sexes. This allowed for the potential expression of sexualities not defined by the cock/penis, and the erotic pleasure of bodies that are not defined by a relationship to a penis. The sexual liberation expressed through the rhythm of disco is further represented in the club spaces that disco grew within.\nIn Peter Shapiro's \": Throbbing Words on Sound\", he discusses eroticism through the technology disco utilizes to create its audacious sound. The music, Shapiro states, is adjunct to \"the pleasure-is-politics ethos of post-Stonewall culture.\" He explains how \"mechano-eroticism\", which links the technology used to create the unique mechanical sound of disco to eroticism, set the genre in a new dimension of reality living outside of naturalism and heterosexuality. Randy Jones and Mark Jacobsen echo this sentiment in BBC Radio's \"The Politics of Dancing: How Disco Changed the World,\" describing the loose, hip-focused dance style as \"a new kind of communion\" that celebrates the sparks of liberation brought on the Stonewall riots. As New York state had laws against homosexual behavior in public, including dancing with a member of the same sex, the eroticism of disco served as resistance and an expression of sexual freedom.\nHe uses Donna Summer's singles \"Love to Love You Baby\" (1975) and \"I Feel Love\" (1977) as examples of the ever-present relationship between the synthesized bass lines and backgrounds to the simulated sounds of orgasms. Summer's voice echoes in the tracks, and likens them to the drug-fervent, sexually liberated fans of disco who sought to free themselves through disco's \"aesthetic of machine sex.\" Shapiro sees this as an influence that creates sub-genres like hi-NRG and dub-disco, which allowed for eroticism and technology to be further explored through intense synth bass lines and alternative rhythmic techniques that tap into the entire body rather than the obvious erotic parts of the body.\nThe New York nightclub The Sanctuary under resident DJ Francis Grasso is a prime example of this sexual liberty. In their history of the disc jockey and club culture, Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton describe the Sanctuary as \"poured full of newly liberated gay men, then shaken (and stirred) by a weighty concoction of dance music and pharmacoia of pills and potions, the result is a festivaly of carnality.\" The Sanctuary was the \"first totally uninhibited gay discotheque in America\" and while sex was not allowed on the dancefloor, the dark corners, bathrooms. and hallways of the adjacent buildings were all utilized for orgy-like sexual engagements.\nBy describing the music, drugs, and liberated mentality as a trifecta coming together to create the festival of carnality, Brewster and Broughton are inciting all three as stimuli for the dancing, sex, and other embodied movements that contributed to the corporeal vibrations within the Sanctuary. It supports the argument that disco music took a role in facilitating this sexual liberation that was experienced in the discotheques. The recent legalization of abortion and the introduction of antibiotics and the pill facilitated a culture shift around sex from one of procreation to pleasure and enjoyment. Thus was fostered a very sex-positive framework around discotheques.\nFurther, in addition to gay sex being illegal in New York state, until 1973 the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as an illness. This law and classification coupled together can be understood to have heavily dissuaded the expression of queerness in public, as such the liberatory dynamics of discotheques can be seen as having provided space for self-realization for queer persons. David Mancuso's club/house party, The Loft, was described as having a \"pansexual attitude [that] was revolutionary in a country where up until recently it had been illegal for two men to dance together unless there was a woman present; where women were legally obliged to wear at least one recognizable item of female clothing in public; and where men visiting gay bars usually carried bail money with them.\"\nHistory.\n1940s\u20131960s: First discotheques.\nDisco was mostly developed from music that was popular on the dance floor in clubs that started playing records instead of having a live band. The first discotheques mostly played swing music. Later on, uptempo rhythm and blues became popular in American clubs and northern soul and glam rock records in the UK. In the early 1940s, nightclubs in Paris resorted to playing jazz records during the Nazi occupation.\nR\u00e9gine Zylberberg claimed to have started the first discotheque and to have been the first club DJ in 1953 in the \"Whisky \u00e0 Go-Go\" in Paris. She installed a dance floor with colored lights and two turntables so she could play records without having a gap in the music. In October 1959, the owner of the Scotch Club in Aachen, West Germany chose to install a record player for the opening night instead of hiring a live band. The patrons were unimpressed until a young reporter, who happened to be covering the opening of the club, impulsively took control of the record player and introduced the records that he chose to play. Klaus Quirini later claimed to thus have been the world's first nightclub DJ.\n1960s\u20131974: Precursors and early disco music.\nDuring the 1960s, discotheque dancing became a European trend that was enthusiastically picked up by the American press. At this time, when the discotheque culture from Europe became popular in the United States, several music genres with danceable rhythms rose to popularity and evolved into different sub-genres: rhythm and blues (originated in the 1940s), soul (late 1950s and 1960s), funk (mid-1960s) and go-go (mid-1960s and 1970s; more than \"disco\", the word \"go-go\" originally indicated a music club). Musical genres that were primarily performed by African-American musicians would influence much of early disco.\nAlso during the 1960s, the Motown record label developed its own approach, described as having \"1) simply structured songs with sophisticated melodies and chord changes, 2) a relentless four-beat drum pattern, 3) a gospel use of background voices, vaguely derived from the style of the Impressions, 4) a regular and sophisticated use of both horns and strings, 5) lead singers who were halfway between pop and gospel music, 6) a group of accompanying musicians who were among the most dextrous, knowledgeable, and brilliant in all of popular music (Motown bassists have long been the envy of white rock bassists) and 7) a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio.\" Motown had many hits with disco elements by acts like Eddie Kendricks (\"Girl You Need a Change of Mind\" in 1972, \"Keep on Truckin'\" in 1973, \"Boogie Down\" in 1974).\nAt the end of the 1960s, musicians, and audiences from the Black, Italian, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the hippie and psychedelia subcultures. They included using music venues with a loud, overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, trippy lighting, colorful costumes, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs. In addition, the perceived positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the hippies informed proto-disco music like MFSB's album \"Love Is the Message\".\nPartly through the success of Jimi Hendrix, psychedelic elements that were popular in rock music of the late 1960s found their way into soul and early funk music and formed the subgenre psychedelic soul. Examples can be found in the music of the Chambers Brothers, George Clinton with his Parliament-Funkadelic collective, Sly and the Family Stone, and the productions of Norman Whitfield with The Temptations.\nThe long instrumental introductions and detailed orchestration found in psychedelic soul tracks by the Temptations are also considered as cinematic soul. In the early 1970s, Curtis Mayfield and Isaac Hayes scored hits with cinematic soul songs that were actually composed for movie soundtracks: \"Superfly\" (1972) and \"Theme from Shaft\" (1971). The latter is sometimes regarded as an early disco song. From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Philadelphia soul developed as a sub-genre that also had lavish percussion, lush string orchestra arrangements, and expensive record production processes. In the early 1970s, the Philadelphia soul productions by Gamble and Huff evolved from the simpler arrangements of the late-1960s into a style featuring lush strings, thumping basslines, and sliding hi-hat rhythms. These elements would become typical for disco music and are found in several of the hits they produced in the early 1970s:\nOther early disco tracks that helped shape disco and became popular on the dance floors of (underground) discotheque clubs and parties include: \nEarly disco was dominated by record producers and labels such as Salsoul Records (Ken, Stanley, and Joseph Cayre), West End Records (Mel Cheren), Casablanca (Neil Bogart), and Prelude (Marvin Schlachter). The genre was also shaped by Tom Moulton, who wanted to extend the enjoyment of dance songs \u2014 thus creating the extended mix or \"remix\", going from a three-minute 45 rpm single to the much longer 12\" record. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the \"disco sound\" included David Mancuso, Nicky Siano, Shep Pettibone, Larry Levan, Walter Gibbons, and Chicago-based Frankie Knuckles. Frankie Knuckles was not only an important disco DJ; he also helped to develop house music in the 1980s.\nDisco hit the television airwaves as part of the music/dance variety show \"Soul Train\" in 1971 hosted by Don Cornelius, then Marty Angelo's \"Disco Step-by-Step Television Show\" in 1975, Steve Marcus's \"Disco Magic/Disco 77\", Eddie Rivera's \"Soap Factory\", and Merv Griffin's \"Dance Fever\", hosted by Deney Terrio, who is credited with teaching actor John Travolta to dance for his role in the film \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977), as well as DANCE, based out of Columbia, South Carolina.\nIn 1974, New York City's WPIX-FM premiered the first disco radio show.\nEarly disco culture in the United States.\nIn the 1970s, the key counterculture of the 1960s, the hippie movement, was fading away. The economic prosperity of the previous decade had declined, and unemployment, inflation, and crime rates had soared. Political issues like the backlash from the Civil Rights Movement culminating in the form of , the Vietnam War, the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy, and the Watergate scandal, left many feeling disillusioned and hopeless. The start of the '70s was marked by a shift in the consciousness of the American people: the rise of the feminist movement, identity politics, gangs, etc. very much shaped this era. Disco music and disco dancing provided an escape from negative social and economic issues. Yet, Bench Ansfield argues that disco also reflected those social currents: for instance, in the genre's frequent reference to fire and heat during a decade when American cities were burning down en masse.\nIn \"Beautiful Things in Popular Culture\", Simon Frith highlights the sociability of disco and its roots in 1960s counterculture. \"The driving force of the New York underground dance scene in which disco was forged was not simply that city's complex ethnic and sexual culture but also a 1960s notion of community, pleasure and generosity that can only be described as hippie\", he says. \"The best disco music contained within it a remarkably powerful sense of collective euphoria.\" \nThe non-partnered dance style of disco music allowed people of all races and sexual orientations to enjoy the dancefloor atmosphere.\nThe explosion of disco is often claimed to be found in the private dance parties held by New York City DJ David Mancuso's home that became known as The Loft, an invitation-only non-commercial underground club that inspired many others. He organized the first major party in his Manhattan home on Valentine's Day 1970 with the name \"Love Saves The Day\". After some months the parties became weekly events and Mancuso continued to give regular parties into the 1990s. Mancuso required that the music played had to be soulful, rhythmic, and impart words of hope, redemption, or pride.\nWhen Mancuso threw his first informal house parties, the gay community (which made up much of The Loft's attendee roster) was often harassed in the gay bars and dance clubs, with many gay men carrying bail money with them to gay bars. But at The Loft and many other early, private discotheques, they could dance together without fear of police action thanks to Mancuso's underground, yet legal, policies. Vince Aletti described it \"like going to party, completely mixed, racially and sexually, where there wasn't any sense of someone being more important than anyone else,\" and Alex Rosner reiterated this saying \"It was probably about sixty percent black and seventy percent gay...There was a mix of sexual orientation, there was a mix of races, mix of economic groups. A real mix, where the common denominator was music.\"\nFilm critic Roger Ebert called the popular embrace of disco's exuberant dance moves an escape from \"the general depression and drabness of the political and musical atmosphere of the late seventies.\" Pauline Kael, writing about the disco-themed film \"Saturday Night Fever\", said the film and disco itself touched on \"something deeply romantic, the need to move, to dance, and the need to be who you'd like to be. Nirvana is the dance; when the music stops, you return to being ordinary.\"\nEarly disco culture in the United Kingdom.\nIn the late 1960s, uptempo soul with heavy beats and some associated dance styles and fashion were picked up in the British mod scene and formed the northern soul movement. Originating at venues such as the Twisted Wheel in Manchester, it quickly spread to other UK dancehalls and nightclubs like the Chateau Impney (Droitwich), Catacombs (Wolverhampton), the Highland Rooms at Blackpool Mecca, Golden Torch (Stoke-on-Trent), and Wigan Casino. As the favoured beat became more uptempo and frantic in the early 1970s, northern soul dancing became more athletic, somewhat resembling the later dance styles of disco and break dancing. Featuring spins, flips, karate kicks, and backdrops, club dancing styles were often inspired by the stage performances of touring American soul acts such as Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials and Jackie Wilson.\nIn 1974, there were an estimated 25,000 mobile discos and 40,000 professional disc jockeys in the United Kingdom. Mobile discos were hired deejays that brought their own equipment to provide music for special events. Glam rock tracks were popular, with, for example, Gary Glitter's 1972 single \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" becoming popular on UK dance floors while it did not get much radio airplay.\n1974\u20131977: Rise to mainstream.\nFrom 1974 to 1977, disco music increased in popularity as many disco songs topped the charts. The Hues Corporation's \"Rock the Boat\" (1974), a US number-one single and million-seller, was one of the early disco songs to reach number one. The same year saw the release of \"Kung Fu Fighting\", performed by Carl Douglas and produced by Biddu, which reached number one in both the UK and US, and became the best-selling single of the year and one of the best-selling singles of all time with 11\u00a0million records sold worldwide, helping to popularize disco to a great extent. Another notable disco success that year was George McCrae's \"Rock Your Baby\": it became the United Kingdom's first number one disco single.\nIn the northwestern sections of the United Kingdom, the northern soul explosion, which started in the late 1960s and peaked in 1974, made the region receptive to disco, which the region's disc jockeys were bringing back from New York City. The shift by some DJs to the newer sounds coming from the U.S. resulted in a split in the scene, whereby some abandoned the 1960s soul and pushed a modern soul sound which tended to be more closely aligned with disco than soul.\nIn 1975, Gloria Gaynor released her first vinyl album, which included a remake of the Jackson 5's \"Never Can Say Goodbye\" (which, in fact, is also the album title) and two other songs, \"Honey Bee\" and her disco version of \"Reach Out (I'll Be There)\". The album first topped the Billboard disco/dance charts in November 1974. Later in 1978, Gaynor's number-one disco song was \"I Will Survive\", which was seen as a symbol of female strength and a gay anthem, like her further disco hit, a 1983 remake of \"I Am What I Am\". In 1979 she released \"Let Me Know (I Have a Right)\", a single which gained popularity in the civil rights movements. Also in 1975, Vincent Montana Jr.'s Salsoul Orchestra contributed with their Latin-flavored orchestral dance song \"Salsoul Hustle\", reaching number four on the Billboard Dance Chart; their 1976 hits were \"Tangerine\" and \"Nice 'n' Naasty\", the first being a cover of a 1941 song.\nSongs such as Van McCoy's 1975 \"The Hustle\" and the humorous Joe Tex 1977 \"Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)\" gave names to the popular disco dances \"the Bump\" and \"the Hustle\". Other notable early successful disco songs include Barry White's \"You're the First, the Last, My Everything\" (1974); Labelle's \"Lady Marmalade\" (1974)'; Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes' \"Get Dancin'\" (1974); Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's \"Shining Star\" (1975); Silver Convention's \"Fly, Robin, Fly\" (1975) and \"Get Up and Boogie\" (1976); Vicki Sue Robinson's \"Turn the Beat Around\" (1976); and \"More, More, More\" (1976) by Andrea True (a former pornographic actress during the Golden Age of Porn, an era largely contemporaneous with the height of disco).\nFormed by Harry Wayne Casey (a.k.a. \"KC\") and Richard Finch, Miami's KC and the Sunshine Band had a string of disco-definitive top-five singles between 1975 and 1977, including \"Get Down Tonight\", \"That's the Way (I Like It)\", \"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty\", \"I'm Your Boogie Man\", \"Boogie Shoes\", and \"Keep It Comin' Love\". In this period, rock bands like the English Electric Light Orchestra featured in their songs a violin sound that became a staple of disco music, as in the 1975 hit \"Evil Woman\", although the genre was correctly described as orchestral rock.\nOther disco producers such as Tom Moulton took ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased Jamaican migration to New York City in the 1970s) to provide alternatives to the \"four on the floor\" style that dominated. DJ Larry Levan utilized styles from dub and jazz and remixing techniques to create early versions of house music that sparked the genre.\nMotown turning disco.\nNorman Whitfield was an influential producer and songwriter at Motown records, renowned for creating innovative \"psychedelic soul\" songs with many hits for Marvin Gaye, The Velvelettes, The Temptations, and Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. From around the production of the Temptations album \"Cloud Nine\" in 1968, he incorporated some psychedelic influences and started to produce longer, dance-friendly tracks, with more room for elaborate rhythmic instrumental parts. An example of such a long psychedelic soul track is \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\", which appeared as a single edit of almost seven minutes and an approximately 12-minute-long 12\" version in 1972. By the early 1970s, many of Whitfield's productions evolved more and more towards funk and disco, as heard on albums by the Undisputed Truth and the 1973 album \"\" by The Jackson 5. The Undisputed Truth, a Motown recording act assembled by Whitfield to experiment with his psychedelic soul production techniques, found success with their 1971 song \"Smiling Faces Sometimes\". Their disco single \"You + Me = Love\" (number 43) was produced by Whitfield and made number 2 on the US dance chart in 1976.\nIn 1975, Whitfield left Motown and founded his own label Whitfield records, on which also \"You + Me = Love\" was released. Whitfield produced some more disco hits, including \"Car Wash\" (1976) by Rose Royce from the to the 1976 film \"Car Wash\". In 1977, singer, songwriter, and producer Willie Hutch, who had been signed to Motown since 1970, now signed with Whitfield's new label, and scored a successful disco single with his song \"In and Out\" in 1982.\nOther Motown artists turned to disco as well. Diana Ross embraced the disco sound with her successful 1976 outing \"Love Hangover\" from her self-titled album. Her 1980 dance classics \"Upside Down\" and \"I'm Coming Out\" were written and produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of the group Chic. The Supremes, the group that made Ross famous, scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs without her, most notably 1976's \"I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking\" and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977's \"You're My Driving Wheel\".\nAt the request of Motown that he produce songs in the disco genre, Marvin Gaye released \"Got to Give It Up\" in 1978, despite his dislike of disco. He vowed not to record any songs in the genre and actually wrote the song as a parody. However, several of Gaye's songs have disco elements, including \"I Want You\" (1975). Stevie Wonder released the disco single \"Sir Duke\" in 1977 as a tribute to Duke Ellington, the influential jazz legend who had died in 1974. Smokey Robinson left the Motown group The Miracles for a solo career in 1972 and released his third solo album \"A Quiet Storm\" in 1975, which spawned and lent its name to the \"Quiet Storm\" musical programming format and subgenre of R&amp;B. It contained the disco single \"Baby That's Backatcha\". Other Motown artists who scored disco hits were Robinson's former group, the Miracles, with \"Love Machine\" (1975), Eddie Kendricks with \"Keep On Truckin'\" (1973), the Originals with \"Down to Love Town\" (1976), and Thelma Houston with her cover of the Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song \"Don't Leave Me This Way\" (1976). The label continued to release successful songs into the 1980s, with Rick James's \"Super Freak\" (1981) and the Commodores' \"Lady (You Bring Me Up)\" (1981).\nSeveral of Motown's solo artists who left the label went on to have successful disco songs. Mary Wells, Motown's first female superstar with her signature song \"My Guy\" (written by Smokey Robinson), abruptly left the label in 1964. She briefly reappeared on the charts with the disco song \"Gigolo\" in 1980. Jimmy Ruffin, the elder brother of the Temptations lead singer David Ruffin, was also signed to Motown and released his most successful and well-known song \"What Becomes of the Brokenhearted\" as a single in 1966. Ruffin eventually left the record label in the mid-1970s, but saw success with the 1980 disco song \"Hold On (To My Love)\", which was written and produced by Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees, for his album \"Sunrise\". Edwin Starr, known for his Motown protest song \"War\" (1970), reentered the charts in 1979 with a pair of disco songs, \"Contact\" and \"H.A.P.P.Y. Radio\". Kiki Dee became the first white British singer to sign with Motown in the US, and released one album, \"Great Expectations\" (1970), and two singles \"The Day Will Come Between Sunday and Monday\" (1970) and \"Love Makes the World Go Round\" (1971), the latter giving her first-ever chart entry (number 87 on the US Chart). She soon left the company and signed with Elton John's The Rocket Record Company, and in 1976 had her biggest and best-known single, \"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\", a disco duet with John. The song was intended as an affectionate disco-style pastiche of the Motown sound, in particular the various duets recorded by Marvin Gaye with Tammi Terrell and Kim Weston.\nMany Motown groups who had left the record label charted with disco songs. The Jackson 5, one of Motown's premier acts in the early 1970s, left the record company in 1975 (Jermaine Jackson, however, remained with the label) after successful songs like \"I Want You Back\" (1969) and \"ABC\" (1970), and even the disco song \"Dancing Machine\" (1974). Renamed as \"the Jacksons\" (as Motown owned the name \"the Jackson 5\"), they went on to find success with disco songs like \"Blame It on the Boogie\" (1978), \"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\" (1979), and \"Can You Feel It\" (1981) on the Epic label.\nThe Isley Brothers, whose short tenure at the company had produced the song \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)\" in 1966, went on release successful disco songs like \"It's a Disco Night (Rock Don't Stop)\" (1979). Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, who recorded the most successful version of \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" (1967) before Marvin Gaye, scored commercially successful singles such as \"Baby, Don't Change Your Mind\" (1977) and \"Bourgie', Bourgie'\" (1980) in the disco era. The Detroit Spinners were also signed to the Motown label and saw success with the Stevie Wonder-produced song \"It's a Shame\" in 1970. They left soon after, on the advice of fellow Detroit native Aretha Franklin, to Atlantic Records, and there had disco songs like \"The Rubberband Man\" (1976). In 1979, they released a successful cover of Elton John's \"Are You Ready for Love\", as well as a medley of the Four Seasons' song \"Working My Way Back to You\" and Michael Zager's \"Forgive Me, Girl\". The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown's MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R&amp;B and soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, \"Chameleon\" (1972), to little commercial success in the US. However, one single, \"The Night\", was released in Britain in 1975 and, thanks to popularity from the Northern soul circuit, reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song \"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\" (1975) for Warner Curb Records.\nEuro disco.\nBy far the most successful Euro disco act was ABBA (1972\u20131982). This Swedish quartet, which sang primarily in English, found success with singles such as \"Waterloo\" (1974), \"Take a Chance on Me\" (1978), \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\" (1979), \"Super Trouper\" (1980), and their signature smash hit \"Dancing Queen\" (1976).\nIn the 1970s, Munich, West Germany, music producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte made a decisive contribution to disco music with a string of hits for Donna Summer, which became known as the \"Munich Sound\". In 1975, Summer suggested the lyric \"Love to Love You Baby\" to Moroder and Bellotte, who turned the lyric into a full disco song. The final product, which contained the vocalizations of a series of simulated orgasms, initially was not intended for release, but when Moroder played it in the clubs it caused a sensation and he released it. The song became an international hit, reaching the charts in many European countries and the US (No. 2). It has been described as the arrival of the expression of raw female sexual desire in pop music. A nearly 17-minute 12-inch single was released. The 12\" single became and remains a standard in discos today.\nDonna Summer's \"Love to Love You Baby\" peaking on the \"Billboard\" charts at No.2 in 1976, is considered a feminist anthem and staple in the genre. Billboard recently ranked the song #1 on their list of \"The 34 Top Disco Songs of All Time.\" Summer is featured at all top six spots on the list.\nIn 1976 Donna Summer's version of \"Could It Be Magic\" brought disco further into the mainstream. In 1977 Summer, Moroder and Bellotte further released \"I Feel Love\", as the B-side of \"Can't We Just Sit Down (And Talk It Over)\", which revolutionized dance music with its mostly electronic production and was a massive worldwide success, spawning the Hi-NRG subgenre. Giorgio Moroder was described by AllMusic as \"one of the principal architects of the disco sound\". Another successful disco music project by Moroder at that time was Munich Machine (1976\u20131980).\nBoney M. (1974\u20131986) was a West German Euro disco group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by record producer Frank Farian. Boney M. charted worldwide with such songs as \"Daddy Cool\" (1976) \"Ma Baker\" (1977) and \"Rivers Of Babylon\" (1978). Another successful West German Euro disco recording act was Silver Convention (1974\u20131979). The German group Kraftwerk also had an influence on Euro disco.\nIn France, Dalida released \"J'attendrai\" (\"I Will Wait\") in 1975, which also became successful in Canada, Europe, and Japan. Dalida successfully adjusted herself to disco and released at least a dozen of songs that charted in the top 10 in Europe. Claude Fran\u00e7ois, who re-invented himself as the \"king of French disco\", released \"La plus belle chose du monde\", a French version of the Bee Gees song \"Massachusetts\", which became successful in Canada and Europe and \"Alexandrie Alexandra\" was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide success. Cerrone's early songs, \"Love in C Minor\" (1976), \"Supernature\" (1977), and \"Give Me Love\" (1978) were successful in the US and Europe. Another Euro disco act was the French diva Amanda Lear, where Euro disco sound is most heard in \"Enigma (Give a Bit of Mmh to Me)\" (1978). French producer Alec Costandinos assembled the Euro disco group Love and Kisses (1977\u20131982).\nIn Italy Raffaella Carr\u00e0 was the most successful Euro disco act, alongside La Bionda, Hermanas Goggi (Loretta and Daniela Goggi) and Oliver Onions. Her greatest international single was \"Tanti auguri\" (\"Best Wishes\"), which has become a popular song with gay audiences. The song is also known under its Spanish title \"Hay que venir al sur\" (which refers to Southern Europe, since the song was recorded and taped in Spain). The Estonian version of the song \"J\u00e4tke v\u00f5tmed v\u00e4ljapoole\" was performed by Anne Veski. \"A far l'amore comincia tu\" (\"To make love, your move first\") was another success for her internationally, known in Spanish as \"En el amor todo es empezar\", in German as \"Liebelei\", in French as \"Puisque tu l'aimes dis le lui\", and in English as \"Do It, Do It Again\". It was her only entry to the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 9, where she remains a one-hit wonder. In 1977, she recorded another successful single, \"Fiesta\" (\"The Party\" in English) originally in Spanish, but then recorded it in French and Italian after the song hit the charts. \"A far l'amore comincia tu\" has also been covered in Turkish by a Turkish popstar Ajda Pekkan as \"Sak\u0131n Ha\" in 1977.\nRecently, Carr\u00e0 has gained new attention for her appearance as the female dancing soloist in a 1974 TV performance of the experimental gibberish song \"Prisencolinensinainciusol\" (1973) by Adriano Celentano. A remixed video featuring her dancing went viral on the internet in 2008. In 2008 a video of a performance of her only successful UK single, \"Do It, Do It Again\", was featured in the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Midnight\". Rafaella Carr\u00e0 worked with Bob Sinclar on the new single \"Far l'Amore\" which was released on YouTube on March 17, 2011. The song charted in different European countries. Also prominent European disco acts are Spargo (band), Time Bandits (band) and Luv' from the Netherlands.\nEuro disco continued evolving within the broad mainstream pop music scene, even when disco's popularity sharply declined in the United States, abandoned by major U.S. record labels and producers. Through the influence of Italo disco, it also played a role in the evolution of early house music in the early 1980s and later forms of electronic dance music, including early '90s Eurodance.\n1977\u20131979: Pop preeminence.\n\"Saturday Night Fever\" (John Badham, 1977).\nIn December 1977, the film \"Saturday Night Fever\" was released. It was a huge success and its soundtrack became one of the best-selling albums of all time. The idea for the film was sparked by a 1976 \"New York\" magazine article titled \"Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night\" which supposedly chronicled the disco culture in mid-1970s New York City, but was later revealed to have been fabricated. Some critics said the film \"mainstreamed\" disco, making it more acceptable to heterosexual white males. Many music historians believe the success of the movie and soundtrack extended the life of the disco era by several years.\nOrganized around the culture of suburban discotheques and the character of Tony Manero, portrayed by John Travolta (which earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination), \"Saturday Night Fever\" became a cultural phenomenon that recast the dance floor as a site for patriarchal masculinity and heterosexual courtship. This transformation aligned disco with the interests of the perceived mass market, specifically targeting suburban and Middle American audiences.\nThe portrayal of the dance floor in \"Saturday Night Fever\" marked a reappropriation by straight male culture, turning it into a space for men to showcase their prowess and pursue partners of the opposite sex. The film popularized the hustle, a Latin social dance, reinforcing the centrality of the straight-dancing couple in the disco exchange. Notably, the soundtrack, dominated by the Bee Gees, risked presenting disco as a new incarnation of shrill white pop, deviating from its diverse and inclusive origins. The success of \"Saturday Night Fever\" was unprecedented, breaking box office and album sale records. Unfortunately, its impact went beyond mere popularity. The film established a template for disco that was easily reproducible, yet thoroughly de-queered in its outlook. By narrowing the narrative to fit into the conventional ideals of suburban heterosexual culture, the film contributed to a distorted and commodified version of disco.\nDisco goes mainstream.\nThe Bee Gees used Barry Gibb's falsetto to garner hits such as \"You Should Be Dancing\", \"Stayin' Alive\", \"Night Fever\", \"More Than A Woman\", \"Love You Inside Out\", and \"Tragedy\". Andy Gibb, a younger brother to the Bee Gees, followed with similarly styled solo singles such as \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\", \"(Love Is) Thicker Than Water\", and \"Shadow Dancing\".\nIn 1978, Donna Summer's multi-million-selling vinyl single disco version of \"MacArthur Park\" was number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart for three weeks and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The recording, which was included as part of the \"MacArthur Park Suite\" on her double live album \"Live and More\", was eight minutes and 40 seconds long on the album. The shorter seven-inch vinyl single version of MacArthur Park was Summer's first single to reach number one on the Hot 100; it does not include the balladic second movement of the song, however. A 2013 remix of \"MacArthur Park\" by Summer topped the Billboard Dance Charts marking five consecutive decades with a number-one song on the charts. From mid-1978 to late 1979, Summer continued to release singles such as \"Last Dance\", \"Heaven Knows\" (with Brooklyn Dreams), \"Hot Stuff\", \"Bad Girls\", \"Dim All the Lights\" and \"On the Radio\", all very successful songs, landing in the top five or better, on the Billboard pop charts.\nThe band Chic was formed mainly by guitarist Nile Rodgers\u2014a self-described \"street hippie\" from late 1960s New York\u2014and bassist Bernard Edwards. Their popular 1978 single, \"Le Freak\", is regarded as an iconic song of the genre. Other successful songs by Chic include the often-sampled \"Good Times\" (1979), \"I Want Your Love\" (1979), and \"Everybody Dance\" (1979). The group regarded themselves as the disco movement's rock band that made good on the hippie movement's ideals of peace, love, and freedom. Every song they wrote was written with an eye toward giving it \"deep hidden meaning\" or D.H.M.\nSylvester, a flamboyant and openly gay singer famous for his soaring falsetto voice, scored his biggest disco hits in late 1978 with \"You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)\" and \"Dance (Disco Heat)\". His singing style was said to have influenced the singer Prince. At that time, disco was one of the forms of music most open to gay performers.\nThe Village People were a singing/dancing group created by Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo to target disco's gay audience. They were known for their onstage costumes of typically male-associated jobs and ethnic minorities and achieved mainstream success with their 1978 hit song \"Macho Man\". Other songs include \"Y.M.C.A.\" (1979) and \"In the Navy\" (1979).\nAlso noteworthy are the Trammps' \"Disco Inferno\" (1976; 1978 reissue due to the popularity gained from the \"Saturday Night Fever\" soundtrack), Heatwave's \"Boogie Nights\" (1977), Evelyn \"Champagne\" King's \"Shame\" (1977), A Taste of Honey's \"Boogie Oogie Oogie\" (1978), Cheryl Lynn's \"Got to Be Real\" (1978), Alicia Bridges's \"I Love the Nightlife\" (1978), Patrick Hernandez's \"Born to Be Alive\" (1978), Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's \"September\" (1978) and \"Boogie Wonderland\" (1979), Peaches &amp; Herb's \"Shake Your Groove Thing\" (1978), Chaka Khan's \"I'm Every Woman\" (1978), Sister Sledge's \"We Are Family\" and \"He's the Greatest Dancer\" (both 1979), McFadden and Whitehead's \"Ain't No Stoppin' Us Now\" (1979), Anita Ward's \"Ring My Bell\" (1979), Kool &amp; the Gang's \"Ladies' Night\" (1979) and \"Celebration\" (1980), the Whispers' \"And the Beat Goes On\" (1979), Stephanie Mills's \"What Cha Gonna Do with My Lovin'\" (1979), Lipps Inc.'s \"Funkytown\" (1980), the Brothers Johnson's \"Stomp!\" (1980), George Benson's \"Give Me the Night\" (1980), Donna Summer's \"Sunset People\" (1980), and Walter Murphy's various attempts to bring classical music to the mainstream, most notably the disco song \"A Fifth of Beethoven\" (1976), which was inspired by Beethoven's fifth symphony.\nAt the height of its popularity, many non-disco artists recorded songs with disco elements, such as Rod Stewart with his \"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" in 1979. Even mainstream rock artists adopted elements of disco. Progressive rock group Pink Floyd used disco-like drums and guitar in their song \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\" (1979), which became their only number-one single in both the US and UK. The Eagles referenced disco with \"One of These Nights\" (1975) and \"Disco Strangler\" (1979), Paul McCartney &amp; Wings with \"Silly Love Songs\" (1976) and \"Goodnight Tonight\" (1979), Queen with \"Another One Bites the Dust\" (1980), the Rolling Stones with \"Miss You\" (1978) and \"Emotional Rescue\" (1980), Stephen Stills with his album \"Thoroughfare Gap\" (1978), Electric Light Orchestra with \"Shine a Little Love\" and \"Last Train to London\" (both 1979), Chicago with \"Street Player\" (1979), the Kinks with \"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\" (1979), the Grateful Dead with \"Shakedown Street\", the Who with \"Eminence Front\" (1982), and the J. Geils Band with \"Come Back\" (1980). Even hard rock group KISS jumped in with \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" (1979), and Ringo Starr's album \"Ringo the 4th\" (1978) features a strong disco influence.\nThe disco sound was also adopted by artists from other genres, including the 1979 U.S. number one hit \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\" by easy listening singer Barbra Streisand in a duet with Donna Summer. In country music, in an attempt to appeal to the more mainstream market, artists began to add pop/disco influences to their music. Dolly Parton launched a successful crossover onto the pop/dance charts, with her albums \"Heartbreaker\" and \"Great Balls of Fire\" containing songs with a disco flair. In particular, a disco remix of the track \"Baby I'm Burnin'\" peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart; ultimately becoming one of the year's biggest club hits.\nAdditionally, Connie Smith covered Andy Gibb's \"I Just Want to Be Your Everything\" in 1977, Bill Anderson recorded \"Double S\" in 1978, and Ronnie Milsap released \"Get It Up\" and covered blues singer Tommy Tucker's song \"Hi-Heel Sneakers\" in 1979.\nPre-existing non-disco songs, standards, and TV themes were frequently \"disco-ized\" in the 1970s, such as the \"I Love Lucy\" theme (recorded as \"Disco Lucy\" by the Wilton Place Street Band), \"Aquarela do Brasil\" (recorded as \"Brazil\" by The Ritchie Family), and \"Baby Face\" (recorded by the Wing and a Prayer Fife and Drum Corps). The rich orchestral accompaniment that became identified with the disco era conjured up the memories of the big band era\u2014which brought out several artists that recorded and disco-ized some big band arrangements, including Perry Como, who re-recorded his 1945 song \"Temptation\", in 1975, as well as Ethel Merman, who released an album of disco songs entitled \"The Ethel Merman Disco Album\" in 1979.\nMyron Floren, second-in-command on \"The Lawrence Welk Show\", released a recording of the \"Clarinet Polka\" entitled \"Disco Accordion.\" Similarly, Bobby Vinton adapted \"The Pennsylvania Polka\" into a song named \"Disco Polka\". Easy listening icon Percy Faith, in one of his last recordings, released an album entitled \"Disco Party\" (1975) and recorded a disco version of his \"Theme from \"A Summer Place\"\" in 1976. Even classical music was adapted for disco, notably Walter Murphy's \"A Fifth of Beethoven\" (1976, based on the first movement of Beethoven's 5th Symphony) and \"Flight 76\" (1976, based on Rimsky-Korsakov's \"Flight of the Bumblebee\"), and Louis Clark's \"Hooked On Classics\" series of albums and singles.\nMany original television theme songs of the era also showed a strong disco influence, such as \"S.W.A.T.\" (1975), \"Wonder Woman\" (1975), \"Charlie's Angels\" (1976), \"NBC Saturday Night At The Movies\" (1976), \"The Love Boat\" (1977), \"The Donahue Show\" (1977), \"CHiPs\" (1977), \"The Professionals\" (1977), \"Dallas\" (1978), NBC Sports broadcasts (1978), \"Kojak\" (1977), and \"The Hollywood Squares\" (1979).\nDisco jingles also made their way into many TV commercials, including Purina's 1979 \"Good Mews\" cat food commercial and an \"IC Light\" commercial by Pittsburgh's Iron City Brewing Company.\nParodies.\nSeveral parodies of the disco style were created. Rick Dees, at the time a radio DJ in Memphis, Tennessee, recorded \"Disco Duck\" (1976) and \"Dis-Gorilla\" (1977); Frank Zappa parodied the lifestyles of disco dancers in \"Disco Boy\" on his 1976 \"Zoot Allures\" album and in \"Dancin' Fool\" on his 1979 \"Sheik Yerbouti\" album. \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's eponymous 1983 debut album includes a disco song called \"Gotta Boogie\", an extended pun on the similarity of the disco move to the American slang word \"booger\". Comedian Bill Cosby devoted his entire 1977 album \"Disco Bill\" to disco parodies. In 1980, \"Mad Magazine\" released a flexi-disc titled \"Mad Disco\" featuring six full-length parodies of the genre. Rock and roll songs critical of disco included Bob Seger's \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" and, especially, the Who's \"Sister Disco\" (both 1978)\u2014although the Who's \"Eminence Front\" (four years later) had a disco feel.\n1979\u20131981: Controversy and decline in popularity.\nBy the end of the 1970s, anti-disco sentiment developed among rock music fans and musicians, particularly in the United States. Disco was criticized as mindless, consumerist, overproduced and escapist. The slogans \"Disco sucks\" and \"Death to disco\" became common. Rock artists such as Rod Stewart and David Bowie who added disco elements to their music were accused of selling out.\nThe punk subculture in the United States and the United Kingdom was often hostile to disco, although, in the UK, many early Sex Pistols fans such as the Bromley Contingent and Jordan liked disco, often congregating at nightclubs such as Louise's in Soho and the Sombrero in Kensington. The track \"Love Hangover\" by Diana Ross, the house anthem at the former, was cited as a particular favourite by many early UK punks.\nThe film \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" and its soundtrack album contained a disco medley of Sex Pistols songs, entitled \"Black Arabs\" and credited to a group of the same name.\nHowever, Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys, in the song \"Saturday Night Holocaust\", likened disco to the cabaret culture of Weimar-era Germany for its apathy towards government policies and its escapism. Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo said that disco was \"like a beautiful woman with a great body and no brains\", and a product of political apathy of that era. Experimental filmmaker Wheeler Winston Dixon called it \"absolutely brain dead\", around the clock disco-based radio as \"just awful\" and Studio 54 struck him as \"really dull and elitist\" and \"everything I was against\" (favoring CBGB, which he called \"something of a haven\", and New Wave acts like Blondie, The Ramones and Television). David Byrne, lead singer of The Talking Heads, remarked on the liner notes for the compilation album \"\" about lyrics in their 1979 song \"Life During Wartime\" (\"this ain't no party, this ain't no disco, this ain't no foolin' around\")\nThe line 'This ain't no disco' sure stuck! Remember when they would build bonfires of Donna Summer records? Well, we liked some disco music! It's called 'dance music' now. Some of it was radical, camp, silly, transcendent and disposable. So it was funny that we were sometimes seen as the flag-bearers of the anti-disco movement.\nNew Jersey rock critic Jim Testa wrote \"Put a Bullet Through the Jukebox\", a vitriolic screed attacking disco that was considered a punk call to arms. Steve Hillage, shortly prior to his transformation from a progressive rock musician into an electronic artist at the end of the 1970s with the inspiration of disco, disappointed his rockist fans by admitting his love for disco, with Hillage recalling \"it's like I'd killed their pet cat.\"\nAnti-disco sentiment was expressed in some television shows and films. A recurring theme on the show \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" was a hostile attitude towards disco music. In one scene of the 1980 comedy film \"Airplane!\", a wayward airplane slices a radio tower with its wing, knocking out an all-disco radio station. July 12, 1979, became known as \"the day disco died\" because of the Disco Demolition Night, an anti-disco demonstration in a baseball double-header at Comiskey Park in Chicago. Rock station DJs Steve Dahl and Garry Meier, along with Michael Veeck, son of Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck, staged the promotional event for disgruntled rock fans between the games of a White Sox doubleheader which involved exploding disco records in centerfield. As the second game was about to begin, the raucous crowd stormed onto the field and proceeded to set fires and tear out seats and pieces of turf. The Chicago Police Department made numerous arrests, and the extensive damage to the field forced the White Sox to forfeit the second game to the Detroit Tigers, who had won the first game.\nDisco's decline in popularity after Disco Demolition Night was rapid. On July 12, 1979, the top six records on the U.S. music charts were disco songs. By September 22, there were no disco songs in the US Top 10 chart, with the exception of Herb Alpert's instrumental \"Rise\", a smooth jazz composition with some disco overtones. Some in the media, in celebratory tones, declared disco dead and rock revived. Karen Mixon Cook, the first female disco DJ, stated that people still pause every July 12 for a moment of silence in honor of disco. Dahl stated in a 2004 interview that disco was \"probably on its way out [at the time]. But I think it [Disco Demolition Night] hastened its demise\".\nImpact on the music industry.\nThe anti-disco movement, combined with other societal and radio industry factors, changed the face of pop radio in the years following Disco Demolition Night. Starting in the 1980s, country music began a slow rise on the pop chart. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie \"Urban Cowboy\". The continued popularity of power pop and the revival of oldies in the late 1970s was also related to disco's decline; the 1978 film \"Grease\" was emblematic of this trend. Coincidentally, the star of both films was John Travolta, who in 1977 had starred in \"Saturday Night Fever\", which remains one of the most iconic disco films of the era.\nDuring this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, MCA Records purchased ABC Records, absorbed some of its artists and then shut the label down. Midsong International Records ceased operations in 1980. RSO Records founder Robert Stigwood left the label in 1981 and TK Records closed in the same year. Salsoul Records continues to exist in the 2000s, but primarily is used as a reissue brand. Casablanca Records had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company PolyGram.\nMany groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success\u2014even ones who tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. The Bee Gees, for instance, retreated from the pop mainstream in the early 1980s and spent the first half of the decade writing and producing successful material for other artists, such as Barbra Streisand and Dionne Warwick, finally returning for 1987's \"E.S.P.\", which spawned the chart-topping hit \"You Win Again\" in their home country, whereas in the US, they only had one top-10 entry (1989's \"One\") and three other top-40 songs, and the band itself largely abandoned disco in its 1980s and 1990s songs. Chic never hit the top 40 again after \"Good Times\" topped the chart in August 1979. Of the handful of groups not taken down by disco's fall from favor, Kool &amp; the Gang, Donna Summer, the Jacksons, and Gloria Gaynor in particular, stand out. In spite of having helped define the disco sound early on, they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond. Earth, Wind &amp; Fire also survived the anti-disco trend and continued to produce successful singles at roughly the same pace for several more years, in addition to an even longer string of R&amp;B chart hits that lasted into the 1990s. Some popular disco tracks released after Disco Demolition Night include \"Steppin' Out\" by Kool &amp; the Gang (1981), \"In the Middle\" by Unlimited Touch (1981), \"Upside Down\" and \"I'm Coming Out\" by Diana Ross (both 1980), \"My Feet Keep Dancing\" by Chic (1979), \"Funkytown\" by Lipps Inc. (1980), \"Lady (You Bring Me Up)\" by the Commodores (1981), and \"All American Girls\" by Sister Sledge (1981).\nSix months prior to Disco Demolition Night (in December 1978), popular progressive rock radio station WDAI (WLS-FM) had suddenly switched to an all-disco format, disenfranchising thousands of Chicago rock fans and leaving Dahl unemployed. WDAI, who survived the change of public sentiment and still had good ratings at this point, continued to play disco until it flipped to a short-lived hybrid Top 40/rock format in May 1980. Another disco outlet that competed against WDAI at the time, WGCI-FM, would later incorporate R&amp;B and pop songs into the format, eventually evolving into an urban contemporary outlet that it continues with today. The latter also helped bring the Chicago house genre to the airwaves.\nFactors contributing to disco's decline.\nFactors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970s, as well as burnout from the hedonistic lifestyles led by participants. In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the \"Disco sucks\" movement as implicitly macho and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures. It was also linked to a wider cultural \"backlash\", the move towards conservatism, that also made its way into US politics with the election of conservative president Ronald Reagan in 1980, which also led to Republican control of the United States Senate for the first time since 1954, plus the subsequent rise of the Religious Right around the same time.\nIn January 1979, rock critic Robert Christgau argued that homophobia, and most likely racism, were reasons behind the movement, a conclusion seconded by John Rockwell. Craig Werner wrote: \"The Anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of funkateers and feminists, progressives, and puritans, rockers and reactionaries. Nonetheless, the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism, sexism and homophobia.\" Legs McNeil, founder of the fanzine \"Punk\", was quoted in an interview as saying, \"the hippies always wanted to be black. We were going, 'fuck the blues, fuck the black experience.'\" He also said that disco was the result of an \"unholy\" union between homosexuals and blacks.\nSteve Dahl, who had spearheaded Disco Demolition Night, denied any racist or homophobic undertones to the promotion, saying, \"It's really easy to look at it historically, from this perspective, and attach all those things to it. But we weren't thinking like that,\" it was \"just kids pissing on a musical genre\". It has been noted that British punk rock critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist reggae genre as well as the more pro-gay new romantics movement. Christgau and Jim Testa have said that there were legitimate artistic reasons for being critical of disco.\nIn 1979, the music industry in the United States underwent its worst slump in decades, and disco, despite its mass popularity, was blamed. The producer-oriented sound was having difficulty mixing well with the industry's artist-oriented marketing system. Harold Childs, senior vice president at A&amp;M Records, reportedly told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that \"radio is really desperate for rock product\" and \"they're all looking for some white rock-n-roll\".\n1981\u20131989: Aftermath.\nBirth of electronic dance music.\nDisco was instrumental in the development of electronic dance music genres like house, techno, and Eurodance. The Eurodisco song \"I Feel Love\", produced by Giorgio Moroder for Donna Summer in 1976, has been described as a milestone and blueprint for electronic dance music because it was the first to combine repetitive synthesizer loops with a continuous four-on-the-floor bass drum and an off-beat hi-hat, which would become a main feature of techno and house ten years later.\nDuring the first years of the 1980s, the traditional disco sound characterized by complex arrangements performed by large ensembles of studio session musicians (including a horn section and an orchestral string section) began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward electronic and pop genres, starting with hi-NRG. Despite its decline in popularity, so-called club music and European-style disco remained relatively successful in the early-to-mid 1980s with songs like Aneka's \"Japanese Boy\", The Weather Girls's \"It's Raining Men\", Stacey Q's \"Two of Hearts\", Dead or Alive's \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\", Laura Branigan's \"Self Control\", and Baltimora's \"Tarzan Boy\". However, a revival of the traditional-style disco called nu-disco has been popular since the 1990s.\nHouse music displayed a strong disco influence, which is why house music, regarding its enormous success in shaping electronic dance music and contemporary club culture, is often described being \"disco's revenge\". Early house music was generally dance-based music characterized by repetitive four-on-the-floor beats, rhythms mainly provided by drum machines, off-beat hi-hat cymbals, and synthesized basslines. While house displayed several characteristics similar to disco music, it was more electronic and minimalist, and the repetitive rhythm of house was more important than the song itself. As well, house did not use the lush string sections that were a key part of the disco sound.\nLegacy.\nDJ culture.\nThe rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in the role of the DJ. DJing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and DJ mixers to create a continuous, seamless mix of songs, with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing. The resulting DJ mix differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. It, in turn, affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques, such as beatmatching and scratching, a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the Technics SL-1200 MK 2, first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor. DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.\nIn the 1970s, individual DJs became more prominent, and some DJs, such as Larry Levan, the resident at Paradise Garage, Jim Burgess, Tee Scott, and Francis Grasso became famous in the disco scene. Levan, for example, developed a cult following among clubgoers, who referred to his DJ sets as \"Saturday Mass\". Some DJs would use reel-to-reel tape recorders to make remixes and tape edits of songs. Some DJs who were making remixes made the transition from the DJ booth to becoming a record producer, notably Burgess. Scott developed several innovations. He was the first disco DJ to use three turntables as sound sources, the first to simultaneously play two beat-matched records, the first to use electronic effects units in his mixes, and he was an innovator in mixing dialogue in from well-known movies, typically over a percussion break. These mixing techniques were also applied to radio DJs, such as Ted Currier of WKTU and WBLS. Grasso is particularly notable for taking the DJ \"profession out of servitude and [making] the DJ the musical head chef.\" Once he entered the scene, the DJ was no longer responsible for waiting on the crowd hand and foot, meeting their every song request. Instead, with increased agency and visibility, the DJ was now able to use their own technical and creative skills to whip up a nightly special of innovative mixes, refining their personal sound and aesthetic, and building their own reputation.\nPost-disco.\nThe post-disco sound and genres associated with it originated in the 1970s and early 1980s with R&amp;B and post-punk musicians focusing on a more electronic and experimental side of disco, spawning boogie, Italo disco, and alternative dance. Drawing from a diverse range of non-disco influences and techniques, such as the \"one-man band\" style of Kashif and Stevie Wonder and alternative approaches of Parliament-Funkadelic, it was driven by synthesizers, keyboards, and drum machines. Post-disco acts include D. Train, Patrice Rushen, ESG, Bill Laswell, Arthur Russell. Post-disco had an important influence on dance-pop and was bridging classical disco and later forms of electronic dance music.\nEarly hip-hop.\nThe disco sound had a strong influence on early hip-hop. Most of the early hip-hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. The Sugarhill Gang used Chic's \"Good Times\" as the foundation for their 1979 song \"Rapper's Delight\", generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world.\nWith synthesizers and Krautrock influences that replaced the previous disco foundation, a new genre was born when Afrika Bambaataa released the single \"Planet Rock\", spawning a hip-hop electronic dance trend that includes songs such as Planet Patrol's \"Play at Your Own Risk\" (1982), C-Bank's \"One More Shot\" (1982), Cerrone's \"Club Underworld\" (1984), Shannon's \"Let the Music Play\" (1983), Freeez's \"I.O.U.\" (1983), Midnight Star's \"Freak-a-Zoid\" (1983), and Chaka Khan's \"I Feel For You\" (1984).\nHouse music and rave culture.\nHouse music is a genre of electronic dance music that originated in Chicago in the early 1980s (also see: Chicago house). It quickly spread to other American cities such as Detroit, where it developed into the harder and more industrial techno, New York City (also see: garage house), and Newark \u2013 all of which developed their own regional scenes.\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, house music became popular in Europe as well as major cities in South America and Australia. Early house music commercial success in Europe saw songs such as \"Pump Up The Volume\" by MARRS (1987), \"House Nation\" by House Master Boyz and the Rude Boy of House (1987), \"Theme from S'Express\" by S'Express (1988) and \"Doctorin' the House\" by Coldcut (1988) in the pop charts. Since the early to mid-1990s, house music has been infused in mainstream pop and dance music worldwide.\nHouse music in the 2010s, while keeping several of these core elements, notably the prominent kick drum on every beat, varies widely in style and influence, ranging from the soulful and atmospheric deep house to the more aggressive acid house or the minimalist microhouse. House music has also fused with several other genres creating fusion subgenres, such as euro house, tech house, electro house, and jump house.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, rave culture began to emerge from the house and acid house scene. Like house, it incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music played by DJs over powerful sound systems, recreational drug and club drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and hedonism. Although disco culture started out underground, it eventually thrived in the mainstream by the late 1970s, and major labels commodified and packaged the music for mass consumption. In contrast, the rave culture started out underground and stayed (mostly) underground. In part, this was to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music. The rave scene also stayed underground to avoid law enforcement attention that was directed at the rave culture due to its use of secret, unauthorized warehouses for some dance events and its association with illegal club drugs like ecstasy.\nPost-punk.\nThe post-punk movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported punk rock's rule-breaking while rejecting its move back to raw rock music. Post-punk's mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles. Public Image Limited is considered the first post-punk group. The group's second album \"Metal Box\" fully embraced the \"studio as instrument\" methodology of disco. The group's founder John Lydon, the former lead singer for the Sex Pistols, told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time.\nNo wave was a subgenre of post-punk centered in New York City. For shock value, James Chance, a notable member of the no wave scene, penned an article in the \"East Village Eye\" urging his readers to move uptown and get \"trancin' with some superradioactive disco voodoo funk\". His band James White and the Blacks wrote a disco album titled \"Off White\". Their performances resembled those of disco performers (horn section, dancers and so on). In 1981 ZE Records led the transition from no wave into the more subtle mutant disco (post-disco/punk) genre. Mutant disco acts such as Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Was Not Was, ESG and Liquid Liquid influenced several British post-punk acts such as New Order, Orange Juice and A Certain Ratio.\nNu-disco.\nNu-disco is a 21st-century dance music genre associated with the renewed interest in 1970s and early 1980s disco, mid-1980s Italo disco, and the synthesizer-heavy Euro disco aesthetics. The moniker appeared in print as early as 2002, and by mid-2008 was used by record shops such as the online retailers Juno and Beatport. These vendors often associate it with re-edits of original-era disco music, as well as with music from European producers who make dance music inspired by original-era American disco, electro, and other genres popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It is also used to describe the music on several American labels who were previously associated with the genres electroclash and French house.\nRevivals and return to mainstream success.\n1990s resurgence.\nIn the 1990s, after a decade of backlash, disco and its legacy became more accepted by pop music artists and listeners alike, as more songs, films, and compilations were released that referenced disco. This was part of a wave of 1970s nostalgia that was taking place in popular culture at the time. Some commentators attributed the revival of the genre to frequent use of disco music in fashion shows.\nExamples of songs during this time that were influenced by disco included Deee-Lite's \"Groove Is in the Heart\" (1990), U2's \"Lemon\" (1993), Blur's \"Girls &amp; Boys\" (1994) and \"Entertain Me\" (1995), Pulp's \"Disco 2000\" (1995), and Jamiroquai's \"Canned Heat\" (1999), while films such as \"Boogie Nights\" (1997) and \"The Last Days of Disco\" (1998) featured primarily disco soundtracks.\n2000s resurgence.\nIn the early 2000s, an updated genre of disco called \"nu-disco\" began breaking into the mainstream. A few examples like Daft Punk's \"One More Time\" and Kylie Minogue's \"Love at First Sight\" and \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" became club favorites and commercial successes. Several nu-disco songs were crossovers with funky house, such as Spiller's \"Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)\" and Modjo's \"Lady (Hear Me Tonight)\", both songs sampling older disco songs and both reaching number one on the UK Singles Chart in 2000. Robbie Williams's disco single \"Rock DJ\" was the UK's fourth best-selling single the same year. Jamiroquai's song \"Little L\" and \"Murder on the Dancefloor\" by Sophie Ellis-Bextor were hits in 2001. Rock band Manic Street Preachers released a disco song, \"Miss Europa Disco Dancer\", in the same year. The song's disco influence, which appears on \"Know Your Enemy\", was described as being \"much-discussed\". In 2005, Madonna immersed herself in the disco music of the 1970s and released her album \"Confessions on a Dance Floor\" to rave reviews. One of the singles from the album, \"Hung Up\", which samples ABBA's 1979 song \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\", became a major club staple. In addition to Madonna's disco-influenced attire to award shows and interviews, her Confessions Tour incorporated various elements of the 1970s, such as disco balls, a mirrored stage design, and the roller derby. In 2006, Jessica Simpson released her album \"A Public Affair\" inspired by disco and the 1980s music. The first single of the album, \"\"\"A Public Affair\", was reviewed as a disco-dancing competition influenced by Madonna's early works. The video of the song was filmed on a skating rink and features a line dance of hands.\nThe success of the \"nu-disco\" revival of the early 2000s was described by music critic Tom Ewing as more interpersonal than the pop music of the 1990s: \"The revival of disco within pop put a spotlight on something that had gone missing over the 90s: a sense of music not just for dancing, but for dancing with someone. Disco was a music of mutual attraction: cruising, flirtation, negotiation. Its dancefloor is a space for immediate pleasure, but also for promises kept and otherwise. It's a place where things start, but their resolution, let alone their meaning, is never clear. All of 2000's great disco number ones explore how to play this hand. Madison Avenue look to impose their will upon it, to set terms and roles. Spiller is less rigid. 'Groovejet' accepts the night's changeability, happily sells out certainty for an amused smile and a few great one-liners.\"\n2010s resurgence.\nIn 2011, K-pop girl group T-ara released Roly-Poly as a part of their EP \"John Travolta Wannabe\". The song accumulated over 4,000,000 units in digital downloads, which became the highest number of downloads for a K-pop girl group single on the Gaon Digital Chart in the 2010s. In 2013, with several 1970s-style disco and funk being released, the pop charts had more dance songs than at any other point since the late 1970s. The biggest disco song of the year was \"Get Lucky\" by Daft Punk, featuring Nile Rodgers on guitar. Its parent album, \"Random Access Memories\", ended up winning Album of the Year at the 2014 Grammys. Other disco-styled songs that made it into the top 40 that year were Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" (number one), Justin Timberlake's \"Take Back the Night\" (number 29), Bruno Mars' \"Treasure\" (number five) Arcade Fire's \"Reflektor\" featured strong disco elements. In 2014, disco music could be found in Lady Gaga's \"Artpop\" and Katy Perry's \"Birthday\". Other disco songs from 2014 include \"I Want It All\" By Karmin, 'Wrong Club\" by the Ting Tings, \"Blow\" by Beyonc\u00e9 and the William Orbit mix of \"Let Me in Your Heart Again\" by Queen.\nIn 2014 Brazilian Globo TV, the second biggest television network in the world, aired Boogie Oogie, a telenovela about the Disco Era that takes place between 1978 and 1979, from the hit fever to the decadence. The show's success was responsible for a Disco revival across the country, bringing back to the stage and to Brazilian record charts local disco divas like Lady Zu and As Fren\u00e9ticas.\nTop-10 entries from 2015 such as Mark Ronson's disco groove-infused \"Uptown Funk\", Maroon 5's \"Sugar\", the Weeknd's \"Can't Feel My Face\" and Jason Derulo's \"Want To Want Me\" also have a strong disco influence. Disco mogul and producer Giorgio Moroder also re-appeared in 2015 with his new album \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\", which proved to be a modest success. Other songs from 2015 like \"I Don't Like It, I Love It\" by Flo Rida, \"Adventure of a Lifetime\" by Coldplay, \"Back Together\" by Robin Thicke and \"Levels\" by Nick Jonas feature disco elements as well. In 2016, disco songs or disco-styled pop songs continued showing a strong presence on the music charts as a possible backlash to the 1980s-styled synthpop, electro house, and dubstep that had been dominating the charts up until then. Justin Timberlake's 2016 song \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\", which shows strong elements of disco, became the 26th song to debut at number-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in the history of the chart. \"The Martian\", a 2015 film, extensively uses disco music as a soundtrack, although for the main character, astronaut Mark Watney, there's only one thing worse than being stranded on Mars: it's being stranded on Mars with nothing but disco music. \"Kill the Lights\", featured on an episode of the HBO television series \"Vinyl\" (2016) and with Nile Rodgers' guitar licks, hit number one on the US Dance chart in July 2016.\n2020s resurgence.\nIn 2020, disco continued its mainstream popularity and became a prominent trend in popular music. In early 2020, disco-influenced hits such as Doja Cat's \"Say So\", Lady Gaga's \"Stupid Love\", and Dua Lipa's \"Don't Start Now\" experienced widespread success on global music charts, charting at numbers 1, 5 and 2, respectively, on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. At the time, \"Billboard\", declared that Lipa was \"leading the charge toward disco-influenced production\" a day after her retro and disco-influenced album \"Future Nostalgia\" was released on March 27, 2020. By the end of 2020, multiple disco albums had been released, including Adam Lambert's \"Velvet\", Jessie Ware's \"What's Your Pleasure?\", and R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy's discoth\u00e8que mixtape, \"R\u00f3is\u00edn Machine\". In early September 2020, South Korean group BTS debuted at number 1 in the US with their English\u2013language disco single \"Dynamite\" having sold 265,000 downloads in its first week in the US, marking the biggest pure sales week since Taylor Swift's \"Look What You Made Me Do\" (2017).\nIn July 2020, Australian singer Kylie Minogue announced she would be releasing her fifteenth studio album, \"Disco\", on November 6, 2020. The album was preceded by two singles. The lead single, \"Say Something\", was released on July 23 and premiered on BBC Radio 2; the second single, \"Magic\", was released on September 24. Both singles received critical acclaim, with critics praising Minogue for returning to disco roots, which were prominent in her albums \"Light Years\" (2000), \"Fever\" (2001), and \"Aphrodite\" (2010).\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7973", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7973", "title": "Donegal fiddle tradition", "text": "Traditional fiddle-playing method from County Donegal, Ireland\nThe Donegal fiddle tradition is one of the distinct fiddle traditions within Irish traditional music. The distinctness of the Donegal tradition developed due to the close relations between County Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and style has influences from Scottish fiddle music. For example, in addition to the \u201duniversally known\u201d standard Irish dance tunes, there is an added volume of Scottish and Nova Scotia tunes played, with even some tunes from Shetland and Orkney. This includes standard tune types such as double jigs (), slip jigs (), reels (), and hornpipes (swung ). It has been claimed that Donegal musicians play more slip jigs than any other region of Ireland. This is potentially due to the geographical borders/mountains (as well as national borders with Northern Ireland) keeping Donegal's repertoire more locally-known for decades. There is also a prevalence of mazurka playing. Mazurkas are historically mainland-European tunes very similar to a waltz, in its meter, though generally livelier and with more emphasis being placed on the second beat of each measure. Another uniquely Donegal tune is called the barndance, stemming from the Germanic schottische (essentially meaning \u2018Scottish\u2019), also similar to the Norwegian reinlander. The barndance is very similar to a hornpipe, but slower than a reel; typically they are played with less of a hornpipe's \u201cswing\u201d and more of the \u201cdrive\u201d of a reel.\nIn stark contrast to other Irish musical styles, the Donegal tradition also has the Scottish strathspey, a traditional dance from Scotland, played a bit like a hornpipe but with emphasis on the semi-quaver; this dotted rhythm gives the strathspey its distinct \u201cScotch Snap\u201d sound. While strathspeys are definitely known in Donegal (albeit played slightly slower and with less \u201dsnap\u201d than Scottish fiddlers), more common is the highland. Very rarely referred to as a \u201chighland fling\u201d, these quintessentially Donegal tunes are influenced by the Scottish strathspey, but played a bit smoother, as a sort of \u201cstrathspey-reel\u201d. Some Scotch Snaps will be played, but highlands tend to be more akin to a slower reel, overall. Reels, themselves, are said to have originated in Scottish music. The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict, between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition, when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.\nThe tradition has several distinguishing traits compared to other fiddle traditions such as the Sliabh Luachra style of southern Ireland, most of which involves styles of bowing and the ornamentation of the music, and rhythm. Due to the frequency of double stops and the strong bowing it is often compared to the Cape Breton tradition. Another characteristic of the style is the rapid pace at which it tends to proceed. Modern players, such as the fiddle group Altan, continue to be popular due to a variety of reasons.\nAmong the most famous Donegal style players are John Doherty from the early twentieth century and James Byrne, Paddy Glackin, Tommy Peoples and Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh in recent decades.\nHistory.\nThe fiddle has ancient roots in Ireland, the first report of bowed instruments similar to the violin being in the Book of Leinster (ca. 1160). The modern violin was ubiquitous in Ireland by the early 1700s. However the first mention of the fiddle being in use in Donegal is from the blind harper Arthur O'Neill who in his 1760 memoirs described a wedding in Ardara as having \"plenty of pipers and fiddlers\". Donegal fiddlers participated in the development of the Irish music tradition in the 18th century during which jigs and slipjigs and later reels and hornpipes became the dominant musical forms. However, Donegal musicians, many of them being fishermen, also frequently travelled to Scotland, where they acquired tune types from the Scottish repertoire such as the Strathspey which was integrated into the Donegal tradition as \"Highland\" tunes. The Donegal tradition derives much of its unique character from the synthesis of Irish and Scottish stylistic features and repertoires. Aoidh notes however that while different types of art music were commonly played among the upper classes of Scottish society in the 18th century, the Donegal tradition drew exclusively from the popular types of Scottish music. Like some Scottish fiddlers (who, like Donegal fiddlers, tend to use a short bow and play in a straight-ahead fashion), some Donegal fiddlers worked at imitating the sound of the bagpipes. Workers from Donegal would bring their music to Scotland and also bring back Scottish tunes with them such music of J. Scott Skinner and Mackenzie Murdoch. Lilting, unaccompanied singing of wordless tunes, was also an important part of the Donegal musical tradition often performed by women in social settings. Describing the musical life of Arranmore Island in the late 19th century singer R\u00f3ise Rua Nic Gr\u00edanna describes the most popular dances: \"The Sets, the Lancers, the Maggie Pickie [i.e., Maggie Pickins] the Donkey, the Mazurka and the Barn dances\". Among the travelling fiddlers of the late 19th century players such as John Mhosa\u00ed McGinley, Anthony Hilferty, the McConnells and the Dohertys are best known. As skill levels increased through apprenticeships several fiddle masters appeared such as the Cassidy's, Connie Haughey, Jimmy Lyons and Miock McShane of Teelin and Francie Dearg and Mickey B\u00e1n Byrne of Kilcar. These virtuosos played unaccompanied listening pieces in addition to the more common dance music.\nThe influences between Scotland and Donegal went both ways and were furthered by a wave of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as can be heard in the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the P\u00edob Mh\u00f3r, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the p\u00edob m\u00f3r and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.\nAs Irish music was consolidated and organised under the Comhaltas Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed \u00c9ireann movement in the 1960s, both strengthened the interest in traditional music but sometimes conflicted with the Donegal tradition and its social conventions. The rigidly organised sessions of the Comhaltas reflected the traditions of Southern Ireland and Donegal fiddlers like John Doherty considered the National repertoire with its strong focus on reels to be less diverse than that of Donegal with its varied rhythms. Other old fiddlers dislike the ways comhaltas sessions were organised with a committee player, often not himself a musician, in charge. Sometimes Comhaltas representatives would even disparage the Donegal tradition, with its Scottish flavour, as being un-Irish, and prohibit them from playing local tunes with Scottish genealogies such as the \"Highlands\" at Comhaltas sessions. This sometimes cause antagonism between Donegal players and the main organisation of traditional music in Ireland.\nOutside of the Comhaltas movement however, Donegal fiddling stood strong with Paddy Glackin of Ceoltor\u00ed Laighean and the Bothy Band and later Tommy Peoples also with the Bothy Band and Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh with Altan, who all drew attention and prestige to the Donegal tradition within folk music circles throughout Ireland.\nDescription of style.\nThe Donegal style of fiddling is a label often applied to music from this area, though one also might plausibly identify several different, but related, styles within the county. To the extent to which there is one common style in the county, it is characterised by a rapid pace; a tendency to be more un-swung in the playing of the fast dance tune types (reel and jigs); short (non-slurred), aggressive bowing, sparse ornamentation, the use of bowed triplets more often than trills as ornaments, the use of double stops and droning; and the occurrence of \"playing the octave\", with one player playing the melody and the other playing the melody an octave lower. None of these characteristics are universal, and there is some disagreement as to the extent to which there is a common style at all. In general, however, the style is rather aggressive.\nAnother feature of Donegal fiddling that makes it distinctive among Irish musical traditions is the variety of rare tune types that are played. Highlands, a type of tune in time with some similarities to Scottish strathspeys, which are also played in Donegal, are one of the most commonly played types of tune in the county. Other tune types common solely in the county include barndances, also called \"Germans,\" and mazurkas.\nFiddlers of the Donegal tradition.\nHistorical.\nThere are a number of different strands to the history of fiddle playing in County Donegal. Perhaps the best-known and, in the last half of the twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family. Hugh Doherty is the first known musician of this family. Born in 1790, he headed an unbroken tradition of fiddlers and pipers in the Doherty family until the death, in 1980, of perhaps the best-known Donegal fiddler, John Doherty. John, a travelling tinsmith, was known for his extremely precise and fast finger- and bow-work and vast repertoire, and is considered to be one of the greatest Irish fiddlers ever recorded. John's older brother, Mickey, was also recorded and, though Mickey was another of the great Irish fiddlers, his reputation has been overshadowed by John's.\nThere is no single Donegal style but several distinctive styles. These styles traditionally come from the geographical isolated regions of Donegal including Inishowen, eastern Donegal, The Rosses and Gweedore, Croaghs, Teelin, Kilcar, Glencolmcille, Ballyshannon and Bundoran. Even with improved communications and transport, these regions still have recognisably different ways of fiddle playing. Notable deceased players of the older Donegal styles include Neillidh (\"Neilly\") Boyle, Francie Byrne, Con Cassidy, Frank Cassidy, James Byrne (1946\u20132008), P.V. O'Donnell (2011), and Tommy Peoples (1948\u20132018). Currently living Donegal fiddlers, include, Vincent Campbell, John Gallagher, Paddy Glackin, and Danny O'Donnell.\nModern.\nFiddle playing continues to be popular in Donegal. The three fiddlers of the Donegal \"supergroup\" Altan, Mair\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, Paul O'Shaughnessy, and Ciar\u00e1n Tourish, are generally admired within Donegal. An example of another fiddler-player from Donegal is Liz Doherty.\nAnother well regarded fiddle player hailing from Donegal is Aidan O'Donnell. TG4 Young Musician of the Year 2010 Aidan O'Donnell has been described as one of the finest young Irish musicians at present. He began his music making at the age of 12, and since then has performed with some of traditional music's finest artists, including Donal Lunny, Micheal \u00d3'Suilleabh\u00e1in and the Chieftains. In 2007, he won the prestigious \u2018Oireachtas na Geailge' fiddle title, and has been a regular tutor at the Irish World Academy of Music and Dance, at the University of Limerick for the past number of years.\nThe fiddle, and traditional music in general, remained popular in Donegal not only because of the international coverage of certain artists but because of local pride in the music. Traditional music \"Seisi\u00fans\" are still common place both in pubs and in houses. The Donegal fiddle music has been influenced by recorded music, but this is claimed to have had a positive impact on the tradition. Modern Donegal fiddle music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Since there is no reciprocating action needed to eject and reload the shells, doubles are more compact than repeating designs such as pump action, lever action, bolt action, or self-loading shotguns.\nBarrel configuration.\nDouble-barreled shotguns (specifically break-action), come in two basic configurations:\nThe original double-barreled guns were commonly all side-by-side designs, which was a more practical design for muzzleloaders. Early cartridge-firing shotguns also used the side-by-side action, because they kept the exposed hammers of the earlier muzzleloading shotguns from which they evolved. When hammerless designs started to become common, the over-and-under design was introduced, and most modern sporting doubles are over-and-under designs.\nOne significant advantage that doubles have over single-barrel repeating shotguns is the ability to have more than one choke at a time. Some shotgun shooting sports, such as skeet shooting, use crossing targets presented in a narrow range of distance, and only require one level of choke. Other sports, like sporting clays, give the shooter targets at differing ranges, and targets that might approach or recede from the shooter, and so must be engaged at differing ranges. Having two barrels lets the shooter use a more open choke for near targets, and a tighter choke for distant targets, providing the optimal shot pattern for each distance.\nThe disadvantage lies in the fact that the barrels of a double-barreled shotgun, whether over-and-under or side-by-side, are not parallel, but slightly angled, so that shots from the barrels converge, usually at \"40 yards out\". For the side-by-side configuration, the shotstring continues on its path to the opposite side of the rib after the converging point; for example, the left barrel's discharge travels on the left of the rib till it hits dead center at 40 yards (36.58\u00a0m) out, after that, the discharge continues on to the right. In the over-and-under configuration with a parallel rib, both barrels' discharges will keep to the dead center, but the discharge from the \"under\" barrel will shoot higher than the discharge from the \"over\" barrel after 40 yards (36.58\u00a0m). Thus, double-barreled shotguns are accurate only at practical shotgun ranges, though the range of their ammunition easily exceeds four to six times that distance.\nSide-by-side shotguns are often more expensive and may take more practice to aim effectively than an over-and-under. The off-center nature of the recoil in a side-by-side gun may make shooting the body-side barrel slightly more painful by comparison to an over-and-under, single-shot, pump-action, or lever-action shotgun. Gas-operated and recoil-operated designs will recoil less than either. More side-by-side than over-and-under guns have traditional \"cast-off\" stocks, where the end of the buttstock veers slightly to the right, allowing a right-handed user to point the gun more easily.\nDouble-barreled shotguns are also inherently more safe, as whether the shotgun is loaded or can be fired can be ascertained by anyone present if the action is broken open, for instance on a skeet, trap or hunting clays course when another shooter is firing; if the action is open, the gun cannot fire. Similarly, doubles are more easily examined to see if loaded than pump-action or semi-automatic shotguns, whose bolt must be opened and chamber closely examined or felt to make sure it is unloaded; with a double gun (or a break-action single gun), whether the gun is loaded, i.e., has cartridges in any chamber, is easily and immediately seen with a glance (and just as easily unloaded).\nTrigger mechanism.\nThe early doubles used two triggers, one for each barrel, located front to back inside the trigger guard. The index finger was used to pull either trigger, as having two fingers inside the trigger guard can cause a very undesirable recoil-induced double-discharge. Double-trigger designs are typically set up for right-handed users. In double-trigger designs, it is often possible to pull both triggers at once, firing both barrels simultaneously, though this is generally not recommended as it doubles the recoil, battering both shotgun and shooter, particularly if it was unanticipated or unintended. Discharging both barrels at the same time has long been a hunting trick employed by hunters using 8 gauge \"elephant\" shotguns, firing the two slugs for sheer stopping power at close range.\nLater models use a single trigger that alternately fires both barrels, called a \"single selective trigger\" or \"SST\". The single selective trigger does not allow firing both barrels at once, since the single trigger must be pulled twice in order to fire both barrels. The change from one barrel to the other may be done by a clockwork type system, where a cam alternates between barrels, or by an inertial system where the recoil of firing the first barrel toggles the trigger to the next barrel. A double-barreled shotgun with an inertial trigger works best with full power shotshells; shooting low recoil shotshells often will not reliably toggle the inertial trigger, causing an apparent failure to fire occasionally when attempting to depress the trigger a second time to fire the second barrel (this also can happen if the first shell fails to fire). Generally there is a method of selecting the order in which the barrels of a single selective trigger shotgun fire; commonly this is done through manipulation of the safety, pushing to one side to select top barrel first and the other side to select bottom barrel first. In the event that an inertial trigger does not toggle to the second barrel when firing low recoil shotshells, manually selecting the order to the second barrel will enable the second barrel to fire when the trigger is depressed again.\nOne of the advantages of double-barreled shotgun with double triggers or single selective trigger, is that the second shot can be taken almost immediately after the first with merely a second trigger pull, without needing to manually operate the action (which will inevitably destabilize the gun from the shoulder position and affect aim), and can utilize different chokes for the two shots (assuming, of course, that full power shotshells are fired, at least for a double-barreled shotgun with an inertial type single selective trigger, as needed to toggle the inertial trigger). This can be noticeably faster than a pump-action shotgun, which requires manually pumping the fore-end to eject and reload for the second shot, and may be faster, or not slower, than a semi-automatic shotgun (as there are no bolt movements to delay the rechambering of a second shell). Note, however, in neither the pump-action or semi-automatic will the second shot be a different choke pattern from the first shot, whereas for a double, the two shots are usually with different chokes. Thus, depending on the nature of the hunt, the appropriate choke for the shot is always at hand. For example, while field hunting flushing birds, the first shot is usually closer than the second because the bird flies away from the shooter; so, the more open choke (and barrel) would be better for the first shot, and if a second shot is needed, as the bird is flying away, the more closed (and thus longer distance of an effective shot pattern) choke (and barrel) is then appropriate. Conversely, on a driven hunt, where the birds are driven towards the shooter, the closed (longer effective distance) choke (and barrel) should be fired first, saving the open (closer effective distance) choke (and barrel) for the now-closer incoming bird. None of this is possible with single-barrel shotguns, only with a double, either a side-by-side (S\u00d7S) or over-and-under (O/U).\nRegulation.\n\"Regulation\" is a term used for multi-barreled firearms (most commonly found in rifles and shotguns) that indicates how close to the same point of aim the barrels will shoot. A poorly regulated gun may hit consistently with one barrel but miss consistently with the other, making the gun nearly useless for anything requiring two shots. However, the short ranges and spread of shot provide a significant overlap, so a small error in regulation in a double is often too small to be noticed. Generally, the shotguns are regulated to hit the point of aim at a given distance usually the maximum expected range since that is the range at which a full choke is used and where precise regulation matters most. The regulation is usually more important in side-by-side rather than in over-and-under shotguns, as felt recoil differs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7976", "revid": "50655394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7976", "title": "Dessert", "text": "Sweet course that concludes a meal\nDessert is a course that concludes a meal; the course consists of sweet foods, such as cake, biscuit, ice cream, and possibly a beverage, such as dessert wine or liqueur. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savory to create desserts. In some parts of the world, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.\nHistorically, the dessert course consisted entirely of foods 'from the storeroom' (\"de l'office\"), including fresh, stewed, preserved, and dried fruits; nuts; cheese and other dairy dishes; dry biscuits (cookies) and wafers; and ices and ice creams. Sweet dishes from the kitchen, such as freshly prepared pastries, meringues, custards, puddings, and baked fruits, were served in the entremets course, not in the dessert course. By the 20th century, though, sweet entremets had come to be included among the desserts.\nThe modern term \"dessert\" can apply to many sweets, including fruit, custards, gelatins, puddings, biscuits, cookies, macaroons, pastries, pies, tarts, cakes, ice creams, and sweet soups.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"dessert\" originated from the French word \"desservir,\" meaning \"to clear the table\", and it referred to the final course of the meal, presented after the table was \"cleared\" (\"deservi\").\nOne of the earliest uses of the term in a culinary context is in the \"M\u00e9nagier de Paris\" (1393), which includes a course of \"desserte\" in three of the menus, one of which includes sweet pastries and fruits, another of which includes savory frumenty and venison.\nIn later centuries, the term continued to refer to the last course of the meal. In the late 19th century, the word \"desserts\" also came to refer to the dishes served in the dessert course.\nOther names.\nThe word \"dessert\" is most commonly used for this course in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United States, while its use exists alongside several synonyms, including \"\"pudding\", \"sweet\" and \"afters\"\", in the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries.\nHistory.\nSweets were fed to the gods in ancient Mesopotamia and ancient India and other ancient civilizations. Herodotus mentions that Persian meals featured many desserts, and were more varied in their sweet offerings than the main dishes. German army officer Helmuth von Moltke whilst serving in the Ottoman Empire noted the unusual presentation of courses with the sweet courses served between roasts and other savory dishes.\nDried fruit and honey were probably the first sweeteners used in most of the world, but the spread of sugarcane around the world was essential to the development of dessert. Sugarcane was grown and refined in India before 500 BC and was crystallized, making it easy to transport, by AD 500. Sugar and sugarcane were traded, making sugar available to Macedonia by 303 BC and China by AD 600. In the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and China, sugar has been a staple of cooking and desserts for over a thousand years.\nSugarcane and sugar were little known and rare in Europe until the twelfth century or later when the Crusades and then colonization spread its use. Europeans began to manufacture sugar in the Middle Ages, and more sweet desserts became available. Even then sugar was so expensive usually only the wealthy could indulge on special occasions. The first apple pie recipe was published in 1381; The earliest documentation of the term \"cupcake\" was in \"Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats\" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's \"Receipts\" cookbook.\nThe Industrial Revolution in Europe and later America led to the mass-production of foodstuffs, including desserts, that could be processed, preserved, canned, and packaged. Frozen foods, including desserts, became very popular starting in the 1920s.\nIngredients.\nSweet desserts usually contain cane sugar, palm sugar, brown sugar, honey, or some types of syrup such as molasses, maple syrup, treacle, or corn syrup. Other common ingredients in Western-style desserts are flour or other starches, cooking fats such as butter or lard, dairy, eggs, salt, acidic ingredients such as lemon juice, and spices and other flavoring agents such as chocolate, coffee, peanut butter, fruits, and nuts. The proportions of these ingredients, along with the preparation methods, play a major part in the consistency, texture, and flavor of the end product.\nSugars contribute moisture and tenderness to baked goods. Flour or starch components serves as a protein and gives the dessert structure. Fats contribute moisture and can enable the development of flaky layers in pastries and pie crusts. The dairy products in baked goods keep the desserts moist. Many desserts also contain eggs, in order to form custard or to aid in the rising and thickening of a cake-like substance. Egg yolks specifically contribute to the richness of desserts. Egg whites can act as a leavening agent or provide structure. Further innovation in the healthy eating movement has led to more information being available about vegan and gluten-free substitutes for the standard ingredients, as well as replacements for refined sugar.\nDesserts can contain many spices and extracts to add a variety of flavors. Salt and acids are added to desserts to balance sweet flavors and create a contrast in flavors. Some desserts are coffee-flavored, for example an iced coffee souffl\u00e9 or coffee biscuits. Alcohols and liqueurs can also be used as an ingredient, to make alcoholic desserts.\nVarieties and elements.\nDesserts consist of variations of tastes, textures, and appearances. Desserts can be defined as a usually sweeter course that concludes a meal. This definition includes a range of courses ranging from fruits or dried nuts to multi-ingredient cakes and pies. Many cultures have different variations of dessert. In modern times the variations of desserts have usually been passed down or come from geographical regions. This is one cause for the variation of desserts. These are some major categories in which desserts can be placed.\nCakes.\nCakes are sweet tender breads made with sugar and delicate flour. Cakes can vary from light, airy sponge cakes to dense cakes with less flour. Common flavorings include dried, candied or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa or extracts. They may be filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit. Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, for example weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. Small-sized cakes have become popular, in the form of cupcakes and petits fours, an example of which can be the Portuguese \"bolo de arroz\".\nPuddings.\nPuddings are similar to custards in that their base is cream or milk. However, their primary difference is that puddings are thickened with starches such as corn starch or tapioca. On the other hand, custards are thickened using only eggs and are usually more firm.\nSmall cakes and pastries.\nBiscuits or cookies are small disks of sweetened dough, similar in composition to a cake. The term \"\"biscuit\" is a derivation of Latin for \"twice-baked\", while the term \"cookie\"\" is a Dutch diminutive for \"koek\", meaning cake. Some examples of this dessert include a ginger nut, shortbread biscuit and chocolate chip cookie. In Commonwealth English, the term \"biscuit\" refers to this type of dessert in general, with \"cookie\" reserved for a specific type of drop cookie; in North America, the term \"cookie\" typically refers to all forms of this dessert, with \"biscuit\" more commonly referring to a type of bread.\nOther small cakes and pastries can also be counted as under these terms, due to their size and relative similarity to cookies and biscuits, such as jaffa cakes and Eccles cakes.\nConfection.\nConfection, also called candy, sweets or lollies, features sugar or honey as a principal ingredient.\nMany involve sugar heated into crystals with subtle differences. Dairy and sugar based include caramel, fudge and toffee or taffy. There are multiple forms of egg and sugar meringues and similar confections. Unheated sugar dissolves into icings, preservatives and sauces with other ingredients.\nChocolate.\n\"Theobroma cacao beans\" are commonly mixed with sugar to form chocolate. Pure, unsweetened dark chocolate contains primarily cocoa solids. Cocoa butter is also added in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate currently consumed is in the form of sweet chocolate, combining chocolate with sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids. Dark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cacao mixture, with no milk or much less than milk chocolate.\nMithai (sweets).\nMithai, derived from the Sanskrit word \"'sharkara',\" represents the range of Indian desserts.\nCustards.\nThese kinds of desserts usually include a thickened dairy base. Custards are cooked and thickened with eggs. Baked custards include cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and flan. They are often used as ingredients in other desserts, for instance as a filling for pastries or pies.\nDeep-fried.\nMany cuisines include a dessert made of deep-fried starch-based batter or dough. In many countries, a doughnut is a flour-based batter that has been deep-fried. It is sometimes filled with custard or jelly. Fritters are fruit pieces in a thick batter that have been deep fried. Gulab jamun is an Indian dessert made of milk solids kneaded into a dough, deep-fried, and soaked in honey. Churros are a deep-fried and sugared dough that is eaten as dessert or a snack in many countries.\nFrozen.\nIce cream, gelato, sorbet and shaved-ice desserts fit into this category. Ice cream is a cream base that is churned as it is frozen to create a creamy consistency. Gelato uses a milk base and has less air whipped in than ice cream, making it denser. Sorbet is made from churned fruit and is not dairy based. Shaved-ice desserts are made by shaving a block of ice and adding flavored syrup or juice to the ice shavings.\nGelatin.\nJellied desserts are made with a sweetened liquid thickened with gelatin or another gelling agent. They are traditional in many cultures. Y\u014dkan is a Japanese jellied dessert. In English-speaking countries, many dessert recipes are based on gelatin with fruit or whipped cream added. The vegetarian substitute for gelatin is agar agar. Marshmallow is also most commonly made with gelatin.\nPastries.\nPastries are sweet baked pastry products. Pastries can either take the form of light and flaky bread with an airy texture, such as a croissant or unleavened dough with a high fat content and crispy texture, such as shortbread. Pastries are often flavored or filled with fruits, chocolate, nuts, and spices. Pastries are sometimes eaten with tea or coffee as a breakfast food.\nPies, cobblers, and clafoutis.\nPies and cobblers consist of a filling enclosed by a crust, which can be made from either pastry or crumbs. The fillings of pies can vary from fruits to puddings, whereas cobbler fillings are mostly fruit-based. On the other hand, clafoutis is a dessert in which batter is poured over a fruit-based filling before being baked.\nSweet soups.\nTong sui, literally translated as \"sugar water\" and also known as tim tong, is a collective term for any sweet, warm soup or custard served as a dessert at the end of a meal in Cantonese cuisine. \"Tong sui\" are a Cantonese specialty and are rarely found in other regional cuisines of China. Outside of Cantonese-speaking communities, soupy desserts generally are not recognized as a distinct category, and the term \"tong sui\" is not used.\nWines.\nDessert wines are sweet wines typically served with dessert. There is no simple definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine is considered to be any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white fortified wines (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal, and the red fortified wines (port and madeira) drunk after it. Thus, most fortified wines are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less strong fortified white wines, such as Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all fortified wines - and is taxed at higher rates as a result. Examples include Sauternes and Tokaji Asz\u00fa.\nBy region.\nAfrica.\nThroughout much of central and western Africa, there is no tradition of a dessert course following a meal. Fruit or fruit salad would be eaten instead, which may be spiced, or sweetened with a sauce. In some former colonies in the region, the colonial power has influenced desserts \u2013 for example, the Angolan \"cocada amarela\" (yellow coconut) resembles baked desserts in Portugal.\nAsia.\nIn Asia, desserts are often eaten between meals as snacks rather than as a concluding course. There is widespread use of rice flour in East Asian desserts, which often include local ingredients such as coconut milk, palm sugar, and tropical fruit. In India, where sugarcane has been grown and refined since before 500 BC, desserts have been an important part of the diet for thousands of years; types of desserts include burfis, halvahs, jalebis, and laddus.\nEurope.\nIn Ukraine and Russia, breakfast foods such as nalysnyky or blintz or oladi (pancake), and syrniki are served with honey and jam as desserts.\nIn the Netherlands vla is a popular dessert. It is a custard-like dessert that is served cold. Popular flavours are: vanilla, chocolate, caramel, and several fruit flavours. There is also hopjesvla which is flavoured like a Hopje, a Dutch coffee and caramel sweet.\nFrance.\nEarly use of the term.\nThe word \"dessert\" as a culinary term appears as early as 1393 in the \"M\u00e9nagier de Paris\", where \"desserte\" is included in three of the twenty-nine menus. The \"desserte\" comes near the end of the meal, but before the \"issue\" (departure) of hypocras and wafers, included in ten of the menus; and before the \"boute-hors\" (sendoff) of wines and spices, included in four of the menus. The \"desserte\" was the last cooked course of the meal, but the \"boute-hors\" was the true final course of the meal.\nIn the later printed book \"Petit traict\u00e9 auquel verrez la maniere de faire cuisine\" (c. 1536), more widely known from the edition titled \"Livre fort excellent de cuisine\" (1542), the menus at the end of the book present the meal in four stages : the \"entree de table\" (entrance to the table), \"potaiges\" (foods boiled or simmered \"in pots\"), \"services de rost\" (meat or fowl \"roasted\" in dry heat), and \"issue de table\" (departure from the table). The \"issue de table\" includes fruit, nuts, pastries, jellies, cheese, and cream. The menus do not mention \"dessert\".\nDessert in the \"Classical Order\" of table service.\nBetween the mid-16th and mid-17th century, the stages of the meal underwent several significant changes. Notably, potage became the first stage of the meal, the entr\u00e9e became the second stage, entremets came to be served in their own distinct stage after the roast, and the last course of the meal came to be called \"dessert\".\nIn the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, the dessert stage of the meal consisted entirely of foods \"from the storeroom\" (\"de l'office\"), such as fresh, stewed, preserved, and dried fruits; fruit jellies; nuts; cheese and other dairy dishes; dry biscuits (cookies) and wafers; and, beginning in the mid-18th century, ices and petits fours.\nOn lean days out of Lent, the dishes in the dessert stage of the meal were the same as those served on meat days. In Lent, though, eggs were never served at any meal, and only dishes that did not include eggs were appropriate for the dessert stage.\nDespite the significance of dessert in the structured meals of the time, the dessert course was often not included on the menus or bills of fare of the 17th and 18th centuries.\nChanges in the 19th and 20th centuries.\nIn the late 19th century, the word dessert, which properly referred to the last stage of the meal, came to refer also to the dishes that were served in that stage.\nIn the 20th century, cheeses came to be served in their own course just before the dessert course.\nAlso in the 20th century, sweet dishes from the kitchen, such as freshly prepared pastries, meringues, custards, puddings, and baked fruits, which had traditionally been served in the entremets course, came to be included among the desserts.\nNorth America.\nIce cream in The United States is popular. Pie and Cheesecake is also fairly popular in the US. Some of Mexicos favorite desserts are Flan, Paletas, and Pastel de Tres Leches.\nSouth America.\nDulce de leche is a very common confection in Argentina. In Bolivia, sugarcane, honey and coconut are traditionally used in desserts. \"Tawa tawa\" is a Bolivian sweet fritter prepared using sugar cane, and \"helado de canela\" is a dessert that is similar to sherbet which is prepared with cane sugar and cinnamon. Coconut tarts, puddings cookies and candies are also consumed in Bolivia. Brazil has a variety of candies such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and Romeu e Julieta (cheese with a guava jam known as goiabada). Peanuts are used to make pa\u00e7oca, rapadura and p\u00e9-de-moleque. Local common fruits are turned in juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream. In Chile, \"kuchen\" has been described as a \"trademark dessert\". Several desserts in Chile are prepared with \"manjar\", (caramelized milk), including \"alfajor\", \"flan\", \"cuchufli\" and \"arroz con leche\". Desserts consumed in Colombia include dulce de leche, waffle cookies, puddings, nougat, coconut with syrup and thickened milk with sugarcane syrup. Desserts in Ecuador tend to be simple, and desserts are a moderate part of the cuisine. Desserts consumed in Ecuador include tres leches cake, flan, candies and various sweets.\nOceania.\nIn Australia, meals are often finished with dessert. This includes various fruits. More complex desserts include cakes, pies and cookies, which are sometimes served during special occasions.\nNew Zealand and Australia have a long-standing debate over which country invented the Pavlova. The pavlova is named after Anna Pavlova, who visited both countries in the 1920s.\nMarket.\nThe market for desserts has grown over the last few decades, being greatly increased by the commercialization of baking desserts and the rise of food productions. Desserts are served in most restaurants as their popularity has increased. Many commercial stores have been established as solely dessert stores. Ice cream parlors have been around since before 1800. Many businesses have started advertising campaigns focusing solely on desserts. The tactics used to market desserts are very different depending on the audience; for example, desserts can be advertised with popular movie characters to target children. The rise of companies such as Food Network has produced many shows which feature desserts and their creation. Shows like these have displayed extreme desserts and made a game show atmosphere to make desserts a more competitive field.\nDesserts are a standard staple in restaurant menus, with different degrees of variety. Pie and cheesecake were among the most popular dessert courses ordered in U.S. restaurants in 2012.\nNutrition.\nDessert foods often contain relatively high amounts of sugar and fats and, as a result, higher calorie counts per gram than other foods. Fresh or cooked fruit with minimal added sugar or fat is an exception.\nSee also.\nList articles.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes, references, and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.\nDeveloped in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data. In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency (NSA), the NBS selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against brute-force attacks), which was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.\nThe publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard led to its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny. Controversies arose from classified design elements, a relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design, and the involvement of the NSA, raising suspicions about a backdoor. The S-boxes that had prompted those suspicions were designed by the NSA to address a vulnerability they secretly knew (differential cryptanalysis). However, the NSA also ensured that the key size was drastically reduced. The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.\nDES is insecure due to the relatively short 56-bit key size. In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see ). There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible in practice. DES has been withdrawn as a standard by the NIST. Later, the variant Triple DES was developed to increase the security level, but it is considered insecure today as well. DES has been superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\nSome documents distinguish between the DES standard and its algorithm, referring to the algorithm as the DEA (Data Encryption Algorithm).\nHistory.\nThe origins of DES date to 1972, when a National Bureau of Standards study of US government computer security identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.\nAround the same time, engineer Mohamed Atalla in 1972 founded Atalla Corporation and developed the first hardware security module (HSM), the so-called \"Atalla Box\" which was commercialized in 1973. It protected offline devices with a secure PIN generating key, and was a commercial success. Banks and credit card companies were fearful that Atalla would dominate the market, which spurred the development of an international encryption standard. Atalla was an early competitor to IBM in the banking market, and was cited as an influence by IBM employees who worked on the DES standard. The IBM 3624 later adopted a similar PIN verification system to the earlier Atalla system.\nOn 15 May 1973, after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria. None of the submissions was suitable. A second request was issued on 27 August 1974. This time, IBM submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable\u2014a cipher developed during the period 1973\u20131974 based on an earlier algorithm, Horst Feistel's Lucifer cipher. The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis included Feistel, Walter Tuchman, Don Coppersmith, Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer, Mike Matyas, Roy Adler, Edna Grossman, Bill Notz, Lynn Smith, and Bryant Tuckerman.\nNSA's involvement in the design.\nOn 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the \"Federal Register\". Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard. There was criticism received from public-key cryptography pioneers Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, citing a shortened key length and the mysterious \"S-boxes\" as evidence of improper interference from the NSA. The suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they\u2014but no one else\u2014could easily read encrypted messages. Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, \"We sent the S-boxes off to Washington. They came back and were all different.\" The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement. In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the development of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced key size was sufficient; indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.\nHowever, it also found that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way. IBM invented and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, and concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all commercial applications for which the DES was intended.\nAnother member of the DES team, Walter Tuchman, stated \"We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not dictate a single wire!\"\nIn contrast, a declassified NSA book on cryptologic history states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nand\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute-force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes. Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits. Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key.\nSome of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in 1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir of differential cryptanalysis, a general method for breaking block ciphers. The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique in the 1970s. This was indeed the case; in 1994, Don Coppersmith published some of the original design criteria for the S-boxes. According to Steven Levy, IBM Watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique secret. Coppersmith explains IBM's secrecy decision by saying, \"that was because [differential cryptanalysis] can be a very powerful tool, used against many schemes, and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security.\" Levy quotes Walter Tuchman: \"[t]hey asked us to stamp all our documents confidential... We actually put a number on each one and locked them up in safes, because they were considered U.S. government classified. They said do it. So I did it\". Bruce Schneier observed that \"It took the academic community two decades to figure out that the NSA 'tweaks' actually improved the security of DES.\"\nThe algorithm as a standard.\nDespite the criticisms, DES was approved as a federal standard in November 1976, and published on 15 January 1977 as FIPS PUB 46, authorized for use on all unclassified data. It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988 (revised as FIPS-46-1), 1993 (FIPS-46-2), and again in 1999 (FIPS-46-3), the latter prescribing \"Triple DES\" (see below). On 26 May 2002, DES was finally superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), following a public competition. On 19 May 2005, FIPS 46-3 was officially withdrawn, but NIST has approved Triple DES through the year 2030 for sensitive government information.\nThe algorithm is also specified in ANSI X3.92 (Today X3 is known as INCITS and ANSI X3.92 as ANSI INCITS 92), NIST SP 800-67 and ISO/IEC 18033-3 (as a component of TDEA).\nAnother theoretical attack, linear cryptanalysis, was published in 1994, but it was the Electronic Frontier Foundation's DES cracker in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be attacked very practically, and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm. These and other methods of cryptanalysis are discussed in more detail later in this article.\nThe introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers. According to a NIST retrospective about DES,\nThe DES can be said to have \"jump-started\" the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms. In the 1970s there were very few cryptographers, except for those in military or intelligence organizations, and little academic study of cryptography. There are now many active academic cryptologists, mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography, and commercial information security companies and consultants. A generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing (that is, trying to \"crack\") the DES algorithm. In the words of cryptographer Bruce Schneier, \"DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else. Now there was an algorithm to study.\" An astonishing share of the open literature in cryptography in the 1970s and 1980s dealt with the DES, and the DES is the standard against which every symmetric key algorithm since has been compared.\nDescription.\nDES is the archetypal block cipher\u2014an algorithm that takes a fixed-length string of plaintext bits and transforms it through a series of complicated operations into another ciphertext bitstring of the same length. In the case of DES, the block size is 64 bits. DES also uses a key to customize the transformation, so that decryption can supposedly only be performed by those who know the particular key used to encrypt. The key ostensibly consists of 64 bits; however, only 56 of these are actually used by the algorithm. Eight bits are used solely for checking parity, and are thereafter discarded. Hence the effective key length is 56 bits.\nThe key is nominally stored or transmitted as 8 bytes, each with odd parity. According to ANSI X3.92-1981 (Now, known as ANSI INCITS 92\u20131981), section 3.5:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One bit in each 8-bit byte of the \"KEY\" may be utilized for error detection in key generation, distribution, and storage. Bits 8, 16..., 64 are for use in ensuring that each byte is of odd parity.\nLike other block ciphers, DES by itself is not a secure means of encryption, but must instead be used in a mode of operation. FIPS-81 specifies several modes for use with DES. Further comments on the usage of DES are contained in FIPS-74.\nDecryption uses the same structure as encryption, but with the keys used in reverse order. (This has the advantage that the same hardware or software can be used in both directions.)\nOverall structure.\nThe algorithm's overall structure is shown in Figure 1: there are 16 identical stages of processing, termed \"rounds\". There is also an initial and final permutation, termed \"IP\" and \"FP\", which are inverses (IP \"undoes\" the action of FP, and vice versa). IP and FP have no cryptographic significance, but were included in order to facilitate loading blocks in and out of mid-1970s 8-bit based hardware.\nBefore the main rounds, the block is divided into two 32-bit halves and processed alternately; this criss-crossing is known as the Feistel scheme. The Feistel structure ensures that decryption and encryption are very similar processes\u2014the only difference is that the subkeys are applied in the reverse order when decrypting. The rest of the algorithm is identical. This greatly simplifies implementation, particularly in hardware, as there is no need for separate encryption and decryption algorithms.\nThe \u2295 symbol denotes the exclusive-OR (XOR) operation. The \"F-function\" scrambles half a block together with some of the key. The output from the F-function is then combined with the other half of the block, and the halves are swapped before the next round. After the final round, the halves are swapped; this is a feature of the Feistel structure which makes encryption and decryption similar processes.\nThe Feistel (F) function.\nThe F-function, depicted in Figure 2, operates on half a block (32 bits) at a time and consists of four stages:\nThe alternation of substitution from the S-boxes, and permutation of bits from the P-box and E-expansion provides so-called \"confusion and diffusion\" respectively, a concept identified by Claude Shannon in the 1940s as a necessary condition for a secure yet practical cipher.\nKey schedule.\nFigure 3 illustrates the \"key schedule\" for encryption\u2014the algorithm which generates the subkeys. Initially, 56 bits of the key are selected from the initial 64 by \"Permuted Choice 1\" (\"PC-1\")\u2014the remaining eight bits are either discarded or used as parity check bits. The 56 bits are then divided into two 28-bit halves; each half is thereafter treated separately. In successive rounds, both halves are rotated left by one or two bits (specified for each round), and then 48 subkey bits are selected by \"Permuted Choice 2\" (\"PC-2\")\u201424 bits from the left half, and 24 from the right. The rotations (denoted by \"\u00ab&lt;\" in the diagram) mean that a different set of bits is used in each subkey; each bit is used in approximately 14 out of the 16 subkeys.\nThe key schedule for decryption is similar\u2014the subkeys are in reverse order compared to encryption. Apart from that change, the process is the same as for encryption. The same 28 bits are passed to all rotation boxes.\nPseudocode.\nPseudocode for the DES algorithm follows.\nSecurity and cryptanalysis.\nAlthough more information has been published on the cryptanalysis of DES than any other block cipher, the most practical attack to date is still a brute-force approach. Various minor cryptanalytic properties are known, and three theoretical attacks are possible which, while having a theoretical complexity less than a brute-force attack, require an unrealistic number of known or chosen plaintexts to carry out, and are not a concern in practice.\nBrute-force attack.\nFor any cipher, the most basic method of attack is brute force\u2014trying every possible key in turn. The length of the key determines the number of possible keys, and hence the feasibility of this approach. For DES, questions were raised about the adequacy of its key size early on, even before it was adopted as a standard, and it was the small key size, rather than theoretical cryptanalysis, which dictated a need for a replacement algorithm. As a result of discussions involving external consultants including the NSA, the key size was reduced from 256 bits to 56 bits to fit on a single chip.\nIn academia, various proposals for a DES-cracking machine were advanced. In 1977, Diffie and Hellman proposed a machine costing an estimated ) which could find a DES key in a single day. By 1993, Wiener had proposed a key-search machine costing ) which would find a key within 7 hours. However, none of these early proposals were ever implemented\u2014or, at least, no implementations were publicly acknowledged. The vulnerability of DES was practically demonstrated in the late 1990s. In 1997, RSA Security sponsored a series of contests, offering a $10,000 prize to the first team that broke a message encrypted with DES for the contest. That contest was won by the DESCHALL Project, led by Rocke Verser, Matt Curtin, and Justin Dolske, using idle cycles of thousands of computers across the Internet. The feasibility of cracking DES quickly was demonstrated in 1998 when a custom DES-cracker was built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a cyberspace civil rights group, at the cost of approximately ) (see EFF DES cracker). Their motivation was to show that DES was breakable in practice as well as in theory: \"There are many people who will not believe a truth until they can see it with their own eyes. Showing them a physical machine that can crack DES in a few days is the only way to convince some people that they really cannot trust their security to DES.\" The machine brute-forced a key in a little more than 2 days' worth of searching.\nThe next confirmed DES cracker was the COPACOBANA machine built in 2006 by teams of the Universities of Bochum and Kiel, both in Germany. Unlike the EFF machine, COPACOBANA consists of commercially available, reconfigurable integrated circuits. 120 of these field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) of type XILINX Spartan-3 1000 run in parallel. They are grouped in 20 DIMM modules, each containing 6 FPGAs. The use of reconfigurable hardware makes the machine applicable to other code breaking tasks as well. One of the more interesting aspects of COPACOBANA is its cost factor. One machine can be built for approximately ). The cost decrease by roughly a factor of 25 over the EFF machine is an example of the continuous improvement of digital hardware\u2014see Moore's law. Since 2007, SciEngines GmbH, a spin-off company of the two project partners of COPACOBANA has enhanced and developed successors of COPACOBANA. In 2008 their COPACOBANA RIVYERA reduced the time to break DES to less than one day, using 128 Spartan-3 5000's. SciEngines RIVYERA held the record in brute-force breaking DES, having utilized 128 Spartan-3 5000 FPGAs. Their 256 Spartan-6 LX150 model has further lowered this time.\nIn 2012, David Hulton and Moxie Marlinspike announced a system with 48 Xilinx Virtex-6 LX240T FPGAs, each FPGA containing 40 fully pipelined DES cores running at , for a total capacity of 768 gigakeys/sec. The system can exhaustively search the entire 56-bit DES key space in about 26 hours and this service is offered for a fee online. However, the service has been offline since 2024[ [update]] for maintenance\nAttacks faster than brute force.\nThere are three attacks known that can break the full 16 rounds of DES with less complexity than a brute-force search: differential cryptanalysis (DC), linear cryptanalysis (LC), and Davies' attack. However, the attacks are theoretical and are generally considered infeasible to mount in practice; these types of attack are sometimes termed certificational weaknesses.\nThere have also been attacks proposed against reduced-round versions of the cipher, that is, versions of DES with fewer than 16 rounds. Such analysis gives an insight into how many rounds are needed for safety, and how much of a security margin the full version retains.\nDifferential-linear cryptanalysis was proposed by Langford and Hellman in 1994, and combines differential and linear cryptanalysis into a single attack. An enhanced version of the attack can break 9-round DES with 215.8 chosen plaintexts and has a 229.2 time complexity.\nMinor cryptanalytic properties.\nDES exhibits the complementation property, namely that\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is the bitwise complement of formula_3 formula_4 denotes encryption with key formula_5 formula_6 and formula_7 denote plaintext and ciphertext blocks respectively. The complementation property means that the work for a brute-force attack could be reduced by a factor of 2 (or a single bit) under a chosen-plaintext assumption. By definition, this property also applies to TDES cipher.\nDES also has four so-called \"weak keys\". Encryption (\"E\") and decryption (\"D\") under a weak key have the same effect (see involution):\nformula_8 or equivalently, formula_9\nThere are also six pairs of \"semi-weak keys\". Encryption with one of the pair of semiweak keys, formula_10, operates identically to decryption with the other, formula_11:\nformula_12 or equivalently, formula_13\nIt is easy enough to avoid the weak and semiweak keys in an implementation, either by testing for them explicitly, or simply by choosing keys randomly; the odds of picking a weak or semiweak key by chance are negligible. The keys are not really any weaker than any other keys anyway, as they do not give an attack any advantage.\nDES has also been proved not to be a group, or more precisely, the set formula_14 (for all possible keys formula_15) under functional composition is not a group, nor \"close\" to being a group. This was an open question for some time, and if it had been the case, it would have been possible to break DES, and multiple encryption modes such as Triple DES would not increase the security, because repeated encryption (and decryptions) under different keys would be equivalent to encryption under another, single key.\nSimplified DES.\nSimplified DES (SDES) was designed for educational purposes only, to help students learn about modern cryptanalytic techniques.\nSDES has similar structure and properties to DES, but has been simplified to make it much easier to perform encryption and decryption by hand with pencil and paper.\nSome people feel that learning SDES gives insight into DES and other block ciphers, and insight into various cryptanalytic attacks against them.\nReplacement algorithms.\nConcerns about security and the relatively slow operation of DES in software motivated researchers to propose a variety of alternative block cipher designs, which started to appear in the late 1980s and early 1990s: examples include RC5, Blowfish, IDEA, NewDES, SAFER, CAST5 and FEAL. Most of these designs kept the 64-bit block size of DES, and could act as a \"drop-in\" replacement, although they typically used a 64-bit or 128-bit key. In the Soviet Union the GOST 28147-89 algorithm was introduced, with a 64-bit block size and a 256-bit key, which was also used in Russia later.\nAnother approach to strengthening DES was the development of Triple DES (3DES), which applies the DES algorithm three times to each data block to increase security. However, 3DES was later deprecated by NIST due to its inefficiencies and susceptibility to certain cryptographic attacks.\nA crucial aspect of DES involves its permutations and key scheduling, which play a significant role in its encryption process. Analyzing these permutations helps in understanding DES's security limitations and the need for replacement algorithms. A detailed breakdown of DES permutations and their role in encryption is available in this analysis of Data Encryption Standards Permutations.\nDES itself can be adapted and reused in a more secure scheme. Many former DES users now use Triple DES (TDES) which was described and analysed by one of DES's patentees (see FIPS Pub 46\u20133); it involves applying DES three times with two (2TDES) or three (3TDES) different keys. TDES is regarded as adequately secure, although it is quite slow. A less computationally expensive alternative is DES-X, which increases the key size by XORing extra key material before and after DES. GDES was a DES variant proposed as a way to speed up encryption, but it was shown to be susceptible to differential cryptanalysis.\nOn January 2, 1997, NIST announced that they wished to choose a successor to DES. In 2001, after an international competition, NIST selected a new cipher, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), as a replacement. The algorithm which was selected as the AES was submitted by its designers under the name Rijndael. Other finalists in the NIST AES competition included RC6, Serpent, MARS, and Twofish.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They reduce the likelihood of leaks occurring compared to single-hulled tankers, and their ability to prevent or reduce oil spills led to double hulls being standardized for oil tankers and other types of ships including by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships or MARPOL Convention. After the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil spill disaster in Alaska in 1989, the US government required all new oil tankers built for use between US ports to be equipped with a full double hull.\nReasons for use.\nA number of manufacturers have embraced oil tankers with a double hull because it strengthens the hull of ships, reducing the likelihood of oil disasters in low-impact collisions and groundings over single-hull ships. They reduce the likelihood of leaks occurring at low speed impacts in port areas when the ship is under pilotage. Research of impact damage of ships has revealed that double-hulled tankers are unlikely to perforate both hulls in a collision, preventing oil from seeping out. However, for smaller tankers, U-shaped tanks might be susceptible to \"free flooding\" across the double bottom and up to the outside water level each side of the cargo tank. Salvors prefer to salvage doubled-hulled tankers because they permit the use of air pressure to vacuum out the flood water. In the 1960s, collision proof double hulls for nuclear ships were extensively investigated, due to escalating concerns over nuclear accidents.\nThe ability of double-hulled tankers to prevent or reduce oil spills led to double hulls being standardized for other types of ships including oil tankers by the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships or MARPOL Convention. In 1992, MARPOL was amended, making it \"mandatory for tankers of 5,000 dwt and more ordered after 6 July 1993 to be fitted with double hulls, or an alternative design approved by IMO\". However, in the aftermath of the Erika incident of the coast off France in December 1999, members of IMO adopted a revised schedule for the phase-out of single-hull tankers, which came into effect on 1 September 2003, with further amendments validated on 5 April 2005.\nAfter the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil spill disaster, when that ship grounded on Bligh Reef outside the port of Valdez, Alaska in 1989, the US government required all new oil tankers built for use between US ports to be equipped with a full double hull. However, the damage to the Exxon Valdez penetrated sections of the hull (the slops oil tanks, or slop tanks) that were protected by a double bottom, or partial double hull.\nMaintenance issues.\nAlthough double-hulled tankers reduce the likelihood of ships grazing rocks and creating holes in the hull, a double hull does not protect against major, high-energy collisions or groundings which cause the majority of oil pollution, despite this being the reason that the double hull was mandated by United States legislation. Double-hulled tankers, if poorly designed, constructed, maintained and operated can be as problematic, if not more problematic than their single-hulled counterparts. Double-hulled tankers have a more complex design and structure than their single-hulled counterparts, which means that they require more maintenance and care in operating, which if not subject to responsible monitoring and policing, may cause problems. Double hulls often result in the weight of the hull increasing by at least 20%, and because the steel weight of doubled-hulled tanks should not be greater than that of single-hulled ships, the individual hull walls are typically thinner and theoretically less resistant to wear. Double hulls by no means eliminate the possibility of the hulls breaking apart. Due to the air space between the hulls, there is also a potential problem with volatile gases seeping out through worn areas of the internal hull, increasing the risk of an explosion.\nAlthough several international conventions against pollution are in place, as of 2003 there was still no formal body setting international mandatory standards, although the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT) does provide guidelines giving advice on optimum use and safety, such as recommending that ballast tanks are not entered while loaded with cargo, and that weekly samples are made of the atmosphere inside for hydrocarbon gas. Due to the difficulties of maintenance, ship builders have been competitive in producing double-hulled ships which are easier to inspect, such as ballast and cargo tanks which are easily accessible and easier to spot corrosion in the hull. The Tanker Structure Cooperative Forum (TSCF) published the \"Guide to Inspection and Maintenance of Double-Hull Tanker Structures\" in 1995 giving advice based on experience of operating double-hulled tankers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition to their basic function of satisfying thirst, drinks play important roles in human culture. Common types of drinks include plain drinking water, milk, juice, smoothies and soft drinks. Traditionally warm beverages encompass coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. Caffeinated drinks that contain the stimulant caffeine, have been consumed for centuries.\nIn addition, alcoholic drinks such as wine, beer, and liquor, which contain the psychoactive substance ethanol, have been part of human culture for more than 8,000 years. Non-alcoholic drinks typically refer to beverages that are traditionally alcoholic\u2014such as beer, wine, or cocktails\u2014but are produced with a very low alcohol by volume content. This category includes beverages that have undergone processes to remove or significantly reduce alcohol, such as non-alcoholic beers and de-alcoholized wines.\nBiology.\nWhen the human body becomes dehydrated, a person experiences thirst. This craving of fluids results in an instinctive \"need to drink\". Thirst is regulated by the hypothalamus in response to subtle changes in the body's electrolyte levels, and also as a result of changes in the volume of blood circulating. The complete deprivation of drinks (that is, water) will result in death faster than the removal of any other substance besides oxygen. Water and milk have been basic drinks throughout history. As water is essential for life, it has also been the carrier of many diseases.\nAs society developed, techniques were discovered to create alcoholic drinks from the plants that were available in different areas. The earliest archaeological evidence of wine production yet found has been at sites in Georgia (c.\u20096000 BCE) and Iran (c.\u20095000 BCE). Beer may have been known in Neolithic Europe as far back as 3000 BCE, and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale. The invention of beer (and bread) has been argued to be responsible for humanity's ability to develop technology and build civilization. Tea likely originated in Yunnan, China, during the Shang dynasty (1500 BCE\u20131046 BCE) as a medicinal drink.\nHistory.\nDrinking has been a large part of socialising throughout the centuries. In ancient Greece, a social gathering for the purpose of drinking was known as a symposium, where watered down wine would be drunk. The purpose of these gatherings could be anything from serious discussions to direct indulgence. In ancient Rome, a similar concept of a \"convivium\" took place regularly.\nMany early societies considered alcohol a gift from the gods, leading to the creation of gods such as Dionysus. Other religions forbid, discourage, or restrict the drinking of alcoholic drinks for various reasons. In some regions with a dominant religion the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic drinks is forbidden to everybody, regardless of religion.\nToasting is a method of honoring a person or wishing good will by taking a drink. Another tradition is that of the loving cup, at weddings or other celebrations such as sports victories a group will share a drink in a large receptacle, shared by everyone until empty.\nIn East Africa and Yemen, coffee was used in native religious ceremonies. As these ceremonies conflicted with the beliefs of the Christian church, the Ethiopian Church banned the secular consumption of coffee until the reign of Emperor Menelik II. The drink was also banned in Ottoman Turkey during the 17th century for political reasons and was associated with rebellious political activities in Europe.\nProduction.\nA drink is a form of liquid which has been prepared for human consumption. The preparation can include a number of different steps, some prior to transport, others immediately prior to consumption.\nPurification of water.\nWater is the chief constituent in all drinks, and the primary ingredient in most. Water is purified prior to drinking. Methods for purification include filtration and the addition of chemicals, such as chlorination. The importance of purified water is highlighted by the World Health Organization, who point out 94% of deaths from diarrhea \u2013 the third biggest cause of infectious death worldwide at 1.8 million annually \u2013 could be prevented by improving the quality of the victim's environment, particularly safe water.\nPasteurization.\nPasteurization is the process of heating a liquid for a period of time at a specified temperature, then immediately cooling. The process reduces the growth of microorganisms within the liquid, thereby increasing the time before spoilage. It is primarily used on milk, which prior to pasteurization is commonly infected with pathogenic bacteria and therefore is more likely than any other part of the common diet in the developed world to cause illness.\nJuicing.\nThe process of extracting juice from fruits and vegetables can take a number of forms. Simple crushing of most fruits will provide a significant amount of liquid, though a more intense pressure can be applied to get the maximum amount of juice from the fruit. Both crushing and pressing are processes used in the production of wine.\nInfusion.\nInfusion is the process of extracting flavors from plant material by allowing the material to remain suspended within water. This process is used in the production of teas, herbal teas and can be used to prepare coffee (when using a coffee press).\nPercolation.\nThe name is derived from the word \"percolate\" which means \"to cause (a solvent) to pass through a permeable substance especially for extracting a soluble constituent\". In the case of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, aroma, and stimulating properties.\nCarbonation.\nCarbonation is the process of dissolving carbon dioxide into a liquid, such as water.\nFermentation.\nFermentation is a metabolic process that converts sugar to ethanol. Fermentation has been used by humans for the production of drinks since the Neolithic age. In winemaking, grape juice is combined with yeast in an anaerobic environment to allow the fermentation. The amount of sugar in the wine and the length of time given for fermentation determine the alcohol level and the sweetness of the wine.\nWhen brewing beer, there are four primary ingredients \u2013 water, grain, yeast and hops. The grain is encouraged to germinate by soaking and drying in heat, a process known as malting. It is then milled before soaking again to create the sugars needed for fermentation. This process is known as mashing. Hops are added for flavouring, then the yeast is added to the mixture (now called wort) to start the fermentation process.\nDistillation.\nDistillation is a method of separating mixtures based on differences in volatility of components in a boiling liquid mixture. It is one of the methods used in the purification of water. It is also a method of producing spirits from milder alcoholic drinks.\nMixing.\nAn alcoholic mixed drink that contains two or more ingredients is referred to as a cocktail. Cocktails were originally a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters. The term is now often used for almost any mixed drink that contains alcohol, including mixers, mixed shots, etc. A cocktail today usually contains one or more kinds of spirit and one or more mixers, such as soda or fruit juice. Additional ingredients may be sugar, honey, milk, cream, and various herbs.\nType.\nNon-alcoholic drinks.\nA non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no alcohol. This category includes low-alcohol beer, non-alcoholic wine, and apple cider if they contain a sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume (ABV). The exact definition of what is \"non-alcoholic\" and what is not depends on local laws: in the United Kingdom, \"alcohol-free beer\" is under 0.05% ABV, \"de-alcoholised beer\" is under 0.5%, while \"low-alcohol beer\" can contain no more than 1.2% ABV. The term \"soft drink\" specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to \"hard drink\" and \"drink\". The term \"drink\" is theoretically neutral, but often is used in a way that suggests alcoholic content. Drinks such as soda pop, sparkling water, iced tea, lemonade, root beer, fruit punch, milk, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, milkshakes, tap water, bottled water, juice, and energy drinks are all soft drinks.\nWater.\nWater is the world's most consumed drink, however, 97% of water on Earth is non-drinkable salt water. Fresh water is found in rivers, lakes, wetlands, groundwater, and frozen glaciers. Less than 1% of the Earth's fresh water supplies are accessible through surface water and underground sources which are cost effective to retrieve.\nIn western cultures, water is often drunk cold. In the Chinese culture, it is typically drunk hot.\nMilk.\nMilk is regarded as one of the \"original\" drinks; milk is the primary source of nutrition for babies. In many cultures of the world, especially the Western world, humans continue to consume dairy milk beyond infancy, using the milk of other animals (especially cattle, goats and sheep) as a drink.\nCarbonated drinks.\nCarbonated drinks refer to drinks which have carbon dioxide dissolved into them. This can happen naturally through fermenting and in natural water spas or artificially by the dissolution of carbon dioxide under pressure. The first commercially available artificially carbonated drink is believed to have been produced by Thomas Henry in the late 1770s.\nCola, orange, various roots, ginger, and lemon/lime are commonly used to create non-alcoholic carbonated drinks; sugars and preservatives may be added later.\nThe most consumed carbonated soft drinks are produced by three major global brands: Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.\nHot drinks.\nThese drinks are often served warm or hot.\nCoffee.\nCoffee is a brewed drink prepared from the roasted seeds of several species of an evergreen shrub of the genus \"Coffea\". The two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded \"Coffea arabica\", and the \"robusta\" form of the hardier \"Coffea canephora\". Coffee plants are cultivated in more than 70 countries. Once ripe, coffee \"berries\" are picked, processed, and dried to yield the seeds inside. The seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.\nCoffee is slightly acidic (pH 5.0\u20135.1) and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways. The effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies; however, results have varied in terms of coffee's relative benefit.\nCoffee cultivation first took place in southern Arabia; the earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking appears in the middle of the 15th century in the Sufi shrines of Yemen.\nCoffee may have been used socially in the renaissance period of the 17th century. The increasing trades between Europe and North Africa regions made coffee more widely available to Europeans gathering at social locations that served coffee, possibly contributing to the growth of coffeehouses.\nHot chocolate.\nHot chocolate, also known as drinking chocolate or cocoa, is a heated drink consisting of shaved chocolate, melted chocolate or cocoa powder, heated milk or water, and usually a sweetener. Hot chocolate may be topped with whipped cream. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.\nThe first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the Mayans around 2,500-3,000 years ago, and a cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xoc\u014dl\u0101tl. The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then. Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was even used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases.\nHot chocolate is consumed throughout the world and comes in multiple variations, including the spiced \"chocolate para mesa\" of Latin America, the very thick \"cioccolata calda\" served in Italy and \"chocolate a la taza\" served in Spain, and the thinner hot cocoa consumed in the United States. Prepared hot chocolate can be purchased from a range of establishments, including cafeterias, fast food restaurants, coffeehouses and teahouses. Powdered hot chocolate mixes, which can be added to boiling water or hot milk to make the drink at home, are sold at grocery stores and online.\nTea.\nTea, the second most consumed drink in the world, is produced from infusing dried leaves of the \"Camellia sinensis\" shrub, in boiling water. There are many ways in which tea is prepared for consumption: lemon or milk and sugar are among the most common additives worldwide. Other additions include butter and salt in Bhutan, Nepal, and Tibet; bubble tea in Taiwan; fresh ginger in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore; mint in North Africa and Senegal; cardamom in Central Asia; rum to make Jagertee in Central Europe; and coffee to make yuanyang in Hong Kong. Tea is also served differently from country to country: in China, Japan and South Korea tiny cups are used to serve tea; in Thailand and the United States tea is often served cold (as \"iced tea\") or with a lot of sweetener; Indians boil tea with milk and a blend of spices as masala chai; tea is brewed with a samovar in Iran, Kashmir, Russia and Turkey; and in the Australian Outback it is traditionally brewed in a billycan.\nTea leaves can be processed in different ways resulting in a drink which appears and tastes different. Chinese yellow and green tea are steamed, roasted and dried; Oolong tea is semi-oxidised and appears green-black and black teas are fully oxidised.\nHerbal tea.\nAround the world, people refer to other herbal infusions as \"teas\"; it is also argued that these were popular long before the \"Camellia sinensis\" shrub was used for tea making. Leaves, flowers, roots or bark can be used to make a herbal infusion and can be bought fresh, dried or powdered.\nJuice and plant drinks.\nFruit juice is a natural product that contains few or no additives. Citrus products such as orange juice and tangerine juice are familiar breakfast drinks, while grapefruit juice, pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. Coconut water is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice. Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened. Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces wine.\nFruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Fruits can also be blended with ice and other ingredients to make a smoothie. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.\nVegetable juices are usually served warm or cold. Different types of vegetables can be used to make vegetable juice such as carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, celery and many more. Some vegetable juices are mixed with some fruit juice to make the vegetable juice taste better. Many popular vegetable juices, particularly ones with high tomato content, are high in sodium, and therefore consumption of them for health must be carefully considered. Some vegetable juices provide the same health benefits as whole vegetables in terms of reducing risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer.\nPlant milk is a general term for any milk-like product that is derived from a plant source. The most common varieties internationally are soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, coconut milk and oat milk.\nSleep drinks.\nA nightcap is a drink taken shortly before bedtime to induce sleep. For example, a small alcoholic drink or a cup of warm milk can supposedly promote a good night's sleep. Today, most nightcaps and relaxation drinks are generally non-alcoholic beverages containing calming ingredients. They are considered beverages which serve to relax a person. Unlike other calming beverages, such as tea, warm milk or milk with honey; relaxation drinks almost universally contain more than one active ingredient. Relaxation drinks have been known to contain other natural ingredients and are usually free of caffeine and alcohol but some have claimed to contain marijuana.\nAlcoholic drinks.\nA drink is considered \"alcoholic\" if it contains ethanol, commonly known as alcohol (although in chemistry the definition of \"alcohol\" includes many other compounds). Beer has been a part of human civilisation for around 8,000 years.\nBeer.\nBeer is an alcoholic drink produced by the saccharification of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat. Most beer is also flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called brewing. Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic drink. It is said to have been discovered by goddess Ninkasi around 5300 BCE, when she accidentally discovered yeast after leaving grain in jars that were later rained upon and left for several days. Women have been the chief creators of beer throughout history due to its association with domesticity and it, throughout much of history, being brewed in the home for family consumption. Only in recent history have men begun to dabble in the field. It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented drink.\nSome of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \"The Hymn to Ninkasi\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people. Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries.\nCider.\nCider is a fermented alcoholic drink made from fruit juice, most commonly and traditionally apple juice, but also the juice of peaches, pears (\"Perry\" cider) or other fruit. Cider may be made from any variety of apple, but certain cultivars grown solely for use in cider are known as cider apples. The United Kingdom has the highest per capita consumption of cider, as well as the largest cider-producing companies in the world, As of 2006[ [update]], the U.K. produces 600 million litres of cider each year (130 million imperial gallons).\nWine.\nWine is an alcoholic drink made from fermented grapes or other fruits. The natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. Yeast consumes the sugars in the grapes and converts them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, terroir and subsequent appellation, along with human intervention in the overall process. The final product may contain tens of thousands of chemical compounds in amounts varying from a few percent to a few parts per billion.\nWines made from produce besides grapes are usually named after the product from which they are produced (for example, rice wine, pomegranate wine, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine. The term \"wine\" can also refer to starch-fermented or fortified drinks having higher alcohol content, such as barley wine, huangjiu, or sake.\nWine has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with the earliest production so far discovered having occurred c.\u20096000\u00a0BC in Georgia. It had reached the Balkans by c.\u20094500\u00a0BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece and Rome.\nFrom its earliest appearance in written records, wine has also played an important role in religion. Red wine was closely associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians, who, according to Plutarch, avoided its free consumption as late as the 7th-century BC Saite dynasty, \"thinking it to be the blood of those who had once battled against the gods\". The Greek cult and mysteries of Dionysus, carried on by the Romans in their Bacchanalia, were the origins of western theater. Judaism incorporates it in the Kiddush and Christianity in its Eucharist, while alcohol consumption was forbidden in Islam.\nSpirits.\nSpirits are distilled beverages that contain no added sugar and have at least 20% alcohol by volume (ABV). Popular spirits include borovi\u010dka, brandy, gin, rum, slivovitz, tequila, vodka, and whisky. Brandy is a spirit created by distilling wine, whilst vodka may be distilled from any starch- or sugar-rich plant matter; most vodka today is produced from grains such as sorghum, corn, rye, or wheat.\nIn culture.\nPlaces to drink.\nThroughout history, people have come together in establishments to socialise whilst drinking. This includes caf\u00e9s and coffeehouses, focus on providing hot drinks as well as light snacks. Many coffee houses in the Middle East, and in West Asian immigrant districts in the Western world, offer \"shisha\" (\"nargile\" in Turkish and Greek), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah. Espresso bars are a type of coffeehouse that specialize in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.\nIn China and Japan, the establishment would be a tea house, where people would socialise while drinking tea. Chinese scholars have used the teahouse as a place to share ideas.\nAlcoholic drinks are served in drinking establishments, which have different cultural connotations. For example, pubs are fundamental to the culture of The United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Canada, New England, Metro Detroit, South Africa and New Zealand. In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community. The writings of Samuel Pepys describe the pub as the heart of England. Many pubs are controlled by breweries, so cask ale or keg beer may be a better value than wines and spirits.\nIn contrast, types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \"dive bars\", to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Bars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. The term \"bar\" is derived from the specialized counter on which drinks are served. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, go-go dancers, or strippers. Patrons may sit or stand at the bar and be served by the bartender, or they may sit at tables and be served by cocktail servers.\nMatching with food.\nFood and drink are often paired together to enhance the taste experience. This primarily happens with wine and a culture has grown up around the process. Weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented. In recent years, food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.\nPresentation.\nDifferent drinks have unique receptacles for their consumption. This is sometimes purely for presentations purposes, such as for cocktails. In other situations, the drinkware has practical application, such as coffee cups which are designed for insulation or brandy snifters which are designed to encourage evaporation but trap the aroma within the glass.\nMany glasses include a stem, which allows the drinker to hold the glass without affecting the temperature of the drink. In champagne glasses, the bowl is designed to retain champagne's signature carbonation, by reducing the surface area at the opening of the bowl. Historically, champagne has been served in a champagne coupe, the shape of which allowed carbonation to dissipate even more rapidly than from a standard wine glass.\nCommercial trade.\nInternational exports and imports.\nAn important export commodity, coffee was the top agricultural export for twelve countries in 2004,\nand it was the world's seventh-largest legal agricultural export by value in 2005. Green (unroasted) coffee is one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world.\nInvestment.\nSome drinks, such as wine, can be used as an alternative investment. This can be achieved by either purchasing and reselling individual bottles or cases of particular wines, or purchasing shares in an investment wine fund that pools investors' capital.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is native to North Africa, Iran, and the Arabian Peninsula; it is grown widely in Eurasia, where its leaves and seeds are used as a herb or spice for flavouring food.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"dill\" and its close relatives are found in most of the Germanic languages; its ultimate origin is unknown.\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus name \"Anethum\" is the Latin form of Greek \u1f04\u03bd\u1fd1\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd / \u1f04\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd / \u1f04\u03bd\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03bd / \u1f04\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, which meant both \"dill\" and \"anise\". The form 'an\u012bsum' came to be used for anise, and 'an\u0113thum' for dill. The Latin word is the origin of dill's names in the Western Romance languages ('anet', 'aneldo' etc.), and also of the obsolete English 'anet'.\nBotany.\nDill grows up to from a taproot like a carrot. Its stems are slender and hollow with finely divided, softly delicate leaves; the leaves are alternately arranged, long with ultimate leaf divisions measuring broad, slightly broader than the similar leaves of fennel, which are threadlike, less than broad, but harder in texture.\nIn hot or dry weather, small white to yellow scented flowers form in small umbels diameter from one long stalk. The seeds come from dried up fruit long and thick, and straight to slightly curved with a longitudinally ridged surface.\nCultivation.\nSuccessful cultivation requires warm to hot summers with high sunshine levels; even partial shade will reduce the yield substantially. It also prefers rich, well-drained soil. The seed is harvested by cutting the flower heads off the stalks when the seed is beginning to ripen. The seed heads are placed upside down in a paper bag and left in a warm, dry place for a week. The seeds then separate from the stems easily for storage in an airtight container.\nThese plants, like their fennel and parsley relatives, often are eaten by black swallowtail caterpillars in areas where that species occurs. For this reason, they may be included in some butterfly gardens.\nHistory.\nDill has been found in the tomb of Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep II, dating to around 1400\u00a0BC. It was also later found in the Greek city of Samos, around the 7th century BC, and mentioned in the writings of Theophrastus (371\u2013287\u00a0BC). In Greek mythology, the dill was originally a young man named Anethus who was transformed into the plant.\nUses.\nCulinary.\nAroma profile.\nFresh and dried dill leaves (sometimes called \"dill weed\" or \"dillweed\" to distinguish it from dill seed) are widely used as herbs in Europe and in central and south-eastern Asia.\nLike caraway, the fern-like leaves of dill are aromatic and are used to flavour many foods such as gravlax (cured salmon) and other fish dishes, borscht, and other soups, as well as pickles (where the dill flower is sometimes used). Dill is best when used fresh, as it loses its flavor rapidly if dried. However, freeze-dried dill leaves retain their flavour relatively well for a few months.\nDill oil is extracted from the leaves, stems, and seeds of the plant. The oil from the seeds is distilled and used in the manufacturing of soaps.\nDill is the eponymous ingredient in dill pickles.\nCentral and eastern Europe.\nIn central and eastern Europe, the Nordic countries, the Baltic states, Ukraine, and Russia, dill is a staple culinary herb along with chives and parsley. Fresh, finely cut dill leaves are used as a topping in soups, especially the hot red borsht and the cold borsht mixed with curds, kefir, yogurt, or sour cream, which is served during hot summer weather and is called 'okroshka'. It also is popular in summer to drink fermented milk (curds, kefir, yogurt, or buttermilk) mixed with dill (and sometimes other herbs).\nIn the same way, dill is used as a topping for boiled potatoes covered with fresh butter\u00a0\u2013 especially in summer when there are so-called new, or young, potatoes. The dill leaves may be mixed with butter, making a dill butter, to serve the same purpose. Dill leaves mixed with tvorog form one of the traditional cheese spreads used for sandwiches. Fresh dill leaves are used throughout the year as an ingredient in salads, \"e.g.\", one made of lettuce, fresh cucumbers, and tomatoes, as basil leaves are used in Italy and Greece.\nRussian cuisine is noted for liberal use of dill, where it is known as . It is supposed to have antiflatulent properties; some Russian cosmonauts recommended its use in human spaceflight due to such properties being beneficial in confined quarters with a closed air supply.\nIn Polish cuisine, fresh dill leaves mixed with sour cream are the basis for dressings. It is especially popular to use this kind of sauce with freshly cut cucumbers, which are almost wholly immersed in the sauce, making a salad called 'mizeria'. Dill sauce is used hot for baked freshwater fish and for chicken or turkey breast, or used hot or cold for hard-boiled eggs. A dill-based soup, (zupa koperkowa), served with potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, is popular in Poland. Whole stems including roots and flower buds are used traditionally to prepare Polish-style pickled cucumbers (og\u00f3rki kiszone), especially the so-called low-salt cucumbers (og\u00f3rki ma\u0142osolne). Whole stems of dill (often including the roots) also are cooked with potatoes, especially the potatoes of autumn and winter, so they resemble the flavour of the newer potatoes found in summer. Some kinds of fish, especially trout and salmon, traditionally are baked with the stems and leaves of dill.\nIn the Czech Republic, white dill sauce made of cream (or milk), butter, flour, vinegar, and dill is called 'koprov\u00e1 om\u00e1\u010dka' (also 'koprovka' or 'kopra\u010dka') and is served either with boiled eggs and potatoes, or with dumplings and boiled beef. Another Czech dish with dill is a soup called 'kulajda' that contains mushrooms (traditionally wild ones).\nIn Germany, dill is popular as a seasoning for fish and many other dishes, chopped as a garnish on potatoes, and as a flavouring in pickles.\nIn the UK, dill may be used in fish pie.\nIn Bulgaria, dill is widely used in traditional vegetable salads, and most notably the yogurt-based cold soup Tarator. It is also used in the preparation of sour pickles, cabbage, and other dishes.\nIn Romania, dill (m\u0103rar) is widely used as an ingredient for soups such as 'bor\u015f' (pronounced \"borsh\"), pickles, and other dishes, especially those based on peas, beans, and cabbage. It is popular for dishes based on potatoes and mushrooms and may be found in many summer salads (especially cucumber salad, cabbage salad and lettuce salad). During springtime, it is used in omelets with spring onions. It often complements sauces based on sour cream or yogurt and is mixed with salted cheese and used as a filling. Another popular dish with dill as a main ingredient is dill sauce, which is served with eggs and fried sausages.\nIn Hungary, dill is very widely used. It is popular as a sauce or filling, and mixed with a type of cottage cheese. Dill is also used for pickling and in salads. The Hungarian name for dill is 'kapor'.\nIn Serbia, dill is known as 'mirodjija' and is used as an addition to soups, potato and cucumber salads, and French fries. It features in the Serbian proverb, \"\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0452\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0443 \u0441\u0432\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0458 \u0447\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\" /biti mirodjija u svakoj \u010dorbi/ (to be a dill in every soup), which corresponds to the English proverb \"to have a finger in every pie\".\nIn Greece, dill is known as '\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2' (anithos). In antiquity it was used as an ingredient in wines that were called \"anithites oinos\" (wine with anithos-dill). In modern days, dill is used in salads, soups, sauces, and fish and vegetable dishes.\nIn Santa Maria, Azores, dill (endro) is the most important ingredient of the traditional Holy Ghost soup (sopa do Esp\u00edrito Santo). Dill is found ubiquitously in Santa Maria, yet, is rare in the other Azorean Islands.\nIn Sweden, dill is a common spice or herb. The flowers of fully grown dill are called 'krondill' (crown dill) and used when cooking crayfish. The krondill is put into the water after the crayfish is boiled, but still in hot and salt water. Then the entire dish is refrigerated for at least 24 hours before being served (with toasted bread and butter). Krondill is also used to flavor pickles and vodka. After a month or two of fermentation, the cucumber pickles are ready to eat, for instance, with pork, brown sauce, and potatoes, as a sweetener. The thinner part of dill and young plants may be used with boiled fresh potatoes (especially the first potatoes of the year, new potatoes, which usually are small and have a very thin skin). In salads it is used together with, or instead, of other green herbs, such as parsley, chives, and basil. It is often paired up with chives when used in food. Dill is often used to flavour fish and seafood in Sweden, for example, gravlax and various herring pickles, among them the traditional, 'sill i dill' (literally 'herring in dill'). In contrast to the various fish dishes flavoured with dill, there is also a traditional Swedish dish called, 'dillk\u00f6tt', which is a meaty stew flavoured with dill. The dish commonly contains pieces of veal or lamb that are boiled until tender and then served together with a vinegary dill sauce. Dill seeds may be used in breads or 'akvavit'. A newer, non-traditional use of dill is to pair it with chives as a flavouring for potato chips. These are called 'dillchips' and are quite popular in Sweden.\nIn Finland, the uses of dill are very similar to those in Sweden, including flavouring potato chips and, less popularly, in a dish similar to 'dillk\u00f6tt' ('tilliliha'). However, the use of dill in Finland is not as extensive as in large parts of central and eastern Europe, particularly Russia but including even the ethnolinguistically close Estonia.\nAsia and Middle East.\nIn Iran, dill is known as 'shevid' and sometimes, is used with rice and called 'shevid-polo'. It also is used in Iranian 'aash' recipes, and similarly, is called in Persian.\nIn India, dill is known as 'Sholpa' in Bengali, (\u0936\u0947\u092a\u0942) in Marathi, sheppi (\u0936\u0947\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0940) in Konkani, in Hindi, or in Punjabi. In Telugu, it is called 'Soa-kura' (herb greens). It also is called (\u0cb8\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cb8\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cc6 \u0cb8\u0cca\u0caa\u0ccd\u0caa\u0cc1) in Kannada. In Tamil it is known as (\u0b9a\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bbf). In Malayalam, it is \u0d1a\u0d24\u0d15\u0d41\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a () or (). In Sanskrit, this herb is called . In Gujarati, it is known as (\u0ab8\u0ac2\u0ab5\u0abe). In India, dill is prepared in the manner of yellow 'moong dal', as a main-course dish. It is considered to have very good antiflatulent properties, so it is used as 'mukhwas', or an after-meal digestive. Traditionally, it is given to mothers immediately after childbirth. In the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, a small amount of fresh dill is cooked along with cut potatoes and fresh fenugreek leaves (Hindi \u0906\u0932\u0942-\u092e\u0947\u0925\u0940-\u0938\u094b\u092f\u093e).\nIn Manipur, dill, locally known as , is an essential ingredient of \u2013 a traditional Manipuri dish made with fermented soybean and rice.\nIn Laos and parts of northern Thailand, dill is known in English as Lao coriander ( or ), and served as a side with salad yum or papaya salad. In the Lao language, it is called 'phak see', and in Thai, it is known as 'phak chee Lao'. In Lao cuisine, Lao coriander is used extensively in traditional Lao dishes such as 'mok pa' (steamed fish in banana leaf) and several coconut milk curries that contain fish or prawns.\nIn China dill is called colloquially, 'hu\u00edxi\u0101ng' (, perfume of Hui people), or more properly 'sh\u00edlu\u00f3' (). It is a common filling in 'baozi', 'jiaozi' and 'xianbing' and may be used as vegetarian with rice vermicelli, or combined with either meat or eggs. Vegetarian dill baozi are a common part of a Beijing breakfast. In baozi and xianbing, it often is interchangeable with non-bulbing fennel and the term also may refer to fennel, similarly to caraway and coriander leaf, sharing a name in Chinese as well. Dill also may be stir fried as a potherb, often with egg, in the same manner as Chinese chives. In Northern China, Beijing, Inner-Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, and Xinjiang, dill seeds commonly are called 'z\u012br\u00e1n' (), but also 'k\u016bm\u00edng' (), 'k\u016bm\u00edngzi' (), 'sh\u00edlu\u00f3zi' (), 'xi\u01ceohu\u00edxi\u0101ngzi' () and are used with pepper for lamb meat. In the whole of China, 'y\u00e1ngchu\u00e0n' () or 'y\u00e1ngr\u00f2u chu\u00e0n' (), lamb brochette, a speciality from Uyghurs, uses cumin and pepper.\nIn Taiwan, it is also commonly used as a filling in steamed buns (baozi) and dumplings (jiaozi).\nIn Vietnam, the use of dill in cooking is regional. It is used mainly in northern Vietnamese cuisine.\nMiddle East.\nIn Arab countries, dill seed, called (grasshopper's eye), is used as a spice in cold dishes such as 'fattoush' and pickles. In Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, dill is called 'shibint' and is used mostly in fish dishes. In Egypt, dillweed is commonly used to flavour cabbage dishes, including 'mahshi koronb' (stuffed cabbage leaves).\nCompanion planting.\nWhen used as a companion plant, dill attracts many beneficial insects as the umbrella flower heads go to seed. It makes a good companion plant for cucumbers and broccoli.\nTomato plants benefit from dill when it is young because it repels harmful pests while attracting pollinators. But the dill must be pruned before it flowers, otherwise it can slow or stop the growth of the tomatoes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Consequently, the dual space is an important concept in functional analysis.\nEarly terms for \"dual\" include \"polarer Raum\" [Hahn 1927], \"espace conjugu\u00e9\", \"adjoint space\" [Alaoglu 1940], and \"transponierter Raum\" [Schauder 1930] and [Banach 1932]. The term \"dual\" is due to Bourbaki 1938.\nAlgebraic dual space.\nGiven any vector space formula_1 over a field formula_4, the (algebraic) dual space formula_5 (alternatively denoted by formula_6 or formula_7) is defined as the set of all linear maps \"formula_8\" (linear functionals). Since linear maps are vector space homomorphisms, the dual space may be denoted formula_9.\nThe dual space formula_10 itself becomes a vector space over \"formula_4\" when equipped with an addition and scalar multiplication satisfying:\n formula_12\nfor all formula_13, \"formula_14\", and formula_15.\nElements of the algebraic dual space formula_10 are sometimes called covectors, one-forms, or linear forms.\nThe pairing of a functional \"formula_17\" in the dual space formula_10 and an element \"formula_19\" of \"formula_1\" is sometimes denoted by a bracket: \"formula_21\"\nor \"formula_22\". This pairing defines a nondegenerate bilinear mapping formula_23 called the natural pairing.\nFinite-dimensional case.\nIf formula_1 is finite-dimensional, then formula_10 has the same dimension as formula_1. Given a basis formula_27 in formula_1, it is possible to construct a specific basis in formula_10, called the dual basis. This dual basis is a set formula_30 of linear functionals on formula_1, defined by the relation\n formula_32\nfor any choice of coefficients formula_33. In particular, letting in turn each one of those coefficients be equal to one and the other coefficients zero, gives the system of equations\n formula_34\nwhere formula_35 is the Kronecker delta symbol. This property is referred to as the \"bi-orthogonality property\".\nFor example, if formula_1 is formula_37, let its basis be chosen as formula_38. The basis vectors are not orthogonal to each other. Then, formula_39 and formula_40 are one-forms (functions that map a vector to a scalar) such that formula_41, formula_42, formula_43, and formula_44. (Note: The superscript here is the index, not an exponent.) This system of equations can be expressed using matrix notation as\nformula_45\nSolving for the unknown values in the first matrix shows the dual basis to be formula_46. Because formula_39 and formula_40 are functionals, they can be rewritten as formula_49 and formula_50.\nIn general, when formula_1 is formula_52, if formula_53 is a matrix whose columns are the basis vectors and formula_54 is a matrix whose columns are the dual basis vectors, then\nformula_55\nwhere formula_56 is the identity matrix of order formula_57. The biorthogonality property of these two basis sets allows any point formula_58 to be represented as\nformula_59\neven when the basis vectors are not orthogonal to each other. Strictly speaking, the above statement only makes sense once the inner product formula_60 and the corresponding duality pairing are introduced, as described below in \"\".\nIn particular, formula_52 can be interpreted as the space of columns of formula_57 real numbers, its dual space is typically written as the space of \"rows\" of formula_57 real numbers. Such a row acts on formula_52 as a linear functional by ordinary matrix multiplication. This is because a functional maps every formula_57-vector formula_19 into a real number formula_67. Then, seeing this functional as a matrix formula_68, and formula_19 as an formula_70 matrix, and formula_67 a formula_72 matrix (trivially, a real number) respectively, if formula_73 then, by dimension reasons, formula_68 must be a formula_75 matrix; that is, formula_68 must be a row vector.\nIf formula_1 consists of the space of geometrical vectors in the plane, then the level curves of an element of formula_10 form a family of parallel lines in formula_1, because the range is 1-dimensional, so that every point in the range is a multiple of any one nonzero element.\nSo an element of formula_10 can be intuitively thought of as a particular family of parallel lines covering the plane. To compute the value of a functional on a given vector, it suffices to determine which of the lines the vector lies on. Informally, this \"counts\" how many lines the vector crosses.\nMore generally, if formula_1 is a vector space of any dimension, then the level sets of a linear functional in formula_10 are parallel hyperplanes in formula_1, and the action of a linear functional on a vector can be visualized in terms of these hyperplanes.\nInfinite-dimensional case.\nIf formula_1 is not finite-dimensional but has a basis formula_85 indexed by an infinite set formula_86, then the same construction as in the finite-dimensional case yields linearly independent elements formula_87 (formula_88) of the dual space, but they will not form a basis.\nFor instance, consider the space formula_89, whose elements are those sequences of real numbers that contain only finitely many non-zero entries, which has a basis indexed by the natural numbers formula_90. For formula_91, formula_92 is the sequence consisting of all zeroes except in the formula_93-th position, which is 1.\nThe dual space of formula_89 is (isomorphic to) formula_95, the space of \"all\" sequences of real numbers: each real sequence formula_96 defines a function where the element formula_97 of formula_89 is sent to the number\nformula_99\nwhich is a finite sum because there are only finitely many nonzero formula_100. The dimension of formula_89 is countably infinite, whereas formula_95 does not have a countable basis.\nThis observation generalizes to any infinite-dimensional vector space formula_1 over any field formula_4: a choice of basis formula_105 identifies formula_1 with the space formula_107 of functions formula_108 such that formula_109 is nonzero for only finitely many formula_88, where such a function formula_111 is identified with the vector\nformula_112\nin formula_1 (the sum is finite by the assumption on formula_111, and any formula_115 may be written uniquely in this way by the definition of the basis).\nThe dual space of formula_1 may then be identified with the space formula_117 of \"all\" functions from formula_86 to formula_4: a linear functional formula_120 on formula_1 is uniquely determined by the values formula_122 it takes on the basis of formula_1, and any function formula_124 (with formula_125) defines a linear functional formula_120 on formula_1 by\nformula_128\nAgain, the sum is finite because formula_129 is nonzero for only finitely many formula_130.\nThe set formula_107 may be identified (essentially by definition) with the direct sum of infinitely many copies of formula_4 (viewed as a 1-dimensional vector space over itself) indexed by formula_86, i.e. there are linear isomorphisms\nformula_134\nOn the other hand, formula_117 is (again by definition), the direct product of infinitely many copies of formula_4 indexed by formula_86, and so the identification\nformula_138\nis a special case of a general result relating direct sums (of modules) to direct products.\nIf a vector space is not finite-dimensional, then its (algebraic) dual space is \"always\" of larger dimension (as a cardinal number) than the original vector space. This is in contrast to the case of the continuous dual space, discussed below, which may be isomorphic to the original vector space even if the latter is infinite-dimensional.\nThe proof of this inequality between dimensions results from the following.\nIf formula_1 is an infinite-dimensional formula_4-vector space, the arithmetical properties of cardinal numbers implies that \nformula_141\nwhere cardinalities are denoted as absolute values. For proving that formula_142 it suffices to prove that formula_143 which can be done with an argument similar to Cantor's diagonal argument. The exact dimension of the dual is given by the Erd\u0151s\u2013Kaplansky theorem.\nBilinear products and dual spaces.\nIf \"V\" is finite-dimensional, then \"V\" is isomorphic to \"V\"\u2217. But there is in general no natural isomorphism between these two spaces. Any bilinear form formula_60 on formula_1 gives a mapping of formula_1 into its dual space via\nformula_147\nwhere the right hand side is defined as the functional on \"V\" taking each formula_148 to formula_149. In other words, the bilinear form determines a linear mapping\nformula_150\ndefined by\nformula_151\nIf the bilinear form is nondegenerate, then this is an isomorphism onto a subspace of \"V\"\u2217.\nIf \"V\" is finite-dimensional, then this is an isomorphism onto all of \"V\"\u2217. Conversely, any isomorphism formula_152 from \"V\" to a subspace of \"V\"\u2217 (resp., all of \"V\"\u2217 if \"V\" is finite dimensional) defines a unique nondegenerate bilinear form formula_153 on \"V\" by\nformula_154\nThus there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of \"V\" to a subspace of (resp., all of) \"V\"\u2217 and nondegenerate bilinear forms on \"V\".\nIf the vector space \"V\" is over the complex field, then sometimes it is more natural to consider sesquilinear forms instead of bilinear forms.\nIn that case, a given sesquilinear form \u27e8\u00b7,\u00b7\u27e9 determines an isomorphism of \"V\" with the complex conjugate of the dual space\n formula_155\nThe conjugate of the dual space formula_156 can be identified with the set of all additive complex-valued functionals \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 C such that\n formula_157\nInjection into the double-dual.\nThere is a natural homomorphism formula_158 from formula_1 into the double dual formula_160, defined by formula_161 for all formula_162. In other words, if formula_163 is the evaluation map defined by formula_164, then formula_165 is defined as the map formula_166. This map formula_158 is always injective; and it is always an isomorphism if formula_1 is finite-dimensional.\nIndeed, the isomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space with its double dual is an archetypal example of a natural isomorphism.\nInfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not isomorphic to their algebraic double duals, but instead to their continuous double duals.\nTranspose of a linear map.\nIf \"f\" : \"V\" \u2192 \"W\" is a linear map, then the \"transpose\" (or \"dual\") \"f\"\u2217 : \"W\"\u2217 \u2192 \"V\"\u2217 is defined by\n formula_169\nfor every \"formula_170\". The resulting functional \"formula_171\" in \"formula_10\" is called the \"pullback\" of \"formula_17\" along \"formula_111\".\nThe following identity holds for all \"formula_170\" and \"formula_176\":\n formula_177\nwhere the bracket [\u00b7,\u00b7] on the left is the natural pairing of \"V\" with its dual space, and that on the right is the natural pairing of \"W\" with its dual. This identity characterizes the transpose, and is formally similar to the definition of the adjoint.\nThe assignment \"f\" \u21a6 \"f\"\u2217 produces an injective linear map between the space of linear operators from \"V\" to \"W\" and the space of linear operators from \"W\"\u2217 to \"V\"\u2217; this homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if \"W\" is finite-dimensional.\nIf \"V\" = \"W\" then the space of linear maps is actually an algebra under composition of maps, and the assignment is then an antihomomorphism of algebras, meaning that (\"fg\")\u2217 = \"g\"\u2217\"f\"\u2217.\nIn the language of category theory, taking the dual of vector spaces and the transpose of linear maps is therefore a contravariant functor from the category of vector spaces over \"F\" to itself.\nIt is possible to identify (\"f\"\u2217)\u2217 with \"f\" using the natural injection into the double dual.\nIf the linear map \"f\" is represented by the matrix \"A\" with respect to two bases of \"V\" and \"W\", then \"f\"\u2217 is represented by the transpose matrix \"A\"T with respect to the dual bases of \"W\"\u2217 and \"V\"\u2217, hence the name.\nAlternatively, as \"f\" is represented by \"A\" acting on the left on column vectors, \"f\"\u2217 is represented by the same matrix acting on the right on row vectors.\nThese points of view are related by the canonical inner product on R\"n\", which identifies the space of column vectors with the dual space of row vectors.\nQuotient spaces and annihilators.\nLet formula_178 be a subset of formula_1.\nThe annihilator of formula_178 in formula_10, denoted here formula_182, is the collection of linear functionals formula_183 such that formula_184 for all formula_185.\nThat is, formula_182 consists of all linear functionals formula_187 such that the restriction to formula_178 vanishes: formula_189.\nWithin finite dimensional vector spaces, the annihilator is dual to (isomorphic to) the orthogonal complement.\nThe annihilator of a subset is itself a vector space.\nThe annihilator of the zero vector is the whole dual space: formula_190, and the annihilator of the whole space is just the zero covector: formula_191.\nFurthermore, the assignment of an annihilator to a subset of formula_1 reverses inclusions, so that if formula_193, then\n formula_194\nIf formula_86 and formula_196 are two subsets of formula_1 then\n formula_198\nIf formula_199 is any family of subsets of formula_1 indexed by formula_93 belonging to some index set formula_202, then\n formula_203\nIn particular if formula_86 and formula_196 are subspaces of formula_1 then\n formula_207\nand\n formula_208\nIf formula_1 is finite-dimensional and formula_210 is a vector subspace, then\n formula_211\nafter identifying formula_210 with its image in the second dual space under the double duality isomorphism formula_213. In particular, forming the annihilator is a Galois connection on the lattice of subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space.\nIf formula_210 is a subspace of formula_1 then the quotient space formula_216 is a vector space in its own right, and so has a dual. By the first isomorphism theorem, a functional formula_187 factors through formula_216 if and only if formula_210 is in the kernel of formula_111. There is thus an isomorphism\n formula_221\nAs a particular consequence, if formula_1 is a direct sum of two subspaces formula_86 and formula_196, then formula_10 is a direct sum of formula_226 and formula_227.\nDimensional analysis.\nThe dual space is analogous to a \"negative\"-dimensional space. Most simply, since a vector formula_176 can be paired with a covector formula_229 by the natural pairing\nformula_230 to obtain a scalar, a covector can \"cancel\" the dimension of a vector, similar to reducing a fraction. Thus while the direct sum formula_231 is a &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-dimensional space (if &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-dimensional), &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; behaves as an &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;-dimensional space, in the sense that its dimensions can be canceled against the dimensions of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;. This is formalized by tensor contraction.\nThis arises in physics via dimensional analysis, where the dual space has inverse units. Under the natural pairing, these units cancel, and the resulting scalar value is dimensionless, as expected. For example, in (continuous) Fourier analysis, or more broadly time\u2013frequency analysis: given a one-dimensional vector space with a unit of time &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;, the dual space has units of frequency: occurrences \"per\" unit of time (units of &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak;). For example, if time is measured in seconds, the corresponding dual unit is the inverse second: over the course of 3 seconds, an event that occurs 2 times per second occurs a total of 6 times, corresponding to formula_232. Similarly, if the primal space measures length, the dual space measures inverse length.\nContinuous dual space.\nWhen dealing with topological vector spaces, the continuous linear functionals from the space into the base field formula_233 (or formula_234) are particularly important.\nThis gives rise to the notion of the \"continuous dual space\" or \"topological dual\" which is a linear subspace of the algebraic dual space formula_10, denoted by formula_7.\nFor any \"finite-dimensional\" normed vector space or topological vector space, such as Euclidean \"n-\"space, the continuous dual and the algebraic dual coincide.\nThis is however false for any infinite-dimensional normed space, as shown by the example of discontinuous linear maps.\nNevertheless, in the theory of topological vector spaces the terms \"continuous dual space\" and \"topological dual space\" are often replaced by \"dual space\".\nFor a topological vector space formula_1 its \"continuous dual space\", or \"topological dual space\", or just \"dual space\" (in the sense of the theory of topological vector spaces) formula_7 is defined as the space of all continuous linear functionals formula_239.\nImportant examples for continuous dual spaces are the space of compactly supported test functions formula_240 and its dual formula_241 the space of arbitrary distributions (generalized functions); the space of arbitrary test functions formula_242 and its dual formula_243 the space of compactly supported distributions; and the space of rapidly decreasing test functions formula_244 the Schwartz space, and its dual formula_245 the space of tempered distributions (slowly growing distributions) in the theory of generalized functions.\nProperties.\nIf X is a Hausdorff topological vector space (TVS), then the continuous dual space of X is identical to the continuous dual space of the completion of X.\nTopologies on the dual.\nThere is a standard construction for introducing a topology on the continuous dual formula_7 of a topological vector space formula_1. Fix a collection formula_248 of bounded subsets of formula_1.\nThis gives the topology on formula_1 of uniform convergence on sets from formula_251 or what is the same thing, the topology generated by seminorms of the form\nformula_252\nwhere formula_17 is a continuous linear functional on formula_1, and formula_86 runs over the class formula_256\nThis means that a net of functionals formula_257 tends to a functional formula_17 in formula_7 if and only if\nformula_260\nUsually (but not necessarily) the class formula_248 is supposed to satisfy the following conditions:\nIf these requirements are fulfilled then the corresponding topology on formula_7 is Hausdorff and the sets\nformula_273\nform its local base.\nHere are the three most important special cases.\nIf formula_1 is a normed vector space (for example, a Banach space or a Hilbert space) then the strong topology on formula_7 is normed (in fact a Banach space if the field of scalars is complete), with the norm\nformula_280\nEach of these three choices of topology on formula_7 leads to a variant of reflexivity property for topological vector spaces:\nExamples.\nLet 1 &lt; \"p\" &lt; \u221e be a real number and consider the Banach space \"\u2113\u2009p\" of all sequences a = (\"a\"\"n\") for which\nformula_293\nDefine the number \"q\" by 1/\"p\" + 1/\"q\" = 1. Then the continuous dual of \"\u2113\"\u2009\"p\" is naturally identified with \"\u2113\"\u2009\"q\": given an element formula_294, the corresponding element of \"\u2113\"\u2009\"q\" is the sequence formula_295 where formula_296 denotes the sequence whose n-th term is 1 and all others are zero. Conversely, given an element a = (\"a\"\"n\") \u2208 \"\u2113\"\u2009\"q\", the corresponding continuous linear functional \"formula_17\" on \"\u2113\"\u2009\"p\" is defined by\nformula_298\nfor all b = (\"bn\") \u2208 \"\u2113\"\u2009\"p\" (see H\u00f6lder's inequality).\nIn a similar manner, the continuous dual of \"\u2113\"\u20091 is naturally identified with \"\u2113\"\u2009\u221e (the space of bounded sequences).\nFurthermore, the continuous duals of the Banach spaces \"c\" (consisting of all convergent sequences, with the supremum norm) and \"c\"0 (the sequences converging to zero) are both naturally identified with \"\u2113\"\u20091.\nBy the Riesz representation theorem, the continuous dual of a Hilbert space is again a Hilbert space which is anti-isomorphic to the original space.\nThis gives rise to the bra\u2013ket notation used by physicists in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.\nBy the Riesz\u2013Markov\u2013Kakutani representation theorem, the continuous dual of certain spaces of continuous functions can be described using measures.\nTranspose of a continuous linear map.\nIf \"T\" : \"V \u2192 W\" is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces, then the (continuous) transpose \"T\u2032\" : \"W\u2032 \u2192 V\u2032\" is defined by the same formula as before:\nformula_299\nThe resulting functional \"T\u2032\"(\"\u03c6\") is in \"V\u2032\". The assignment \"T \u2192 T\u2032\" produces a linear map between the space of continuous linear maps from \"V\" to \"W\" and the space of linear maps from \"W\u2032\" to \"V\u2032\".\nWhen \"T\" and \"U\" are composable continuous linear maps, then\nformula_300\nWhen \"V\" and \"W\" are normed spaces, the norm of the transpose in\"L\"(\"W\u2032\", \"V\u2032\") is equal to that of \"T\" in \"L\"(\"V\", \"W\").\nSeveral properties of transposition depend upon the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\nFor example, the bounded linear map \"T\" has dense range if and only if the transpose \"T\u2032\" is injective.\nWhen \"T\" is a compact linear map between two Banach spaces \"V\" and \"W\", then the transpose \"T\u2032\" is compact.\nThis can be proved using the Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem.\nWhen \"V\" is a Hilbert space, there is an antilinear isomorphism \"iV\" from \"V\" onto its continuous dual \"V\u2032\".\nFor every bounded linear map \"T\" on \"V\", the transpose and the adjoint operators are linked by\nformula_301\nWhen \"T\" is a continuous linear map between two topological vector spaces \"V\" and \"W\", then the transpose \"T\u2032\" is continuous when \"W\u2032\" and \"V\u2032\" are equipped with \"compatible\" topologies: for example, when for \"X\" = \"V\" and \"X\" = \"W\", both duals \"X\u2032\" have the strong topology \"\u03b2\"(\"X\u2032\", \"X\") of uniform convergence on bounded sets of \"X\", or both have the weak-\u2217 topology \"\u03c3\"(\"X\u2032\", \"X\") of pointwise convergence on\u00a0\"X\".\nThe transpose \"T\u2032\" is continuous from \"\u03b2\"(\"W\u2032\", \"W\") to \"\u03b2\"(\"V\u2032\", \"V\"), or from \"\u03c3\"(\"W\u2032\", \"W\") to \"\u03c3\"(\"V\u2032\", \"V\").\nAnnihilators.\nAssume that \"W\" is a closed linear subspace of a normed space\u00a0\"V\", and consider the annihilator of \"W\" in \"V\u2032\",\nformula_302\nThen, the dual of the quotient \"V\"\u2009/\u2009\"W\"\u2009 can be identified with \"W\"\u22a5, and the dual of \"W\" can be identified with the quotient \"V\u2032\"\u2009/\u2009\"W\"\u22a5.\nIndeed, let \"P\" denote the canonical surjection from \"V\" onto the quotient \"V\"\u2009/\u2009\"W\"\u2009; then, the transpose \"P\u2032\" is an isometric isomorphism from (\"V\"\u2009/\u2009\"W\"\u2009)\u2032 into \"V\u2032\", with range equal to \"W\"\u22a5.\nIf \"j\" denotes the injection map from \"W\" into \"V\", then the kernel of the transpose \"j\u2032\" is the annihilator of \"W\":\nformula_303\nand it follows from the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem that \"j\u2032\" induces an isometric isomorphism\n\"V\u2032\"\u2009/\u2009\"W\"\u22a5 \u2192 \"W\u2032\".\nFurther properties.\nIf the dual of a normed space V is separable, then so is the space V itself.\nThe converse is not true: for example, the space \"\u2113\"\u20091 is separable, but its dual \"\u2113\"\u2009\u221e is not.\nDouble dual.\nIn analogy with the case of the algebraic double dual, there is always a naturally defined continuous linear operator \u03a8 : \"V\" \u2192 \"V\u2032\u2032\" from a normed space \"V\" into its continuous double dual \"V\u2032\u2032\", defined by\nformula_304\nAs a consequence of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem, this map is in fact an isometry, meaning \u2016 \u03a8(\"x\") \u2016 = \u2016 \"x\" \u2016 for all \"x\" \u2208 \"V\".\nNormed spaces for which the map \u03a8 is a bijection are called reflexive.\nWhen \"V\" is a topological vector space then \u03a8(\"x\") can still be defined by the same formula, for every \"x\" \u2208 \"V\", however several difficulties arise.\nFirst, when \"V\" is not locally convex, the continuous dual may be equal to { 0 } and the map \u03a8 trivial.\nHowever, if \"V\" is Hausdorff and locally convex, the map \u03a8 is injective from \"V\" to the algebraic dual \"V\u2032\"\u2217 of the continuous dual, again as a consequence of the Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\nSecond, even in the locally convex setting, several natural vector space topologies can be defined on the continuous dual \"V\u2032\", so that the continuous double dual \"V\u2032\u2032\" is not uniquely defined as a set. Saying that \u03a8 maps from \"V\" to \"V\u2032\u2032\", or in other words, that \u03a8(\"x\") is continuous on \"V\u2032\" for every \"x\" \u2208 \"V\", is a reasonable minimal requirement on the topology of \"V\u2032\", namely that the evaluation mappings\n formula_305\nbe continuous for the chosen topology on \"V\u2032\". Further, there is still a choice of a topology on \"V\u2032\u2032\", and continuity of \u03a8 depends upon this choice.\nAs a consequence, defining reflexivity in this framework is more involved than in the normed case.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "7989", "revid": "194203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7989", "title": "Dianetics", "text": "Set of ideas and practices adopted by Scientologists\nDianetics is a set of pseudoscientific ideas and practices regarding the human mind invented in 1950 by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard. Dianetics was originally conceived as a form of psychological treatment, but was rejected by the psychological and medical establishments as pseudoscientific and ineffective. It was the precursor to Scientology and has since been incorporated into it. It involves a process called \"auditing\", which uses an electrical resistance meter, ostensibly to remove emotional burdens and \"cure\" people from their troubles.\n\"Auditing\" uses techniques from hypnosis that are intended to create dependency and obedience in the auditing subject. Hubbard eventually decided to present Dianetics as a form of spirituality that is part of the Church of Scientology, after several practitioners were arrested for practicing medicine without a license and a prosecution trial was pending against the first Dianetics organization that Hubbard founded in Elizabeth, New Jersey. As well as escaping prosecution, Hubbard also saw the possibility of reducing the tax burden from the sale of Dianetics books and methods.\nPremise.\nThe word \"Dianetics\" was coined from Greek \"dia\" meaning \"through\" and \"nous\" meaning \"mind\".394\nThe pseudoscientific Dianetics ideas seek to explain the metaphysical relationship between the mind and the body. The theory describes the human mind as two parts: the conscious \"analytical mind\" and the subconscious \"reactive mind\". The stated purpose of the Dianetics technique of \"auditing\" is to erase the contents of the reactive mind\u2014the holder of painful and destructive emotions that can act on a person as posthypnotic suggestions.61 \"Auditing\" uses techniques from hypnosis that are intended to create dependency and obedience in the auditing subject. In auditing, the person is asked questions intended to help them locate and deal with painful past experiences.63\nDianetics theory posits that \"the basic principle of existence is to survive\" and that the basic personality of humans is sincere, intelligent, and good. The drive for goodness and survival is distorted and inhibited by aberrations (deviations from rational thinking).25 Hubbard claimed that Dianetics could increase intelligence, eliminate unwanted emotions, and alleviate a wide range of illnesses he believed to be psychosomatic. Conditions purportedly treatable by Dianetics included arthritis, allergies, asthma, some coronary difficulties, eye trouble, ulcers, migraines, and sexual deviance.\nHistory.\nAccording to Hubbard, he had a near-death experience while sedated for a dental operation in 1938 that inspired him to write the manuscript \"Excalibur\". Though it was never published, the work allegedly became the basis for Dianetics. The first publication on Dianetics was ', an article by Hubbard in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" (cover date May 1950). This was followed by the book ' (DMSMH), published May 9, 1950. In these works Hubbard claimed that the source of all psychological pain, and therefore the cause of mental and physical health problems, was a form of memory known as \"engrams\". According to Hubbard, people could reach a state he named \"Clear\" when all their engrams had been removed by talking with an \"auditor\".\nWhile the technique was not accepted by the medical and scientific establishment, in the first two years of its publication DMSMH sold over 100,000 copies. Publication of DMSMH brought in a flood of revenue, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major U.S. cities.30 Two of the strongest initial supporters of Dianetics in the 1950s were John W. Campbell, editor of \"Astounding Science Fiction\", and Joseph Augustus Winter, a writer and medical physician. Campbell published some of Hubbard's short stories, and Winter hoped that his own colleagues would likewise be attracted to Hubbard's Dianetics system.\nReaders formed groups to study and practice Dianetics. According to sociologist Roy Wallis, this period was one of \"excited experimentation\" and Hubbard's work was regarded as \"an initial exploration to be developed further by others\". Per Wallis, it was Dianetics' popularity as a lay psychotherapy that contributed to the Dianetics Foundation's downfall. Most people read the book, tried it out, then put it down. The remaining practitioners had no ties to the Foundation. Factions formed and followers challenged Hubbard's movement and his authority. The craze of 1950\u201351 was dead by 1952.\nIn 1951, with debts piled up and facing bankruptcy, the Foundation was bailed out by Don Purcell, a wealthy Dianetics follower from Wichita. But the relief was short-lived, and the Foundation fell to bankruptcy in 1952. Hubbard fled to Phoenix, Arizona, having lost the Foundation, the rights to Dianetics, and the DMSMH copyrights to Purcell. Hubbard sued and in 1954 Purcell settled by giving the copyrights back to Hubbard.\nIn Phoenix, Hubbard created \"Scientology\"; its techniques were intended to rehabilitate people so that they might reach their full potential as spiritual beings. Dianetics was incorporated into Scientology. In 1978, Hubbard introduced \"New Era Dianetics\" (NED) and New Era Dianetics for OTs, and added them to The Bridge to Total Freedom.\nConcepts.\nIn the book \"\", Hubbard describes techniques that he suggests can rid people of fears and psychosomatic illnesses. A basic idea in Dianetics is that the mind consists of two parts: the \"analytical mind\" and the \"reactive mind\". The \"reactive mind\", which operates when a person is physically unconscious, acts as a record of shock, trauma, pain, and otherwise harmful memories. Experiences such as these are dubbed \"engrams\". Dianetics is proposed as a method to erase engrams in the reactive mind to achieve a state of clear.\nIn Dianetics, the unconscious or reactive mind is described as a collection of \"mental image pictures\", which contain the recorded experience of past moments of unconsciousness, including all sensory perceptions and feelings involved, ranging from prenatal experiences, infancy and childhood, to even the traumatic feelings associated with events from past lives and extraterrestrial cultures. The type of mental image picture created during a period of unconsciousness involves the exact recording of a painful experience. Hubbard called this phenomenon an engram, and defined it as \"a moment of 'unconsciousness' containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions and is not available to the analytical mind as experience\".39\nHubbard proposed that these engrams caused \"aberrations\" (deviations from rational thinking) in the mind, which produced lasting adverse physical and emotional effects. When the analytical (conscious) mind shut down during these moments, events and perceptions of this period were stored as engrams in the unconscious or reactive mind. In Hubbard's earliest publications on the subject, engrams were variously referred to as \"norn\", \"impediment\", and \"comanome\" before \"engram\" was adapted from its existing usage at the suggestion of Joseph Augustus Winter.109 Some commentators noted Dianetics's blend of science fiction and occult orientations at the time.\nHubbard claimed that engrams were the cause of almost all psychological and physical problems. In addition to physical pain, engrams could include words or phrases spoken in the vicinity while the patient was unconscious. For instance, Winter cites the example of a patient with a persistent headache supposedly tracing the problem to a doctor saying, \"Take him now\", during the patient's birth.165 \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[The reactive mind] can give a man arthritis, bursitis, asthma, allergies, sinusitis, coronary trouble, high blood pressure\u00a0...

Discharge the content of [the reactive mind] and the arthritis vanishes, myopia gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole catalog of ills goes away and stays away. \u2014\u200a\nAccording to Bent Corydon, Hubbard created the illusion that Dianetics was the first psychotherapy to address traumatic experiences in their own time, but others had done so before as standard procedure. Hugh Urban wrote it was clear that Hubbard's work had been influenced by Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud and Otto Rank, and Hubbard himself mentioned similarities between Dianetics and Freud.\nHubbard claimed that by using Dianetics technique the reactive mind could be emptied of all engrams; \"cleared\" of its contents. A person who has completed this process would be \"Clear\". The benefits of Clear might include a higher IQ, better relationships, or career success.46\nProcedure.\nThe procedure of Dianetics therapy (known as \"auditing\") is a two-person activity. One person, the \"auditor\", guides the other person, the \"preclear\", through the procedures. The preclear's job is to look at their mind and talk to the auditor. The auditor acknowledges what the preclear says and controls the process.\nThe auditor and preclear sit down facing each other. After getting settled, the auditor tells the preclear to close their eyes and locate something that happened to them in the past. The preclear tells the auditor what happened in the incident like he is re-experiencing it again. The auditor coaxes the preclear to recall as much as possible, and goes back over the incident several times until the preclear is cheerful about it, at which point the auditor may end the session or find another incident and repeat the process.\nTherapeutic claims.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The slick craftsman of mass-production science-fiction, mustering his talents and energies for a supreme effort, produces [...] a fictional science. Had dianetics been presented as fiction [...] it might have been, like other ingenious science-fiction, good entertainment.\u2014\u200a\nIn August 1950, amid the success of \"\", Hubbard held a demonstration at Los Angeles's Shrine Auditorium where he presented a young woman called Sonya Bianca (a pseudonym) to a large audience, including many reporters and photographers, as \"the world's first Clear\". Despite Hubbard's claim that she had \"full and perfect recall of every moment of her life\", Bianca proved unable to answer questions from the audience testing her memory and analytical abilities, including the question of the color of Hubbard's tie. Hubbard explained Bianca's failure to display her promised powers of recall to the audience by saying that he had used the word \"now\" in calling her to the stage, and thus inadvertently frozen her in \"present time\", which blocked her abilities. In the late 1950s, Hubbard claimed that several people had reached the state of Clear by the time he presented Bianca as the world's first; these others, Hubbard said, he had successfully cleared in the late 1940s while working \"incognito\" in Hollywood posing as a swami. In 1966, Hubbard declared South African Scientologist John McMaster to be the first true Clear.\nHubbard claimed, in an interview with \"The New York Times\" in November 1950, that \"he had already submitted proof of claims made in the book to a number of scientists and associations.\" He added that the public as well as proper organizations were entitled to such proof and that he was ready and willing to give such proof in detail. In January 1951, the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation of Elizabeth, New Jersey, published \"Dianetic Processing: A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results\", a booklet providing the results of psychometric tests conducted on 88 people undergoing Dianetics therapy. It presents case histories and a number of X-ray plates to support claims that Dianetics had cured \"aberrations\" including manic depression, asthma, arthritis, colitis and \"overt homosexuality\", and that after Dianetic processing, test subjects experienced significantly increased scores on a standardized IQ test. The report's subjects are not identified by name, but one of them is clearly Hubbard himself (\"Case 1080A, R. L.\").\nThe authors provide no qualifications, although they are described in Hubbard's book \"Science of Survival\" (where some results of the same study were reprinted) as psychotherapists. Critics of Dianetics are skeptical of this study, both because of the bias of the source and because the researchers appear to ascribe all physical benefits to Dianetics without considering possible outside factors; in other words, the report lacks any scientific controls. Winter was originally an associate of Hubbard and an early adopter of Dianetics, but by the end of 1950 had cut ties with Hubbard and written an account of his personal experiences with Dianetics.39 He called Hubbard \"absolutistic and authoritarian\", and criticized the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for failing to undertake \"precise scientific research into the functioning of the mind\".40 He also recommended that auditing be done by experts only and that it was dangerous for laymen to audit each other. Hubbard writes: \"Again, Dianetics is not being released to a profession, for no profession could encompass it.\"168\nScientific rejection.\nHubbard's original book on Dianetics attracted highly critical reviews from science and medical writers and organizations. The American Psychological Association passed a resolution in 1950 calling \"attention to the fact that these claims are not supported by empirical evidence of the sort required for the establishment of scientific generalizations.\" Dianetics has achieved no acceptance as a scientific theory, and scientists cite it as an example of a pseudoscience.274\nFew scientific investigations into the effectiveness of Dianetics have been published. Professor John A. Lee states in his 1970 evaluation of Dianetics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Objective experimental verification of Hubbard's physiological and psychological doctrines is lacking. To date, no regular scientific agency has established the validity of his theories of prenatal perception and engrams, or cellular memory, or Dianetic reverie, or the effects of Scientology auditing routines. Existing knowledge contradicts Hubbard's theory of recording of perceptions during periods of unconsciousness. \u2014\u200a\nThe MEDLINE database records two independent scientific studies on Dianetics, both conducted in the 1950s under the auspices of New York University. Harvey Jay Fischer tested Dianetic therapy against three claims made by proponents and found it does not affect any significant changes in intellectual functioning, mathematical ability, or the degree of personality conflicts; Jack Fox tested Hubbard's thesis regarding recall of engrams, with the assistance of the Dianetic Research Foundation, and could not substantiate it.\nCommentators from a variety of backgrounds have described Dianetics as an example of pseudoscience. For example, philosophy professor Robert Carroll points to Dianetics' lack of empirical evidence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such \"data\" would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations\u00a0... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science.\nThe validity and practice of auditing have been questioned by a variety of non-Scientologist commentators. Commenting on the example cited by Winter, the science writer Martin Gardner asserts that \"nothing could be clearer from the above dialogue than the fact that the dianetic explanation for the headache existed only in the mind of the therapist, and that it was with considerable difficulty that the patient was maneuvered into accepting it.\"278\nOther critics and medical experts have suggested that Dianetic auditing is a form of hypnosis. Hubbard, who had previously used hypnosis for entertainment purposes, strongly denied this connection and cautioned against hypnosis in Dianetics auditing. Professor Richard J. Ofshe, a leading expert on false memories, suggests that the feeling of well-being reported by preclear at the end of an auditing session may be induced by post-hypnotic suggestion. Other researchers have identified quotations in Hubbard's work suggesting evidence that false memories were created in \"Dianetics\", specifically in the form of birth and pre-birth memories.\nAccording to an article by physician Martin Gumpert, \"Hubbard's concept of psychosomatic disease is definitely wrong. Psychosomatic ailments are not simply caused by emotional disturbances: they are diseases in which the emotional and the organic factor are closely involved and interdependent.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But even the limited good that dianetics may do by introducing a single, narrowly-defined role-playing technique into interpersonal relations is probably more than offset by the damage it can do with its accompanying pretentious and nonsensical doctrines. [...T]hose who are helped by dianetics will necessarily be kept at a low level of intellectual and emotional maturity by the nonsense they have absorbed in order to be helped. The lure of the pseudoscientific vocabulary and promises of dianetics cannot but condemn thousands who are beginning to emerge from scientific illiteracy to a continuation of their susceptibility to word-magic and semantic hash.\u2014\u200a\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Data warehouses are central repositories of data integrated from disparate sources. They store current and historical data organized in a way that is optimized for data analysis, generation of reports, and developing insights across the integrated data. They are intended to be used by analysts and managers to help make organizational decisions.\nThe data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from operational systems (such as marketing or sales). The data may pass through an operational data store and may require data cleansing for additional operations to ensure data quality before it is used in the data warehouse for reporting.\nThe two main workflows for building a data warehouse system are extract, transform, load (ETL) and extract, load, transform (ELT).\nComponents.\nThe environment for data warehouses and marts includes the following:\nRelated systems.\nOperational databases.\nOperational databases are optimized for the preservation of data integrity and speed of recording of business transactions through use of database normalization and an entity\u2013relationship model. Operational system designers generally follow Codd's 12 rules of database normalization to ensure data integrity. Fully normalized database designs (that is, those satisfying all Codd rules) often result in information from a business transaction being stored in dozens to hundreds of tables. Relational databases are efficient at managing the relationships between these tables. The databases have very fast insert/update performance because only a small amount of data in those tables is affected by each transaction. To improve performance, older data are periodically purged.\nData warehouses are optimized for analytic access patterns, which usually involve selecting specific fields rather than all fields as is common in operational databases. Because of these differences in access, operational databases (loosely, OLTP) benefit from the use of a row-oriented database management system (DBMS), whereas analytics databases (loosely, OLAP) benefit from the use of a column-oriented DBMS. Operational systems maintain a snapshot of the business, while warehouses maintain historic data through ETL processes that periodically migrate data from the operational systems to the warehouse.\nOnline analytical processing (OLAP) is characterized by a low rate of transactions and complex queries that involve aggregations. Response time is an effective performance measure of OLAP systems. OLAP applications are widely used for data mining. OLAP databases store aggregated, historical data in multi-dimensional schemas (usually star schemas). OLAP systems typically have a data latency of a few hours, while data mart latency is closer to one day. The OLAP approach is used to analyze multidimensional data from multiple sources and perspectives. The three basic operations in OLAP are roll-up (consolidation), drill-down, and slicing &amp; dicing.\nOnline transaction processing (OLTP) is characterized by a large numbers of short online transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). OLTP systems emphasize fast query processing and maintaining data integrity in multi-access environments. For OLTP systems, performance is the number of transactions per second. OLTP databases contain detailed and current data. The schema used to store transactional databases is the entity model (usually 3NF). Normalization is the norm for data modeling techniques in this system.\nPredictive analytics is about finding and quantifying hidden patterns in the data using complex mathematical models to prepare for different future outcomes, including demand for products, and make better decisions. By contrast, OLAP focuses on historical data analysis and is reactive. Predictive systems are also used for customer relationship management (CRM).\nData marts.\nA data mart is a simple data warehouse focused on a single subject or functional area. Hence it draws data from a limited number of sources such as sales, finance or marketing. Data marts are often built and controlled by a single department in an organization. The sources could be internal operational systems, a central data warehouse, or external data. \nTypes of data marts include dependent, independent, and hybrid data marts.\nVariants.\nETL.\nThe typical extract, transform, load (ETL)-based data warehouse uses staging, data integration, and access layers to house its key functions. The staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systems. The integration layer integrates disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer, often storing this transformed data in an operational data store (ODS) database. The integrated data are then moved to yet another database, often called the data warehouse database, where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups, often called dimensions, and into facts and aggregate facts. The combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema. The access layer helps users retrieve data.\nThe main source of the data is cleansed, transformed, catalogued, and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining, online analytical processing, market research and decision support. However, the means to retrieve and analyze data, to extract, transform, and load data, and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing system. Many references to data warehousing use this broader context. Thus, an expanded definition of data warehousing includes business intelligence tools, tools to extract, transform, and load data into the repository, and tools to manage and retrieve metadata.\nELT.\nELT-based data warehousing gets rid of a separate ETL tool for data transformation. Instead, it maintains a staging area inside the data warehouse itself. In this approach, data gets extracted from heterogeneous source systems and are then directly loaded into the data warehouse, before any transformation occurs. All necessary transformations are then handled inside the data warehouse itself. Finally, the manipulated data gets loaded into target tables in the same data warehouse.\nBenefits.\nA data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:\nHistory.\nThe concept of data warehousing dates back to the late 1980s when IBM researchers Barry Devlin and Paul Murphy developed the \"business data warehouse\". In essence, the data warehousing concept was intended to provide an architectural model for the flow of data from operational systems to decision support environments. The concept attempted to address the various problems associated with this flow, mainly the high costs associated with it. In the absence of a data warehousing architecture, an enormous amount of redundancy was required to support multiple decision support environments. In larger corporations, it was typical for multiple decision support environments to operate independently. Though each environment served different users, they often required much of the same stored data. The process of gathering, cleaning and integrating data from various sources, usually from long-term existing operational systems (usually referred to as legacy systems), was typically in part replicated for each environment. Moreover, the operational systems were frequently reexamined as new decision support requirements emerged. Often new requirements necessitated gathering, cleaning and integrating new data from \"data marts\" that was tailored for ready access by users.\nAdditionally, with the publication of The IRM Imperative (Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991) by James M. Kerr, the idea of managing and putting a dollar value on an organization's data resources and then reporting that value as an asset on a balance sheet became popular. In the book, Kerr described a way to populate subject-area databases from data derived from transaction-driven systems to create a storage area where summary data could be further leveraged to inform executive decision-making. This concept served to promote further thinking of how a data warehouse could be developed and managed in a practical way within any enterprise.\nKey developments in early years of data warehousing:\nData organization.\nFacts.\nA fact is a value or measurement in the system being managed.\nRaw facts are ones reported by the reporting entity. For example, in a mobile telephone system, if a base transceiver station (BTS) receives 1,000 requests for traffic channel allocation, allocates for 820, and rejects the rest, it could report three facts to a management system:\nRaw facts are aggregated to higher levels in various dimensions to extract information more relevant to the service or business. These are called aggregated facts or summaries.\nFor example, if there are three BTSs in a city, then the facts above can be aggregated to the city level in the network dimension. For example:\nDimensional versus normalized approach for storage of data.\nThe two most important approaches to store data in a warehouse are dimensional and normalized. The dimensional approach uses a star schema as proposed by Ralph Kimball. The normalized approach, also called the third normal form (3NF) is an entity-relational normalized model proposed by Bill Inmon.\nDimensional approach.\nIn a dimensional approach, transaction data is partitioned into \"facts\", which are usually numeric transaction data, and \"dimensions\", which are the reference information that gives context to the facts. For example, a sales transaction can be broken up into facts such as the number of products ordered and the total price paid for the products, and into dimensions such as order date, customer name, product number, order ship-to and bill-to locations, and salesperson responsible for receiving the order.\nThis dimensional approach makes data easier to understand and speeds up data retrieval. Dimensional structures are easy for business users to understand because the structure is divided into measurements/facts and context/dimensions. Facts are related to the organization's business processes and operational system, and dimensions are the context about them (Kimball, Ralph 2008). Another advantage is that the dimensional model does not involve a relational database every time. Thus, this type of modeling technique is very useful for end-user queries in data warehouse.\nThe model of facts and dimensions can also be understood as a data cube, where dimensions are the categorical coordinates in a multi-dimensional cube, the fact is a value corresponding to the coordinates.\nThe main disadvantages of the dimensional approach are:\nNormalized approach.\nIn the normalized approach, the data in the warehouse are stored following, to a degree, database normalization rules. Normalized relational database tables are grouped into \"subject areas\" (for example, customers, products and finance). When used in large enterprises, the result is dozens of tables linked by a web of joins.(Kimball, Ralph 2008).\nThe main advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to add information into the database. Disadvantages include that, because of the large number of tables, it can be difficult for users to join data from different sources into meaningful information and access the information without a precise understanding of the date sources and the data structure of the data warehouse.\nBoth normalized and dimensional models can be represented in entity\u2013relationship diagrams because both contain joined relational tables. The difference between them is the degree of normalization. These approaches are not mutually exclusive, and there are other approaches. Dimensional approaches can involve normalizing data to a degree (Kimball, Ralph 2008).\nIn \"Information-Driven Business\", Robert Hillard compares the two approaches based on the information needs of the business problem. He concludes that normalized models hold far more information than their dimensional equivalents (even when the same fields are used in both models) but at the cost of usability. The technique measures information quantity in terms of information entropy and usability in terms of the Small Worlds data transformation measure.\nDesign methods.\nBottom-up design.\nIn the \"bottom-up\" approach, data marts are first created to provide reporting and analytical capabilities for specific business processes. These data marts can then be integrated to create a comprehensive data warehouse. The data warehouse bus architecture is primarily an implementation of \"the bus\", a collection of conformed dimensions and conformed facts, which are dimensions that are shared (in a specific way) between facts in two or more data marts.\nTop-down design.\nThe \"top-down\" approach is designed using a normalized enterprise data model. \"Atomic\" data, that is, data at the greatest level of detail, are stored in the data warehouse. Dimensional data marts containing data needed for specific business processes or specific departments are created from the data warehouse.\nHybrid design.\nData warehouses often resemble the hub and spokes architecture. Legacy systems feeding the warehouse often include customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning, generating large amounts of data. To consolidate these various data models, and facilitate the extract transform load process, data warehouses often make use of an operational data store, the information from which is parsed into the actual data warehouse. To reduce data redundancy, larger systems often store the data in a normalized way. Data marts for specific reports can then be built on top of the data warehouse.\nA hybrid (also called ensemble) data warehouse database is kept on third normal form to eliminate data redundancy. A normal relational database, however, is not efficient for business intelligence reports where dimensional modelling is prevalent. Small data marts can shop for data from the consolidated warehouse and use the filtered, specific data for the fact tables and dimensions required. The data warehouse provides a single source of information from which the data marts can read, providing a wide range of business information. The hybrid architecture allows a data warehouse to be replaced with a master data management repository where operational (not static) information could reside.\nThe data vault modeling components follow hub and spokes architecture. This modeling style is a hybrid design, consisting of the best practices from both third normal form and star schema. The data vault model is not a true third normal form, and breaks some of its rules, but it is a top-down architecture with a bottom up design. The data vault model is geared to be strictly a data warehouse. It is not geared to be end-user accessible, which, when built, still requires the use of a data mart or star schema-based release area for business purposes.\nCharacteristics.\nThere are basic features that define the data in the data warehouse that include subject orientation, data integration, time-variant, nonvolatile data, and data granularity.\nSubject-oriented.\nUnlike the operational systems, the data in the data warehouse revolves around the subjects of the enterprise. Subject orientation is not database normalization. Subject orientation can be really useful for decision-making.\nGathering the required objects is called subject-oriented.\nIntegrated.\nThe data found within the data warehouse is integrated. Since it comes from several operational systems, all inconsistencies must be removed. Consistencies include naming conventions, measurement of variables, encoding structures, physical attributes of data, and so forth.\nTime-variant.\nWhile operational systems reflect current values as they support day-to-day operations, data warehouse data represents a long time horizon (up to 10 years) which means it stores mostly historical data. It is mainly meant for data mining and forecasting. (E.g. if a user is searching for a buying pattern of a specific customer, the user needs to look at data on the current and past purchases.)\nNonvolatile.\nThe data in the data warehouse is read-only, which means it cannot be updated, created, or deleted (unless there is a regulatory or statutory obligation to do so).\nOptions.\nAggregation.\nIn the data warehouse process, data can be aggregated in data marts at different levels of abstraction. The user may start looking at the total sale units of a product in an entire region. Then the user looks at the states in that region. Finally, they may examine the individual stores in a certain state. Therefore, typically, the analysis starts at a higher level and drills down to lower levels of details.\nVirtualization.\nWith data virtualization, the data used remains in its original locations and real-time access is established to allow analytics across multiple sources creating a virtual data warehouse. This can aid in resolving some technical difficulties such as compatibility problems when combining data from various platforms, lowering the risk of error caused by faulty data, and guaranteeing that the newest data is used. Furthermore, avoiding the creation of a new database containing personal information can make it easier to comply with privacy regulations. However, with data virtualization, the connection to all necessary data sources must be operational as there is no local copy of the data, which is one of the main drawbacks of the approach.\nArchitecture.\nThe different methods used to construct/organize a data warehouse specified by an organization are numerous. The hardware utilized, software created and data resources specifically required for the correct functionality of a data warehouse are the main components of the data warehouse architecture. All data warehouses have multiple phases in which the requirements of the organization are modified and fine-tuned.\nEvolution in organization use.\nThese terms refer to the level of sophistication of a data warehouse:\nIn healthcare.\nIn the healthcare sector, data warehouses are critical components of health informatics, enabling the integration, storage, and analysis of large volumes of clinical, administrative, and operational data. These systems consolidate information from disparate sources such as electronic health records (EHRs), laboratory information systems, picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and medical billing platforms. By centralizing data, healthcare data warehouses support a range of functions including population health, clinical decision support, quality improvement, public health surveillance, and medical research.\nHealthcare data warehouses often incorporate specialized data models that account for the complexity and sensitivity of medical data, such as temporal information (e.g., longitudinal patient histories), coded terminologies (e.g., ICD-10, SNOMED CT), and compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA in the United States or GDPR in the European Union).\nFollowing is a list of major patient data warehouses with broad scope (not disease- or specialty-specific), with variables including laboratory results, pharmacy, age, race, socioeconomic status, comorbidities and longitudinal changes:\nThese warehouses enable data-driven healthcare by supporting retrospective studies, comparative effectiveness research, and predictive analytics, often with the use of healthcare-applied artificial intelligence.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "7992", "revid": "1778754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7992", "title": "Devonian", "text": "Fourth period of the Paleozoic Era\nThe Devonian ( ) is a geologic period and system of the Paleozoic era during the Phanerozoic eon, spanning 60.3\u00a0million years from the end of the preceding Silurian period at million years ago (Ma), to the beginning of the succeeding Carboniferous period at Ma. It is the fourth period of both the Paleozoic and the Phanerozoic. It is named after Devon, South West England, where rocks from this period were first studied.\nThe first significant evolutionary radiation of life on land occurred during the Devonian, as free-sporing land plants (pteridophytes) began to spread across dry land, forming extensive coal forests which covered the continents. By the middle of the Devonian, several groups of vascular plants had evolved leaves and true roots, and by the end of the period the first seed-bearing plants (pteridospermatophytes) appeared. This rapid evolution and colonization process, which had begun during the Silurian, is known as the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution. The earliest land animals, predominantly arthropods such as myriapods, arachnids and hexapods, also became well-established early in this period, after beginning their colonization of land at least from the Ordovician Period.\nFishes, especially jawed fish, reached substantial diversity during this time, leading the Devonian to be called the Age of Fishes. The armored placoderms began dominating almost every known aquatic environment. In the oceans, cartilaginous fishes such as primitive sharks became more numerous than in the Silurian and Late Ordovician. Tetrapodomorphs, which include the ancestors of all four-limbed vertebrates (i.e. tetrapods), began diverging from freshwater lobe-finned fish as their more robust and muscled pectoral and pelvic fins gradually evolved into forelimbs and hindlimbs, though they were not fully established for life on land until the Late Carboniferous.\nThe first ammonites, a subclass of cephalopod molluscs, appeared. Trilobites, brachiopods and the great coral reefs were still common during the Devonian. The Late Devonian extinction, which started about 375\u00a0Ma, severely affected marine life, killing off most of the reef systems, most of the jawless fish, the placoderms, and nearly all trilobites save for a few species of the order Proetida. The subsequent end-Devonian extinction, which occurred at around 359\u00a0Ma, further impacted the ecosystems and completed the extinction of all calcite sponge reefs and placoderms.\nDevonian palaeogeography was dominated by the supercontinent Gondwana to the south, the small continent of Siberia to the north, and the medium-sized continent of Laurussia to the east. Major tectonic events include the closure of the Rheic Ocean, the separation of South China from Gondwana, and the resulting expansion of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean. The Devonian experienced several major mountain-building events as Laurussia and Gondwana approached; these include the Acadian Orogeny in North America and the beginning of the Variscan Orogeny in Europe. These early collisions preceded the formation of the single supercontinent Pangaea in the Late Paleozoic.\nHistory.\nThe period is named after Devon, a county in southwestern England, where a controversial argument in the 1830s over the age and structure of the rocks found throughout the county was resolved by adding the Devonian Period to the geological timescale. The Great Devonian Controversy was a lengthy debate between Roderick Murchison, Adam Sedgwick and Henry De la Beche over the naming of the period. Murchison and Sedgwick won the debate and named it the Devonian System.\nWhile the rock beds that define the start and end of the Devonian Period are well identified, the exact dates are uncertain. According to the International Commission on Stratigraphy, the Devonian extends from the end of the Silurian Ma, to the beginning of the Carboniferous Ma \u2013 in North America, at the beginning of the Mississippian subperiod of the Carboniferous.\nIn 19th-century texts, the Devonian has been called the \"Old Red Age\", after the red and brown terrestrial deposits known in the United Kingdom as the Old Red Sandstone in which early fossil discoveries were found. Another common term is \"Age of the Fishes\", referring to the evolution of several major groups of fish that took place during the period. Older literature on the Anglo-Welsh basin divides it into the Downtonian, Dittonian, Breconian, and Farlovian stages, the latter three of which are placed in the Devonian.\nThe Devonian has also erroneously been characterised as a \"greenhouse age\", due to sampling bias: most of the early Devonian-age discoveries came from the strata of Western Europe and eastern North America, which at the time straddled the Equator as part of the supercontinent of Euramerica where fossil signatures of widespread reefs indicate tropical climates that were warm and moderately humid. In fact, the climate in the Devonian differed greatly during its epochs and between geographic regions. For example, during the Early Devonian, arid conditions were prevalent through much of the world including Siberia, Australia, North America, and China, but Africa and South America had a warm temperate climate. In the Late Devonian, by contrast, arid conditions were less prevalent across the world and temperate climates were more common.\nSubdivisions.\nThe Devonian Period is formally broken into Early, Middle and Late subdivisions. The rocks corresponding to those epochs are referred to as belonging to the Lower, Middle and Upper parts of the Devonian System.\nEarly Devonian.\nThe Early Devonian lasted from to Ma. It began with the Lochkovian Stage from to Ma, which was followed by the Pragian from to Ma and then by the Emsian, which lasted until the Middle Devonian began at Ma.\nDuring this time, the first ammonoids appeared, descending from bactritoid nautiloids. Ammonoids during this time period were simple and differed little from their nautiloid counterparts. These ammonoids belong to the order Agoniatitida, which in later epochs evolved to new ammonoid orders, for example Goniatitida and Clymeniida. This class of cephalopod molluscs would dominate the marine fauna until the beginning of the Mesozoic Era.\nMiddle Devonian.\nThe Middle Devonian comprised two subdivisions: first the Eifelian, which then gave way to the Givetian at Ma. During this time, the jawless agnathan fishes began to decline in diversity in freshwater and marine environments partly due to drastic environmental changes and partly due to the increasing competition, predation, and diversity of jawed fishes. The shallow, warm, oxygen-depleted waters of Devonian inland lakes, surrounded by primitive plants, provided the environment necessary for certain early fish to develop such essential characteristics as well developed lungs and the ability to crawl out of the water and onto the land for short periods of time.\nLate Devonian.\nFinally, the Late Devonian started with the Frasnian, from to Ma, during which the first forests took shape on land. The first tetrapods appeared in the fossil record in the ensuing Famennian subdivision, the beginning and end of which are marked with extinction events. This lasted until the end of the Devonian at Ma.\nClimate.\nThe Devonian was a relatively warm period, although significant glaciers may have existed during the Early and Middle Devonian. The temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was not as large as it is today. The weather was also very arid, mostly along the equator where it was the driest. Reconstruction of tropical sea surface temperature from conodont apatite implies an average value of in the Early Devonian. Early Devonian mean annual surface temperatures were approximately 16 \u00b0C. CO2 levels dropped steeply throughout the Devonian Period. The newly evolved forests drew carbon out of the atmosphere, which were then buried into sediments. This may be reflected by a Mid-Devonian cooling of around . The Late Devonian warmed to levels equivalent to the Early Devonian; while there is no corresponding increase in CO2 concentrations, continental weathering increases (as predicted by warmer temperatures); further, a range of evidence, such as plant distribution, points to a Late Devonian warming. The climate would have affected the dominant organisms in reefs; microbes would have been the main reef-forming organisms in warm periods, with corals and stromatoporoid sponges taking the dominant role in cooler times. The warming at the end of the Devonian may even have contributed to the extinction of the stromatoporoids. At the terminus of the Devonian, Earth rapidly cooled into an icehouse, marking the beginning of the Late Paleozoic icehouse.\nPaleogeography.\nThe Devonian world involved many continents and ocean basins of various sizes. The largest continent, Gondwana, was located entirely within the Southern Hemisphere. It corresponds to modern day South America, Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and India, as well as minor components of North America and Asia. The second-largest continent, Laurussia, was northwest of Gondwana, and corresponds to much of modern-day North America and Europe. Various smaller continents, microcontinents, and terranes were present east of Laurussia and north of Gondwana, corresponding to parts of Europe and Asia. The Devonian Period was a time of great tectonic activity, as the major continents of Laurussia and Gondwana drew closer together.\nSea levels were high worldwide, and much of the land lay under shallow seas, where tropical reef organisms lived. The enormous \"world ocean\", Panthalassa, occupied much of the Northern Hemisphere as well as wide swathes east of Gondwana and west of Laurussia. Other minor oceans were the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and Rheic Ocean.\nLaurussia.\nBy the early Devonian, the continent Laurussia (also known as Euramerica) was fully formed through the collision of the continents Laurentia (modern day North America) and Baltica (modern day northern and eastern Europe). The tectonic effects of this collision continued into the Devonian, producing a string of mountain ranges along the southeastern coast of the continent. In present-day eastern North America, the Acadian Orogeny continued to raise the Appalachian Mountains. Further east, the collision also extended the rise of the Caledonian Mountains of Great Britain and Scandinavia. As the Caledonian Orogeny wound down in the later part of the period, orogenic collapse facilitated a cluster of granite intrusions in Scotland.\nMost of Laurussia was located south of the equator, but in the Devonian it moved northwards and began to rotate counterclockwise towards its modern position. While the most northern parts of the continent (such as Greenland and Ellesmere Island) established tropical conditions, most of the continent was located within the natural dry zone along the Tropic of Capricorn, which (as nowadays) is a result of the convergence of two great air-masses, the Hadley cell and the Ferrel cell. In these near-deserts, the Old Red Sandstone sedimentary beds formed, made red by the oxidised iron (hematite) characteristic of drought conditions. The abundance of red sandstone on continental land also lends Laurussia the name \"the Old Red Continent\". For much of the Devonian, the majority of western Laurussia (North America) was covered by subtropical inland seas which hosted a diverse ecosystem of reefs and marine life. Devonian marine deposits are particularly prevalent in the midwestern and northeastern United States. Devonian reefs also extended along the southeast edge of Laurussia, a coastline now corresponding to southern England, Belgium, and other mid-latitude areas of Europe.\nIn the Early and Middle Devonian, the west coast of Laurussia was a passive margin with broad coastal waters, deep silty embayments, river deltas and estuaries, found today in Idaho and Nevada. In the Late Devonian, an approaching volcanic island arc reached the steep slope of the continental shelf and began to uplift deep water deposits. This minor collision sparked the start of a mountain-building episode called the Antler orogeny, which extended into the Carboniferous. Mountain building could also be found in the far northeastern extent of the continent, as minor tropical island arcs and detached Baltic terranes re-join the continent. Deformed remnants of these mountains can still be found on Ellesmere Island and Svalbard. Many of the Devonian collisions in Laurussia produce both mountain chains and foreland basins, which are frequently fossiliferous.\nGondwana.\nGondwana was by far the largest continent on the planet. It was completely south of the equator, although the northeastern sector (now Australia) did reach tropical latitudes. The southwestern sector (now South America) was located to the far south, with Brazil situated near the South Pole. The northwestern edge of Gondwana was an active margin for much of the Devonian, and saw the accretion of many smaller land masses and island arcs. These include Chilenia, Cuyania, and Chaitenia, which now form much of Chile and Patagonia. These collisions were associated with volcanic activity and plutons, but by the Late Devonian the tectonic situation had relaxed and much of South America was covered by shallow seas. These south polar seas hosted a distinctive brachiopod fauna, the Malvinokaffric Realm, which extended eastward to marginal areas now equivalent to South Africa and Antarctica. Malvinokaffric faunas even managed to approach the South Pole via a tongue of Panthalassa which extended into the Paran\u00e1 Basin.\nThe northern rim of Gondwana was mostly a passive margin, hosting extensive marine deposits in areas such as northwest Africa and Tibet. The eastern margin, though warmer than the west, was equally active. Numerous mountain building events and granite and kimberlite intrusions affected areas equivalent to modern day eastern Australia, Tasmania, and Antarctica.\nAsian terranes.\nSeveral island microcontinents (which would later coalesce into modern day Asia) stretched over a low-latitude archipelago to the north of Gondwana. They were separated from the southern continent by an oceanic basin: the Paleo-Tethys. Although the western Paleo-Tethys Ocean had existed since the Cambrian, the eastern part only began to rift apart as late as the Silurian. This process accelerated in the Devonian. The eastern branch of the Paleo-Tethys was fully opened when South China and Annamia (a terrane equivalent to most of Indochina), together as a unified continent, detached from the northeastern sector of Gondwana. Nevertheless, they remained close enough to Gondwana that their Devonian fossils were more closely related to Australian species than to north Asian species. Other Asian terranes remained attached to Gondwana, including Sibumasu (western Indochina), Tibet, and the rest of the Cimmerian blocks.\nWhile the South China-Annamia continent was the newest addition to the Asian microcontinents, it was not the first. North China and the Tarim Block (now northwesternmost China) were located westward and continued to drift northwards, powering over older oceanic crust in the process. Further west was a small ocean (the Turkestan Ocean), followed by the larger microcontinents of Kazakhstania, Siberia, and Amuria. Kazakhstania was a volcanically active region during the Devonian, as it continued to assimilate smaller island arcs. The island arcs of the region, such as the Balkhash-West Junggar Arc, exhibited biological endemism as a consequence of their location.\nSiberia was located just north of the equator as the largest landmass in the Northern Hemisphere. At the beginning of the Devonian, Siberia was inverted (upside down) relative to its modern orientation. Later in the period it moved northwards and began to twist clockwise, though it was not near its modern location. Siberia approached the eastern edge of Laurussia as the Devonian progressed, but it was still separated by a seaway, the Ural Ocean. Although Siberia's margins were generally tectonically stable and ecologically productive, rifting and deep mantle plumes impacted the continent with flood basalts during the Late Devonian. The Altai-Sayan region was shaken by volcanism in the Early and Middle Devonian, while Late Devonian magmatism was magnified further to produce the Vilyuy Traps, flood basalts which may have contributed to the Late Devonian Mass Extinction. The last major round of volcanism, the Yakutsk Large Igneous Province, continued into the Carboniferous to produce extensive kimberlite deposits.\nSimilar volcanic activity also affected the nearby microcontinent of Amuria (now Manchuria, Mongolia, and their vicinities). Though certainly close to Siberia in the Devonian, the precise location of Amuria is uncertain due to contradictory paleomagnetic data.\nClosure of the Rheic Ocean.\nThe Rheic Ocean, which separated Laurussia from Gondwana, was wide at the start of the Devonian, having formed after the drift of Avalonia away from Gondwana. It steadily shrunk as the period continued, as the two major continents approached near the equator in the early stages of the assembly of Pangaea. The closure of the Rheic Ocean began in the Devonian and continued into the Carboniferous. As the ocean narrowed, endemic marine faunas of Gondwana and Laurussia combined into a single tropical fauna. The history of the western Rheic Ocean is a subject of debate, but there is good evidence that Rheic oceanic crust experienced intense subduction and metamorphism under Mexico and Central America.\nThe closure of the eastern part of the Rheic Ocean is associated with the assemblage of central and southern Europe. In the early Paleozoic, much of Europe was still attached to Gondwana, including the terranes of Iberia, Armorica (France), Palaeo-Adria (the western Mediterranean area), Bohemia, Franconia, and Saxothuringia. These continental blocks, collectively known as the Armorican Terrane Assemblage, split away from Gondwana in the Silurian and drifted towards Laurussia through the Devonian. Their collision with Laurussia leads to the beginning of the Variscan Orogeny, a major mountain-building event which would escalate further in the Late Paleozoic. Franconia and Saxothuringia collided with Laurussia near the end of the Early Devonian, pinching out the easternmost Rheic Ocean. The rest of the Armorican terranes followed, and by the end of the Devonian they were fully connected with Laurussia. This sequence of rifting and collision events led to the successive creation and destruction of several small seaways, including the Rheno-Hercynian, Saxo-Thuringian, and Galicia-Moldanubian oceans. Their sediments were eventually compressed and completely buried as Gondwana fully collided with Laurussia in the Carboniferous.\nLife.\nMarine biota.\nSea levels in the Devonian were generally high. Marine faunas continued to be dominated by conodonts, bryozoans, diverse and abundant brachiopods, the enigmatic hederellids, microconchids, and corals. Lily-like crinoids (animals, their resemblance to flowers notwithstanding) were abundant, and trilobites were still fairly common. Bivalves became commonplace in deep water and outer shelf environments. The first ammonites also appeared during or slightly before the early Devonian Period around 400\u00a0Ma. Bactritoids make their first appearance in the Early Devonian as well; their radiation, along with that of ammonoids, has been attributed by some authors to increased environmental stress resulting from decreasing oxygen levels in the deeper parts of the water column. Among vertebrates, jawless armored fish (ostracoderms) declined in diversity, while the jawed fish (gnathostomes) simultaneously increased in both the sea and fresh water. Armored placoderms were numerous during the early ages of the Devonian Period and became extinct in the Late Devonian, perhaps because of competition for food against the other fish species. Early cartilaginous (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Osteichthyes) also become diverse and played a large role within the Devonian seas. The first abundant genus of cartilaginous fish, \"Cladoselache\", appeared in the oceans during the Devonian Period. The great diversity of fish around at the time has led to the Devonian being given the name \"The Age of Fishes\" in popular culture.\nThe Devonian saw significant expansion in the diversity of nektonic marine life driven by the abundance of planktonic microorganisms in the free water column as well as high ecological competition in benthic habitats, which were extremely saturated; this diversification has been labeled the \"Devonian Nekton Revolution\" by many researchers. However, other researchers have questioned whether this revolution existed at all; a 2018 study found that although the proportion of biodiversity constituted by nekton increased across the boundary between the Silurian and Devonian, it decreased across the span of the Devonian, particularly during the Pragian, and that the overall diversity of nektonic taxa did not increase significantly during the Devonian compared to during other geologic periods, and was in fact higher during the intervals spanning from the Wenlock to the Lochkovian and from the Carboniferous to the Permian. The study's authors instead attribute the increased overall diversity of nekton in the Devonian to a broader, gradual trend of nektonic diversification across the entire Palaeozoic.\nReefs.\nA now-dry barrier reef, located in present-day Kimberley Basin of northwest Australia, once extended , fringing a Devonian continent. Reefs are generally built by various carbonate-secreting organisms that can erect wave-resistant structures near sea level. Although modern reefs are constructed mainly by corals and calcareous algae, Devonian reefs were either microbial reefs built up mostly by autotrophic cyanobacteria or coral-stromatoporoid reefs built up by coral-like stromatoporoids and tabulate and rugose corals. Microbial reefs dominated under the warmer conditions of the early and late Devonian, while coral-stromatoporoid reefs dominated during the cooler middle Devonian.\nTerrestrial biota.\nBy the Devonian Period, life was well underway in its colonization of the land. The moss forests and bacterial and algal mats of the Silurian were joined early in the period by primitive rooted plants that created the first stable soils and harbored arthropods like mites, scorpions, trigonotarbids and myriapods (although arthropods appeared on land much earlier than in the Early Devonian and the existence of fossils such as \"Protichnites\" suggest that amphibious arthropods may have appeared as early as the Cambrian). By far the largest land organism at the beginning of this period was the enigmatic \"Prototaxites\", which was possibly the fruiting body of an enormous fungus, rolled liverwort mat, or another organism of uncertain affinities that stood more than tall, and towered over the low, carpet-like vegetation during the early part of the Devonian. Also, the first possible fossils of insects appeared around 416\u00a0 Ma, in the Early Devonian. Evidence for the earliest tetrapods takes the form of trace fossils in shallow lagoon environments within a marine carbonate platform/shelf during the Middle Devonian, although these traces have been questioned and an interpretation as fish feeding traces (\"Piscichnus\") has been advanced.\nThe greening of land.\nMany Early Devonian plants did not have true roots or leaves like extant plants, although vascular tissue is observed in many of those plants. Some of the early land plants such as \"Drepanophycus\" likely spread by vegetative growth and spores. The earliest land plants such as \"Cooksonia\" consisted of leafless, dichotomous axes with terminal sporangia and were generally very short-statured, and grew hardly more than a few centimetres tall. Fossils of \"Armoricaphyton chateaupannense\", about 400 million years old, represent the oldest known plants with woody tissue. By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: lycophytes, horsetails, ferns, and progymnosperms evolved. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest-known trees appeared in the Middle Devonian. These included a lineage of lycopods and another arborescent, woody vascular plant, the cladoxylopsids and progymnosperm \"Archaeopteris\". These tracheophytes were able to grow to large size on dry land because they had evolved the ability to biosynthesize lignin, which gave them physical rigidity and improved the effectiveness of their vascular system while giving them resistance to pathogens and herbivores. In Eifelian age, cladoxylopsid trees formed the first forests in Earth history. By the end of the Devonian, the first seed-forming plants had appeared. This rapid appearance of many plant groups and growth forms has been referred to as the Devonian Explosion or the Silurian-Devonian Terrestrial Revolution.\nThe 'greening' of the continents acted as a carbon sink, and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide may have dropped. This may have cooled the climate and led to a massive extinction event. (\"See\" Late Devonian extinction).\nAnimals and the first soils.\nPrimitive arthropods co-evolved with this diversified terrestrial vegetation structure. The evolving co-dependence of insects and seed plants that characterized a recognizably modern world had its genesis in the Late Devonian Epoch. The development of soils and plant root systems probably led to changes in the speed and pattern of erosion and sediment deposition. The rapid evolution of a terrestrial ecosystem that contained copious animals opened the way for the first vertebrates to seek terrestrial living. By the end of the Devonian, arthropods were solidly established on the land.\nLate Devonian extinction.\nThe Late Devonian extinction is not a single event, but rather is a series of pulsed extinctions at the Givetian-Frasnian boundary, the Frasnian-Famennian boundary, and the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. Together, these are considered one of the \"Big Five\" mass extinctions in Earth's history. The Devonian extinction crisis primarily affected the marine community, and selectively affected shallow warm-water organisms rather than cool-water organisms. The most important group to be affected by this extinction event were the reef-builders of the great Devonian reef systems.\nAmongst the severely affected marine groups were the brachiopods, trilobites, ammonites, and acritarchs, and the world saw the disappearance of an estimated 96% of vertebrates like conodonts and bony fishes, and all of the ostracoderms and placoderms. Land plants as well as freshwater species, such as our tetrapod ancestors, were relatively unaffected by the Late Devonian extinction event (there is a counterargument that the Devonian extinctions nearly wiped out the tetrapods).\nThe reasons for the Late Devonian extinctions are still unknown, and all explanations remain speculative. Canadian paleontologist Digby McLaren suggested in 1969 that the Devonian extinction events were caused by an asteroid impact. However, while there were Late Devonian collision events (see the Alamo bolide impact), little evidence supports the existence of a large enough Devonian crater.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Over Thompson's career, he travelled across North America, mapping of the continent along the way. For this historic feat, Thompson has been described as the \"greatest practical land geographer that the world has produced\".\nEarly life.\nDavid Thompson was born in Westminster, Middlesex, to recent Welsh migrants from Radnorshire David and Ann Thompson. They changed their family name from ap Thomas to Thompson. When Thompson was two, his father died. Due to his widowed mother not having financial resources, she placed Thompson, 29 April 1777, the day before his seventh birthday, and his older brother in the Grey Coat Hospital, a school for the disadvantaged of Westminster. Thompson graduated to the Grey Coat mathematical school, well known for teaching navigation and surveying.\nHe received an education for the Royal Navy: including mathematics of trigonometry and geometry, practical navigation including using of nautical instruments, finding latitudes and longitudes and making navigational calculations from observing the sun, moon and tide, and drawing maps and charts, taking land measurements, and sketching landscapes. He later built on these skills to make his career. In 1784, when Thompson was 14, the Grey Coat treasurer paid the Hudson's Bay Company the sum of five pounds, upon which the youth became an apprentice employee of the company, contracted for a period of seven years to be trained as a clerk.&lt;ref name=\"Thompson/Moreau p.xxiii\"&gt;Thompson/Moreau p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;\nHe set sail on a ship to North America on 28 May of that year, leaving England.\nHudson's Bay Company (HBC).\nOn 2 September 1784, Thompson arrived in Churchill (now in Manitoba) and was put to work as a clerk/secretary, copying the personal papers of the governor of Fort Churchill, Samuel Hearne. The next year he was transferred to nearby York Factory, and over the next few years spent time as a secretary at Cumberland House, and South Branch House of the Hudson's Bay Company before being transferred to Manchester House in 1787. During those years he learned to keep accounts and other records, calculate values of furs (it was noted that he also had several expensive beaver pelts at that time even when a secretary's job would not pay terribly well), track supplies and other duties.\nOn 23 December 1788, Thompson seriously fractured his tibia, forcing him to spend the next two winters at Cumberland House convalescing. It was during this time that he greatly refined and expanded his mathematical, astronomical, and surveying skills under the tutelage of Hudson's Bay Company surveyor Philip Turnor. It was also during this time that he lost sight in his right eye.\nIn 1790, with his apprenticeship nearing its end, Thompson requested a set of surveying tools in place of the typical parting gift of fine clothes offered by the company to those completing their indenture. He received both. He entered the employ of the Hudson's Bay Company as a fur trader. In 1792 he completed his first significant survey, mapping a route to Lake Athabasca (where today's Alberta/Saskatchewan border is located).\nBetween February and May 1793, Thompson made 34 observations of the longitude of Cumberland House using lunar distances. The mean of these observations was 102\u00b012\u2032 W, about 2' east of the modern value. The mean error of the 34 observations was about 15' of longitude. Broughton (2009) notes that the precision of the type of sextant used by Thompson was 15\" of arc, corresponding to 7.5' of longitude giving an absolute limit to the precision of an individual observation. The error in Thompson's mean was several times less than this. The time he took on these observations, about 3 hours of calculation each, indicates that he understood the power of averages.\nIn recognition of his map-making and surveying skills, the company promoted Thompson to the surveyor in 1794. He continued working for the Hudson's Bay Company until 23 May 1797 when, frustrated by an order to cease surveying and focus on the fur trade, he left. He walked in the snow in order to enter the employ of the competition, the North West Company. There he continued to work as a fur trader and surveyor.\nNorth West Company.\nThompson's decision to defect to the North West Company (NWC) in 1797 without providing the customary one-year notice was not well received by his former employers. But the North West Company was more supportive of Thompson pursuing his work on surveying and mapping the interior of what was to become Canada, as they judged it in the company's interest to know the exact locations of their settlements and the distances between them.23 In 1797, Thompson was sent south by his employers to survey part of the Canada-US boundary along the water routes from Lake Superior to Lake of the Woods to satisfy unresolved questions of territory arising from the Jay Treaty of 1794 between Great Britain and the United States after the American Revolutionary War.\nBy 1798 Thompson had completed a survey of from Grand Portage, through Lake Winnipeg, to the headwaters of the Assiniboine and Mississippi rivers, as well as two sides of Lake Superior. In 1798, the company sent him to Red Deer Lake (Lac La Biche in present-day Alberta) to establish a trading post. (The English translation of Lac la Biche: Red Deer Lake, was first recorded on the Mackenzie map of 1793.) Thompson spent the next few seasons trading based in Fort George (now in Alberta), and during this time led several expeditions into the Rocky Mountains.xlvi\nOn 10 July 1804, at the annual meeting of the North West Company in Kaministiquia, Thompson was made a full partner of the company. He became a 'wintering partner', who was based in the field rather than Montreal, and was granted two of the 92 NWC's shares worth more than \u00a34,000. He spent the next few seasons based there managing the fur trading operations, but still finding time to expand his surveys of the waterways around Lake Superior. At the 1806 company meeting, officers decided to send Thompson back into the interior. Concern over the United States-backed expedition of Lewis and Clark prompted the North West Company to charge Thompson with the task of finding a route to the Pacific to open up the lucrative trading territories of the Pacific Northwest.\nColumbia River travels.\nAfter the general meeting in 1806, Thompson travelled to Rocky Mountain House and prepared for an expedition to follow the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. In June 1807 Thompson crossed the Rocky Mountains and spent the summer surveying the Columbia basin; he continued to survey the area over the next few seasons. Thompson mapped and established trading posts in Northwestern Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Western Canada. Trading posts he founded included Kootenae House, Kullyspell House and Saleesh House; the latter two were the first trading posts west of the Rockies in Idaho and Montana, respectively. These posts established by Thompson extended North West Company fur trading territory into the Columbia Basin drainage area. The maps he made of the Columbia River basin east of the Cascade Mountains were of such high quality and detail that they continued to be useful into the 20th-century258.\nIn early 1810, Thompson was returning eastward toward Montreal but, while en route at Rainy Lake, received orders to return to the Rocky Mountains and establish a route to the mouth of the Columbia. The North West Company was responding to the plans of American entrepreneur John Jacob Astor to send a ship around the Americas to establish a fur trading post of the Pacific Fur Company on the Pacific Coast. During his return, Thompson was delayed by an angry group of Peigan natives at Howse Pass. Instead of pushing through with violence, he led the canoe brigade to seek a new route across the Rocky Mountains and found one through Athabasca Pass.\nDavid Thompson was the first European to navigate the full length of the Columbia River. Between Kettle Falls (3 July 1811) and the Junction of the Columbia and Snake Rivers (9 July), he was travelling through country that had never been visited by Europeans, and took time to visit the villages along the way to establish good relations, helped by copious quantities of tobacco. In 1805 Lewis and Clark had descended the Snake River, and continued down the Columbia. On reaching the junction Thompson erected a pole and a notice claiming the country for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site. This notice was found later that year by Astor company workers looking to establish an inland fur post, contributing to their selection of a more northerly site at Fort Okanogan. The North West Company established its post of Fort Nez Perc\u00e9s near the Snake River confluence several years later. Continuing down the Columbia, Thompson passed over the Celilo Falls, almost losing the canoe on the rocks, and portaged around the rapids of The Dalles and the Cascades Rapids. On 14 July 1811, Thompson reached the partially constructed Fort Astoria at the mouth of the Columbia, arriving two months after the Pacific Fur Company's ship, the \"Tonquin\".\nBefore returning upriver and across the mountains, Thompson hired Naukane, a Native Hawaiian Takane labourer brought to Fort Astoria by the Pacific Fur Company's ship \"Tonquin\". Naukane, known as Coxe to Thompson, accompanied Thompson across the continent to Lake Superior before journeying on to England.\nThompson wintered at Saleesh House before beginning his final journey in 1812 back to Montreal, where the North West Company was based.\nIn his published journals, Thompson recorded seeing large footprints (\u201cwhich measured fourteen inches in length by eight inches in breadth\u201d) near what is now Jasper, Alberta, in 1811. It has been suggested that these prints were similar to what has since been called the sasquatch. However, Thompson noted that these tracks showed \"a small Nail at the end of each [toe]\", which led him to surmise it was a bear, but he had doubts, saying, \"I held it to be the track of a large old grizzled bear; yet the shortness of the nails, the ball of the foot, and its great size was not that of a Bear\".\nThe years 1807\u20131812 are the most carefully scrutinized in his career and comprise his most enduring historical legacy, due to his development of the commercial routes across the Rockies, and his mapping of the lands they traverse.\nAppearance and personality.\nIn 1820, the English geologist, John Jeremiah Bigsby, attended a dinner party given by The Hon. William McGillivray at his home, Chateau St. Antoine, one of the early estates in Montreal's Golden Square Mile. He describes the party and some of the guests in his entertaining book \"The Shoe and Canoe\", giving an excellent description of David Thompson:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was well placed at table between one of the Miss McGillivray's and a singular-looking person of about fifty. He was plainly dressed, quiet, and observant. His figure was short and compact, and his black hair was worn long all round, and cut square, as if by one stroke of the shears, just above the eyebrows. His complexion was of the gardener's ruddy brown, while the expression of his deeply-furrowed features was friendly and intelligent, but his cut-short nose gave him an odd look. His speech betrayed the Welshman, although he left his native hills when very young. I might have been spared this description of Mr David Thompson by saying he greatly resembled Curran the Irish Orator...\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I afterwards travelled much with him, and have now only to speak of him with great respect, or, I ought to say, with admiration... No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; he has a very powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.\nMarriage and children.\nOn 10 June 1799 at \u00cele-\u00e0-la-Crosse, Thompson married Charlotte Small, a thirteen-year-old M\u00e9tis daughter of Scottish fur trader Patrick Small and a Cree mother. Their marriage was formalised thirteen years later at the Scotch Presbyterian Church in Montreal on 30 October 1812243. He and Charlotte had 13 children together; five of them were born before he left the fur trade. The family did not adjust easily to life in Eastern Canada; they lived in Montreal while he was travelling. Two of the children, John (aged 5) and Emma (aged 7), died of round worms, a common parasite. By the time of Thompson's death, the couple had been married 57 years, the longest marriage known in Canada pre-Confederation.\nLater life.\nUpon his arrival back in Montreal, Thompson retired with a generous pension from the North West Company. He settled in nearby Terrebonne and worked on completing his great map, a summary of his lifetime of exploring and surveying the interior of North America. The map covered the wide area stretching from Lake Superior to the Pacific, and was given by Thompson to the North West Company. Thompson's 1814 map, his greatest achievement, was so accurate that 100 years later it was still the basis for many of the maps issued by the Canadian government. It now resides in the Archives of Ontario.\nIn 1815, Thompson moved his family to Williamstown, Upper Canada,135 and a few years later was employed to survey the newly established borders with the United States from Lake of the Woods to the Eastern Townships of Quebec, established by Treaty of Ghent after the War of 1812. In 1843 Thompson completed his atlas of the region from Hudson Bay to the Pacific Ocean.254\nAfterwards, Thompson returned to a life as a land owner, but soon financial misfortune would ruin him. By 1831 he was so deeply in debt he was forced to take up a position as a surveyor for the British American Land Company to provide for his family. His luck continued to worsen and he was forced to move in with his daughter and son-in-law in 1845. He began work on a manuscript chronicling his life exploring the continent, but this project was left unfinished when his sight failed him completely in 1851.143\nDeath and afterward.\nThe land mass mapped by Thompson amounted to of wilderness (one-fifth of the continent). His contemporary, the great explorer Alexander Mackenzie, remarked that Thompson did more in ten months than he would have thought possible in two years.\nDespite these significant achievements, Thompson died in Montreal in near obscurity on 10 February 1857, his accomplishments almost unrecognised. He never finished the book of his 28 years in the fur trade, based on his 77 field notebooks, before he died. In the 1890s geologist J.B. Tyrrell resurrected Thompson's notes and in 1916 published them as \"David Thompson's Narrative\", as part of the General Series of the Champlain Society. Further editions and re-examinations of Thompson's life and works were published in 1962 by Richard Glover, in 1971 by Victor Hopwood, and in 2015 by William Moreau.\nThompson's body was interred in Montreal's Mount Royal Cemetery in an unmarked grave. It was not until 1926 that efforts by J.B. Tyrrell and the Canadian Historical Society resulted in the placing of a tombstone to mark his grave. The next year, Thompson was named a National Historic Person by the federal government, one of the earliest such designations. A federal plaque reflecting that status is at Jasper National Park, Alberta. Meantime, Thompson's achievements are central reasons for other national historic designations:\nIn 1957, one hundred years after his death, Canada's post office department honoured him with his image on a postage stamp. The David Thompson Highway in Alberta was named in his honour, along with David Thompson High School on the side of the highway near Leslieville, Alberta. There are also two David Thompson Secondary Schools, one in Vancouver, BC, and one in Invermere, BC.\nHis prowess as a geographer is now well-recognized. He has been called \"the greatest land geographer that the world has produced.\"\nThere is a monument dedicated to David Thompson (maintained by the state of North Dakota) near the former town site of the ghost town Verendrye, North Dakota, located approximately north and west of Karlsruhe, North Dakota. Thompson Falls, Montana, and British Columbia's Thompson River and Thompson Falls on the Blaeberry River are also named after the explorer.\nThere is a statue commemorating David Thompson in downtown Sandpoint, Idaho, near the intersection of Second Avenue and Main Street.\nThe year 2007 marked the 150th year of Thompson's death and the 200th anniversary of his first crossing of the Rocky Mountains. Commemorative events and exhibits were planned across Canada and the United States from 2007 to 2011 as a celebration of his accomplishments.\nIn 2007, a commemorative plaque was placed on a wall at the Grey Coat Hospital, the school for the disadvantaged of Westminster David Thompson attended as a boy, by English author and TV presenter Ray Mears.\nThompson was the subject of a 1964 National Film Board of Canada short film \"David Thompson: The Great Mapmaker \", as well as the BBC2 programme \"Ray Mears' Northern Wilderness\" (Episode 5), broadcast in November 2009. He's also the subject of 2010 KSPS-TV film \"Uncharted Territory: David Thompson on the Columbia Plateau\".\nHe is referenced in the 1981 folk song \"Northwest Passage\" by Stan Rogers.\nThe national park service, Parks Canada, announced in 2018 that it had named its new research vessel , to be used for underwater archaeology, including sea floor mapping, and for marine science in the Pacific, Atlantic, Arctic Oceans, and the Great Lakes. It will be the main platform for research on the Wrecks of HMS \"Erebus\" and HMS \"Terror\" National Historic Site.\nThe David Thompson Astronomical Observatory at Fort William Historical Park was named to commemorate David Thompson and his discoveries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Among monocot plants, Dioscoreales are grouped with the lilioid monocots, wherein they are a sister group to the Pandanales. In total, the order Dioscoreales comprises three families, 22 genera and about 850 species.\nDioscoreales contains the family Dioscoreaceae, which notably includes the yams (\"Dioscorea\") and several other bulbous and tuberous plants, some of which are heavily cultivated as staple food sources in certain countries. \nCertain species are found solely in arid climates (incl. parts of Southern Africa), and have adapted to this harsh environment as caudex-forming, perennial caudiciformes, including \"Dioscorea elephantipes\", the \"elephant's foot\" or \"elephant-foot yam\".\nOlder systems tended to place all lilioid monocots with reticulate veined leaves (such as Smilacaceae and Stemonaceae together with Dioscoraceae) in Dioscoreales; as currently circumscribed by phylogenetic analysis, using combined morphology and molecular methods, Dioscreales now contains many reticulate-veined vines within the Dioscoraceae, as well as the myco-heterotrophic Burmanniaceae and the autotrophic Nartheciaceae.\nDescription.\nDioscoreales are vines or herbaceous forest floor plants. They may be achlorophyllous or saprophytic. Synapomorphies include tuberous roots, glandular hairs, seed coat characteristics and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals. Other characteristics of the order include the presence of saponin steroids, annular vascular bundles that are found in both the stem and leaf. The leaves are often unsheathed at the base, have a distinctive petiole and reticulate veined lamina. Alternatively they may be small and scale-like with a sheathed base. The flowers are actinomorphic, and may be bisexual or dioecious, while the flowers or inflorescence bear glandular hairs. The perianth may be conspicuous or reduced and the style is short with well developed style branches. The tepals persist in the development of the fruit, which is a dry capsule or berry. In the seed, the endotegmen is tanniferous and the embryo short.\nAll of the species except the genera placed in Nartheciaceae express simultaneous microsporogenesis. Plants in Nartheciaceae show successive microsporogenesis which is one of the traits indicating that the family is sister to all the other members included in the order.\nTaxonomy.\nPre-Darwinian.\nFor the early history from Lindley (1853) onwards, see Caddick \"et al.\" (2000) Table 1, Caddick et al. (2002a) Table 1 and Table 2 in Bouman (1995). The taxonomic classification of Dioscoreales has been complicated by the presence of a number of morphological features reminiscent of the dicotyledons, leading some authors to place the order as intermediate between the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons.\nWhile Lindley did not use the term \"Dioscoreales\", he placed the family Dioscoraceae together with four other families in what he referred to as an Alliance (the equivalent of the modern Order) called Dictyogens. He reflected the uncertainty as to the place of this Alliance by placing it as a class of its own between Endogens (monocots) and Exogens (dicots) The botanical authority is given to von Martius (1835) by APG for his description of the family Dioscoreae or \"Ordo\", while other sources cite Hooker (Dioscoreales Hook.f.) for his use of the term \"Dioscorales\" in 1873 with a single family, Dioscoreae. However, in his more definitive work, the \"Genera plantara\" (1883), he simply placed Dioscoraceae in the Epigynae \"Series\".\nPost-Darwinian.\nAlthough Charles Darwin's Origin of Species (1859) preceded Bentham and Hooker's publication, the latter project was commenced much earlier and George Bentham was initially sceptical of Darwinism. The new phyletic approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata, but this did little to further define the circumscription of Dioscoreaceae. The major works in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century employing this approach were in the German literature. Authors such as Eichler, Engler and Wettstein placed this family in the Liliiflorae, a major subdivision of monocotyledons. it remained to Hutchinson (1926) to resurrect the Dioscoreales to group Dioscoreaceae and related families together. Hutchinson's circumscription of Dioscoreales included three other families in addition to Dioscoreaceae, Stenomeridaceae, Trichopodaceae and Roxburghiaceae. Of these only Trichopodaceae was included in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification (see below), but was subsumed into Dioscoraceae. Stenomeridaceae, as \"Stenomeris\" was also included in Dioscoreaceae as subfamily Stenomeridoideae, the remaining genera being grouped in subfamily Dioscoreoideae. Roxburghiaceae on the other hand was segregated in the sister order Pandanales as Stemonaceae. Most taxonomists in the twentieth century (the exception was the 1981 Cronquist system which placed most such plants in order Liliales, subclass Liliidae, class Liliopsida=monocotyledons, division Magnoliophyta=angiosperms) recognised Dioscoreales as a distinct order, but demonstrated wide variations in its composition.\nDahlgren, in the second version of his taxonomic classification (1982) raised the Liliiflorae to a superorder and placed Dioscoreales as an order within it. In his system, Dioscoreales contained only three families, Dioscoreaceae, Stemonaceae (\"i.e.\" Hutchinson's Roxburghiaceae) and Trilliaceae. The latter two families had been treated as a separate order (Stemonales, or Roxburghiales) by other authors, such as Huber (1969). The APG would later assign these to Pandanales and Liliales respectively. Dahlgren's construction of Dioscoreaceae included the Stenomeridaceae and Trichopodaceae, doubting these were distinct, and Croomiaceae in Stemonaceae. Furthermore, he expressed doubts about the order's homogeneity, especially Trilliaceae. The Dioscoreales at that time were marginally distinguishable from the Asparagales. In his examination of Huber's Stemonales, he found that the two constituent families had as close an affinity to Dioscoreaceae as to each other, and hence included them. He also considered closely related families and their relationship to Dioscoreales, such as the monogeneric Taccaceae, then in its own order, Taccales. Similar considerations were discussed with respect to two Asparagales families, Smilacaceae and Petermanniaceae.\nIn Dahlgren's third and final version (1985) that broader circumscription of Dioscoreales was created within the superorder Lilianae, subclass Liliidae (monocotyledons), class Magnoliopsida (angiosperms) and comprised the seven families Dioscoreaceae, Petermanniaceae, Smilacaceae, Stemonaceae, Taccaceae, Trichopodaceae and Trilliaceae. Thismiaceae has either been treated as a separate family closely related to Burmanniaceae or as a tribe (Thismieae) within a more broadly defined Burmanniaceae, forming a separate order, Burmanniales, in the Dahlgren system. The related Nartheciaceae were treated as tribe Narthecieae within the Melanthiaceae in a third order, the Melanthiales, by Dahlgren. Dahlgren considered the Dioscoreales to most strongly resemble the ancestral monocotyledons, and hence sharing \"dicotyledonous\" characteristics, making it the most central monocotyledon order. Of these seven families, Bouman considered Dioscoreaceae, Trichopodaceae, Stemonaceae and Taccaceae to represent the \"core\" families of the order. However, that study also indicated both a clear delineation of the order from other orders particularly Asparagales, and a lack of homogeneity within the order.\nMolecular phylogenetics and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.\nThe increasing availability of molecular phylogenetics methods in addition to morphological characteristics in the 1990s led to major reconsiderations of the relationships within the monocotyledons. In that large multi-institutional examination of the seed plants using the plastid gene \"rbc\"L the authors used Dahlgren's system as their basis, but followed Thorne (1992) in altering the suffixes of the superorders from \"\"-iflorae\" to \"-anae\"\". This demonstrated that the Lilianae comprised three lineages corresponding to Dahlgren's orders Dioscoreales, Liliales, and Asparagaless.\nUnder the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system of 1998, which took Dahlgren's system as a basis, the order was placed in the monocot clade and comprised the five families Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae, Taccaceae, Thismiaceae and Trichopodaceae.\nIn APG II (2003), a number of changes were made to Dioscoreales, as a result of an extensive study by Caddick and colleagues (2002), using an analysis of three genes, \"rbc\"L, \"atp\"B and 18S rDNA, in addition to morphology. These studies resulted in a re-examination of the relationships between most of the genera within the order. Thismiaceae was shown to be a sister group to Burmanniaceae, and so was included in it. The monotypic families Taccaceae and Trichopodaceae were included in Dioscoreaceae, while Nartheciaceae could also be grouped within Dioscoreales. APG III (2009) did not change this, so the order now comprises three families Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae and Nartheciaceae.\nAlthough further research on the deeper relationships within Dioscoreales continues, the APG IV (2016) authors felt it was still premature to propose a restructuring of the order. Specifically these issues involve conflicting information as to the relationship between \"Thismia\" and Burmanniaceae, and hence whether Thismiaceae should be subsumed in the latter, or reinstated.\nPhylogeny.\nMolecular phylogenetics in Dioscoreales poses special problems due to the absence of plastid genes in mycoheterotrophs. Dioscoreales is monophyletic and is placed as a sister order to Pandanales, as shown in Cladogram I.\nEvolution.\nThe data for the evolution of the order is collected from molecular analyses since there are no such fossils found. It is estimated that Dioscoreales and its sister clade Pandanales split up around 121 million years ago during Early Cretaceous when the stem group was formed. Then it took 3 to 6 million years for the crown group to differentiate in Mid Cretaceous.\nSubdivision.\nThe three families of Dioscreales constitutes about 22 genera and about 849 species making it one of the smaller monocot orders. Of these, the largest group is \"Dioscorea\" (yams) with about 450 species. By contrast the second largest genus is \"Burmannia\" with about 60 species, and most have only one or two.\nSome authors, preferring the original APG (1998)families, continue to treat Thismiaceae separately from Burmanniaceae and Taccaceae from Dioscoreaceae. But in the 2015 study of Hertwerk and colleagues, seven genera representing all three families were examined with an eight gene dataset. Dioscoreales was monophyletic and three subclades were represented corresponding to the APG families. Dioscoreaceae and Burmanniaceae were in a sister group relationship.\nEtymology.\nNamed after the type genus \"Dioscorea\", which in turn was named by Linnaeus in 1753 to honour the Greek physician and botanist Dioscorides.\nDistribution and habitat.\nSpecies from this order are distributed across all of the continents except Antarctica. They are mainly tropical or subtropical representatives, but some members of families Dioscoreaceae and Nartheciaceae are found in cooler regions of Europe and North America. Order Dioscoreales contains plants that are able to form an underground organ for reservation of nutritions as many other monocots. An exception is the family Burmanniaceae which is entirely myco-heterotrophic and contains species that lack photosynthetic abilities.\nEcology.\nThe three families included in order Dioscoreales also represent three different ecological groups of plants. Dioscoreaceae contains mainly vines (\"Dioscorea\") and other crawling species (\"Epipetrum\"). Nartheciaceae on the other hand is a family composed of herbaceous plants with a rather lily-like appearance (\"Aletris\") while Burmanniaceae is entirely myco-heterotrophic group.\nUses.\nMany members of Dioscoreaceae produce tuberous starchy roots (yams) which form staple foods in tropical regions. They have also been the source of steroids for the pharmaceutical industry, including the production of oral contraceptives.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "8005", "revid": "50377238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8005", "title": "Dentistry", "text": "Branch of medicine\nDentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is the branch of medicine focused on the teeth, gums, and mouth. It consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, management, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the mouth, most commonly focused on dentition (the development and arrangement of teeth) as well as the oral mucosa. Dentistry may also encompass other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint. The practitioner is called a dentist.\nThe history of dentistry is almost as ancient as the history of humanity and civilization, with the earliest evidence dating from 7000 BC to 5500 BC. Dentistry is thought to have been the first specialization in medicine which has gone on to develop its own accredited degree with its own specializations. Dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology (the study of the mouth and its disorders and diseases) for which reason the two terms are used interchangeably in certain regions. However, some specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery (facial reconstruction/OMFS) may require both medical and dental degrees to accomplish.\nDental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries (such as dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, and dental therapists). Most dentists either work in private practices (primary care), dental hospitals, or (secondary care) institutions (prisons, armed forces bases, etc.).\nThe modern movement of evidence-based dentistry calls for the use of high-quality scientific research and evidence to guide decision-making such as in manual tooth conservation, use of fluoride water treatment and fluoride toothpaste, dealing with oral diseases such as tooth decay and periodontitis, as well as systematic diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS which could also affect the oral cavity. Other practices relevant to evidence-based dentistry include radiology of the mouth to inspect teeth deformity or oral malaises, haematology (study of blood) to avoid bleeding complications during dental surgery, cardiology (due to various severe complications arising from dental surgery with patients with heart disease), etc.\nEtymology.\nThe term dentistry comes from \"dentist\", which comes from French \"dentiste\", which comes from the French and Latin words for tooth. The term for the associated scientific study of teeth is odontology (from ) \u2013 the study of the structure, development, and abnormalities of the teeth.\nDental treatment.\nDentistry usually encompasses practices related to the oral cavity. According to the World Health Organization, oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe, with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.\nThe majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases, which are dental caries (tooth decay) and periodontal disease (gingivitis or periodontitis). Common treatments involve the restoration of teeth, extraction or surgical removal of teeth, scaling and root planing, endodontic root canal treatment, and cosmetic dentistry.\nBy nature of their general training, dentists, without specialization, can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative (fillings, crowns, bridges), prosthetic (dentures), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and extraction of teeth, as well as performing examinations, radiographs (x-rays), and diagnosis. Dentists can also prescribe medications used in the field such as antibiotics, sedatives, and any other drugs used in patient management. Depending on their licensing boards, general dentists may be required to complete additional training to perform sedation, dental implants, etc.\nDentists also encourage the prevention of oral diseases through proper hygiene and regular, twice or more yearly, checkups for professional cleaning and evaluation. Oral infections and inflammations may affect overall health, and conditions in the oral cavity may be indicative of systemic diseases, such as osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac disease or cancer. Many studies have also shown that gum disease is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and preterm birth. The concept that oral health can affect systemic health and disease is referred to as \"oral-systemic health\".\nEducation and licensing.\nJohn M. Harris started the world's first dental school in Bainbridge, Ohio, and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. It opened on 21 February 1828, and today is a dental museum. The first dental college, Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, opened in Baltimore, Maryland, US in 1840. The second in the United States was the Ohio College of Dental Surgery, established in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1845. The Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery followed in 1852. In 1907, Temple University accepted a bid to incorporate the school.\nStudies show that dentists who graduated from different countries, or even from different dental schools in one country, may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. For example, dentists that graduated from Israeli dental schools may recommend the removal of asymptomatic impacted third molar (wisdom teeth) more often than dentists that graduated from Latin American or Eastern European dental schools.\nIn the United Kingdom, the first dental schools, the London School of Dental Surgery and the Metropolitan School of Dental Science, both in London, opened in 1859. The British Dentists Act of 1878 and the 1879 Dentists Register limited the title of \"dentist\" and \"dental surgeon\" to qualified and registered practitioners. However, others could legally describe themselves as \"dental experts\" or \"dental consultants\". The practice of dentistry in the United Kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 Dentists Act, which required the registration of anyone practising dentistry. The British Dental Association, formed in 1880 with Sir John Tomes as president, played a major role in prosecuting dentists practising illegally. Dentists in the United Kingdom are now regulated by the General Dental Council.\nDentists in many countries complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. Though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree. In a few countries, to become a qualified dentist one must usually complete at least four years of postgraduate study; Dental degrees awarded around the world include the Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) and Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) in North America (US and Canada), and the Bachelor of Dental Surgery/Baccalaureus Dentalis Chirurgiae (BDS, BDent, BChD, BDSc) in the UK and current and former British Commonwealth countries.\nAll dentists in the United States undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies, but nearly all complete a bachelor's degree. This schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a \"Doctor of Dental Surgery\" (DDS) or \"Doctor of Dental Medicine\" (DMD). Specialization in dentistry is available in the fields of Anesthesiology, Dental Public Health, Endodontics, Oral Radiology, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Medicine, Orofacial Pain, Pathology, Orthodontics, Pediatric Dentistry (Pedodontics), Periodontics, and Prosthodontics.\nContinuing education.\nMany countries require licensed dentists to undertake continuing education or continuing professional development (CE/CPD) after graduation. These structured activities help maintain clinical competence, support patient safety, and keep practitioners up to date with current standards of care, with government regulators typically specifying minimum hours or points per cycle and mandating core topics such as infection control, radiography, and medical emergencies.\nSpecialties.\nSome dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize. Exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location. Examples include:\nHistory.\nTooth decay was low in pre-agricultural societies, but the advent of farming society about 10,000 years ago correlated with an increase in tooth decay (cavities). An infected tooth from Italy partially cleaned with flint tools, between 13,820 and 14,160 years old, represents the oldest known dentistry, although a 2017 study suggests that 130,000 years ago the Neanderthals already used rudimentary dentistry tools. In Italy evidence dated to the Paleolithic, around 13,000 years ago, points to bitumen used to fill a tooth and in Neolithic Slovenia, 6500 years ago, beeswax was used to close a fracture in a tooth. The Indus valley has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 BC, during the Stone Age. The Neolithic site of Mehrgarh (now in Pakistan's south western province of Balochistan) indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead-crafters. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. The earliest dental filling, made of beeswax, was discovered in Slovenia and dates from 6500 years ago. Dentistry was practised in prehistoric Malta, as evidenced by a skull which had a dental abscess lanced from the root of a tooth dating back to around 2500 BC. The practice of dentistry dates back thousands of years, with evidence of dental procedures such as tooth extraction and fillings found in ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and the Greeks. One notable historical figure is Pierre Fauchard, often referred to as the 'father of modern dentistry,' who wrote the first comprehensive book on the subject in 1728.\nAn ancient Sumerian text describes a \"tooth worm\" as the cause of dental caries. Evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient India, Egypt, Japan, and China. The legend of the worm is also found in the \"Homeric Hymns\", and as late as the 14th century AD the surgeon Guy de Chauliac still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay.\nRecipes for the treatment of toothache, infections and loose teeth are spread throughout the Ebers Papyrus, Kahun Papyri, Brugsch Papyrus, and Hearst papyrus of Ancient Egypt. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written in the 17th century BC but which may reflect previous manuscripts from as early as 3000 BC, discusses the treatment of dislocated or fractured jaws. In the 18th century BC, the Code of Hammurabi referenced dental extraction twice as it related to punishment. Examination of the remains of some ancient Egyptians and Greco-Romans reveals early attempts at dental prosthetics. However, it is possible the prosthetics were prepared after death for aesthetic reasons.\nAncient Greek scholars Hippocrates and Aristotle wrote about dentistry, including the eruption pattern of teeth, treating decayed teeth and gum disease, extracting teeth with forceps, and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws. Use of dental appliances, bridges and dentures was applied by the Etruscans in northern Italy, from as early as 700 BC, of human or other animal teeth fastened together with gold bands. The Romans had likely borrowed this technique by the 5th century BC. The Phoenicians crafted dentures during the 6th\u20134th century BC, fashioning them from gold wire and incorporating two ivory teeth. In ancient Egypt, Hesy-Ra is the first named \"dentist\" (greatest of the teeth). The Egyptians bound replacement teeth together with gold wire. Roman medical writer Cornelius Celsus wrote extensively of oral diseases as well as dental treatments such as narcotic-containing emollients and astringents. The earliest dental amalgams were first documented in a Tang dynasty medical text written by the Chinese physician Su Kung in 659, and appeared in Germany in 1528.\nDuring the Islamic Golden Age Dentistry was discussed in several famous books of medicine such as The Canon in medicine written by Avicenna and Al-Tasreef by Al-Zahrawi who is considered the greatest surgeon of the Middle Ages, Avicenna said that jaw fracture should be reduced according to the occlusal guidance of the teeth; this principle is still valid in modern times. Al-Zahrawi invented over 200 surgical tools that resemble the modern kind.\nHistorically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. During the Middle Ages and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general physicians. Barbers usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated pain and associated chronic tooth infection. Instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. In the 14th century, Guy de Chauliac most probably invented the dental pelican (resembling a pelican's beak) which was used to perform dental extractions up until the late 18th century. The pelican was replaced by the dental key which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 19th century.\nThe first book focused solely on dentistry was the \"Artzney Buchlein\" in 1530, and the first dental textbook written in English was called \"Operator for the Teeth\" by Charles Allen in 1685.\nIn the United Kingdom, there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until 1859 and it was only in 1921 that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified. The Royal Commission on the National Health Service in 1979 reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per 10,000 population in the UK than there were in 1921.\nModern dentistry.\nIt was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. The English physician Thomas Browne in his \"A Letter to a Friend\" (c.\u20091656 pub. 1690) made an early dental observation with characteristic humour:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Egyptian Mummies that I have seen, have had their Mouths open, and somewhat gaping, which affordeth a good opportunity to view and observe their Teeth, wherein 'tis not easie to find any wanting or decayed: and therefore in Egypt, where one Man practised but one Operation, or the Diseases but of single Parts, it must needs be a barren Profession to confine unto that of drawing of Teeth, and little better than to have been Tooth-drawer unto King Pyrrhus, who had but two in his Head.\nThe French surgeon Pierre Fauchard became known as the \"father of modern dentistry\". Despite the limitations of the primitive surgical instruments during the late 17th and early 18th century, Fauchard was a highly skilled surgeon who made remarkable improvisations of dental instruments, often adapting tools from watchmakers, jewelers and even barbers, that he thought could be used in dentistry. He introduced dental fillings as treatment for dental cavities. He asserted that sugar-derived acids like tartaric acid were responsible for dental decay, and also suggested that tumors surrounding the teeth and in the gums could appear in the later stages of tooth decay.\nFauchard was the pioneer of dental prosthesis, and he invented many methods to replace lost teeth. He suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of ivory or bone. He also introduced dental braces, although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. Waxed linen or silk threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. His contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication Le chirurgien dentiste or The Surgeon Dentist. The French text included \"basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery\".\nAfter Fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. Two important books, \"Natural History of Human Teeth\" (1771) and \"Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth\" (1778), were published by British surgeon John Hunter. In 1763, he entered into a period of collaboration with the London-based dentist James Spence. He began to theorise about the possibility of tooth transplants from one person to another. He realised that the chances of a successful tooth transplant (initially, at least) would be improved if the donor tooth was as fresh as possible and was matched for size with the recipient. These principles are still used in the transplantation of internal organs. Hunter conducted a series of pioneering operations, in which he attempted a tooth transplant. Although the donated teeth never properly bonded with the recipients' gums, one of Hunter's patients stated that he had three which lasted for six years, a remarkable achievement for the period.\nMajor advances in science were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. The profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. In the UK, the Dentist Act was passed in 1878 and the British Dental Association formed in 1879. In the same year, Francis Brodie Imlach was the first ever dentist to be elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons (Edinburgh), raising dentistry onto a par with clinical surgery for the first time.\nHazards in modern dentistry.\nLong term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and tinnitus. Noise exposure can cause excessive stimulation of the hearing mechanism, which damages the delicate structures of the inner ear. NIHL can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above 90 dBA according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Regulations state that the permissible noise exposure levels for individuals is 90 dBA. For the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), exposure limits are set to 85 dBA. Exposures below 85 dBA are not considered to be hazardous. Time limits are placed on how long an individual can stay in an environment above 85 dBA before it causes hearing loss. OSHA places that limitation at 8 hours for 85 dBA. The exposure time becomes shorter as the dBA level increases.\nWithin the field of dentistry, a variety of cleaning tools are used including piezoelectric and sonic scalers, and ultrasonic scalers and cleaners. While a majority of the tools do not exceed 75 dBA, prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus. Few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices, which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus.\nChemical Hazards.\nIn addition to noise exposure occupational hazards, there are various chemical hazards from disinfection and dental materials, that lead to allergens from compounds like mercury, methacrylate, and nickel. \nDisinfectants.\nChemical disinfectants are necessary in a dental practice to prevent infection and contamination between patients. As a consequence, it introduces many chemical and occupational hazards. The most commonly used active ingredients in disinfection include alcohol, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA) solution, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, and glutaraldehyde. In terms of surface-disinfection, workers are especially exposed to agents like aldehydes and quaternary-ammonium compounds via inhalation or physical contact. This may result in allergies, due to lack of adequate ventilation and prolonged exposure. Research shows that around 10.9% of dental professionals may test positive for an allergic reaction to glutaraldehyde, compared to 2% in non-dental control subjects. Additionally, frequent use of disinfectants may result in more respiratory symptoms in dental workers as well as worsened asthma control. \nIt is essential to implement controls within dental clinics to reduce occupational exposure to these chemical hazards from disinfectants. In terms of engineering, using alternative and less sensitive chemicals as well as maintaining proper ventilation systems within the clinic will help reduce the amount of airborne chemicals. Having a safety data sheet, regular training on chemical safety, appropriate response equipment, and conducting assessments of workplace safety are all recommended administrative controls to minimize exposure. Wearing full personal protective equipment reduces the occurrence of symptoms like burning sensation in eyes, dry cough, skin dermatitis, and respiratory irritation to chemical disinfectants. Therefore, it is vital as a last form of defense that dental professionals wear gloves, gowns, masks, and eye protection when using disinfectant. The application of these engineering techniques, administrative protocols, and personal protection are standard industrial hygiene practices to keep dental professionals safe while keeping the work environment clean. \nMercury.\nElemental mercury makes up approximately 50% of conventional dental amalgam and can release toxic vapor during both placement and removal procedures. Dental amalgam is a restorative material used for filling cavities caused by tooth decay. It is composed of a mixture of metals, approximately 50% of which is elemental mercury (Hg\u2070)\u00a0 combined with an alloy powder containing silver, tin, copper, and other trace metals. https:// Mercury serves as a binding agent amalgamates the alloy particles into a durable, moldable mass. Prolonged or repeated exposure to these vapors has been associated with adverse effects on the nervous system and kidneys. Chronic exposure to mercury vapor has been associated with neurological, renal, and immunological effects, as mercury has a high affinity for nervous tissue and the kidneys. Symptoms of overexposure may include tremors, memory impairment, fatigue, and mood changes. https:// \nMethacrylate.\nMethyl methacrylate is an acrylic resin used in restorative and prosthetic dentistry, especially in dentures, temporary crowns, and retainers. Exposure can occur by inhalation of vapors through grinding or polymerization during dental procedures or by skin contact with uncured materials. Short-term exposure can lead to eye, skin, and respiratory irritation, and long-term exposure can cause asthma or allergic contact dermatitis. One cross-sectional study discovered that dental assistants with high exposure to methacrylate vapors had increased odds of asthma and nasal issues. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding that methacrylate is a respiratory and dermal hazard in dentistry.\nPrevention measures to reduce exposure to methacrylate include local exhaust ventilation to capture aerosols, consistent air sampling, covered mixing systems, and proper personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends keeping methyl methacrylate concentrations below the recommended exposure limit of 100ppm for an 8-hour time-weighted average. Implementing safety measures to protect dental staff from hazards can be achieved by ventilation improvements and proper personal protective equipment to prevent them from respiratory irritation, asthma, and allergic contact dermatitis.\nNickel.\nNickel exposure in dentistry can primarily occur through the use of nickel-containing alloys like crowns, bridges, brackets, surgical implants, and orthodontic appliances. Acute allergic reactions are the most common response in individuals who are either allergic or hypersensitive to nickel, and this leads to an immediate immune response. The immune responses correlated to nickel exposure are not toxic poisoning and does not occur in the general population, but they consist of contact dermatitis (ACD), hypersensitivity reactions such as inflammation of the oral mucosa, lip or cheek dermatitis, itching, oral burning, and erythema. Nickel sensitivity is highly common in childhood through adolescence due to constant exposure from jewlry, belts, toys, coins, and dental appliances. However, according to recent studies, in people who are not sensitive to nickel dental alloys release levels that are typically less harmful and regarded as biologically safe.\nEvidence-based dentistry.\nThere is a movement in modern dentistry to place a greater emphasis on high-quality scientific evidence in decision-making. Evidence-based dentistry uses current scientific evidence to guide decisions. It is an approach to oral health that requires the application and examination of relevant scientific data related to the patient's oral and medical health. Along with the dentist's professional skill and expertise, evidence-based dentistry allows dentists to stay up to date on procedures for patients to receive improved treatment. A new paradigm for medical education designed to incorporate current research into education and practice was developed to help practitioners provide the best care for their patients. It was first introduced by Gordon Guyatt and the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada in the 1990s. It is part of the larger movement toward evidence-based medicine and other evidence-based practices, especially since a major part of dentistry involves dealing with oral and systemic diseases. Other issues relevant to the dental field in terms of evidence-based research and evidence-based practice include population oral health, dental clinical practice, tooth morphology etc.\nDigitalization of dentistry.\nLike other medical disciplines, dentistry is strongly influenced by the digital transformation of healthcare. Processes are changing fundamentally, affecting the effectiveness and accuracy of patient treatment.\nVarious technologies are being used in dentistry, including cocomputer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems in combination with 3D printing, artificial intelligence (AI), and electronic health records. The degree of implementation of such technologies varies significantly across dental practices.\nResearch shows that larger dental centers are adopting digital solutions more rapidly. Younger dentists, as well as those who regularly participate in digital training programs, show a higher willingness to implement new technologies. However, financial constraints and the lack of comprehensive training opportunities for the digitalization of dentistry currently represent major barriers to implementation.\nEthical and medicolegal issues.\nDentistry is unique in that it requires dental students to have competence-based clinical skills that can only be acquired through supervised specialized laboratory training and direct patient care. This necessitates the need for a scientific and professional basis of care with a foundation of extensive research-based education. According to some experts, the accreditation of dental schools can enhance the quality and professionalism of dental education.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle. Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere.\nIn more modern usage, the length formula_1 of a diameter is also called the diameter. In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter (which refers to the line segment itself), because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length, this being twice the radius formula_2\nformula_3\nThe word \"diameter\" is derived from (), \"diameter of a circle\", from (), \"across, through\" and (), \"measure\". It is often abbreviated formula_4 or formula_5\nConstructions.\nWith straightedge and compass, a diameter of a given circle can be constructed as the perpendicular bisector of an arbitrary chord. Drawing two diameters in this way can be used to locate the center of a circle, as their crossing point. To construct a diameter parallel to a given line, choose the chord to be perpendicular to the line.\nThe circle having a given line segment as its diameter can be constructed by straightedge and compass, by finding the midpoint of the segment and then drawing the circle centered at the midpoint through one of the ends of the line segment.\nSymbol.\nThe symbol or variable for diameter, \u2300, is sometimes used in technical drawings or specifications as a prefix or suffix for a number (e.g. \"\u2300 55 mm\"), indicating that it represents diameter. Photographic filter thread sizes are often denoted in this way.\nThe symbol has a code point in Unicode at , in the Miscellaneous Technical set. It should not be confused with several other characters (such as or ) that resemble it but have unrelated meanings. It has the compose sequence .\nGeneralizations.\nThe definitions given above are only valid for circles and spheres. However, they are special cases of a more general definition that is valid for any kind of formula_6-dimensional object, or a set of scattered points. The \"diameter of a set\" is the least upper bound of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the subset.\nA different and incompatible definition is sometimes used for the diameter of a conic section. In this context, a diameter is any chord which passes through the conic's centre. A diameter of an ellipse is any line passing through the centre of the ellipse. Half of any such diameter may be called a semidiameter, although this term is most often a synonym for the radius of a circle or sphere. The longest and shortest diameters are called the \"major axis\" and \"minor axis\", respectively. \"Conjugate diameters\" are a pair of diameters where one is parallel to a tangent to the ellipse at the endpoint of the other diameter.\nSeveral kinds of object can be measured by \"equivalent diameter\", the diameter of a circular or spherical approximation to the object. This includes hydraulic diameter, the equivalent diameter of a channel or pipe through which liquid flows, and the Sauter mean diameter of a collection of particles.\nThe diameter of a circle is exactly twice its radius. However, this is true only for a circle, and only in the Euclidean metric. Jung's theorem provides more general inequalities relating the diameter to the radius.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a stage in the process of adducing evidence from witnesses in a court of law. Direct examination is usually performed to elicit evidence in support of facts which will satisfy a required element of a party's claim or defense.\nIn direct examination, one is generally prohibited from asking leading questions. This prevents a lawyer from feeding answers to a favorable witness. An exception to this rule occurs if one side has called a witness, but it is either understood or becomes clear, that the witness is hostile to the calling lawyer's side of the controversy, the lawyer who called the witness may then ask the court to declare the person on the stand a hostile witness. If the court does so, the lawyer may thereafter ask witness leading questions during direct examination.\nThe techniques of direct examination are taught in courses on trial advocacy.

The technical term \"intoxication\" in common speech may suggest that a large amount of alcohol has been consumed, leading to accompanying physical symptoms and deleterious health effects. Mild intoxication is mostly referred to by slang terms such as \"tipsy\" or \"buzzed\". In addition to the toxicity of ethanol, the main psychoactive component of alcoholic beverages, other physiological symptoms may arise from the activity of acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol. These effects may not arise until hours after ingestion and may contribute to a condition colloquially known as a hangover. \nSymptoms of intoxication at lower doses may include mild sedation and poor coordination. At higher doses, there may be slurred speech, trouble walking, impaired vision, mood swings and vomiting. Extreme doses may result in a respiratory depression, coma, or death. Complications may include seizures, aspiration pneumonia, low blood sugar, and injuries or self-harm such as suicide. Alcohol intoxication can lead to alcohol-related crime, with perpetrators more likely to be intoxicated than victims.\nAlcohol intoxication typically begins after two or more alcoholic drinks. Alcohol has the potential for abuse. Risk factors include a social situation where heavy drinking is common and a person having an impulsive personality. Diagnosis is usually based on the history of events and physical examination. Verification of events by witnesses may be useful. Legally, alcohol intoxication is often defined as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of greater than 5.4\u201317.4\u00a0mmol/L (25\u201380\u00a0mg/dL or 0.025\u20130.080%). This can be measured by blood or breath testing. Alcohol is broken down in the human body at a rate of about 3.3\u00a0mmol/L (15\u00a0mg/dL) per hour, depending on an individual's metabolic rate (metabolism). The DSM-5 defines alcohol intoxication as at least one of the following symptoms that developed during or close after alcohol ingestion: slurred speech, incoordination, unsteady walking/movement, nystagmus (uncontrolled eye movement), attention or memory impairment, or near unconsciousness or coma.\nManagement of alcohol intoxication involves supportive care. Typically, this includes putting the person in the recovery position, keeping the person warm, and making sure breathing is sufficient. Gastric lavage and activated charcoal have not been found to be useful. Repeated assessments may be required to rule out other potential causes of a person's symptoms.\nAcute intoxication has been documented throughout history, and alcohol remains one of the world's most widespread recreational drugs. Some religions, such as Islam, consider alcohol intoxication to be a sin.\nSymptoms.\nAlcohol intoxication leads to negative health effects due to the recent drinking of large amount of ethanol (alcohol). When severe it may become a medical emergency. Some effects of alcohol intoxication, such as euphoria and lowered social inhibition, are central to alcohol's desirability.\nAs drinking increases, people become sleepy or fall into a stupor. At very high blood alcohol concentrations, for example, above 0.3%, the respiratory system becomes depressed and the person may stop breathing. Comatose patients may aspirate their vomit (resulting in vomitus in the lungs, which may cause \"drowning\" and later pneumonia if survived). CNS depression and impaired motor coordination, along with poor judgment, increase the likelihood of accidental injury occurring. It is estimated that about one-third of alcohol-related deaths are due to accidents, and another 14% are from intentional injury.\nIn addition to respiratory failure and accidents caused by its effects on the central nervous system, alcohol causes significant metabolic derangements. Hypoglycaemia occurs due to ethanol's inhibition of gluconeogenesis, especially in children, and may cause lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, and acute kidney injury. Metabolic acidosis is compounded by respiratory failure. Patients may also present with hypothermia.\nPathophysiology.\nAlcohol is metabolized by a normal liver at the rate of about 8 grams of pure ethanol per hour. 8 grams or is one British standard unit. An \"abnormal\" liver with conditions such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, gall bladder disease, and cancer is likely to result in a slower rate of metabolism.\nDiagnosis.\nAlcohol intoxication is described as a mental and behavioural disorder by the International Classification of Diseases. (ICD-10). Definitive diagnosis relies on a blood test for alcohol, usually performed as part of a toxicology screen. Law enforcement officers in the United States and other countries often use breathalyzer units and field sobriety tests as more convenient and rapid alternatives to blood tests. There are also various models of breathalyzer units that are available for consumer use. Because these may have varying reliability and may produce different results than the tests used for law-enforcement purposes, the results from such devices should be conservatively interpreted.\nMany informal intoxication tests exist, which, in general, are unreliable and not recommended as deterrents to excessive intoxication or as indicators of the safety of activities such as motor vehicle driving, heavy equipment operation, machine tool use, etc.\nFor determining whether someone is intoxicated by alcohol by some means other than a blood-alcohol test, it is necessary to rule out other conditions such as hypoglycemia, stroke, usage of other intoxicants, mental health issues, and so on. It is best if their behavior has been observed while the subject is sober to establish a baseline. Several well-known criteria can be used to establish a probable diagnosis. For a physician in the acute-treatment setting, acute alcohol intoxication can mimic other acute neurological disorders or is frequently combined with other recreational drugs that complicate diagnosis and treatment.\nManagement.\nAcute alcohol poisoning (an overdose of the drug) is a medical emergency due to the risk of death from respiratory depression or aspiration of vomit if vomiting occurs while the person is unresponsive. Emergency treatment strives to stabilize and maintain an open airway and sufficient breathing while waiting for the alcohol to metabolize. This can be done by removal of any vomit or, if the person is unconscious or has impaired gag reflex, intubation of the trachea.\nOther measures may include\nAdditional medication may be indicated for treatment of nausea, tremor, and anxiety.\nClinical findings.\nHospital admissions.\nAlcohol intoxication was found to be prevalent in clinical populations within the United States involving people treated for trauma and in the age group of people aged within their 18th\u201324th years (in a study of a group for the years 1999\u20132004). In the United States during the years 2010\u20132012, acute intoxication was found to be the direct cause of an average of 2,221 deaths, in the sample group of those aged within their 15th year or older. The same mortality route is thought to cause indirectly more than 30,000 deaths per year.\nPrognosis.\nA normal liver detoxifies the blood of alcohol over a period of time that depends on the initial level and the patient's overall physical condition. An abnormal liver will take longer but still succeeds, provided the alcohol does not cause liver failure.\nPeople who have drunk heavily for several days or weeks may have withdrawal symptoms after the acute intoxication has subsided.\nA person consuming a dangerous amount of alcohol persistently can develop memory blackouts and idiosyncratic intoxication or pathological drunkenness symptoms. Long-term persistent consumption of excessive amounts of alcohol can cause liver damage and have other deleterious health effects.\nSociety and culture.\nAlcohol intoxication is a risk factor in some cases of catastrophic injury, in particular for unsupervised recreational activity. A study in the province of Ontario based on epidemiological data from 1986, 1989, 1992, and 1995 states that 79.2% of the 2,154 catastrophic injuries recorded for the study were preventable, of which 346 (17%) involved alcohol consumption. The activities most commonly associated with alcohol-related catastrophic injury were snowmobiling (124), fishing (41), diving (40), boating (31) and canoeing (7), swimming (31), riding an all-terrain vehicle (24), and cycling (23). These events are often associated with unsupervised young males, often inexperienced in the activity, and may result in drowning. Alcohol use is also associated with unsafe sex.\nLegal issues.\nLaws on drunkenness vary. In the United States, it is a criminal offense for a person to be drunk while driving a motorized vehicle, except in Wisconsin, where it is only a fine for the first offense. It is also a criminal offense to fly an aircraft or (in some American states) to assemble or operate an amusement park ride while drunk. Similar laws also exist in the United Kingdom and most other countries.\nIn some jurisdictions, it is also an offense to serve alcohol to an already-intoxicated person, and, often, alcohol can only be sold by persons qualified to serve responsibly through alcohol server training.\nThe (BAC) for legal operation of a vehicle is typically measured as a percentage of a unit volume of blood. This percentage ranges from 0.00% in Romania and the United Arab Emirates; to 0.05% in Australia, South Africa, Germany, Scotland, and New Zealand (0.00% for underage individuals); to 0.08% in England and Wales, the United States and Canada.\nThe United States Federal Aviation Administration prohibits crew members from performing their duties within eight hours of consuming an alcoholic beverage, while under the influence of alcohol, or with a BAC greater than 0.04%.\nIn the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, public intoxication is a crime (also known as \"being drunk and disorderly\" or \"being drunk and incapable\").\nIn some countries, there are special facilities, sometimes known as \"drunk tanks\", for the temporary detention of persons found to be drunk.\nReligious views.\nSome religious groups permit the consumption of alcohol; some permit consumption but prohibit intoxication; others prohibit any amount of alcohol consumption altogether.\nChristianity.\nMost denominations of Christianity, such as Catholicism, Orthodoxy and Lutheranism, use wine as a part of the Eucharist (Holy Communion) and permit its consumption, but consider it sinful to become intoxicated.\nRomans 13:13\u201314, 1 Corinthians 6:9\u201311, Galatians 5:19\u201321 and Ephesians 5:18 are among a number of other Bible passages that speak against intoxication.\nSome Protestant Christian denominations prohibit the consumption of alcohol based upon biblical passages that condemn drunkenness, but others allow a moderate rate of consumption.\nIn the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, alcohol consumption is forbidden, and teetotalism has become a distinguishing feature of its members. Jehovah's Witnesses allow moderate alcohol consumption among its members.\nIslam.\nIn the Quran, there is a prohibition on the consumption of grape-based alcoholic beverages, and intoxication is considered an abomination in the hadith of Muhammad. The schools of thought of Islamic jurisprudence have interpreted this as a strict prohibition of the consumption of all types of alcohol and declared it to be \"haram\" (lit.\u2009'forbidden [in Islam]'), although other uses may be permitted.\nBuddhism.\nIn Buddhism, in general, the consumption of intoxicants is discouraged for both monastics and lay followers. Many Buddhists observe a basic code of ethics known as the five precepts, of which the fifth precept is an undertaking to refrain from the consumption of intoxicating substances (except for medical reasons). In the \"bodhisattva\" vows of the \"Brahmajala Sutra\", observed by Mahayana Buddhist communities, distribution of intoxicants is likewise discouraged, as well as consumption.\nHinduism.\nIn the Gaudiya Vaishnavism branch of Hinduism, one of the four regulative principles forbids the taking of intoxicants, including alcohol.\nJudaism.\nIn the Bible, the Book of Proverbs contains several chapters related to the negative effects of drunkenness and warns to stay away from intoxicating beverages. The Book of Genesis refers to the use of wine by Lot's daughters to rape him. The story of Samson in the Book of Judges tells of a monk from the Israelite tribe of Dan who, as a Nazirite, is prohibited from cutting his hair and drinking wine. warns against kings and other rulers drinking wine and similar alcoholic beverages, Proverbs 31:6\u20137 promotes giving such beverages to the perishing and wine to those whose lives are bitter as a coping mechanism against the likes of poverty and other troubles.\nIn Judaism, in accordance with the biblical stance against drinking, drinking wine is restricted for priests. The biblical command to sanctify the Sabbath and other holidays has been interpreted as having three ceremonial meals with wine or grape juice, known as \"Kiddush\". A number of Jewish marriage ceremonies end with the bride and groom drinking a shared cup of wine after reciting seven blessings; this occurs after a fasting day in some Ashkenazi traditions. It has been customary and in many cases even mandated to drink moderately so as to stay sober, and only after the prayers are over.\nDuring the Seder on Passover, there is an obligation to drink four ceremonial cups of wine while reciting the Haggadah. It has been assumed to be the source of the wine-drinking ritual at communion in some Christian groups. During Purim, there is an obligation to become intoxicated; however, as with many other decrees, this has been avoided in many communities by allowing sleep during the day as a replacement.\nDuring the U.S. Prohibition era in the 1920s, a rabbi from the Reform Judaism movement proposed using grape juice for the ritual instead of wine. Although refuted at first, the practice became widely accepted by orthodox Jews as well.\nOther animals.\nIn the film \"Animals Are Beautiful People\", an entire section was dedicated to showing many different animals, including monkeys, elephants, hogs, giraffes, and ostriches, eating over-ripe marula tree fruit, causing them to sway and lose their footing in a manner similar to human drunkenness. Birds may become intoxicated with fermented berries, and some die colliding with hard objects when flying under the influence.\nIn elephant warfare, practiced by the Greeks during the Maccabean revolt and by Hannibal during the Punic wars, it has been recorded that the elephants would be given wine before the attack, and only then would they charge forward after being agitated by their driver.\nIt is a regular practice to give small amounts of beer to race horses in Ireland. Ruminant farm animals have natural fermentation occurring in their stomach, and adding small quantities of alcoholic beverages to their water is generally harmless and will not cause them to become drunk.\nAlcoholic beverages are extremely harmful to dogs, and often for reasons of additives such as xylitol, an artificial sweetener in some mixers. Dogs can absorb ethyl alcohol in dangerous amounts through their skin as well as through drinking the liquid or consuming it in foods. Even fermenting bread dough can be dangerous to dogs. In 1999, one of the royal footmen for Britain's Queen Elizabeth II was demoted from Buckingham Palace due to his \"party trick\" of spiking the meals and drinks of the Queen's pet corgi dogs with alcohol which in turn would lead the dogs to run around drunk.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
