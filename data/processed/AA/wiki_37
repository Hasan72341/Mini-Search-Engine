{"id": "4391", "revid": "45121396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4391", "title": "Big Brother (franchise)", "text": "Dutch reality game show franchise\nBig Brother is a reality competition television franchise created by John de Mol Jr., first broadcast in the Netherlands in 1999 and subsequently syndicated internationally beginning in 2000. The show features contestants called \"housemates\" or \"HouseGuests\" who live together in a specially constructed house that is isolated from the outside world. The show has been cited as having had widespread influence on the status of television and celebrity.\nThe name is inspired by Big Brother from George Orwell's novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", and the housemates are continuously monitored during their stay in the house by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones. Throughout the course of the competition, they are voted out of the house (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the grand prize.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], there have been 508 seasons of \"Big Brother\" in over 63 franchise countries and regions. English-language editions of the program are often referred to by its initials \"BB\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPremise.\nAt regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to vote via telephone for the nominee they wish to be evicted or saved from eviction. The last person remaining is declared the winner.\nSome more recent editions have since included additional methods of voting, such as voting through social media and smartphone applications. Occasionally, non-standard votes occur, where two houseguests are evicted at once or no one is voted out. In the earlier series of \"Big Brother\", there were 10 contestants with evictions every two weeks. However, the British version introduced a larger number of contestants with weekly evictions. Most versions of \"Big Brother\" follow the weekly eviction format, broadcast over approximately three months for 16 contestants.\nThe contestants are required to do housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as \"Big Brother\"). The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit. In some countries, the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance (to buy food and other essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.\nHistory.\nName.\nThe term \"Big Brother\" originates from George Orwell's novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" with its theme of continuous oppressive surveillance.\nCreation.\nThe first version of \"Big Brother\" was broadcast in 1999 on Veronica in the Netherlands. In the first season of \"Big Brother\", the house was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture, and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a survivalist element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension. Nearly all later series provide a modern house for the contest with a Jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, loft, and other luxuries.\nInternational expansion.\nThe format has become an international TV franchise. While each country or region has its own variation, the common theme is that the contestants are confined to the house and have their every action recorded by cameras and microphones and that no contact with the outside world is permitted.\nMost international versions of the show remain quite similar: their main format remains true to the original fly on the wall observational style with an emphasis on human relationships, to the extent that contestants are usually forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy. In 2001, the American version adopted a different format since the second season, where the contestants are encouraged to strategize to advance in the game; in this format, the contestants themselves vote to evict each other and a jury of evicted contestants vote for the winner. Occasionally, individual game twists and format changes may allow for some viewer voting, usually to give a game advantage to the Housemates selected by the viewer vote. \"Big Brother Canada\", introduced in 2013, also follows the American format, while the Australian series also used an American-styled format when the series was rebooted in 2020, with the winner being decided by Australia's vote among the Finalist.\nOther international versions have included aspects of the American format. In 2011, the British version controversially adopted the discussion of nominations before reversing this rule after a poll by \"Big Brother\" broadcaster Channel 5.\nReception.\nOverview.\nFrom a sociological and demographic perspective, \"Big Brother\" allows an analysis of how people react when forced into close confinement with people outside of their comfort zone (having different opinions or ideals, or from a different socioeconomic group). The viewer has the opportunity to see how a person reacts from the outside (through the constant recording of their actions) and the inside (in the Diary or Confession Room). The Diary Room is where contestants can privately express their feelings about the game, strategy and the other contestants. The results range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes).\nIn 2011, Brazilian sociologist Silvia Viana Rodrigues wrote a thesis at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo analyzing reality shows as spectacles that proliferate rituals of suffering. She analyzes such rituals in various cultural products from Hollywood and Brazilian television, with special attention to \"Big Brother Brasil\". When investigating the openly eliminatory and cruel face of the game, Silvia Viana points out that such characteristics are liable to be entertainment with great and crucial public engagement because such processes of elimination, competition, exclusion, the affirmation of the war of all against all, of self-management and personal self-control through socio-emotional skills, entrepreneurship, the banality of evil, the naturalization of torture, the \"battle for survival\" logic and the incorporation of Nazi language and elements are already part of contemporary social life, especially in the context of work under neoliberalism. The thesis was later published as a book.\nThe show is notable for involving the Internet. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates during the evening (sometimes criticized by viewers and former contestants for heavy editing by producers), viewers can also watch a continuous feed from multiple cameras on the Web in most countries. These websites were successful, even after some national series began charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, WAP and SMS. The house is shown live on satellite television, although in some countries there is a 10\u201315 minutes delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people not participating in the program who have not consented to have personal information broadcast) to be removed.\nContestants occasionally develop sexual relationships; the level of sexual explicitness allowed to be shown in broadcast and Internet-feed varies according to the country's broadcasting standards.\nIsolation.\n\"Big Brother\" contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio, or the Internet. They are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). In most versions of the program, books and writing materials are also forbidden, although exceptions are sometimes made for religious materials such as the Bible, Tanakh or the Qur'an. Some versions ban all writing implements, even items that can be used to write (such as lipstick or eyeliner). Despite the housemates' isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.\nNews from the outside world may occasionally be given as a reward. Additionally, news of extraordinary events from the outside world may be given to the Housemates if such information is considered important, such notable past examples include that of national election results, (along with Housemates being able participate in said elections, for countries with compulsory voting) the September 11 attacks, and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nContestants have regularly scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day, the program's producer, in the \"Big Brother\" voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counselling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time and are often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.\nSeason 16 of the Australian adaption of \"Big Brother\" has the house located inside the Gold Coast theme park Dreamworld, allowing patrons on certain rides to see into the house garden, with some overhead yelling to the housemates. Previous series at Dreamworld had the house located outside the theme parks grounds, separating the housemates from park visitors.\nFormat changes and twists.\nRegional versions.\nDue to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations, various regional versions of \"Big Brother\" have been produced. Some countries have multiple franchises based on languag, for example, the United States has English- and Spanish-language versions of the show.\nTwists involving single franchises.\nMultiple areas and houses.\nIn 2001, \"Big Brother 3\" of the Netherlands introduced the \"Rich and Poor\" concept, in which the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half, and two teams of housemates compete for a place in the luxurious half. The Dutch version continued this concept to the end of its fourth season. Other versions later followed and introduced a similar concept, of which some have their own twists: Africa (in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013), Albania (in 2010), Australia (in 2003 and 2013), Balkan States (in VIP 2010 and 2011), Brazil (2009\u2013present), Canada (2013\u20132024), Denmark (in 2003), Finland (in 2009 and 2014), France (in 2009, 2011\u20132017), Germany (in 2003, 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2008, 2008\u201309 and since Celebrity 2014), Greece (in 2003), India (in 2012 and 2013), Israel (in 2009), Italy (in 2006 and 2007), Norway (in 2003), Philippines (in , and ), Poland (in 2002), Portugal (in VIP 2013 and 2016), Slovakia (in 2005), Slovenia (in 2008, 2015 and 2016), Scandinavia (in 2005), South Africa (in 2014), Spain (in VIP 2004, 2008, 2009\u201310 and 2010), United Kingdom (in 2002, Celebrity 2007, 2008, Celebrity 2013 and 2016), United States (2009\u2013present) and Tamil Nadu, India (2023\u201324)\nIn 2011\u201312, the seventh Argentine series added \"La Casa de al Lado\" (\"The House Next Door\"), a smaller, more luxurious house which served multiple functions. The first week it hosted 4 potential housemates, and the public voted for two of them to enter the main house. The second week, two pairs of twins competed in the same fashion, with only one pair allowed in. Later, the 3rd, 4th and 5th evicted contestants were given the choice of staying on their way out and they competed for the public's vote to reenter the house. Months later, after one of the contestants left the house voluntarily, the House Next Door reopened for four contestants who wanted to reenter and had not been in such a playoff before. The House Next Door was also used in other occasions to accommodate contestants from the main house for limited periods of time, especially to have more privacy (which of course could be seen by the public).\nThe ninth Brazilian season featured the \"Bubble\": a glass house in a shopping mall in Rio de Janeiro where four potential housemates lived for a week. Later in the season, a bubble was built inside the Big Brother house, with another two housemates living in it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled. The Glass House was reused in the eleventh season, featuring five evicted housemates competing for a chance to join the house again, and in the thirteenth season, with six potential housemates competing for two places in the main house. A dividing wall from the ninth season was reused in the fourteenth Brazilian season, when mothers and aunts of the housemates entered for International Women's Day and stayed in the house for 6 days, though they could not be seen by the housemates. Every season brings back the glass house. Some editions also featured an all-white panic room, where contestants were held until one of them decided to quit the show.\nIn the fourth English-Canadian season, two house guests were evicted and moved into a special suite where they were able to watch the remaining house guests. A week later, the houseguests were required to unanimously decide which of them to bring back into the house.\nEvil Big Brother.\nIn 2004, the fifth British series introduced a villainous \"Big Brother\" with harsher punishments, such as taking away prize money, more difficult tasks and secret tricks. This concept has also been used in Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, South America, Scandinavia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Philippines and Mexico.\nTwin or triplet housemates.\nIn 2004, the fifth American season introduced twins who were tasked with secretly switching back and forth in the house; they were allowed to play the game as individual house guests after succeeding at the deception for four weeks. This twist was reused in the seventeenth American season without the deception element \u2013 the pair simply needed to survive five weeks without being \"evicted\". HouseGuests who discovered this twist could use the twins to their strategic advantage.\nThis twin or triplet twist was used in several countries. Some made modifications to this twist; others have had twins in the house together without this element of secrecy. The following are the countries that have featured twins or triplets: Australia (in 2005), Germany (in 2005\u201306), Brazil (in 2006 and 2015), Bulgaria (in 2006, 2012 and VIP 2017), United Kingdom (in 2007, Celebrity 2011, Celebrity 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016 and Celebrity 2017), France (in 2007, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016), Spain (in 2007 and 2013), Poland (in 2007 and 2019), India (in 2008), Africa (in 2009), Balkan Region (in 2009 and 2013), Philippines (in , and ), Portugal (in 2010 and 2012), Israel (in 2011), Ukraine (in 2011), Argentina (in 2011 and 2016), Albania (in 2013, 2017, Celebrity 2021\u201322 and Celebrity 2022\u201323), Greece (in 2020) and Kosovo (in Celebrity 2022\u201323).\nPairs competitions.\nSeveral versions of the program feature variations of the housemates competing in pairs:\nSecret missions.\nSecret missions are a common element of the show since their introduction during the sixth British series. During these missions, one or more housemates are set a task from \"Big Brother\" with the reward of luxuries for the household and/or a personal reward if the task is successful. Some versions of \"Big Brother\" have secret tasks presented by another character who lives in plain sight of the housemate. Such characters include Marsha the Moose (from \"BB Canada\") and Surly the Fish (from \"BB Australia\").\nThe third Belgian season introduced a mole. This housemate was given secret missions by \"Big Brother\".\nThe sixth Australian season featured The Insider. Voted on by Australia, the Housemates deemed \"The Most Competitive\" had to complete secret missions tasked by Big Brother in order to win immunity from Nomination Voting and hence, Eviction. Failure in a mission would result in Automatic Nomination.\nThe eighth American season introduced \"America's Player\", where a selected house guest must complete various tasks (determined by public vote) in secret for the duration of their stay in the house in exchange for a cash reward. It was repeated in the tenth American season for a week. The eleventh American season featured Pandora's Box, in which the winning head of household was tempted to open a box, with unintended consequences for the house. The twelfth American season featured a saboteur, who entered the house to wreak havoc with tasks suggested by viewers. The sixteenth American season featured \"Team America\", in which 3 houseguests were selected to work as a team to complete tasks (determined by public voting) for a cash reward; this continued for the entire season despite the eviction of a team member.\nThe fourth Argentine series added a telephone in the living room. This telephone rang once a week for ten seconds, and the person to pick up the receiver was given an order or news from Big Brother (which typically no other housemate could hear). The order could be beneficial or detrimental, but a refused order resulted in the nomination for eviction. If nobody picked up the call, the whole house would be nominated for eviction.\nOpening night twists.\nSince \"Big Brother 2\", the British series has opened with a twist. This has included having potential Housemates being voted upon by the public for one to enter the house (\"Big Brother 2\" &amp; \"Big Brother 13\"); public voting for least-favourite housemates, with the housemates choosing between two nominees to evict (\"Big Brother 3\"); first-night nominations (\"Big Brother 4\" &amp; \"Big Brother 13\"); suitcase nominations (\"Big Brother 5\"); Unlucky Housemate 13 (\"Big Brother 6\"); Big Brother Hood (\"Big Brother 7\"); an all-female house and a set of twins as contestants (\"Big Brother 8\"); a couple entering as housemates, who must hide their relationship (\"Big Brother 9\"); housemates having to earn housemate status (\"Big Brother 10\", with an altered version of the twist appearing in \"Big Brother 21\"); a mole entering the house with an impossible task (\"Big Brother 11\"); Pamela Anderson entering as a guest for 5 days (\"Big Brother 12\"); a professional actor posing as a housemate and a mother and daughter as contestants (\"Big Brother 14\"); one contestant gets a pass to the final (\"Big Brother 15\"); first night eviction (\"Big Brother 16\"); two houses with \"the other house\" featuring enemies from the main house housemates past (\"Big Brother 17\"); Jackie Stallone entering a house containing her son's ex-wife Brigitte Nielsen (\"Celebrity Big Brother 3\"); a \"fake celebrity\" (a civilian contestant pretending to be a celebrity) in a celebrity edition (\"Celebrity Big Brother 4\"); a visit from Jade Goody's family (\"Celebrity Big Brother 5\") and unlocked bedrooms allowing housemates to immediately claim beds with the last housemate becoming the Head of House (\"Celebrity Big Brother 6\").\nA common opening twist is to introduce only a cast of a single sex on the premiere of the show while having members of the opposite sex introduced over the next few days. The eighth British series first used this twist with an initial all-female house, adding a male housemate two days later. The same twist was used in the fourth Bulgarian series, and an all-male premiere was used on \"Big Brother Africa 4\". The second Belgian season was used a similar twist in 2001, where eleven male housemates and one female housemate entered the house on launch night and the second female housemate entered the house on the third day.\nFake evictions.\nThe fifth British series introduced fake evictions, where Big Brother misleads housemates that eviction has taken place, only for the \"evicted\" housemate to reenter the house sometime later.\nIn the eighth British series, one housemate was evicted, interviewed and sent back into the house.\nIn the , four housemates were fake-evicted and stayed in a place called \"bodega\". In the second batch of the , four housemates were fake-evicted due to losing their duel challenge and temporarily stayed in a secret room. In the adult edition of the , two housemates, and later three more, were fake evicted after failing in two different \"Ligtask\" challenges and temporarily stayed in the task room until the end of their weekly task.\nThe concept of the fake-eviction was incorporated into the Australian series for the first time in the sixth Australian season, when housemates Camilla Severi and Anna Lind-Hansen were both fake-evicted in Day 8 and were moved into a secret room in the house, the Revenge Room. Severi and Lind-Hansen could see who nominated them for eviction and were given the opportunity to wreak havoc upon the house and those who nominated them by constructing extravagant tasks for the housemates to complete and for making mess in the house when they were not looking. Severi and Lind-Hansen returned to the house in a live special on Day 10. In the tenth Australian season, Benjamin Zabel was fake evicted for 24 hours before being returned to the house with immunity from eviction for that week. In the eleventh Australian season Travis Lunardi was fake-evicted and received advice from Benjamin Zabel for 24 hours; Travis returned to the house after a 3-day absence with immunity from eviction for that week.\nIn the thirteenth Brazilian series, Anamara Barreira was fake evicted. She was removed and put into a small private apartment without the other housemates knowing she was still in the house. After 24 hours, she returned to the house as Head of Household and with immunity from eviction that week. In the sixteenth Brazilian series, Ana Paula Renault was similarly fake evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 48 hours with immunity from eviction that week. In the eighteen Brazilian series, Gleici Damasceno was similarly fake evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 72 hours with immunity from eviction and with the power to put someone to eviction.\nIn the first Turkish series, there is a fake eviction in week 10.\nThe Indian version \"Bigg Boss\" sees frequent fake evictions. In \"Bigg Boss Kannada\" season 4, winner Pratham and co-contestant Malavika were kept in secret room after fake eviction for one week and they were both allowed in the Bigg Boss house.\nSimilarly, in \"Bigg Boss Kannada\" season 5, firstly Jaya Srinivasan and Sameer Acharya were put into the secret room after fake eviction for one week and then Sameer Acharya was allowed into the house, but Jaya Srinivasan was evicted from the secret room itself. In the same season, the runner up Divakar was put into the secret room after fake eviction for one week.\nCoaches.\nThe fourteenth American season had four house guests from past seasons return to coach twelve new house guests, playing for a separate prize of $100,000. However, in a reset twist, they opted to join the normal game alongside the other house guests.\nRed button.\nThe seventh Argentine series incorporated a red button into the Confession Room, which would sound an alarm throughout the house. This button was to be used when a contestant wanted to leave the house voluntarily, and the contestant would be given five minutes to leave the house. A red button is also used in \"Secret Story\" series, however, in this case whoever presses the button will try to guess someone's secret.\nLegacy rewards or penalties.\nIn \"\", evicted housemates were given the opportunity to choose if a \"ninja\" delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year, the eighth Australian series introduced the Housemate Hand Grenade, where an evicted housemate decided which remaining housemate received a penalty. A similar punishment used on \"Big Brother Africa\" was called the Molotov Cocktail, Dagger or Fuse.\nMost valuable player.\nThe fifteenth American season allowed viewers to vote for a house guest to be made M.V.P., who then secretly nominates a third houseguest for eviction (in addition to the two selected by the Head of Household).\nIn a further twist introduced part-way through the MVP twist, the viewers themselves decided who the third nominee would be, with the HouseGuests still thinking one of their own is the MVP. Like many such twists, this was ended halfway into the season as the pool of contestants shrank.\nMultiple heads of household.\nThe sixteenth and seventeenth American seasons featured two Heads of Household every week and had four houseguests nominated for eviction. There was also a \"Battle of the Block\" competition where the two sets of nominees competed to save themselves; the winning pair not only saved themselves but dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them, who was then vulnerable as a replacement nominee if a veto was used. It is also used in specific weeks in Brazil since \"Big Brother Brasil 16\" where the HOH's have to choose which HoH will get R$10,000 and who is the one that will win immunity.\nAmerica's Favorite HouseGuest.\nIn the American version, each season there are three cash prizes: $750,000 for the winner, $75,000 for second, and $50,000 for who was voted by the viewers to be America's Favorite HouseGuest.\nMultiple winners.\nIn 2011, \"Big Brother Africa\" season 6 was the first season of \"Big Brother\" to have two winners, each getting US$200,000.\nIn 2012, the four finalists from \"Gran Hermano 12+1\" (Spain) were given the chance to choose a formerly evicted housemate to be their partner. The companion of the winner became the \"+1 winner\" and received a secondary prize of \u20ac20,000.\nIn 2015, the , also had two winners; one from the and one from the . Each of which received PHP1,000,000.\n\"Bigg Boss 8\" (India) ended with a twist, where the top five contestants were crowned 'champions'. The season was extended by 35 days (total 135) as a spin-off called \"Bigg Boss Halla Bol\", where ex-contestants from previous seasons entered the house to compete with the five champions.\nReserve housemates.\nThe introduced the concept of having reserved housemates, those of whom are short-listed auditioners who were given a chance to be a housemate by completing tasks assigned by Big Brother. It was eventually done also in the where the reserved housemates were placed in a camp (a separate House but is just adjacent to the Main House) and that reserved housemate must compete amongst other reserved housemates while gaining points by participating in various tasks, including those that required the participation of doing such tasks outside of the Big Brother House premises. As the eviction was done weekly, once an official housemate is evicted from the Main House, the housemate(s) with the most points earned for that particular week crossovers to the Main House and becomes an official housemate.\nThese reserved housemates twist was also used in Argentina's seventh season and Brazil's ninth season.\n\"Big Brother Zoom\".\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the \"Big Brother Portugal\" revival started with a twist, where all the contestants were isolated in different apartments for 14 days, in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations. Cameras were filming them 24 hours a day as usual, and they were able to communicate with each other and host Cl\u00e1udio Ramos using tablets.\nTwists involving multiple franchises.\nHousemate exchanges.\nIn 2002, the Mexican and Spanish editions (BBM1 and GH3) made temporary housemate exchanges. Mexico's Eduardo Orozco swapped with Spain's Andr\u00e9s Barreiro for 7 days. In 2010, the first 2-housemate exchange was held by Spain and Italy (GH11 and GF10). Gerardo Prager and Saray Pereira from Spain were swapped with Carmela Gualtieri and Massimo Scattarella of Italy for 7 days.\nIn later years, several housemate exchanges were done around the world: Argentina (GH3) and Spain (GH4), Ecuador (GH1) and Mexico (BBM2), and Africa (BBA1) and United Kingdom (BB4) in 2003; Scandinavia (BB2) and Thailand (BBT2) in 2006; Philippines () and Slovenia (BB1), and Argentina (GH5) and Spain (GH9) in 2007; Africa (BBA3) and Finland (BB4) in 2008; Finland (BB5) and Philippines () in 2009; Finland (BB6) and Slovenia (BBS1) in 2010; Spain (GH12) and Israel (HH3) in 2010\u201311; Finland (BB7) and Norway (BB4) in 2011; Argentina (GH7) and Israel (HH4) in 2012; Mexico (BB4) and Spain (GH16) in 2015; and Spain (GHVIP5) and Brazil (BBB17) in 2017.\nEvicted housemate exchanges.\nIn 2003, Mexico's Isabel Madow (BB VIP2) and Spain's A\u00edda N\u00edzar (GH5) were swapped for 7 days. This twist was also done between Russia (BBR1) and Pacific (GHP1) in 2005, and Argentina (GH4) and Brazil (BBB7) in 2007.\nOther exchanges.\nIn 2009, as part of the casting process for Italy's GF9, Doroti Polito and Leonia Coccia visited Spain's GH10.\nIn 2012, four contestants from Denmark's BB4 visited Sweden's BB6 and competed in a Viking-themed challenge. The Danish team won and 'kidnapped' Swedish contestant Annica Englund to the Denmark house for the following week.\nIn 2012, evicted housemate Laisa Portella of Brazil (from BBB12) was a guest on Spain's \"Gran Hermano 13\" for a week; the following week, non-evicted Noem\u00ed Merino of GH13 stayed in the Brazilian Big Brother house for 5 days.\nIn 2016, \"Big Brother UK\" housemate Nikki Grahame and \"Big Brother Australia\" housemate Tim Dormer were voted in by Canada to be houseguests on the 4th season of \"Big Brother Canada\". Similarly, \"Big Brother UK\" housemate Jade Goody appeared as a housemate on the 2nd season of \"Bigg Boss Hindi\".\n\"Big Brother Australia\" (2015) contestant Priya Malik joined \"Bigg Boss 9\" (India) the same year as a wild card.\nIn 2017, GHVIP5 contestant Elettra Lamborghini visited Brazil's BBB17.\nIn 2019, the winner of Italy's GF15, Alberto Mezzetti visited Brazil's BBB19.\nIn 2022, Bindhu Madhavi, 4th Runner-up of \"Bigg Boss Tamil 2017\" made her entry as a contestant in a Telugu back to win spin-off named \"Bigg Boss Non-Stop\" and emerged as the winner of that show respectively.\nAfter winning the debut season of \"Bigg Boss Marathi\" (regional version of \"Big Brother\"), winner Megha Dhade made her entry in \"Bigg Boss\" season 12 as a wild card contestant.\nAfter winning season 2 of \"Bigg Boss Marathi\" (regional version of \"Big Brother\"), winner Shiv Thakare made her entry in \"Bigg Boss 16\".\nEvicted housemate visits.\nAnouska Golebiewski, an evicted housemate from the United Kingdom (housemate from BB4) visited Australia (BB3) in 2003. In 2005, United Kingdom (Nadia Almada of BB5) visited Australia (BB5) again. In 2006, United Kingdom (Chantelle Houghton of CBB4) visited Germany (BBG6). This twist was used in later years by other countries: Africa (Ricardo Ferreira of BBA3) visited Brazil (BBB9) in 2009; Germany (Annina Ucatis and Sascha Schwan of BBG9) visited the Philippines (), and Italy (George Leonard and Veronica Ciardi of GF10) visited Albania (BB3) in 2010; Sweden (Martin Granetoft and Peter OrrmyrSara Jonsson of BB5) visited Norway (BB4) in 2011; Brazil (Rafael Cordeiro of BBB12) visited Spain (GH12), and Argentina (Agust\u00edn Belforte of GH4) visited Colombia (GH2) in 2012; United States (Dan Gheesling of BB10/BB14) visited Canada (BB1 and the BB2 Jury) in 2013; Canada (Emmett Blois of BB1) visited South Africa (BBM3) in 2014; and Spain (Paula Gonzalez of GH15) visited Mexico (BBM4) in 2015.\nA similar event took place between the United States and Canada in 2014 wherein Rachel Reilly (from BB12/BB13) made a video chat to Canada (BB2). Rachel Reilly also appeared on \"Big Brother Canada\"'s side show, which airs after the eviction episode.\nHousemates competing in another country.\nThere were occasions that a former housemate from one franchise participated and competed in a different franchise: Daniela Martins of France (SS3) competed in Portugal (SS1); Daniel Mkongo of France (SS5) competed in Italy (GF12); Brigitte Nielsen of Denmark (BB VIP) competed in the United Kingdom (CBB3); Jade Goody of the United Kingdom (BB3, BB Panto, and CBB5) competed in India (BB2); Sava Radovi\u0107 of Germany (BB4) competed in the Balkan States (VB1); Nikola Nasteski of the Balkan States (VB4) competed in Bulgaria (BB All-Stars 1); \u017darko Stojanovi\u0107 of France (SS5) competed in the Balkan States (VB VIP5); \u017deljko Stojanovi\u0107 of France (SS5) competed in the Balkan States (VB VIP5); Kelly Baron of Brazil (BBB13) competed in Portugal (BB VIP); Lucy Diakovska of Bulgaria (VIP B4) competed in Germany (PBB1); Leila Ben Khalifa of Italy (GF6) competed in France (SS8); Priya Malik of Australia (BB11) competed in India (BB9); Tim Dormer of Australia (BB10) and Nikki Grahame of the United Kingdom (BB7, UBB) competed in Canada (BB4) after beating Jase Wirey of the United States (BB5, BB7) and Veronica Graf of Italy (GF13) in a public vote; Leonel Estev\u00e3o-Luto of Africa (BB4) competed in Angola &amp; Mozambique (); Frankie Grande of the United States (BB16) competed in the United Kingdom (CBB18); Fanny Rodrigues of Portugal (SS2) competed in France (SS10); and Tucha Anita of Angola (); Amor Romeira of Spain (GH9) competed in Portugal (SS6) and Alain Rochette of Spain (GH17) competed in France (SS11); Despite being American, Brandi Glanville competed first in the United Kingdom (CBB20) then later competed in first Celebrity series in the United States (CBB1); A\u00edda Nizar of Spain (GH5 and GHVIP5) competed in Italy (GF15); Ivana Icardi of Argentina (GH9) competed in Italy (GF16); Gianmarco Onestini of Italy (GF16) competed in Spain (GHVIP7); Michael Terlizzi of Italy (GF16) competed in Spain (GHVIP8); Heidi Baci of Italy (GF17) competed in Albania (BBVIP3).\nSpecial editions.\n\"Celebrity\" and \"VIP\" \"Big Brother\".\nThe \"Big Brother\" format has been adopted in some countries; the housemates are local celebrities, and the shows are called \"Celebrity Big Brother\" or \"Big Brother VIP\". In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version.\nVariations.\nThe 2006 Netherlands series was entitled \"Hotel Big Brother\". This variation introduced a group of celebrity hoteliers and a Big Boss, who run a hotel and collect money for charity without nominations, evictions or a winner.\nAnother variation appeared in the UK in early 2008, entitled \"\". Instead of being housemates the celebrities became Big Brother himself, creating tasks and holding nominations with the help of Big Brother. The housemates were considered by the producers \"Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary\" 18- to 21-year-olds. The prize for the winner of the series was \u00a350,000.\nIn 2009, \"VIP Brother 3 Bulgaria\" introduced the concept of celebrities competing for charitable causes, which changed each week. Housemates were sometimes allowed to leave the house to raise money for the charity. Ten out of Thirteen seasons of \"Bigg Boss\" (the Indian version of \"Big Brother\") have been celebrity-only seasons. The 10th season of \"Big Boss\" had celebrities put up against commoners, where a commoner ultimately won.\nAmerican format.\nThe American and Canadian versions of \"Big Brother\" differ from most global versions of the series. The American series began in 2000 with the original Dutch format\u2014i.e., housemates, or HouseGuests, as they are styled in the United States, nominating each other for eviction and the public voting on evictions and the eventual winner. But due to both poor ratings and the concurrent popularity of \"Survivor\", a gameplay-oriented format was introduced in the second season, with HouseGuests allowed to strategize, politic and collude to survive eviction, with the entire nomination and eviction process being determined by the HouseGuest themselves.\nEach week the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house, before voting off one of the HouseGuests during the eviction. The main elements of the format are as follows:\nBefore the sixteenth American season, HouseGuests competed in a Have/Have-Not challenge similar to the shopping tasks on \"Big Brother UK\" and other international editions. The winners become Haves and enjoy a full pantry of food, while Have-Nots, will be left with a staple diet of \"slop\" (fortified oatmeal), sleep in designated uncomfortable beds and take cold showers. In later seasons, the Haves &amp; Have-Nots are determined either by the HoH themself or by the results of the HoH Competition.\nWhen only two contestants remain, a jury formed of the most recently evicted HouseGuests (generally seven or nine) votes which of the two finalists wins the grand prize. Beginning in the fourth (2003) American season, jury members were sequestered off-site so that they would not be privy to the day-to-day goings-on in the house. (\"Celebrity Big Brother US\" does not sequester its jury members\u2014all evicted celebrity HouseGuests vote on the winner.). The final Head of Household competition is split into three parts; the winners of the first two rounds compete in the third and final round. Once only two HouseGuests remain, the members of the jury cast their votes for who should win the series.\nIn addition, American and Canadian \"Big Brother\" do not air a live launch show, as is customary in international editions\u2014by the time the network show and live online feeds begin airing, it is not uncommon for at least one HouseGuest to already have been evicted. Also, the North American editions currently air only three times a week, compared with daily or six days a week for the recently rebooted British franchise. As a result, the TV episodes focus primarily on the main events regarding the gameplay and house politics versus the day-to-day goings-on in the house; to see the latter, watching the live feeds is necessary.\nIn 2013, English-speaking Canada introduced its own version of the show on the cable channel Slice; the series moved to Global TV for its third (2015) season. The show followed the American format but with more elaborate twists and greater viewer participation in the game. Secret tasks were introduced, usually presented by the show's mascot, \"Marsha the Moose\"; also, as in most global franchises, Big Brother was a distinct character who interacted with the HouseGuests. The French Canadian version mostly followed the American/Anglophone Canadian format, but the public could evict a housemate on some occasions and decided the winner.\nThe 2020 revival of the \"Big Brother Australia\" series adopted a slightly altered version of the American format (having previously used the international format) while pre-recording the series months in advance. A \"Nomination Challenge\" is held to determine who holds the power to nominate for that round, with the winner naming three Nominations for Eviction. During each eviction, all Housemates (excluding the Nominating Housemate) vote to evict. There is no rule prohibiting individuals holding Nomination Power in consecutively between weeks and no Power of Veto is held. Additionally, the Australian public still decided the winner between the final 3.\n\"Big Brother Brasil\" combines the American/Canadian and international formats. Brazil votes on evictions and the winner, but housemates compete for HoH, Power of Immunity, and Power of Veto; there is also a weekly shopping competition. HoH nominates one housemate for eviction, while the rest of the house nominates a second housemate. The winner of the Power of Immunity competition gets to choose someone to be safe from nomination.\nThe pilot for \"Big Brother China\", which premiered exclusively online in 2015, had housemates voting on evictions but the public voting for the winner. A similar format was used for \"\", an online-only spin-off of the American series that ran in 2016.\nThe nineteenth series of \"Big Brother UK\" saw the adaption of the \"Game Changer\" competition which is very similar to the Power of Veto competition. The winner of this competition has the opportunity to save a nominee from eviction. Like the PoV, there are six people that play in the \"Game Changer\" competition. The process of how the contestants are chosen is different as the people who have been nominated play in the competition along with the richest housemate. If there are empty left in the competition, then the richest housemate hand picks who will playing in that weeks \"Game Changer\" competition. The winner of the competition, like the PoV, has the option to save housemate from eviction for the week or not use the power at all. Unlike the PoV however, if the winner does save someone then no replacement nominee was named leaving the remaining nominees up for eviction and facing the public vote.\nOther editions.\nThe \"Big Brother\" format has been otherwise modified in some countries:\nThere are also \"test runs\", with a group of celebrities (or journalists) living in the house for several days to test it. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before. These series have been televised in Argentina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, the Pacific region, the Philippines and Spain. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the American edition, it is used as a promotional tool.\nVersions.\nAs of none }}, \"Big Brother\" has produced 514 winners in over 63 franchises.\n&lt;section begin=\"Big Brother series\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 Currently airing\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 An upcoming season \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 Status unknown\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 No longer airing\n&lt;section end=\"Big Brother series\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0 Season currently being aired.\nCurrent series.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Big Brother: The Game\".\nOn 5 May 2020, Endemol Shine Group announced that an official \"Big Brother\" mobile game named \"Big Brother: The Game\" was being developed by Irish gaming company 9th Impact, with a worldwide release expected later that year. The game uses the American format, with competitions determining the Head of Household and Power of Veto holders, with an eviction cycle occurring each day. Players must form alliances with one another to stay in the game and advance to the next tier. Other users may spectate other games, but outside interference is strictly forbidden. Players were able to win up to $1,000,000 in prizes.\nA trial season took place in the Republic of Ireland during the summer of 2020. The player Aoife Cheung won a \u20ac5000 prize after surviving four evictions. The game was officially launched on 15 October 2020 worldwide for both iOS, Android devices and PC platforms.\nThe first season concluded on 29 July 2021 and was won by Amy Elizabeth, a 31-year-old special education teacher from Delaware who won a grand prize of $33,270.\nOn March 7, 2023, a third season of the game was announced to launch later that year on mobile and PC platforms, including Steam. The grand prize was stated to be for up to $1,000,000, with new features being added in response to fan feedback. However, no global third season took place, with a special British and Irish-only version launching to coincide with the show returning to ITV2 and ITVX, in an official partnership with the broadcaster. This version featured overhauled graphics, with Banijay announcing that previous games had reached 500K players.\nControversies.\nLegal.\nIn April 2000, Castaway, an independent production company, filed a lawsuit against John de Mol and Endemol for stealing the concepts of their own show called \"Survive!\", a reality television show where contestants are placed on a deserted island and have to take care of themselves alone. These contestants were also filmed by cameras around them. The court later dismissed the lawsuit filed by Castaway against de Mol and Endemol. The \"Survive!\" reality television format was later turned into \"Survivor\".\nIn 2000, the estate of George Orwell sued CBS Television and Endemol for copyright and trademark infringement, claiming that the program infringed on the Orwell novel \"1984\" and its trademarks. After a series of court rulings adverse to the defendants (CBS and Endemol), the case was settled for an undisclosed amount of money on the evening of the trial.\nSexual assault.\nThere have been three documented occurrences of possible rape happening during the show. In \"Big Brother South Africa\", a male housemate was accused of assaulting a fellow housemate while she was asleep. The pair were filmed kissing and cuddling in bed before the cameras moved away and the male housemate reportedly claimed to housemates the next day that he had intercourse with the contestant. However, the female housemate was apparently shocked by the claims and informed female housemates that she had not consented to have sex with him (under South African law, this act would be constituted as rape). This male housemate was expelled immediately after the allegations surfaced and was later arrested pending investigation, while the female housemate was removed from the house for her own protection and counselling. After this incident, the other housemates were warned not to attempt any further obscene actions, or they would be subject to a penalty of 43 years in prison and immediate expulsion from the house.\nIn \"Big Brother Brasil\", many viewers reported that they watched a male housemate allegedly force himself on a female housemate while she was passed-out drunk after a \"boozy party\". Soon after, the Federal Police of Brazil entered the house and arrested the offending housemate, who was later banned from ever appearing on the show again.\nAdditionally, an incident of sexual assault occurred in the Australian Big Brother house in 2006, during the show's sixth season. Contestant Michael \"John\" Bric held down fellow contestant Camilla Severi in her bed while a second man, Michael \"Ashley\" Cox, \"slapped\" her in the face with his penis, an indecent act illegal under Australian law. The incident was shown on the 'Adults-only' late-night segment, \"Big Brother: Adults Only\", leading to the show's cancellation. Both men involved in the incident were removed from the house.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The team compete in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system.\nFounded in 1894, the club competed in the Southern League and Western League, being crowned Western League champions in 1897\u201398. They were admitted into the Football League in 1901 and won the Second Division in 1905\u201306. They finished second in the First Division the following season, three points behind champions Newcastle United, and went on to lose to Manchester United in the 1909 FA Cup final. Relegated in 1911, they dropped to the third tier in 1922, though would claim the Third Division South title in 1922\u201323 and again in 1926\u201327. They were returned to the third tier in 1932, remaining there until they won the Third Division South again in 1954\u201355. Having been relegated in 1960, Bristol City won promotion from the third tier in 1964\u201365 and then from the second tier in 1975\u201376. They played four seasons in the top-flight before being relegated in three consecutive seasons by 1982.\nBristol City spent just two seasons in the Fourth Division and went on to win the Associate Members' Cup (Football League Trophy) in 1986. Promoted out of the Third Division in 1989\u201390, the club were relegated in 1995 and again in 1999 after another promotion in 1997\u201398. Bristol City won the Football League Trophy again in 2003, and were promoted from League One in 2006\u201307. Relegated after six seasons in the Championship, they won the Football League Trophy for a third time in 2015 on their way to the 2014\u201315 League One title, and have remained in the Championship since that promotion.\nThey have played their home games at Ashton Gate since moving from St John's Lane in 1904. The club's home colours are red and white, and their nickname is The Robins\u2014a robin featured on the club's badge from 1976 to 1994 and from 2019 onwards. Their main rivals are Bristol Rovers, with whom they contest the Bristol derby, and Cardiff City, with whom they contest the cross-border Severnside derby.\nHistory.\nEarly years and early successes (1894\u20131922).\nThe club was founded in 1894 as Bristol South End and changed their name to Bristol City on adopting professionalism three years later when they were admitted into the Southern League. Finishing as runners-up in three of the first four seasons, in 1900 the club amalgamated with local Southern League rivals Bedminster F.C., who had been founded as Southville in 1887. Bristol City joined the Football League in 1901 when they became only the third club south of Birmingham (following in the footsteps of Woolwich Arsenal and Luton Town) to perform in the competition. Their first game in the Football League was on 7 September 1901 at Bloomfield Road, when Blackpool were beaten 2\u20130.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA scheme has been informally approved by the parties interested for the amalgamation of the Bristol City and Bedminster Association Football Clubs. The leading conditions are that the name and colours of Bristol City shall be retained, that matches shall be played alternately on the ground of each club for one season, and that five directors shall be nominated by each club. This should lead to Bristol securing one of the strongest teams in the south.\n\"Gloucestershire Echo\", 12 April 1900. The announcement of the merger between Bristol City and Bedminster.\nWinning the Second Division Championship with a record number of points when they became the first club in Football League history to win 30 league games in a season (out of 38 played) as well as equalling Manchester United's achievement of the previous season in winning 14 consecutive games (a record until 2018, also accomplished by Preston North End in 1950\u201351). Nicknamed the Bristol Babe at this time, they finished as runners-up in their inaugural First Division campaign (1906\u201307) as the only southern club to finish in the top two prior to World War I.\nIn 1909 they won through to their only FA Cup final, though they were somewhat fortunate that a last-gasp spot-kick saved them from defeat in the semi-final versus Derby County at Stamford Bridge. In the final at the Crystal Palace (now the National Sports Centre) Bristol City lost to Manchester United 1\u20130. After a five-season stay in the top flight, despite winning 1\u20130 at Newcastle at the start of the 1910\u201311 campaign, failure to beat Everton in the season's finale brought City's first-ever taste of relegation and it was to be 65 years before top-flight status would be regained.\nBristol City would then go on to stay in Division 2 until three years after the First World War had ended, and in that time they reached the semi-finals of the 1919\u201320 FA Cup before being beaten 2\u20131 by Huddersfield Town and finished third in the Second Division in the 1920\u201321 season. However, in the next season they were relegated to the Third Division South.\nThe yo-yo era (1922\u201365).\nThe 1920s were a rocky time as City bounced between the Second Division and the Southern Section of the Third Division. The season after City were relegated, they achieved promotion back to the Second Division, before being relegated back to the Southern Section of the Third Division again the following season. After successive high finishes in the league, they were promoted again in 1926\u201327. However, by the 1930s they had slumped into the lower division and stayed that way until over 10 years after the Second World War. During this stay in the Third Division South, they won the Welsh Cup in 1934, beating Tranmere Rovers in the final. However, in the same year they also suffered their biggest ever league defeat, a 9\u20130 loss to Coventry City The 1937\u201338 season was the most successful season for City since they were relegated to the Third Division, coming second in the league and reaching the final of the Third Division South Cup, before losing 6\u20132 to Reading on aggregate. They then came eighth in the Third Division South in the final full season before the war, in which the Grandstand of Ashton Gate was destroyed by a German air raid.\nIn 1946\u201347, City recorded a record league win by beating Aldershot 9\u20130, although despite Don Clark scoring 36 goals in the League, City failed to get promoted that season. Harry Dolman became chairman in 1949, a post he would hold for over 30 years. An engineer who had bought out the firm he worked for, he designed the first set of floodlights installed at Ashton Gate in the early 1950s. The late 1950s were a better time for City, with a five-year stay in the Second Division, a league they returned to for a further spell in 1965.\nBack among the elite (1966\u201380).\nIn 1967, Alan Dicks was appointed manager, and things gradually began to improve, with promotion to the First Division in 1976, ending a 65-year exile from the top flight.\nBetween 1975 and 1981 City were regular participants in the Anglo-Scottish Cup, winning the trophy in 1977\u201378, beating Hibernian in the semi-finals, and winning 3\u20132 on aggregate in the final against St Mirren (managed at the time by a relatively new manager, Alex Ferguson). St Mirren had their revenge two seasons later, with an aggregate 5\u20131 victory over City to become the only Scottish team to win the trophy.\nCity's second stint in the top flight was less successful than the club's first, with thirteenth position in 1979 being their highest finish during this era. Stars of this era included Peter Cormack, Geoff Merrick, Tom Ritchie, Clive Whitehead, Gerry Gow, Trevor Tainton and Jimmy Mann.\nFinancial difficulties and revival (1980\u20132000).\nIn 1980, the City team went back to the Second Division in the first of three relegations, their debt mounted and their financial losses increased, with two successive relegations following. Thus, in 1982, they fell into the Fourth Division, and were declared bankrupt. A new club was formed and BCFC (1982) Ltd acquired the club's player contracts. The highly paid senior players Julian Marshall, Chris Garland, Jimmy Mann, Peter Aitken, Geoff Merrick, David Rodgers, Gerry Sweeney and Trevor Tainton, who became known as the 'Ashton Gate Eight', each accepted termination of his contract for half the amount due. The club's previous owners had failed to pay its debts to many local businesses. The resulting ill will towards the club made it difficult for the new owners to obtain credit.\nCity spent two seasons in the Fourth Division before winning promotion under Terry Cooper in 1984. They consolidated themselves in the Third Division during the latter part of the 1980s, and in 1990 Cooper's successor Joe Jordan achieved promotion as Third Division runners-up to local rivals Bristol Rovers.\nThere was a tragedy for the club, however, in that promotion campaign. In March 1990, two months before the club sealed promotion, striker Dean Horrix was killed in a car crash barely two weeks after joining the club, and having played three league games for them.\nJordan moved to Heart of Midlothian in September 1990, and his successor Jimmy Lumsden remained in charge for 18 months before making way for Denis Smith. Smith's first signing was the 20-year-old Arsenal striker Andy Cole. He was sold to Newcastle United in February 1993 and later played for Manchester United, where he collected five Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the European Cup.\nMeanwhile, City remained in the new Division One (no longer the Second Division after the creation of the Premier League in 1992) and Smith moved to Oxford United in November 1993. His successor was Russell Osman. In January 1994 Osman led City to a shock 1\u20130 victory over Liverpool at Anfield in a third round replay in the FA Cup, a result that would cause the Liverpool manager at the time, Graeme Souness, to resign. Osman was sacked within a year of taking charge.\nJoe Jordan was brought back to Ashton Gate in September 1994, but was unable to prevent relegation to Division Two.\nJordan remained at the helm for two seasons after City's relegation, but left in March 1997 after failing to get them back into Division One. Former Bristol Rovers manager John Ward took over, and achieved promotion in 1998 as Division Two runners-up. But City struggled back in Division One, and Ward stepped down in October 1998 to be succeeded by Benny Lennartsson, their first non-British manager. City were relegated in bottom place and Lennartsson was dismissed in favour of Gillingham's Tony Pulis, who lasted six months before leaving to take over at Portsmouth. During his time at Ashton Gate he was manager of perhaps the worst City side since the one that completed a hat-trick of successive relegations almost 20 years earlier.\nCoach Tony Fawthrop took over until the end of the season, when Danny Wilson was appointed. Wilson was arguably the most prominent manager to take charge of a City side since Denis Smith, as he had guided Barnsley to promotion to the Premier League in 1997 and Sheffield Wednesday to a 12th-place finish in 1999.\n21st century.\nIn the early 2000s Bristol City were regular Division Two play-off contenders during Wilson's spell as manager. They just missed out on the play-offs in 2002, finishing 7th. The following year, Wilson almost took them to automatic promotion, finishing 3rd and winning the Football League Trophy in Cardiff in 2003. The taste of the play-offs was bitter though, losing to rivals Cardiff City 1\u20130 on aggregate in the semi-final. In 2004, they finished in 3rd place again, and this time they reached the play-off final, but lost to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He was sacked within days and replaced by veteran player Brian Tinnion.\nCity just failed to make the play-offs in Tinnion's first season as manager, finishing seventh, and he stepped down in September 2005 after a poor start to the season. Yeovil Town manager Gary Johnson was recruited as his successor in September 2005. Johnson led Bristol City to a 9th-place finish.\nIn the 2006\u201307 season, Bristol City finally achieved the elusive promotion that had evaded them in their 8 years in the third tier. Promotion to the Championship was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 3\u20131 win against already relegated Rotherham United, securing the runners-up place in the division and resulting in automatic promotion.\nAfter a good start in the Championship, City established themselves as real contenders, sitting in 3rd place at Christmas. By the start of March, City were top of the Championship, making an improbable second successive promotion a possibility. However, a poor run ended City's chances of an automatic promotion place but qualified for the play-offs with a 4th-place finish, their highest finish since 1980. City overcame Crystal Palace 4\u20132 on aggregate to progress to the play-off final at Wembley Stadium, where they were beaten 1\u20130 by Hull City.\nAfter a poor start in the first half of the 2008\u201309 season, City recovered after Christmas, peaking at 4th place in late February. After a lot of draws, the season eventually petered out and City finished the season in tenth place. The 2009\u201310 season saw some good results in the autumn, but heavy defeats by local rivals Cardiff City (0\u20136) and Doncaster Rovers (2\u20135) in early 2010 led to much dissatisfaction amongst fans, and Johnson left the club on 18 March 2010. Assistant manager Keith Millen took charge as caretaker manager, and led a series of good results, resulting in a second successive tenth-place finish.\nSteve Coppell became manager in 2010 but resigned after just two matches. Longtime assistant manager Keith Millen was announced as Coppell's successor and City fell to a 15th-place finish in 2010\u201311. After a poor start to the 2011\u201312 season, Millen left the club in October 2011.\nDerek McInnes was appointed next, but after a promising start, City fell into the relegation zone, eventually surviving in 20th place, their worst since promotion in 2007. This steady decline would continue and after a poor start to the 2012\u201313 season, McInnes was sacked in January 2013 with City bottom of the Championship. He was replaced by Sean O'Driscoll, the club's fifth head coach in three years, but City were relegated to League One after six seasons in the Championship. O'Driscoll left with the team 22nd in League One.\nSteve Cotterill joined the club when Bristol City were second bottom of League One. Cotterill guided the club to a 12th-place finish. Bristol City were promoted back to the Championship after securing the League One title in 2014\u201315, their first league title since 1955. In their last home game, against Walsall, they finished the season with an 8\u20132 win. Bristol City finished the season with 99 points, the most points in a single season in the club's history, and 5 losses. In the same season, they also won the Football League Trophy after a win over Walsall, which finished 2\u20130 and their third league trophy, a record held by the club for having the most wins in that competition.\nDespite huge success in the previous season, the club struggled on their return to the second tier. Steve Cotterill was relieved of his duties in January 2016 after a poor run of form which had seen Bristol City slip to 22nd in the Championship table. Lee Johnson, former player and son of former manager, Gary Johnson, was appointed as Bristol City's new head coach on 6 February 2016. Bristol City eventually finished in 18th place.\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, City were only just able to accumulate enough points to ensure survival at the end of the season. Lee Johnson remained at the helm for the following season, again making a positive early start. At the midpoint of the season, after 24 league games, they sat second in the Championship, whilst also knocking out Premier League opposition in Watford, Stoke City, Crystal Palace and Manchester United to reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. However, City would eventually finish in 11th place.\nBristol City ended the 2018\u201319 season in 8th. The battle for the last play-off spot came down to the final day, before Derby County managed to win their final game and clinch it. From March to June, the 2019\u201320 season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite again challenging for the play-offs during the season, Johnson was sacked on 4 July 2020 after a run of just one win in 10 league matches. His long-time assistant, Dean Holden, was appointed as his replacement on 10 August 2020. After suffering six straight defeats in all competitions, Holden was dismissed on 16 February 2021 after just six months in charge. He was replaced by Nigel Pearson.\nOn 29 October 2023, Pearson was sacked with Bristol City 15th in the Championship following a run of 5 losses in 7 games. Despite the poor form, Pearson had overseen year on year points increases in his time at the club and many fans felt he had been undermined by a loss of key players such as Alex Scott and a lack of reinvestment in the playing squad. On 7 November 2023, Liam Manning was appointed as the new head coach of Bristol City, joining from Oxford United.\nCity ended the 2022\u201323 season in 11th place with 62 points, having also enjoyed some success in the FA Cup by knocking out West Ham in January after forcing a replay. In the 2024\u201325 season the club reached the play-offs for the first time in 17 years. This was largely due to strong home form, with City losing only three home games during the season. City went on to lose 6\u20130 on aggregate to Sheffield United in the play-off semi-final.\nOn 3 June 2025 it was announced that Manning would leave the club to manage Norwich City. On 19 June 2025 Gerhard Struber was appointed as the new head coach of Bristol City. \nClub identity.\nBristol City have played in red and white since the 1890s, occasionally also including black. The away kit is more variable. It is traditionally white, but has also featured black or yellow. Other colours featured have included green and a purple and lime combination, the latter of which has become a fan favourite.\nAbout halfway through the 2007\u201308 season Bristol City manager Gary Johnson said in an interview that he hoped the team could get the whole ground bouncing. City supporters took this rallying cry on board and began to sing \"Johnson says bounce around the ground\" to the tune of Yellow Submarine, while continually bouncing up and down. The first game at which it was sung was in an away match against Southampton at St Mary's Stadium, and it was also sung at away at Queen's Park Rangers in February. When Bristol City fans travelled to London to play Charlton Athletic on 4 March 2008, the visiting fans, using the rail network to return home, adapted the song to \"Bounce Around the Train\". Since then, it has become an often used chant at Ashton Gate stadium by the fans. It was also sometimes used by supporters of Gary Johnson's former side Northampton Town, primarily at away matches. When Gary Johnson's son, Lee Johnson returned to his former club in 2016 as their new manager, he stated that he wished to inherit the chant and keep the fans singing it.\nStadium.\nBristol City have played at Ashton Gate Stadium in the south-west of Bristol, just south of the River Avon, since moving from St John's Lane in 1904. The ground currently has an all-seated capacity of 27,000. It was the home of Bedminster until the 1900 merger, and the merged team played some games there the following season, but it did not become the permanent home of Bristol City until 1904.\nIn the past plans were considered for expansion work to be carried out at Ashton Gate. There were also proposals to build a new 36,000-seat stadium at Hengrove Park. This was turned down in a local referendum in December 2000. In 2002, the local council was looking at possible sites for a new 40,000-seat stadium which would house both City, Rovers and Bristol Rugby, but these plans were scrapped and it is widely accepted that this would not have been welcomed by the majority of supporters from all clubs. Ashton Gate's current capacity is an average size for Championship grounds; however, in November 2007 the club announced plans to relocate to a new 30,000-capacity stadium in Ashton Vale. Plans were also in place to increase capacity to 42,000 had England's 2018 World Cup bid been successful.\nThe South stand opened for the 2015\u201316 season, with the existing Williams stand being demolished and replaced by the Lansdown stand in 2016. A new partly-artificial Desso pitch was laid and the current Dolman stand refurbished. A safe standing area was added to the south-east corner of the ground (roughly analogous to the old East End) in 2021.\nA state-of-the-art training facility became operational in 2020. The Robins High Performance Centre is at Failand a short distance from Ashton Gate Stadium.\nRivalries.\nBristol City's traditional rivals are Bristol Rovers. The clubs have met 105 times, with the first meeting in 1897. Bristol City have the most wins on 43. However, the clubs have not been in the same league for a number of years; they were last in the same division in the 2000\u201301 season. Since then, they have only met three times; in the two-legged southern final of the 2006\u201307 Football League Trophy, which Rovers won 1\u20130 on aggregate, and in the first round of the 2013\u201314 Johnstone's Paint Trophy, which City won 2\u20131 at Ashton Gate.\nCity's other main rivals are Cardiff City, who play in nearby Cardiff. Despite being a local derby, it crosses the Wales\u2013England border, making it one of the few international club derbies in the United Kingdom. The two clubs have been at similar levels in recent years, being in the same division for 15 of the last 18 seasons. This has meant frequent meetings in the league including in the semi-finals of the 2003 Second Division play-offs. The biggest defeat in the Derby came in 2010 when Cardiff beat Bristol by 6 goals to 0.\nOther clubs have been seen as 'third rivals' by the fans and media. Swindon Town are seen by many as rivals, nicknamed 'Swindle' by City fans. This rivalry was most recently relevant in the 2014\u201315 season, when the two clubs were rivals for promotion to the Championship. Plymouth Argyle have also previously been considered rivals despite a distance of over 100 miles. The rivalry was especially relevant in the 2000s when the two clubs were the highest-ranking West Country clubs for a number of years, and meetings were seen as a decider of the 'Best in the West'. Swansea City, Newport County, Cheltenham Town and even Yeovil Town have previously been mentioned as rivals, but very rarely. However, during a fixture between Bristol City and Swansea City on 2 February 2019 at Ashton Gate, fighting took place between Bristol City and Swansea City fans resulting in a rivalry flaring up between the two sets of fans.\nRecords and statistics.\nLeague history.\nSource:\nNote: The numbers in parentheses are the level of football for that season.\nMost appearances.\nMost club appearances including substitute appearances in all competitions (excluding Gloucestershire Cup).

{"id": "4393", "revid": "49402000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4393", "title": "Bioterrorism", "text": "Terrorism involving biological agents\nBioterrorism is terrorism involving the intentional release or dissemination of biological agents. These agents include bacteria, viruses, insects, fungi, and/or their toxins, and may be in a naturally occurring or a human-modified form, in much the same way as in biological warfare. Further, modern agribusiness is vulnerable to attacks by terrorists, and such attacks can seriously damage economy as well as consumer confidence. The latter destructive activity is called agrobioterrorism and is a subtype of agro-terrorism.\nDefinition.\nBioterrorism agents are typically found in nature, but could be mutated or altered to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or in food. Biological agents are attractive to terrorists because they are extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the smallpox virus, can be spread from person to person and some, like anthrax, cannot. \nBioterrorism may be favored because biological agents are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain, can be easily disseminated, and can cause widespread fear and panic beyond the actual physical damage. Military leaders, however, have learned that, as a military asset, bioterrorism has some important limitations; it is difficult to use a bioweapon in a way that only affects the enemy and not friendly forces. A biological weapon is useful to terrorists mainly as a method of creating mass panic and disruption to a state or a country. However, technologists such as Bill Joy have warned of the potential power which genetic engineering might place in the hands of future bio-terrorists.\nThe use of agents that do not cause harm to humans, but disrupt the economy, have also been discussed. One such pathogen is the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus, which is capable of causing widespread economic damage and public concern (as witnessed in the 2001 and 2007 FMD outbreaks in the UK), while having almost no capacity to infect humans.\nHistory.\nBy the time World War I began, attempts to use anthrax were directed at animal populations. This generally proved to be ineffective.\nShortly after the start of World War I, Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in the United States, Russia, Romania, and France. At that time, Anton Dilger lived in Germany, but in 1915 he was sent to the United States carrying cultures of glanders, a virulent disease of horses and mules. Dilger set up a laboratory in his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland. He used stevedores working the docks in Baltimore to infect horses with glanders while they were waiting to be shipped to Britain. Dilger was under suspicion as being a German agent, but was never arrested. Dilger eventually fled to Madrid, Spain, where he died during the Influenza Pandemic of 1918. In 1916, the Russians arrested a German agent with similar intentions. Germany and its allies infected French cavalry horses and many of Russia's mules and horses on the Eastern Front. These actions hindered artillery and troop movements, as well as supply convoys.\nIn 1972, police in Chicago arrested two college students, Allen Schwander and Stephen Pera, who had planned to poison the city's water supply with typhoid and other bacteria. Schwander had founded a terrorist group, \"R.I.S.E.\", while Pera collected and grew cultures from the hospital where he worked. The two men fled to Cuba after being released on bail. Schwander died of natural causes in 1974, while Pera returned to the U.S. in 1975 and was put on probation.\nIn 1979, anthrax spores killed around 66 people after the spores were unintentionally released from a military lab near Sverdlovsk, Russia. This occurrence of inhalational anthrax had provided a majority of the knowledge scientists understand about clinical anthrax. Soviet officials and physicians claimed the epidemic was produced by the consumption of infected game meat, but further investigation proves the source of infection were the inhaled spores. There is continued discussion about the intentionality of the epidemic and some speculate it was calculated by the Soviet government. \nIn 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the eradication of smallpox, a highly contagious and incurable disease. Although the disease has been eliminated in the wild, frozen stocks of smallpox virus are still maintained by the governments of the United States and Russia. Disastrous consequences are feared if rogue politicians or terrorists were to get hold of the smallpox strains. Since vaccination programs are now terminated, the world population is more susceptible to smallpox than ever before.\nIn Oregon in 1984, followers of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh attempted to control a local election by incapacitating the local population. They infected salad bars in 10 restaurants, produce in grocery stores, doorknobs, and other public domains with \"Salmonella typhimurium\" bacteria in the city of The Dalles, Oregon. The attack infected 751 people with severe food poisoning and hospitalized 45 of them. There were no fatalities. This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the 20th century. It was also the single largest bioterrorism attack on U.S. soil.\nIn June 1993, the religious group Aum Shinrikyo released anthrax in Tokyo. Eyewitnesses reported a foul odor. The attack was a failure, because it did not infect a single person. The reason for this is due to the fact that the group used the vaccine strain of the bacterium. The spores which were recovered from the site of the attack showed that they were identical to an anthrax vaccine strain that was given to animals at the time. These vaccine strains are missing the genes that cause a symptomatic response.\nIn September and October 2001, several cases of anthrax broke out in the United States, apparently deliberately caused. Letters laced with infectious anthrax were concurrently delivered to news media offices and the U.S. Congress. The letters killed five people.\nScenarios.\nThere are multiple considerable scenarios, how terrorists might employ biological agents. In 2000, tests conducted by various US agencies showed that indoor attacks in densely populated spaces are much more serious than outdoor attacks. Such enclosed spaces are large buildings, trains, indoor arenas, theaters, malls, tunnels and similar. Contra-measures against such scenarios are building architecture and ventilation systems engineering. In 1993, sewage was spilled out into a river, subsequently drawn into the water system and affected 400,000 people in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The disease-causing organism was cryptosporidium parvum. This man-made disaster can be a template for a terrorist scenario. Nevertheless, terrorist scenarios are considered more likely near the points of delivery than at the water sources before the water treatment. Release of biological agents is more likely for a single building or a neighborhood. Counter-measures against this scenario include the further limitation of access to the water supply systems, tunnels, and infrastructure. Agricultural crop-duster flights might be misused as delivery devices for biological agents as well. Counter-measures against this scenario are background checks of employees of crop-dusting companies and surveillance procedures.\nIn the most common hoax scenario, no biological agents are employed. For instance, an envelope with powder in it that says, \u201cYou've just been exposed to anthrax.\u201d Such hoaxes have been shown to have a large psychological impact on the population.\nAnti-agriculture attacks are considered to require relatively little expertise and technology. Biological agents that attack livestock, fish, vegetation, and crops are mostly not contagious to humans and are therefore easier for attackers to handle. Even a few cases of infection can disrupt a country's agricultural production and exports for months, as evidenced by FMD outbreaks.\nTypes of agents.\nUnder current United States law, bio-agents which have been declared by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or the U.S. Department of Agriculture to have the \"potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety\" are officially defined as \"select agents.\" The CDC categorizes these agents (A, B or C) and administers the Select Agent Program, which regulates the laboratories which may possess, use, or transfer select agents within the United States. As with US attempts to categorize harmful recreational drugs, designer viruses are not yet categorized and avian H5N1 has been shown to achieve high mortality and human-communication in a laboratory setting.\nCategory A.\nThese high-priority agents pose a risk to national security, can be easily transmitted and disseminated, result in high mortality, have potential major public health impact, may cause public panic, or require special action for public health preparedness.\nCategory B.\nCategory B agents are moderately easy to disseminate and have low mortality rates.\nCategory C.\nCategory C agents are emerging pathogens that might be engineered for mass dissemination because of their availability, ease of production and dissemination, high mortality rate, or ability to cause a major health impact.\nPlanning and monitoring.\nPlanning may involve the development of biological identification systems. Until recently in the United States, most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than ordinary people in cities. Financial cutbacks have limited the tracking of disease outbreaks. Some outbreaks, such as food poisoning due to \"E. coli\" or \"Salmonella\", could be of either natural or deliberate origin.\nGlobal defense strategies have also been put into place including the introduction of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in 1975. A majority of countries across the globe participated in the conventions (144) but a handful chose not to take part in the defense. Many of the countries who opted out of the convention are located in the Middle East and former Soviet Union countries.\nPreparedness.\nExport controls on biological agents are not applied uniformly, providing terrorists a route for acquisition. Laboratories are working on advanced detection systems to provide early warning, identify contaminated areas and populations at risk, and to facilitate prompt treatment. Methods for predicting the use of biological agents in urban areas as well as assessing the area for the hazards associated with a biological attack are being established in major cities. In addition, forensic technologies are working on identifying biological agents, their geographical origins and/or their initial source. Efforts include decontamination technologies to restore facilities without causing additional environmental concerns.\nEarly detection and rapid response to bioterrorism depend on close cooperation between public health authorities and law enforcement; however, such cooperation is lacking. National detection assets and vaccine stockpiles are not useful if local and state officials do not have access to them.\nAspects of protection against bioterrorism in the United States include:\nOn a CNN news broadcast in 2011, the CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, weighed in on the American government's recent approach to bioterrorist threats. He explains how, even though the United States would be better fending off bioterrorist attacks now than they would be a decade ago, the amount of money available to fight bioterrorism over the last three years has begun to decrease. Looking at a detailed report that examined the funding decrease for bioterrorism in fifty-one American cities, Dr. Gupta stated that the cities \"wouldn't be able to distribute vaccines as well\" and \"wouldn't be able to track viruses.\" He also said that film portrayals of global pandemics, such as \"Contagion\", were actually quite possible and may occur in the United States under the right conditions.\nA news broadcast by MSNBC in 2010 also stressed the low levels of bioterrorism preparedness in the United States. The broadcast stated that a bipartisan report gave the Obama administration a failing grade for its efforts to respond to a bioterrorist attack. The news broadcast invited the former New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, to explain how the government would fare in combating such an attack. He said how \"biological and chemical weapons are probable and relatively easy to disperse.\" Furthermore, Safir thought that efficiency in bioterrorism preparedness is not necessarily a question of money, but is instead dependent on putting resources in the right places. The broadcast suggested that the nation was not ready for something more serious.\nIn a September 2016 interview conducted by Homeland Preparedness News, Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher for the RAND Corporation, stresses the importance in preparing for potential bioterrorist attacks on the nation. He implored the U.S. government to take the proper and necessary actions to implement a strategic plan of action to save as many lives as possible and to safeguard against potential chaos and confusion. He believes that because there have been no significant instances of bioterrorism since the anthrax attacks in 2001, the government has allowed itself to become complacent making the country that much more vulnerable to unsuspecting attacks, thereby further endangering the lives of U.S. citizens.\nGerstein formerly served in the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2014. He claims there has not been a serious plan of action since 2004 during George W. Bush's presidency, in which he issued a Homeland Security directive delegating responsibilities among various federal agencies. He also stated that the blatant mishandling of the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014 attested to the government's lack of preparation. This past May, legislation that would create a national defense strategy was introduced in the Senate, coinciding with the timing of ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups get closer to weaponizing biological agents. In May 2016, Kenyan officials apprehended two members of an Islamic extremist group in motion to set off a biological bomb containing anthrax. Mohammed Abdi Ali, the believed leader of the group, who was a medical intern, was arrested along with his wife, a medical student. The two were caught just before carrying out their plan. The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, which comprises a group of experts on national security and government officials, in which Gerstein had previously testified to, submitted its National Blueprint for Biodefense to Congress in October 2015 listing their recommendations for devising an effective plan.\nBill Gates said in a February 18, 2017 \"Business Insider\" op-ed (published near the time of his Munich Security Conference speech) that it is possible for an airborne pathogen to kill at least 30\u00a0million people over the course of a year. In a \"New York Times\" report, the Gates Foundation predicted that a modern outbreak similar to the Spanish Influenza pandemic (which killed between 50\u00a0million and 100\u00a0million people) could end up killing more than 360\u00a0million people worldwide, even considering widespread availability of vaccines and other healthcare tools. The report cited increased globalization, rapid international air travel, and urbanization as increased reasons for concern. In a March 9, 2017, interview with CNBC, former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman, who was co-chair of the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, said a worldwide pandemic could end the lives of more people than a nuclear war. Lieberman also expressed worry that a terrorist group like ISIS could develop a synthetic influenza strain and introduce it to the world to kill civilians. In July 2017, Robert C. Hutchinson, former agent at the Department of Homeland Security, called for a \"whole-of-government\" response to the next global health threat, which he described as including strict security procedures at our borders and proper execution of government preparedness plans.\nAlso, novel approaches in biotechnology, such as synthetic biology, could be used in the future to design new types of biological warfare agents. Special attention has to be laid on future experiments (of concern) that:\nMost of the biosecurity concerns in synthetic biology, however, are focused on the role of DNA synthesis and the risk of producing genetic material of lethal viruses (e.g. 1918 Spanish flu, polio) in the lab. The CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a promising technique for gene editing. It was hailed by The Washington Post as \"the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly 30 years.\" While other methods take months or years to edit gene sequences, CRISPR speeds that time up to weeks. However, due to its ease of use and accessibility, it has raised a number of ethical concerns, especially surrounding its use in the biohacking space.\nBiosurveillance.\nIn 1999, the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Biomedical Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance). RODS is designed to collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other systems like it, collect data from sources including clinic data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the codirector of the RODS laboratory, and Ron Aryel, a subcontractor, conceived the idea of obtaining live data feeds from \"non-traditional\" (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nationwide.\nOn February 5, 2002, George W. Bush visited the RODS laboratory and used it as a model for a $300 million spending proposal to equip all 50 states with biosurveillance systems. In a speech delivered at the nearby Masonic temple, Bush compared the RODS system to a modern \"DEW\" line (referring to the Cold War ballistic missile early warning system).\nThe principles and practices of biosurveillance, a new interdisciplinary science, were defined and described in the \"Handbook of Biosurveillance\", edited by Michael Wagner, Andrew Moore and Ron Aryel, and published in 2006. Biosurveillance is the science of real-time disease outbreak detection. Its principles apply to both natural and man-made epidemics (bioterrorism).\nData which potentially could assist in early detection of a bioterrorism event include many categories of information. Health-related data such as that from hospital computer systems, clinical laboratories, electronic health record systems, medical examiner record-keeping systems, 911 call center computers, and veterinary medical record systems could be of help; researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by ranching and feedlot operations, food processors, drinking water systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others.\nIn Europe, disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on the continent-wide scale needed to track a biological emergency. The system not only monitors infected persons, but attempts to discern the origin of the outbreak.\nResearchers have experimented with devices to detect the existence of a threat:\nSome research shows that ultraviolet avalanche photodiodes offer the high gain, reliability and robustness needed to detect anthrax and other bioterrorism agents in the air. The fabrication methods and device characteristics were described at the 50th Electronic Materials Conference in Santa Barbara on June 25, 2008. Details of the photodiodes were also published in the February 14, 2008, issue of the journal Electronics Letters and the November 2007 issue of the journal IEEE Photonics Technology Letters.\nThe United States Department of Defense conducts global biosurveillance through several programs, including the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System.\nAnother powerful tool developed within New York City for use in countering bioterrorism is the development of the New York City Syndromic Surveillance System. This system is essentially a way of tracking disease progression throughout New York City, and was developed by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The system works by tracking the symptoms of those taken into the emergency department\u2014based on the location of the hospital to which they are taken and their home address\u2014and assessing any patterns in symptoms. These established trends can then be observed by medical epidemiologists to determine if there are any disease outbreaks in any particular locales; maps of disease prevalence can then be created rather easily. This is an obviously beneficial tool in fighting bioterrorism as it provides a means through which such attacks could be discovered in their nascence; assuming bioterrorist attacks result in similar symptoms across the board, this strategy allows New York City to respond immediately to any bioterrorist threats that they may face with some level of alacrity.\nResponse to bioterrorism incident or threat.\nGovernment agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials and decontamination units, and emergency medical units, if available.\nThe US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the United States Marine Corps' Chemical Biological Incident Response Force and the U.S. Army's 20th Support Command (CBRNE), which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and decontaminate victims exposed to bioterror agents. US response would include the Centers for Disease Control.\nHistorically, governments and authorities have relied on quarantines to protect their populations. International bodies such as the World Health Organization already devote some of their resources to monitoring epidemics and have served clearing-house roles in historical epidemics.\nMedia attention toward the seriousness of biological attacks increased in 2013 to 2014. In July 2013, \"Forbes\" published an article with the title \"Bioterrorism: A Dirty Little Threat With Huge Potential Consequences.\" In November 2013, Fox News reported on a new strain of botulism, saying that the Centers for Disease and Control lists botulism as one of two agents that have \"the highest risks of mortality and morbidity\", noting that there is no antidote for botulism. \"USA Today\" reported that the U.S. military in November was trying to develop a vaccine for troops from the bacteria that cause the disease Q fever, an agent the military once used as a biological weapon. In February 2014, the former special assistant and senior director for biodefense policy to President George W. Bush called the bioterrorism risk imminent and uncertain and Congressman Bill Pascrell called for increasing federal measures against bioterrorism as a \"matter of life or death.\" \"The New York Times\" wrote a story saying the United States would spend $40\u00a0million to help certain low and middle-income countries deal with the threats of bioterrorism and infectious diseases.\nBioterrorism can additionally harm the psychological aspect of victims and the general public. Victims exposed to biological weapons have shown an increased presence of clinical anxiety compared to the normal population. \nBill Gates has warned that bioterrorism could kill more people than nuclear war.\nIn February 2018, a CNN employee discovered on an airplane a \"sensitive, top-secret document in the seatback pouch explaining how the Department of Homeland Security would respond to a bioterrorism attack at the Super Bowl.\"\n2017 U.S. budget proposal affecting bioterrorism programs.\nPresident Donald Trump promoted his first budget around keeping America safe. However, one aspect of defense would receive less money: \"protecting the nation from deadly pathogens, man-made or natural,\" according to \"The New York Times\". Agencies tasked with biosecurity get a decrease in funding under the Administration's budget proposal.\nFor example:\n\"The next weapon of mass destruction may not be a bomb,\" Lawrence O. Gostin, the director of the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights, told \"The New York Times\". \"It may be a tiny pathogen that you can't see, smell or taste, and by the time we discover it, it'll be too late.\"\nLack of international standards on public health experiments.\nTom Inglesy, the CEO and director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and an internationally recognized expert on public health preparedness, pandemic and emerging infectious disease said in 2017 that the lack of an internationally standardized approval process that could be used to guide countries in conducting public health experiments for resurrecting a disease that has already been eradicated increases the risk that the disease could be used in bioterrorism.

It is often referred to as a \"stealth bomber\".\nA subsonic flying wing and lambda wing with a crew of two, the B-2 was designed by Northrop (later Northrop Grumman) as the prime contractor, with Boeing, Hughes Aircraft Company, and Vought as principal subcontractors. It was produced from 1988 to 2000. The bomber can drop conventional and thermonuclear weapons, such as up to eighty Mk 82 JDAM GPS-guided bombs, or sixteen B83 nuclear bombs. The B-2 is the only acknowledged in-service aircraft that can carry large air-to-surface standoff weapons in a stealth configuration.\nDevelopment began under the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) project during the Carter administration, which cancelled the Mach 2-capable B-1A bomber in part because the ATB showed such promise, but development difficulties delayed progress and drove up costs. Ultimately, the program produced 21 B-2s at an average cost of $2.13\u00a0billion each (~$\u00a0billion in 2024 dollars), including development, engineering, testing, production, and procurement. Building each aircraft cost an average of US$737\u00a0million, while total procurement costs (including production, spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support) averaged $929\u00a0million (~$ in 2024 dollars) per plane. The project's considerable capital and operating costs made it controversial in the U.S. Congress even before the winding down of the Cold War dramatically reduced the desire for a stealth aircraft designed to strike deep in Soviet territory. Consequently, in the late 1980s and 1990s lawmakers shrank the planned purchase of 132 bombers to 21.\nThe B-2 can perform attack missions at altitudes of up to ; it has an unrefueled range of more than and can fly more than with one midair refueling. It entered service in 1997 as the second aircraft designed with advanced stealth technology, after the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk attack aircraft. Primarily designed as a nuclear bomber, the B-2 was first used in combat to drop conventional, non-nuclear ordnance in the Kosovo War in 1999. It was later used in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and Iran.\nThe United States Air Force has nineteen B-2s in service as of 2024. One was destroyed in a 2008 crash, and another was likely retired from service after being damaged in a crash in 2022. The Air Force plans to operate the B-2s until 2032, when the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider is to replace them.\nDevelopment.\nOrigins.\nBy the mid-1970s, military aircraft designers had learned of a new method to avoid missiles and interceptors, known today as \"stealth\". The concept was to build an aircraft with an airframe that deflected or absorbed radar signals so that little was reflected back to the radar unit. An aircraft having radar stealth characteristics would be able to fly nearly undetected and could be attacked only by weapons and systems not relying on radar. Although other detection measures existed, such as human observation, infrared scanners, and acoustic locators, their relatively short detection range or poorly developed technology allowed most aircraft to fly undetected, or at least untracked, especially at night.\nIn 1974, DARPA requested information from U.S. aviation firms about the largest radar cross-section of an aircraft that would remain effectively invisible to radars. Initially, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas were selected for further development. Lockheed had experience in this field with the development of the Lockheed A-12 and SR-71, which included several stealthy features, notably its canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall surface finish in radar-absorbing paint. A key improvement was the introduction of computer models used to predict the radar reflections from flat surfaces where collected data drove the design of a \"faceted\" aircraft. Development of the first such designs started in 1975 with the \"Have Blue\", a model Lockheed built to test the concept.\nPlans were well advanced by the summer of 1975, when DARPA started the Experimental Survivability Testbed project. Northrop and Lockheed were awarded contracts in the first round of testing. Lockheed received the sole award for the second test round in April 1976 leading to the \"Have Blue\" program and eventually the F-117 stealth attack aircraft. Northrop also had a classified technology demonstration aircraft, the Tacit Blue in development in 1979 at Area 51. It developed stealth technology, LO (low observables), fly-by-wire, curved surfaces, composite materials, electronic intelligence, and Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft Experimental. The stealth technology developed from the program was later incorporated into other operational aircraft designs, including the B-2 stealth bomber.\nAdvanced Technology Bomber program.\nBy 1976, these programs had progressed to a position in which a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. U.S. president Jimmy Carter became aware of these developments during 1977, and it appears to have been one of the major reasons the B-1 was canceled. Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the \"Have Blue\" platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the 1980 U.S. presidential election campaign in 1979, Ronald Reagan repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense and used the B-1 as a prime example. In response, on 22 August 1980 the Carter administration publicly disclosed that the United States Department of Defense was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.\nThe Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program began in 1979. Full development of the black project followed, funded under the code name \"Aurora\". After the evaluations of the companies' proposals, the ATB competition was narrowed to the Northrop/Boeing and Lockheed/Rockwell teams with each receiving a study contract for further work. Both teams used flying wing designs. The Northrop proposal was code named \"Senior Ice\", and the Lockheed proposal code named \"Senior Peg\". Northrop had experience developing flying wing aircraft: the YB-35 and YB-49. The Northrop design was larger and had curved surfaces while the Lockheed design was faceted and included a small tail. In 1979, designer Hal Markarian produced a sketch of the aircraft that bore considerable similarities to the final design. The final design would become one of the first combat aircraft to use a lambda wing design. The United States Air Force (USAF) originally planned to procure 165 ATB bombers.\nThe Northrop team's ATB design was selected over the Lockheed/Rockwell design on 20 October 1981. The Northrop design received the designation B-2 and the name \"Spirit\". The bomber's design was changed in the mid-1980s when the mission profile was changed from high-altitude to low-altitude, terrain-following. The redesign delayed the B-2's first flight by two years and added about US$1\u00a0billion to the program's cost. By 1989, the U.S. had secretly spent an estimated US$23\u00a0billion on research and development for the B-2. MIT engineers and scientists helped assess the mission effectiveness of the aircraft under a five-year classified contract during the 1980s. ATB technology was also fed into the Advanced Tactical Fighter program, which would produce the Lockheed YF-22 and Northrop YF-23, and later the Lockheed Martin F-22. Northrop was the B-2's prime contractor; major subcontractors included Boeing, Hughes Aircraft (now Raytheon), General Electric Aviation, and Vought Aircraft.\nSecrecy and espionage.\nDuring its design and development, the Northrop B-2 program was a black project; all program personnel needed a secret clearance. Still, it was less closely held than the Lockheed F-117 program; more people in the federal government knew about the B-2, and more information about the project was available. Both during development and in service, considerable effort has been devoted to maintaining the security of the B-2's design and technologies. Staff working on the B-2 in most, if not all, capacities need a level of special-access clearance and undergo extensive background checks carried out by a special branch of the USAF.\nA former Ford automobile assembly plant in Pico Rivera, California, was acquired and substantially rebuilt; the plant's employees were sworn to secrecy. To avoid suspicion, components were typically purchased through front companies, military officials would visit out of uniform, staff members were routinely subjected to polygraph examinations, and the business unit was named the \"Advanced Systems Division\". Nearly all information on the program was kept from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and members of Congress until the mid-1980s.\nThe B-2 was first publicly displayed on 22 November 1988 at USAF Plant 42 in Palmdale, California, where it was assembled. This viewing was heavily restricted, and guests were not allowed to see the rear of the B-2. However, \"Aviation Week\" editors found that there were no airspace restrictions above the presentation area and took aerial photographs of the aircraft's secret rear section with suppressed engine exhausts. The B-2's (s/n 82-1066 / AV-1) first public flight was on 17 July 1989 from Palmdale to Edwards Air Force Base.\nIn 1984, Northrop employee Thomas Patrick Cavanagh was arrested for attempting to sell classified information from the Pico Rivera factory to the Soviet Union. In October 2005, Noshir Gowadia, a design engineer who worked on the B-2's propulsion system, was arrested for selling classified information to China. Gowadia was convicted and sentenced to 32 years in prison.\nProgram costs and procurement.\nA procurement of 132 aircraft was planned in the mid-1980s but was later reduced to 75. By the early 1990s the Soviet Union dissolved, effectively eliminating the Spirit's primary Cold War mission. Under budgetary pressures and U.S. Congressional opposition, in his 1992 State of the Union address, President George H. W. Bush announced B-2 production would be limited to 20 aircraft. In 1996, however, the Clinton administration, though originally committed to ending production of the bombers at 20 aircraft, authorized the conversion of a 21st bomber, a prototype test model, to Block 30 fully operational status at a cost of nearly $500\u00a0million (~$ in 2024 dollars). In 1995, Northrop made a proposal to the USAF to build 20 additional aircraft with a flyaway cost of $566\u00a0million each.\nThe program was the subject of public controversy for its cost to American taxpayers. In 1996, the GAO disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers \"will be, by far, the costliest bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis\", costing over three times as much as the B-1B (US$9.6\u00a0million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H (US$6.8\u00a0million annually). In September 1997, each hour of B-2 flight necessitated 119 hours of maintenance. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours, respectively, for each hour of flight. A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealth properties, particularly its \"low-observable\" stealth skins. Maintenance costs are about $3.4\u00a0million per month for each aircraft. An August 1995 GAO report disclosed that the B-2 had trouble operating in heavy rain, as rain could damage the aircraft's stealth coating, causing procurement delays until an adequate protective coating could be found. In addition, the B-2's terrain-following/terrain-avoidance radar had difficulty distinguishing rain from other obstacles, rendering the subsystem inoperable during rain. However a subsequent report in October 1996 noted that the USAF had made some progress in resolving the issues with the radar via software fixes and hoped to have these fixes undergoing tests by the spring of 1997.\nThe total \"military construction\" cost related to the program was projected to be US$553.6\u00a0million in 1997 dollars. The cost to procure each B-2 was US$737\u00a0million in 1997 dollars (equivalent to US$\u00a0billion in 2021), based only on a fleet cost of US$15.48\u00a0billion. The procurement cost per aircraft, as detailed in GAO reports, which include spare parts and software support, was $929\u00a0million per aircraft in 1997 dollars.\nThe total program cost projected through 2004 was US$44.75\u00a0billion in 1997 dollars (equivalent to US$\u00a0billion in 2021). This includes development, procurement, facilities, construction, and spare parts. The total program cost averaged US$2.13\u00a0billion per aircraft. The B-2 may cost up to $135,000 per flight hour to operate in 2010, which is about twice that of the B-52 and B-1.\nOpposition.\nIn its consideration of the fiscal year 1990 defense budget, the U.S. House of Representative Armed Services Committee trimmed $800\u00a0million from the B-2 research and development budget, while at the same time staving off a motion to end the project. Opposition in committee and in Congress was mostly broad and bipartisan, with Congressmen Ron Dellums (D-CA), John Kasich (R-OH), and John G. Rowland (R-CT) authorizing the motion to end the project\u2014as well as others in the Senate, including Jim Exon (D-NE) and John McCain (R-AZ) also opposing the project. Dellums and Kasich, in particular, worked together from 1989 through the early 1990s to limit production to 21 aircraft and were ultimately successful.\nThe escalating cost of the B-2 program and evidence of flaws in the aircraft's ability to elude detection by radar were among factors that drove opposition to continue the program. At the peak production period specified in 1989, the schedule called for spending US$7\u00a0billion to $8\u00a0billion per year in 1989 dollars, something committee Chair Les Aspin (D-WI) said \"won't fly financially\". In 1990, the Department of Defense accused Northrop of using faulty components in the flight control system; it was also found that redesign work was required to reduce the risk of damage to engine fan blades by bird ingestion.\nIn time, several prominent members of Congress began to oppose the program's expansion, including Senator John Kerry (D-MA), who cast votes against the B-2 in 1989, 1991, and 1992. By 1992, U.S. president Bush had called for the cancellation of the B-2 and promised to cut military spending by 30% in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In October 1995, former Chief of Staff of the USAF, General Mike Ryan, and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, strongly recommended against Congressional action to fund the purchase of any additional B-2s, arguing that to do so would require unacceptable cuts in existing conventional and nuclear-capable aircraft, and that the military had greater priorities in spending a limited budget.\nSome B-2 advocates argued that procuring twenty additional aircraft would save money because B-2s would be able to deeply penetrate anti-aircraft defenses and use low-cost, short-range attack weapons rather than expensive standoff weapons. However, in 1995, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and its Director of National Security Analysis found that additional B-2s would reduce the cost of expended munitions by less than US$2\u00a0billion in 1995 dollars during the first two weeks of a conflict, in which the USAF predicted bombers would make their greatest contribution; this was a small fraction of the US$26.8\u00a0billion (in 1995 dollars) life cycle cost that the CBO projected for an additional 20 B-2s.\nIn 1997, as Ranking Member of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee and National Security Committee, Congressman Ron Dellums (D-CA), a long-time opponent of the bomber, cited five independent studies and offered an amendment to that year's defense authorization bill to cap production of the bombers to the existing 21 aircraft; the amendment was narrowly defeated. Nonetheless, Congress did not approve funding for additional B-2s.\nFurther developments.\nSeveral upgrade packages have been applied to the B-2. In July 2008, the B-2's onboard computing architecture was extensively redesigned; it now incorporates a new integrated processing unit that communicates with systems throughout the aircraft via a newly installed fiber optic network; a new version of the operational flight program software was also developed, with legacy code converted from the JOVIAL programming language to standard C. Updates were also made to the weapon control systems to enable strikes upon moving targets, such as ground vehicles.\nOn 29 December 2008, USAF officials awarded a US$468\u00a0million contract to Northrop Grumman to modernize the B-2 fleet's radars. Changing the radar's frequency was required as the United States Department of Commerce had sold that radio spectrum to another operator. In July 2009, it was reported that the B-2 had successfully passed a major USAF audit. In 2010, it was made public that the Air Force Research Laboratory had developed a new material to be used on the part of the wing trailing edge subject to engine exhaust, replacing existing material that quickly degraded.\nIn July 2010, political analyst Rebecca Grant speculated that when the B-2 becomes unable to reliably penetrate enemy defenses, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II may take on its strike/interdiction mission, carrying B61 nuclear bombs as a tactical bomber. However, in March 2012, The Pentagon announced that a $2\u00a0billion, 10-year-long modernization of the B-2 fleet was to begin. The main area of improvement would be replacement of outdated avionics and equipment. Continued modernization efforts likely have continued in secret, as alluded to by a B-2 commander from Whiteman Air Force Base in April 2021, possibly indicating offensive weapons capability against threatening air defenses and aircraft. He stated: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;without getting into specifics, and without getting into things that we frankly just don't discuss in open channels, I will tell you that our current bomber fleet, and this is all of them, we use some pretty innovative ways to integrate modern weapons capabilities to have us both maintain and increase our survivability. And for the B-2 specifically, the expansion of some of our strike capabilities allow us to increase our survivability beyond the fighter escort realm. Now the B-2 fleet is continuing to do that technological advancement, and that's enabled us to expand our strike capabilities, as well. Although we've been around for over 30 years, there's a lot of life left in this platform, and up until the B-21 is well on the scene and doing its job, this aircraft will continue to be at the forefront of our country and our nation's defense... and with these, and continued innovative upgrades, and weapons system capabilities, we will continue to do that until the last jet flies off the ramp into retirement.\nIt was reported in 2011 that The Pentagon was evaluating an unmanned stealth bomber, characterized as a \"mini-B-2\", as a potential replacement in the near future. In 2012, USAF Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz stated the B-2's 1980s-era stealth technologies would make it less survivable in future contested airspaces, so the USAF is to proceed with the Next-Generation Bomber despite overall budget cuts. In 2012 projections, it was estimated that the Next-Generation Bomber would have an overall cost of $55\u00a0billion.\nIn 2013, the USAF contracted for the Defensive Management System Modernization (DMS-M) program to replace the antenna system and other electronics to increase the B-2's frequency awareness. The Common Very Low Frequency Receiver upgrade allows the B-2s to use the same very low frequency transmissions as the \"Ohio\"-class submarines so as to continue in the nuclear mission until the Mobile User Objective System is fielded. In 2014, the USAF outlined a series of upgrades including nuclear warfighting, a new integrated processing unit, the ability to carry cruise missiles, and threat warning improvements. Due to ongoing software challenges, DMS-M was canceled by 2020, and the existing work was repurposed for cockpit upgrades.\nIn 1998, a Congressional panel advised the USAF to refocus resources away from continued B-2 production and instead begin development of a new bomber, either a new build or a variant of the B-2. In its 1999 bomber roadmap the USAF eschewed the panel's recommendations, believing its current bomber fleet could be maintained until the 2030s. The service believed that development could begin in 2013, in time to replace aging B-2s, B-1s and B-52s around 2037.\nAlthough the USAF previously planned to operate the B-2 until 2058, the FY 2019 budget moved up its retirement to \"no later than 2032\". It also moved the retirement of the B-1 to 2036 while extending the B-52's service life into the 2050s, because the B-52 has lower maintenance costs, versatile conventional payload, and the ability to carry nuclear cruise missiles (which the B-1 is treaty-prohibited from doing). The decision to retire the B-2 early was made because the small fleet of 20 is considered too expensive per plane to retain, with its position as a stealth bomber being taken over with the introduction of the B-21 Raider starting in the mid-2020s.\nDesign.\nOverview.\nThe B-2 Spirit was developed to take over the USAF's vital penetration missions, allowing it to travel deep into enemy territory to deploy ordnance, which could include nuclear weapons. The B-2 is a flying wing aircraft, meaning that it has no fuselage or tail. It has significant advantages over previous bombers due to its blend of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and a large payload. Low observability provides greater freedom of action at high altitudes, thus increasing both range and field of view for onboard sensors. The USAF reports its range as about . At cruising altitude, the B-2 refuels every six hours, taking on up to of fuel at a time.\nThe development and construction of the B-2 required pioneering use of computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies due to its complex flight characteristics and design requirements to maintain very low visibility to multiple means of detection. The B-2 bears a resemblance to earlier Northrop aircraft; the YB-35 and YB-49 were both flying wing bombers that had been canceled in development in the early 1950s, allegedly for political reasons. The resemblance goes as far as B-2 and YB-49 having the same wingspan. The YB-49 also had a small radar cross-section.\nAbout 80 pilots fly the B-2. Each aircraft has a crew of two, a pilot in the left seat and mission commander in the right, and has provisions for a third crew member if needed. For comparison, the B-1B has a crew of four and the B-52 has a crew of five. The B-2 is highly automated, and one crew member can sleep in a camp bed, use a toilet, or prepare a hot meal while the other monitors the aircraft, unlike most two-seat aircraft. Extensive sleep cycle and fatigue research was conducted to improve crew performance on long sorties. Advanced training is conducted at the USAF Weapons School.\nArmaments and equipment.\nIn the envisaged Cold War scenario, the B-2 was to perform deep-penetrating nuclear strike missions, making use of its stealth capabilities to avoid detection and interception throughout the missions. There are two internal bomb bays in which munitions are stored either on a rotary launcher or two bomb-racks; the carriage of the weapons loadouts internally results in less radar visibility than external mounting of munitions. The B-2 is capable of carrying of ordnance. Nuclear ordnance includes the B61 and B83 nuclear bombs; the AGM-129 ACM cruise missile was also intended for use on the B-2 platform.\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it was decided to equip the B-2 for conventional precision attacks as well as for the strategic role of nuclear-strike. The B-2 has a sophisticated GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS) that uses the aircraft's APQ-181 synthetic aperture radar to map out targets before dropping GPS-aided bombs (GAMs)\u2014later, Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs). In the B-2's original configuration, up to 16 GAMs or JDAMs could be deployed; An upgrade in 2004 raised the carrier capacity to 80 JDAMs.\nThe B-2 can drop various conventional weapons, including Mark 82 and Mark 84 bombs, CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions, GATOR mines, and the CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon. In July 2009, Northrop Grumman reported the B-2 was compatible with the equipment necessary to deploy the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), which is intended to attack reinforced bunkers; up to two MOPs could be equipped in the B-2's bomb bays with one per bay, the B-2 is the only platform compatible with the MOP as of 2012. As of 2011, the AGM-158 JASSM cruise missile is an upcoming standoff munition to be deployed on the B-2 and other platforms. This is to be followed by the Long Range Standoff Weapon, which may give the B-2 standoff nuclear capability for the first time, in a stealth configuration.\nAvionics and systems.\nTo make the B-2 more effective than previous bombers, advanced and modern avionics were integrated into its design; these have been modified and improved to accommodate conventional-warfare missions. The low-probability-of-intercept AN/APQ-181 multi-mode radar is part of a digital navigation system that includes terrain-following radar and Global Positioning System (GPS) guidance, NAS-26 astro-inertial navigation system (developed in the 1950s for the Northrop SM-62 Snark cruise missile), and a Defensive Management System (DMS) to inform the flight crew of possible threats. The DMS can automatically assess the detection capabilities of identified threats and indicated targets. The DMS was to be upgraded by 2021 to detect radar emissions from air defenses, then feed the data to the auto-router so it can modify the mission route to minimize exposure to dangers.\nFor safety and fault detection, an onboard test system is linked with most of the B-2's avionics to monitor the performance and status of thousands of components and consumables; it also provides post-mission servicing instructions to ground crews. In 2008, many of the 136 standalone distributed computers aboard the B-2, including the primary flight management computer, were being replaced by a single system. The avionics are controlled by 13 EMP-resistant MIL-STD-1750A computers connected through 26 MIL-STD-1553B-buses; other system elements are connected via optical fiber.\nIn addition to software upgrades and new radar-absorbent materials, the B-2 has had several major upgrades to its avionics and combat systems. For battlefield communications, Link-16 and a high-frequency satellite link have been installed. New munitions have been integrated. The AN/APQ-181 was given new antenna arrays to turn it into an active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, and its operational frequency was changed to avoid interfering with other operators' equipment.\nThe B-2's composite structure requires it to stay away from thunderstorms to avoid static discharge and lightning strikes.\nFlight controls.\nBecause flying wing aircraft are inherently unstable, the B-2 uses a complex quadruplex computer-controlled fly-by-wire flight control system that can automatically manipulate flight surfaces and settings without direct pilot inputs to maintain aircraft stability. The flight computer receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's air speed and angle of attack via pitot-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional pitot tubes which would impair the aircraft's stealth capabilities. The flight actuation system incorporates hydraulic and electrical servoactuated components, and it was designed with a high level of redundancy and fault-diagnostic capabilities.\nNorthrop had investigated several means of applying directional control that would raise the aircraft's radar profile as little as possible, eventually settling on a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust. Engine thrust became a key element of the B-2's aerodynamic design process early on; thrust not only affects drag and lift but pitching and rolling motions as well. Four pairs of control surfaces are located along the wing's trailing edge; while most surfaces are used throughout the aircraft's flight envelope, the inner elevons are normally only in use at slow speeds, such as landing. To avoid contact damage during takeoff and to provide a nose-down pitching attitude, all of the elevons remain drooped during takeoff until a high enough airspeed has been attained.\nStealth.\nThe B-2's low-observable, or \"stealth\", characteristics enable it to penetrate sophisticated anti-aircraft defenses undetected to attack heavily defended targets. This stealth comes from a combination of reduced acoustic, infrared, visual and radar signatures (multi-spectral camouflage), and permits the B-2 to operate with fewer supporting aircraft for air cover, and reduced Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses and electronic countermeasures. This makes the bomber a \"force multiplier\". As of \u00a02013[ [update]], there have been no instances of a missile being launched at a B-2.\nTo reduce optical visibility during daylight flights, the B-2 is painted in an anti-reflective paint. The undersides are dark because it flies at high altitudes (), and at that altitude a dark grey painting blends well into the sky. It is speculated to have an upward-facing light sensor that alerts the pilot to increase or reduce altitude to match the changing illuminance of the sky. The original design had tanks for a contrail-inhibiting chemical, but this was replaced in production aircraft by a contrail sensor that alerts the crew when they should change altitude. The B-2 can be seen at ranges of or less. The B-2 is stored in a $5\u00a0million specialized air-conditioned hangar to maintain its stealth coating. Every seven years, this coating is carefully washed away with crystallized wheat starch so that the B-2's surfaces can be inspected for any dents or scratches.\nRadar.\nThe B-2's low-drag flying wing configuration provides exceptional range and reduces its radar profile. Reportedly, the B-2 has a radar cross-section (RCS) of about . The bomber does not always fly stealthily; when nearing air defenses pilots \"stealth up\" the B-2, a maneuver whose details are secret. The aircraft is stealthy, except briefly when the bomb bay opens. The flying wing design most closely resembles a so-called infinite flat plate (as vertical control surfaces dramatically increase RCS), the perfect stealth shape, as it would lack angles to reflect back radar waves (initially, the shape of the Northrop ATB concept was flatter; it gradually increased in volume according to specific military requirements). Without vertical surfaces to reflect radar laterally, side aspect radar cross section is also reduced. Radars operating at a lower frequency band (S or L band) are able to detect and track certain stealth aircraft that have multiple control surfaces, like canards or vertical stabilizers, where the frequency wavelength can exceed a certain threshold and cause a resonant effect.\nRCS reduction as a result of shape had already been observed on the Royal Air Force's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber, and the USAF's F-117 Nighthawk. The F-117 used flat surfaces (faceting technique) for controlling radar returns as during its development (see Lockheed Have Blue) in the early 1970s, technology only allowed for the simulation of radar reflections on simple, flat surfaces; computing advances in the 1980s made it possible to simulate radar returns on more complex curved surfaces. The B-2 is composed of many curved and rounded surfaces across its exposed airframe to deflect radar beams. This technique, known as \"continuous curvature\", was made possible by advances in computational fluid dynamics, and first tested on the Northrop Tacit Blue.\nInfrared.\nSome analysts claim infra-red search and track systems (IRSTs) can detect stealth aircraft, because any aircraft surface heats up due to air friction. A two-channel IRST is a CO2 (4.3\u00a0\u03bcm absorption maxima) detection possible, through comparing between the low and high channel.\nBurying engines deep inside the fuselage minimizes the thermal visibility or infrared signature of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the boundary layer below the main inlet enters the fuselage (boundary layer suction, first tested on the Northrop X-21) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the nozzles (similar to the Ryan AQM-91 Firefly). According to the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law, this results in less energy (thermal radiation in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and titanium alloy elements, which disperse the air laterally, to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks afterburners as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared signature; breaking the sound barrier would produce an obvious sonic boom as well as aerodynamic heating of the aircraft skin which would also increase the infrared signature.\nMaterials.\nAccording to the Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle, even a very flat plate would still reflect radar waves, though much less than when a signal is bouncing at a right angle. Additional reduction in its radar signature was achieved by the use of various radar-absorbent materials (RAM) to absorb and neutralize radar beams. The B-2 is mostly made of a carbon-graphite composite material that is stronger than steel, lighter than aluminum, and absorbs much radar energy.\nThe B-2 is assembled with unusually tight engineering tolerances to avoid leaks of fluids as they could increase its radar signature. Innovations such as alternate high frequency material (AHFM) and automated material application methods were also used to improve the aircraft's radar-absorbent properties and reduce maintenance requirements. In early 2004, Northrop Grumman began applying a new AHFM to operational B-2s. To protect its radar-absorbent material and coatings, each B-2 is kept inside a climate-controlled hangar (Extra Large Deployable Aircraft Hangar System) large enough to accommodate its wingspan.\nShelter system.\nB-2s are supported by portable, environmentally-controlled hangars called B-2 Shelter Systems (B2SS). The hangars are built by American Spaceframe Fabricators Incorporated and cost about US$5\u00a0million each. The need for specialized hangars arose in 1998 when it was found that B-2s passing through Andersen Air Force Base did not have the climate-controlled environment maintenance operations required. In 2003, the B2SS program was managed by the Combat Support System Program Office at Eglin Air Force Base. B2SS hangars are known to have been deployed to Naval Support Facility Diego Garcia and Royal Air Force Fairford.\nOperational history.\n1990s.\nThe first operational aircraft, christened \"Spirit of Missouri\", was delivered to Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, where the fleet is based, on 17 December 1993. The B-2 reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 1 January 1997. Depot maintenance for the B-2 is accomplished by USAF contractor support and managed at Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center at Tinker Air Force Base. Originally designed to deliver nuclear weapons, modern usage has shifted towards a flexible role with conventional and nuclear capability.\nThe B-2's combat debut was in 1999, during the Kosovo War. It was responsible for destroying 33% of selected Yugoslav bombing targets in the first eight weeks of U.S. involvement in the war. During this war, six B-2s flew non-stop to Yugoslavia from their home base in Missouri and back, totaling 30 hours. Although the bombers accounted for 50 sorties out of a total of 34,000 NATO sorties, they dropped 11 percent of all bombs. The B-2 was the first aircraft to deploy GPS satellite-guided JDAM \"smart bombs\" in combat use in Kosovo. The use of JDAMs and precision-guided munitions effectively replaced the controversial tactic of carpet-bombing, which had been harshly criticized due to it causing indiscriminate civilian casualties in earlier conflicts, such as the 1991 Gulf War. On 7 May 1999, a B-2 dropped five JDAMs on the Chinese Embassy officially due to an error in targeting instructions, killing three people and injuring 20. By then, the B-2 had dropped 500 bombs in Yugoslavia.\n2000s.\nThe B-2 bombed ground targets at the beginning of the War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021) (Operation Crescent Wind/Operation Enduring Freedom). With aerial refueling support, the B-2 flew one of its longest missions to date from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to Afghanistan and back. B-2s would be stationed in the Middle East as a part of a US military buildup in the region from 2003.\nThe B-2's combat use preceded a USAF declaration of \"full operational capability\" in December 2003. The Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation 2003 Annual Report noted that the B-2's serviceability for Fiscal Year 2003 was still inadequate, mainly due to the maintainability of the B-2's low observable coatings. The evaluation also noted that the Defensive Avionics suite had shortcomings with \"pop-up threats\".\nDuring the Iraq War, B-2s operated from Diego Garcia and an undisclosed \"forward operating location\". Other sorties in Iraq have launched from Whiteman Air Force Base. As of \u00a02013[ [update]] the longest combat mission has been 44.3 hours. \"Forward operating locations\" have been previously designated as Andersen Air Force Base in Guam and RAF Fairford in the United Kingdom, where new climate controlled hangars have been constructed. B-2s have conducted 27 sorties from Whiteman Air Force Base and 22 sorties from a forward operating location, releasing more than of munitions, including 583 JDAM \"smart bombs\" in 2003.\n2010s.\nIn response to organizational issues and high-profile mistakes made within the USAF, all of the B-2s, along with the nuclear-capable B-52s and the USAF's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), were transferred to the newly formed Air Force Global Strike Command on 1 February 2010.\nIn March 2011, B-2s were the first U.S. aircraft placed into action in Operation Odyssey Dawn, the UN mandated enforcement of the Libyan no-fly zone. Three B-2s dropped 40 bombs on a Libyan airfield in support of the UN no-fly zone. The B-2s flew directly from the U.S. mainland across the Atlantic Ocean to Libya; each B-2 was refueled by allied tanker aircraft four times during each round trip mission.\nIn August 2011, \"The New Yorker\" reported that prior to the May 2011 U.S. Special Operations raid into Abbottabad, Pakistan that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden, U.S. officials had considered an airstrike by one or more B-2s as an alternative; the use of a bunker busting bomb was rejected due to potential damage to nearby civilian buildings. There were also concerns an airstrike would make it difficult to positively identify bin Laden's remains, making it hard to confirm his death.\nOn 28 March 2013, two B-2s flew a round trip of from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to South Korea, dropping dummy ordnance on the Jik Do target range. The mission, part of the annual South Korean\u2013U.S. military exercises, was the first time that B-2s flew over the Korean Peninsula. Tensions between the Koreas were high; North Korea protested the B-2's participation and threatened retaliatory nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States.\nOn 18 January 2017, two B-2s attacked an ISIS training camp southwest of Sirte, Libya, killing about 85 militants. The B-2s together dropped 108 precision-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) bombs. These strikes were followed by an MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle firing Hellfire missiles. Each B-2 flew a 33-hour, round-trip mission from Whiteman Air Force Base with four or five (accounts differ) refuelings during the trip.\n2020s.\nOn 16 October 2024, B-2As struck five underground weapons storage facilities in Yemen as part of the campaign against the Houthis for attacking international shipping during the Red Sea crisis. It was believed the strikes also served as a warning to Iran, demonstrating the stealth bomber's ability to destroy underground targets. RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory, Australia, was used as a staging ground for the strikes.\nOn 22 June 2025, the U.S. carried out strikes in Iran. Six B-2As dropped 12 GBU-57 \"bunker buster\" bombs on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and a seventh dropped two more GBU-57s on the Natanz Nuclear Facility.\nOperators.\nUnited States Air Force (19 aircraft in active inventory)\nAir Force Global Strike Command\n13th Bomb Squadron 2005\u2013present\n325th Bomb Squadron 1998\u20132005\n393rd Bomb Squadron 1993\u2013present\n394th Combat Training Squadron 1996\u20132018\nAir Combat Command\n72nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri) 1998\u2013present\n325th Weapons Squadron \u2013 Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri 2005\u2013present\n715th Weapons Squadron 2003\u20132005\nAir National Guard\n110th Bomb Squadron\nAir Force Materiel Command\n419th Flight Test Squadron 1997\u2013present\n420th Flight Test Squadron 1992\u2013present\nAir Force Systems Command\n6520th Flight Test Squadron\nAccidents and incidents.\nOn 23 February 2008, B-2 \"AV-12\" \"Spirit of Kansas\" crashed on the runway shortly after takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. \"Spirit of Kansas\" had been operated by the 393rd Bomb Squadron, 509th Bomb Wing, Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, and had logged 5,176 flight hours. The two-person crew ejected safely from the aircraft. The aircraft was destroyed, a hull loss valued at US$1.4\u00a0billion. After the accident, the USAF took the B-2 fleet off operational status for 53 days, returning on 15 April 2008. The cause of the crash was later determined to be moisture in the aircraft's Port Transducer Units during air data calibration, which distorted the information being sent to the bomber's air data system. As a result, the flight control computers calculated an inaccurate airspeed, and a negative angle of attack, causing the aircraft to pitch upward 30 degrees during takeoff. This was the first crash and loss of a B-2.\nIn February 2010, a serious incident involving a B-2 occurred at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. The aircraft involved was AV-11 \"Spirit of Washington\". The aircraft was severely damaged by fire while on the ground and underwent 18 months of repairs to enable it to fly back to the mainland U.S. for more comprehensive repairs. \"Spirit of Washington\" was repaired and returned to service in December 2013. At the time of the accident, the USAF had no training to deal with tailpipe fires on the B-2s.\nOn the night of 13\u201314 September 2021, B-2 \"Spirit of Georgia\" made an emergency landing at Whiteman Air Force Base. The aircraft landed and went off the runway into the grass and came to rest on its left side. The cause was later determined to be faulty landing gear springs and \"microcracking\" in hydraulic connections on the aircraft. The lock link springs in the left landing gear had likely not been replaced in at least a decade, and produced about 11% less tension than specified. The \"microcracking\" reduced hydraulic support to the landing gear. These problems caused the landing gear to fold upon landing. The accident resulted in a minimum of $10.1\u00a0million in repair damages, but the final repair cost was still being determined in March 2022.\nOn 10 December 2022, an in-flight malfunction aboard B-2 AV-16 \"Spirit of Hawaii\" forced an emergency crash landing at Whiteman Air Force Base. No personnel, including the flight crew, sustained injuries during the incident; there was a post-crash fire that was quickly put out. Subsequently, all B-2s were grounded. On 18 May 2023, Air Force officials lifted the grounding without disclosing any details about what caused the incident, or what steps had been taken to return the aircraft to operation. In May 2024, the Air Force announced the B-2 would be divested, as it had been deemed to be \"uneconomical to repair.\" Although no cost estimate was provided, the decision was likely influenced by the coming introduction of the B-21 bomber; after the B-2 crash in 2010, it took almost four years and over $100 million to return the aircraft to service because not losing one of the few penetrating bombers in the inventory was considered necessary to justify the effort. However, the impending arrival of the B-21 and coming retirement of the B-2 sometime after 2029 likely made USAF leaders decide it would not be worth the expense to repair it, only for it to soon be retired.\nAircraft on display.\nNo operational B-2s have been retired by the Air Force to be put on display. B-2s have made occasional appearances on ground display at various air shows.\nB-2 test article (s/n AT-1000), the second of two built without engines or instruments and used for static testing, was placed on display in 2004 at the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio. The test article passed all structural testing requirements before the airframe failed. The museum's restoration team spent over a year reassembling the fractured airframe. The display airframe is marked to resemble \"Spirit of Ohio\" (S/N 82-1070), the B-2 used to test the design's ability to withstand extreme heat and cold. The exhibit features \"Spirit of Ohio\"'s nose wheel door, with its \"Fire and Ice\" artwork, which was painted and signed by the technicians who performed the temperature testing. The restored test aircraft is on display in the museum's \"Cold War Gallery\".\nSpecifications (B-2A Block 30).\n\"Data from\" USAF Fact Sheet, Pace, Spick, Northrop GrummanGeneral characteristics* Crew: 2: pilot (left seat) and mission commander (right seat)* Fuel capacity: 167,000 pounds (75,750\u00a0kg)\nPerformance* Endurance: * Thrust/weight: 0.205\nArmament\n * 2 internal bays for ordnance and payload with an official limit of .

{"id": "4399", "revid": "13518729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4399", "title": "Beaver", "text": "Genus of mammal\nBeavers (genus Castor) are large, semiaquatic rodents of the Northern Hemisphere. There are two existing species: the North American beaver (\"Castor canadensis\") and the Eurasian beaver (\"C. fiber\"). Beavers are the second-largest living rodents, after capybaras, weighing up to . They have stout bodies with large heads, long chisel-like incisors, brown or gray fur, hand-like front feet, webbed back feet, and tails that are flat and scaly. The two species differ in skull and tail shape and fur color. Beavers can be found in a number of freshwater habitats, such as rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. They are herbivorous, consuming tree bark, aquatic plants, grasses and sedges.\nBeavers build dams and lodges using tree branches, vegetation, rocks and mud; they chew down trees for building material. Dams restrict water flow, forming ponds, and lodges (usually built in ponds) serve as shelters. Their infrastructure creates wetlands used by many other species, and because of their effect on other organisms in the ecosystem, beavers are considered a keystone species. Adult males and females live in monogamous pairs with their offspring. After their first year, the young help their parents repair dams and lodges; older siblings may also help raise newly born offspring. Beavers hold territories and mark them using scent mounds made of mud, debris, and castoreum\u2014a liquid substance excreted through the beaver's urethra-based castor sacs. Beavers can also recognize their kin by their anal gland secretions and are more likely to tolerate them as neighbors.\nHistorically, beavers have been hunted for their fur, meat, and castoreum. Castoreum has been used in medicine, perfume, and food flavoring; beaver pelts have been a major driver of the fur trade. Before protections began in the 19th and early 20th centuries, overhunting had nearly exterminated both species. Their populations have since rebounded, and they are listed as species of least concern by the IUCN Red List of mammals. In human culture, the beaver symbolizes industriousness, especially in connection with construction; it is the national animal of Canada.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"beaver\" comes from the Old English word or and is connected to the German word and the Dutch word . The ultimate origin of the word is an Indo-European root for 'brown'. Cognates of \"beaver\" are the source for several European placenames, including those of Beverley, Bi\u00e8vres, Biberbach, Biebrich, Bibra, Bibern, Bibrka, Bobr, Bober, B\u00f3brka, Bjurholm, Bjur\u00e4lven, and Bjurum. The genus name \"Castor\" has its origin in the Greek word and translates as 'beaver'.\nTaxonomy.\nCarl Linnaeus coined the genus name \"Castor\" as well as the specific (species) epithet \"fiber\" for the Eurasian species. German zoologist Heinrich Kuhl coined \"C. canadensis\" in 1820. Many scientists considered both names synonymous for one same species until the 1970s, when chromosomal evidence became available confirming both as separate where the Eurasian has 48 chromosomes, while the North American has 40. The difference in chromosome numbers prevents them from interbreeding. Twenty-five subspecies have been classified for \"C. canadensis\", and nine have been classified for \"C. fiber\".\nThere are two extant species: the North American beaver (\"Castor canadensis\") and the Eurasian beaver (\"C. fiber\"). The Eurasian beaver is slightly longer and has a more lengthened skull, triangular nasal cavities (as opposed to the square ones of the North American species), a lighter fur color, and a narrower tail.\nEvolution.\nBeavers belong to the rodent suborder Castorimorpha, along with Heteromyidae (kangaroo rats and kangaroo mice), and the gophers. Modern beavers are the only extant members of the family Castoridae. They originated in North America in the late Eocene and colonized Eurasia via the Bering Land Bridge in the early Oligocene, coinciding with the \"Grande Coupure\", a time of significant changes in animal species around 33million years ago (myr).\nThe more basal castorids had several unique features: more complex occlusion between cheek teeth, parallel rows of upper teeth, premolars that were only slightly smaller than molars, the presence of a third set of premolars (P3), a hole in the stapes of the inner ear, a smooth palatine bone (with the palatine opening closer to the rear end of the bone), and a longer snout. More derived castorids have less complex occlusion, upper tooth rows that create a V-shape towards the back, larger second premolars compared to molars, absence of a third premolar set and stapes hole, a more grooved palatine (with the opening shifted towards the front), and reduced incisive foramen. Members of the subfamily \"Palaeocastorinae\" appeared in late-Oligocene North America. This group consisted primarily of smaller animals with relatively large front legs, a flattened skull, and a reduced tail\u2014all features of a fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle.\nIn the early Miocene (about 24\u2009mya), castorids evolved a semiaquatic lifestyle. Members of the subfamily Castoroidinae are considered to be a sister group to modern beavers, and included giants like \"Castoroides\" of North America and \"Trogontherium\" of Eurasia. \"Castoroides\" is estimated to have had a length of and a weight of . Fossils of one genus in Castoroidinae, \"Dipoides\", have been found near piles of chewed wood, though \"Dipoides\" appears to have been an inferior woodcutter compared to \"Castor\". Researchers suggest that modern beavers and Castoroidinae shared a bark-eating common ancestor. Dam and lodge-building likely developed from bark-eating, and allowed beavers to survive in the harsh winters of the subarctic. There is no conclusive evidence for this behavior occurring in non-\"Castor\" species.\nThe genus \"Castor\" likely originated in Eurasia. The earliest fossil remains appear to be \"C. neglectus\", found in Germany and dated 12\u201310 mya. Mitochondrial DNA studies place the common ancestor of the two living species at around 8 mya. The ancestors of the North American beaver would have crossed the Bering Land Bridge around 7.5 mya. \"Castor\" may have competed with members of Castoroidinae, which led to niche differentiation. The fossil species \"C. praefiber\" was likely an ancestor of the Eurasian beaver. \"C. californicus\" from the Early Pleistocene of North America was similar to but larger than the extant North American beaver.'\nCharacteristics.\nBeavers are the second-largest living rodents, after capybaras. They have a head\u2013body length of , with a tail, a shoulder height of , and generally weigh , but can be as heavy as . Males and females are almost identical externally. Their bodies are streamlined like marine mammals and their robust build allows them to pull heavy loads. A beaver coat has 12,000\u201323,000 hairs/cm2 (77,000\u2013148,000 hairs/in2) and functions to keep the animal warm, to help it float in water, and to protect it against predators. Guard hairs are long and typically reddish brown, but can range from yellowish brown to nearly black. The underfur is long and dark gray. Beavers molt every summer.\nBeavers have large skulls with powerful chewing muscles. They have four chisel-shaped incisors that continue to grow throughout their lives. The incisors are covered in a thick enamel that is colored orange or reddish-brown by iron compounds. The lower incisors have roots that are almost as long as the entire lower jaw. Beavers have one premolar and three molars on all four sides of the jaws, adding up to 20 teeth. The molars have meandering ridges for grinding woody material. The eyes, ears and nostrils are arranged so that they can remain above water while the rest of the body is submerged. The nostrils and ears have valves that close underwater, while nictitating membranes cover the eyes. To protect the larynx and trachea from water flow, the epiglottis is contained within the nasal cavity instead of the throat. In addition, the back of the tongue can rise and create a waterproof seal. A beaver's lips can close behind the incisors, preventing water from entering their mouths as they cut and bite onto things while submerged.\nThe beaver's front feet are dexterous, allowing them to grasp and manipulate objects and food, as well as dig. The hind feet are larger and have webbing between the toes, and the second innermost toe has a \"double nail\" used for grooming. Beavers can swim at ; only their webbed hind feet are used to swim, while the front feet fold under the chest. On the surface, the hind limbs thrust one after the other; while underwater, they move at the same time. Beavers are awkward on land but can move quickly when they feel threatened. They can carry objects while walking on their hind legs.\nThe beaver's distinctive tail has a conical, muscular, hairy base; the remaining two-thirds of the appendage is flat and scaly. The tail has multiple functions: it provides support for the animal when it is upright (such as when chewing down a tree), acts as a rudder when it is swimming, and stores fat for winter. It also has a countercurrent blood vessel system which allows the animal to lose heat in warm temperatures and retain heat in cold temperatures.\nThe beaver's sex organs are inside the body, and the male's penis has a cartilaginous baculum. They have only one opening, a cloaca, which is used for reproduction, scent-marking, defecation, and urination. The cloaca evolved secondarily, as most mammals have lost this feature, and may reduce the area vulnerable to infection in dirty water. The beaver's intestine is six times longer than its body, and the caecum is double the volume of its stomach. Microorganisms in the caecum allow them to process around 30 percent of the cellulose they eat. A beaver defecates in the water, leaving behind balls of sawdust. Female beavers have four mammary glands; these produce milk with 19 percent fat, a higher fat content than other rodents. Beavers have two pairs of glands: castor sacs, which are part of the urethra, and anal glands. The castor sacs secrete castoreum, a liquid substance used mainly for marking territory. Anal glands produce an oily substance which the beaver uses as a waterproof ointment for its coat. The substance plays a role in individual and family recognition. Anal secretions are darker in females than males among Eurasian beavers, while the reverse is true for the North American species.\nCompared to many other rodents, a beaver's brain has a hypothalamus that is much smaller than the cerebrum; this indicates a relatively advanced brain with higher intelligence. The cerebellum is large, allowing the animal to move within a three-dimensional space (such as underwater) similar to tree-climbing squirrels. The neocortex is devoted mainly to touch and hearing. Touch is more advanced in the lips and hands than the whiskers and tail. Vision in the beaver is relatively poor; the beaver eye cannot see as well underwater as an otter. Beavers have a good sense of smell, which they use for detecting land predators and for inspecting scent marks, food, and other individuals.\nBeavers can hold their breath for as long as 15 minutes but typically remain underwater for no more than five or six minutes. Dives typically last less than 30 seconds and are usually no more than deep. When diving, their heart rate decreases to 60 beats per minute, half its normal pace, and blood flow is directed more towards the brain. A beaver's body also has a high tolerance for carbon dioxide. When surfacing, the animal can replace 75 percent of the air in its lungs in one breath, compared to 15 percent for a human.\nDistribution and status.\nThe IUCN Red List of mammals lists both beaver species as least concern. The North American beaver is widespread throughout most of the United States and Canada and can be found in northern Mexico. The species was introduced to Finland in 1937 (and then spread to northwestern Russia) and to Tierra del Fuego, Patagonia, in 1946. As of 2019[ [update]], the introduced population of North American beavers in Finland has been moving closer to the habitat of the Eurasian beaver. Historically, the North American beaver was trapped and nearly extirpated because its fur was highly sought after. Protections have allowed the beaver population on the continent to rebound to an estimated 6\u201312million by the late 20th century; still far lower than the originally estimated 60\u2013400million North American beavers before the fur trade. The introduced population in Tierra del Fuego is estimated at 35,000\u201350,000 individuals as of 2016[ [update]].\nThe Eurasian beaver's range historically included much of Eurasia, but was decimated by hunting by the early 20th century. In Europe, beavers were reduced to fragmented populations, with combined population numbers being estimated at 1,200 individuals for the Rh\u00f4ne of France, the Elbe in Germany, southern Norway, the Neman river and Dnieper Basin in Belarus, and the Voronezh river in Russia. The beaver has since recolonized parts of its former range, aided by conservation policies and reintroductions. Beaver populations now range across western, central, and eastern Europe, and western Russia and the Scandinavian Peninsula. Beginning in 2009, beavers have been successfully reintroduced to parts of Great Britain. In 2020[ [update]], the total Eurasian beaver population in Europe was estimated at over one million. Small native populations are also present in Mongolia and northwestern China; their numbers were estimated at 150 and 700, respectively, as of 2016[ [update]]. Under New Zealand's Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, beavers are classed as a \"prohibited new organism\" preventing them from being introduced into the country.\nEcology.\nBeavers live in freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. Water is the most important component of beaver habitat; they swim and dive in it, and it provides them refuge from land predators. It also restricts access to their homes and allows them to move building objects more easily. Beavers prefer slower moving streams, typically with a gradient (steepness) of one percent, though they have been recorded using streams with gradients as high as 15 percent. Beavers are found in wider streams more often than in narrower ones. They also prefer areas with no regular flooding and may abandon a location for years after a significant flood.\nBeavers typically select flat landscapes with diverse vegetation close to the water. North American beavers prefer trees being or less from the water, but will roam several hundred meters to find more. Beavers have also been recorded in mountainous areas. Dispersing beavers will use certain habitats temporarily before finding their ideal home. These include small streams, temporary swamps, ditches, and backyards. These sites lack important resources, so the animals do not stay there permanently. Beavers have increasingly settled at or near human-made environments, including agricultural areas, suburbs, golf courses, and shopping malls.\nFood and feeding.\nBeavers have an herbivorous and a generalist diet. During the spring and summer, they mainly feed on herbaceous plant material such as leaves, roots, herbs, ferns, grasses, sedges, water lilies, water shields, rushes, and cattails. During the fall and winter, they eat more bark and cambium of woody plants; tree and shrub species consumed include aspen, birch, oak, dogwood, willow and alder. There is some disagreement about why beavers select specific woody plants; some research has shown that beavers more frequently select species which are more easily digested, while others suggest beavers principally forage based on stem size. Beavers may cache their food for the winter, piling wood in the deepest part of their pond where it cannot be reached by other browsers. This cache is known as a \"raft\"; when the top becomes frozen, it creates a \"cap\". The beaver accesses the raft by swimming under the ice. Many populations of Eurasian beaver do not make rafts, but forage on land during winter.\nInfrastructure.\nBeavers need trees and shrubs to use as building material for dams, which restrict flowing water to create a pond for them to live in, and for lodges, which act as shelters and refuges from predators and the elements. Without such material, or when lodges are not needed, beavers dig burrows into a bank to live. Dam construction begins in late summer or early fall, and they repair them whenever needed. Beavers can cut down trees up to wide in less than 50 minutes. Thicker trees, at wide or more, may not fall for hours. When chewing down a tree, beavers switch between biting with the left and right side of the mouth. Tree branches are then cut and carried to their destination with the powerful jaw and neck muscles. Other building materials, like mud and rocks, are held by the forelimbs and tucked between the chin and chest.\nBeavers start building dams when they hear running water, and the sound of a leak in a dam triggers them to repair it. To build a dam, beavers stack up relatively long and thick logs between the banks. Heavy rocks keep them stable, and grass is packed between them. Beavers continue to pile on more material until the dam slopes in a direction facing upstream. Dams can range in height from to and can stretch from to several hundred meters long. Beaver dams are more effective in trapping and slowly leaking water than man-made concrete dams. Lake-dwelling beavers do not need to build dams.\nBeavers make two types of lodges: bank lodges and open-water lodges. Bank lodges are burrows dug along the shore and covered in sticks while the more complex freestanding, open-water lodges are built over a platform of piled-up sticks. The lodge is mostly sealed with mud, except for a hole at the top which acts as an air vent. Both types are accessed by underwater entrances. The above-water space inside the lodge is known as the \"living chamber\", and a \"dining area\" may exist close to the water entrance. Families routinely clean out old plant material and bring in new material.\nNorth American beavers build more open-water lodges than Eurasian beavers. Beaver lodges built by new settlers are typically small and sloppy. More experienced families can build structures with a height of and an above-water diameter of . A lodge sturdy enough to withstand the coming winter can be finished in just two nights. Both lodge types can be present at a beaver site. During the summer, beavers tend to use bank lodges to keep cool and use open-water lodges during the winter. The air vent provides ventilation, and newly added carbon dioxide can be cleared in an hour. The lodge remains consistent in oxygen and carbon dioxide levels from season to season.\nBeavers in some areas will dig canals connected to their ponds. The canals fill with groundwater and give beavers access and easier transport of resources, as well as allow them to escape predators. These canals can stretch up to wide, deep, and over long. It has been hypothesized that beavers' canals are not only transportation routes but an extension of their \"central place\" around the lodge and/or food cache. As they drag wood across the land, beavers leave behind trails or \"slides\", which they reuse when moving new material.\nEnvironmental effects.\nThe beaver works as an ecosystem engineer and keystone species, as its activities can have a great impact on the landscape and biodiversity of an area. Aside from humans, few other extant animals appear to do more to shape their environment. When building dams, beavers alter the paths of streams and rivers, allowing for the creation of extensive wetland habitats. In one study, beavers were associated with large increases in open-water areas. When beavers returned to an area, 160% more open water was available during droughts than in previous years, when they were absent. Beaver dams also lead to higher water tables in mineral soil environments and in wetlands such as peatlands. In peatlands particularly, their dams stabilize the constantly changing water levels, leading to greater carbon storage.\nBeaver ponds, and the wetlands that succeed them, remove sediments and pollutants from waterways, and can stop the loss of important soils. These ponds can increase the productivity of freshwater ecosystems by accumulating nitrogen in sediments. Beaver activity can affect the temperature of the water; in northern latitudes, ice thaws earlier in the warmer beaver-dammed waters. Beavers may contribute to climate change. In Arctic areas, the floods they create can cause permafrost to thaw, releasing methane into the atmosphere.\nAs wetlands are formed and riparian habitats are enlarged, aquatic plants colonize the newly available watery habitat. One study in the Adirondacks found that beaver engineering lead to an increase of more than 33 percent in herbaceous plant diversity along the water's edge. Another study in semiarid eastern Oregon found that the width of riparian vegetation on stream banks increased several-fold as beaver dams watered previously dry terraces adjacent to the stream. Riparian ecosystems in arid areas appear to sustain more plant life when beaver dams are present. Beaver ponds act as a refuge for riverbank plants during wildfires, and provide them with enough moisture to resist such fires. Introduced beavers at Tierra del Fuego have been responsible for destroying the indigenous forest. Unlike trees in North America, many trees in South America cannot grow back after being cut down.\nBeaver activity impacts communities of aquatic invertebrates. Damming typically leads to an increase of slow or motionless water species, like dragonflies, oligochaetes, snails, and mussels. This is to the detriment of rapid water species like black flies, stoneflies, and net-spinning caddisflies. Beaver floodings create more dead trees, providing more habitat for terrestrial invertebrates like \"Drosophila\" flies and bark beetles, which live and breed in dead wood. The presence of beavers can increase wild salmon and trout populations, and the average size of these fishes. These species use beaver habitats for spawning, overwintering, feeding, and as havens from changes in water flow. The positive effects of beaver dams on fish appear to outweigh the negative effects, such as blocking of migration. Beaver ponds have been shown to be beneficial to frog populations by protecting areas for larvae to mature in warm water. The stable waters of beaver ponds also provide ideal habitat for freshwater turtles.\nBeavers help waterfowl by creating increased areas of water. The widening of the riparian zone associated with beaver dams has been shown to increase the abundance and diversity of birds favoring the water's edge, an impact that may be especially important in semi-arid climates. Fish-eating birds use beaver ponds for foraging, and in some areas, certain species appear more frequently at sites where beavers were active than at sites with no beaver activity. In a study of Wyoming streams and rivers, watercourses with beavers had 75 times as many ducks as those without. As trees are drowned by rising beaver impoundments, they become an ideal habitat for woodpeckers, which carve cavities that may be later used by other bird species. Beaver-caused ice thawing in northern latitudes allows Canada geese to nest earlier.\nOther semi-aquatic mammals, such as water voles, muskrats, minks, and otters, will shelter in beaver lodges. Beaver modifications to streams in Poland create habitats favorable to bat species that forage at the water surface and \"prefer moderate vegetation clutter\". Large herbivores, such as some deer species, benefit from beaver activity as they can access vegetation from fallen trees and ponds.\nMortality and health.\nBeavers usually live up to 10 years. Felids, canids, and bears may prey upon them. Beavers are protected from predators when in their lodges, and prefer to stay near water. Parasites of the beaver include the bacteria \"Francisella tularensis\", which causes tularemia; the protozoan \"Giardia duodenalis\", which causes giardiasis (beaver fever); and the beaver beetle and mites of the genus \"Schizocarpus\". They have also been recorded to be infected with the rabies virus.\nBehavior.\nBeavers are mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, and spend the daytime in their shelters. In northern latitudes, beaver activity is decoupled from the 24-hour cycle during the winter, and may last as long as 29 hours. They do not hibernate during winter, and spend much of their time in their lodges.\nFamily life.\nThe core of beaver social organization is the family, which is composed of an adult male and an adult female in a monogamous pair and their offspring. Beaver families can have as many as ten members; groups about this size require multiple lodges. Mutual grooming and play fighting maintain bonds between family members, and aggression between them is uncommon.\nAdult beavers mate with their partners, though partner replacement appears to be common. A beaver that loses its partner will wait for another one to come by. Estrus cycles begin in late December and peak in mid-January. Females may have two to four estrus cycles per season, each lasting 12\u201324 hours. The pair typically mate in the water and to a lesser extent in the lodge, for half a minute to three minutes.\nUp to four young, or kits, are born in spring and summer, after a three or four-month gestation. Newborn beavers are precocial with a full fur coat, and can open their eyes within days of birth. Their mother is the primary caretaker, while their father maintains the territory. Older siblings from a previous litter also play a role.\nAfter they are born, the kits spend their first one to two months in the lodge. Kits suckle for as long as three months, but can eat solid food within their second week and rely on their parents and older siblings to bring it to them. Eventually, beaver kits explore outside the lodge and forage on their own, but may follow an older relative and hold onto their backs. After their first year, young beavers help their families with construction. Beavers sexually mature around 1.5\u20133 years. They become independent at two years old, but remain with their parents for an extra year or more during times of food shortage, high population density, or drought.\nTerritories and spacing.\nBeavers typically disperse from their parental colonies during the spring or when the winter snow melts. They often travel less than , but long-distance dispersals are not uncommon when previous colonizers have already exploited local resources. Beavers are able to travel greater distances when free-flowing water is available. Individuals may meet their mates during the dispersal stage, and the pair travel together. It may take them weeks or months to reach their final destination; longer distances may require several years. Beavers establish and defend territories along the banks of their ponds, which may be in length.\nBeavers mark their territories by constructing scent mounds made of mud and vegetation, scented with castoreum. Those with many territorial neighbors create more scent mounds. Scent marking increases in spring, during the dispersal of yearlings, to deter interlopers. Beavers are generally intolerant of intruders and fights may result in deep bites to the sides, rump, and tail. They exhibit a behavior known as the \"dear enemy effect\"; a territory-holder will investigate and become familiar with the scents of its neighbors and react more aggressively to the scents of strangers passing by. Beavers are also more tolerant of individuals that are their kin. They recognize them by using their keen sense of smell to detect differences in the composition of anal gland secretions. Anal gland secretion profiles are more similar among relatives than unrelated individuals.\nCommunication.\nBeavers within a family greet each other with whines. Kits will attract the attention of adults with mews, squeaks, and cries. Defensive beavers produce a hissing growl and gnash their teeth. Tail slaps, which involve an animal hitting the water surface with its tail, serve as alarm signals warning other beavers of a potential threat. An adult's tail slap is more successful in alerting others, who will escape into the lodge or deeper water. Juveniles have not yet learned the proper use of a tail slap, and hence are normally ignored. Eurasian beavers have been recorded using a territorial \"stick display\", which involves individuals holding up a stick and bouncing in shallow water.\nInteractions with humans.\nBeavers sometimes come into conflict with humans over land use; individual beavers may be labeled as \"nuisance beavers\". Beavers can damage crops, timber stocks, roads, ditches, gardens, and pastures via gnawing, eating, digging, and flooding. They occasionally attack humans and domestic pets, particularly when infected with rabies, in defense of their territory, or when they feel threatened. Some of these attacks have been fatal, including at least one human death. Beavers can spread giardiasis ('beaver fever') by infecting surface waters, though outbreaks are more commonly caused by human activity.\nFlow devices, like beaver pipes, are used to manage beaver flooding, while fencing and hardware cloth protect trees and shrubs from beaver damage. If necessary, hand tools, heavy equipment, or explosives are used to remove dams. Hunting, trapping, and relocation may be permitted as forms of population control and for removal of individuals. The governments of Argentina and Chile have authorized the trapping of invasive beavers in hopes of eliminating them. The ecological importance of beavers has led to cities like Seattle designing their parks and green spaces to accommodate the animals. The Martinez beavers became famous in the mid-2000s for their role in improving the ecosystem of Alhambra Creek in Martinez, California.\nZoos have displayed beavers since at least the 19th century, though not commonly. In captivity, beavers have been used for entertainment, fur harvesting, and for reintroduction into the wild. Captive beavers require access to water, substrate for digging, and artificial shelters. Archibald Stansfeld \"Grey Owl\" Belaney pioneered beaver conservation in the early 20th century. Belaney wrote several books, and was first to professionally film beavers in their environment. In 1931, he moved to a log cabin in Prince Albert National Park, where he was the \"caretaker of park animals\" and raised a beaver pair and their four offspring. Dorothy Burney Richards, inspired by Belaney, lived with beavers in her home at Beaversprite.\nCommercial use.\nBeavers have been hunted, trapped, and exploited for their fur, meat, and castoreum. Since the animals typically stayed in one place, trappers could easily find them and could kill entire families in a lodge. Many pre-modern people mistakenly thought that castoreum was produced by the testicles or that the castor sacs of the beaver were its testicles, and females were hermaphrodites. Aesop's Fables describes beavers chewing off their testicles to preserve themselves from hunters, which is impossible because a beaver's testicles are internal. This myth persisted for centuries, and was corrected by French physician Guillaume Rondelet in the 1500s. Beavers have historically been hunted and captured using deadfalls, snares, nets, bows and arrows, spears, clubs, firearms, and leg-hold traps. Castoreum was used to lure the animals.\nCastoreum was used for a variety of medical purposes; Pliny the Elder promoted it as a treatment for stomach problems, flatulence, seizures, sciatica, vertigo, and epilepsy. He stated it could stop hiccups when mixed with vinegar, toothaches if mixed with oil (by administering into the ear opening on the same side as the tooth), and could be used as an antivenom. The substance has traditionally been prescribed to treat hysteria in women, which was believed to have been caused by a \"toxic\" womb. Castoreum's properties have been credited to the accumulation of salicylic acid from willow and aspen trees in the beaver's diet, and has a physiological effect comparable to aspirin. Today, the medical use of castoreum has declined and is limited mainly to homeopathy. The substance is also used as an ingredient in perfumes and tinctures, and as a flavouring in food and drinks.\nVarious Native American groups have historically hunted beavers for food, they preferred its meat more than other red meats because of its higher calorie and fat content, and the animals remained plump in winter when they were most hunted. The bones were used to make tools. In medieval Europe, the Catholic Church considered the beaver to be part mammal and part fish, and allowed followers to eat the scaly, fishlike tail on meatless Fridays during Lent. Beaver tails were thus highly prized in Europe; they were described by French naturalist Pierre Belon as tasting like a \"nicely dressed eel\".\nBeaver pelts were used to make hats; felters would remove the guard hairs. The number of pelts needed depended on the type of hat, with Cavalier and Puritan hats requiring more fur than top hats. In the late 16th century, Europeans began to deal in North American furs due to the lack of taxes or tariffs on the continent and the decline of fur-bearers at home. Beaver pelts caused or contributed to the Beaver Wars, King William's War, and the French and Indian War; the trade made John Jacob Astor and the owners of the North West Company very wealthy. For Europeans in North America, the fur trade was a driver of the exploration and westward exploration on the continent and contact with native peoples, who traded with them. The fur trade peaked between 1860 and 1870, when over 150,000 beaver pelts were purchased annually by the Hudson's Bay Company and fur companies in the United States. The contemporary global fur trade is not as profitable due to conservation, anti-fur and animal rights campaigns.\nIn culture.\nThe beaver has been used to represent productivity, trade, tradition, masculinity, and respectability. References to the beaver's skills are reflected in everyday language. The English verb \"to beaver\" means working with great effort and being \"as busy as a beaver\"; a \"beaver intellect\" refers to a way of thinking that is slow and honest. Though it typically has a wholesome image, the beaver's name has been used as a sexual term for the human vulva.\nNative American myths emphasize the beaver's skill and industriousness. In the mythology of the Haida, beavers are descended from the Beaver-Woman, who built a dam on a stream next to their cabin while her husband was out hunting and gave birth to the first beavers. In a Cree story, the Great Beaver and its dam caused a world flood. Other tales involve beavers using their tree chewing skills against an enemy. Beavers have been featured as companions in some stories, including a Lakota tale where a young woman flees from her evil husband with the aid of her pet beaver.\nEuropeans have traditionally thought of beavers as fantastical animals due to their amphibious nature. They depicted them with exaggerated tusk-like teeth, dog- or pig-like bodies, fish tails, and visible testicles. French cartographer Nicolas de Fer illustrated beavers building a dam at Niagara Falls, fantastically depicting them like human builders. Beavers have also appeared in literature such as Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy\" and the writings of Athanasius Kircher, who wrote that on Noah's Ark the beavers were housed near a water-filled tub that was also used by mermaids and otters.\nThe beaver has long been associated with Canada, appearing on the first pictorial postage stamp issued in the Canadian colonies in 1851 as the so-called \"Three-Penny Beaver\". It was declared the national animal in 1975. The five-cent coin, the coat of arms of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the logos for Parks Canada and Roots Canada use its image. Frank and Gordon are two fictional beavers that appeared in Bell Canada's advertisements between 2005 and 2008. However, the beaver's status as a rodent has made it controversial, and it was not chosen to be on the Arms of Canada in 1921. The beaver has commonly been used to represent Canada in political cartoons, typically to signify it as a friendly but relatively weak nation. In the United States, the beaver is the state animal of New York and Oregon. It is also featured on the coat of arms of the London School of Economics.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4400", "revid": "2666701", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4400", "title": "Bear", "text": "Family of carnivoran mammals\nBears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae (). They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.\nWhile the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda is mostly herbivorous, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varying diets. With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.\nBears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have also been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"bear\" comes from Old English ' and belongs to a family of names for the bear in Germanic languages, such as Swedish ', also used as a first name. This form is conventionally said to be related to a Proto-Indo-European word for \"brown\", so that \"bear\" would mean \"the brown one\". However, Ringe notes that while this etymology is semantically plausible, a word meaning \"brown\" of this form cannot be found in Proto-Indo-European. He suggests instead that \"bear\" is from the Proto-Indo-European word \"*\u01f5\u02b0w\u1e17r- ~ *\u01f5\u02b0w\u00e9r\" \"wild animal\". This terminology for the animal originated as a taboo avoidance term: proto-Germanic tribes replaced their original word for bear\u2014\"arkto\"\u2014with this euphemistic expression out of fear that speaking the animal's true name might cause it to appear. According to author Ralph Keyes, this is the oldest known euphemism.\nBear taxon names such as Arctoidea and \"Helarctos\" come from the ancient Greek \u1f04\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (\"arktos\"), meaning bear, as do the names \"arctic\" and \"antarctic\", via the name of the constellation Ursa Major, the \"Great Bear\", prominent in the northern sky.\nBear taxon names such as Ursidae and \"Ursus\" come from Latin \"Ursus/Ursa\", he-bear/she-bear. The female first name \"Ursula\", originally derived from a Christian saint's name, means \"little she-bear\" (diminutive of Latin \"ursa\"). In Switzerland, the male first name \"Urs\" is especially popular, while the name of the canton and city of Bern is by legend derived from \"B\u00e4r\", German for bear. The Germanic name Bernard (including Bernhardt and similar forms) means \"bear-brave\", \"bear-hardy\", or \"bold bear\". The Old English name Beowulf is a kenning, \"bee-wolf\", for bear, in turn meaning a brave warrior.\nEvolution.\nFossil history.\nThe earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including \"Parictis\" (late Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38\u201318\u00a0Mya) and the slightly younger \"Allocyon\" (early Oligocene, 34\u201330\u00a0Mya), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the Bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37\u00a0Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene. European genera morphologically very similar to \"Allocyon\", and to the much younger American \"Kolponomos\" (about 18 Mya), are known from the Oligocene, including \"Amphicticeps\" and \"Amphicynodon\". There has been various morphological evidence linking amphicynodontines with pinnipeds, as both groups were semi-aquatic, otter-like mammals. In addition to the support of the pinniped\u2013amphicynodontine clade, other morphological and some molecular evidence supports bears being the closest living relatives to pinnipeds.\nThe raccoon-sized, dog-like \"Cephalogale\" is the oldest-known member of the subfamily Hemicyoninae, which first appeared during the middle Oligocene in Eurasia about 30\u00a0Mya. The subfamily includes the younger genera \"Phoberocyon\" (20\u201315\u00a0Mya), and \"Plithocyon\" (15\u20137\u00a0Mya). A \"Cephalogale\"-like species gave rise to the genus \"Ursavus\" during the early Oligocene (30\u201328\u00a0Mya); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living bears. Species of \"Ursavus\" subsequently entered North America, together with \"Amphicynodon\" and \"Cephalogale\", during the early Miocene (21\u201318\u00a0Mya). Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from \"Ursavus\" between 15 and 20\u00a0Mya, likely via the species \"Ursavus elmensis\". Based on genetic and morphological data, the Ailuropodinae (pandas) were the first to diverge from other living bears about 19\u00a0Mya, although no fossils of this group have been found before about 11 Mya.\nThe New World short-faced bears (Tremarctinae) differentiated from Ursinae following a dispersal event into North America during the mid-Miocene (about 13\u00a0Mya). They invaded South America (\u22482.5 or 1.2\u00a0Ma) following formation of the Isthmus of Panama. Their earliest fossil representative is \"Plionarctos\" in North America (c.\u00a010\u20132\u00a0Ma). This genus is probably the direct ancestor to the North American short-faced bears (genus \"Arctodus\"), the South American short-faced bears (\"Arctotherium\"), and the spectacled bears, \"Tremarctos\", represented by both an extinct North American species (\"T. floridanus\"), and the lone surviving representative of the Tremarctinae, the South American spectacled bear (\"T. ornatus\").\nThe subfamily Ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3\u20134.5\u00a0Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first members of the genus \"Ursus\" appeared around this time. The sloth bear is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3\u00a0Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3\u20134\u00a0Mya, the species \"Ursus minimus\" appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's Asian black bear. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from \"U.\u00a0minimus\": the black bears (including the sun bear, the Asian black bear, and the American black bear); and the brown bears (which includes the polar bear). Modern brown bears evolved from \"U.\u00a0minimus\" via \"Ursus etruscus\", which itself is ancestral to the extinct Pleistocene cave bear. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. The polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from a population of brown bears that became isolated in northern latitudes by glaciation 400,000\u00a0years ago.\nExternal phylogeny.\nThe relationship of the bear family with other carnivorans is shown in the following phylogenetic tree, which is based on the molecular phylogenetic analysis of six genes in Flynn (2005) with the musteloids updated following the multigene analysis of Law et al. (2018).\nNote that although they are called \"bears\" in some languages, red pandas and raccoons and their close relatives are not bears, but rather musteloids.\nInternal phylogeny.\nOne possible phylogeny is based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Yu et al. (2007). The polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping, while the relationships of the other species are not very well resolved.\nA more recent phylogeny is based on the genetic study of Kumar et al. (2017). It concludes that Ursine bears originated around five million years ago, with extensive hybridization among the different species.\nTaxonomy.\nMcLellan and colleagues (1992) classified the bears into seven subfamilies: Amphicynodontinae, Hemicyoninae, Ursavinae, Agriotheriinae, Ailuropodinae, Tremarctinae, and Ursinae. \nMcKenna et al. (1997) instead classified the bear species into the superfamily Ursoidea, with Hemicyoninae and Agriotheriinae being classified in the family \"Hemicyonidae\". Amphicynodontinae under this classification were classified as stem-pinnipeds in the superfamily Phocoidea. In the McKenna and Bell classification, both bears and pinnipeds are in a parvorder of carnivoran mammals known as Ursida, along with the extinct bear dogs of the family Amphicyonidae.\nWesley-Hunt and Flynn (2005) classify the family Ursidae as one of nine families in the suborder Caniformia, or \"doglike\" carnivorans, within the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids. Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, each having 74 chromosomes (\"see\" Ursid hybrid), whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in Procyonidae, where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.\nPhysical characteristics.\nSize.\nThe bear family includes the most massive extant terrestrial members of the order Carnivora. The polar bear is considered to be the largest extant species, with adult males weighing and measuring in total length. The smallest species is the sun bear, which ranges in weight and in length. Prehistoric North and South American short-faced bears were the largest species known to have lived. The latter estimated to have weighed and stood tall. Body weight varies throughout the year in bears of temperate and arctic climates, as they build up fat reserves in the summer and autumn and lose weight during the winter.\nMorphology.\nBears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are sexually dimorphic with regard to size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The shoulder blades and the pelvis are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter than those of the big cats as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, excavate dens, dig out burrowing animals, turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and club large creatures.\nUnlike most other land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.\nMost mammals have agouti hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of color corresponding to two different types of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single color throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-colored skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. While bears tend to be uniform in color, some species may have markings on the chest or face and the giant panda has a bold black-and-white pelage.\nBears have small rounded ears so as to minimize heat loss, but neither their hearing nor sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have color vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better than that of the dog, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.\nThe skulls of bears are massive, providing anchorage for the powerful masseter and temporal jaw muscles. The canine teeth are large but mostly used for display, and the molar teeth flat and crushing. Unlike most other members of the Carnivora, bears have relatively undeveloped carnassial teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter. Considerable variation occurs in dental formula even within a given species. This may indicate bears are still in the process of evolving from a mainly meat-eating diet to a predominantly herbivorous one. Polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved carnassial-like cheek teeth, as their diets have switched back towards carnivory. Sloth bears lack lower central incisors and use their protrusible lips for sucking up the termites on which they feed. The general dental formula for living bears is: 3.1.2\u20134.23.1.2\u20134.3. The structure of the larynx of bears appears to be the most basal of the caniforms. They possess air pouches connected to the pharynx which may amplify their vocalizations.\nBears have a fairly simple digestive system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must spend much of their time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12\u201315 hours a day feeding.\nDistribution and habitat.\nExtant bears are found in sixty countries primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe. An exception is the spectacled bear; native to South America, it inhabits the Andean region. The sun bear's range extends below the equator in Southeast Asia. The Atlas bear, a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.\nThe most widespread species is the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia to the western areas of North America (where it is called the grizzly bear). The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Ocean. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur in a range of habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra and in the case of the polar bear, ice floes. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.\nBehavior and ecology.\nBrown and American black bears are generally diurnal, meaning that they are active for the most part during the day, though they may forage substantially by night. Other species may be nocturnal, active at night, though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators. Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the Carnivora. The only times bears are encountered in groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs). Fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive scarring, which suggests that maintaining dominance can be intense. With their acute sense of smell, bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away. They use olfaction to locate other foods, encounter mates, avoid rivals and recognize their cubs.\nFeeding.\nMost bears are opportunistic omnivores and consume more plant than animal matter, and appear to have evolved from an ancestor which was a low-protein macronutrient omnivore. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.\nWhen foraging for plants, bears choose to eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behavior. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behavior. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be very important to the diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.\nThe sloth bear is not as specialized as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects. At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets. Some individuals become addicted to sweets in garbage inside towns where tourism-related waste is generated throughout the year. Some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults. Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Fish are an important source of food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like rodents may be dug out and eaten.\nThe brown bear and both species of black bears sometimes take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly the young and weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be sniffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed with raw strength, including bites and paw swipes, and bears do not display the specialized killing methods of felids and canids. Predatory behavior in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.\nBears are prolific scavengers and kleptoparasites, stealing food caches from rodents, and carcasses from other predators. For hibernating species, weight gain is important as it provides nourishment during winter dormancy. A brown bear can eat of food and gain of fat a day prior to entering its den.\nCommunication.\nBears produce a number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, grunting or chuffing may be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, snorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.\nBears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as standing upright, which exaggerates the individual's size. The chest markings of some species may add to this intimidating display. Staring is an aggressive act and the facial markings of spectacled bears and giant pandas may help draw attention to the eyes during agonistic encounters. Individuals may approach each other by stiff-legged walking with the head lowered. Dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing the canine teeth, muzzle twisting and neck stretching. A subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down.\nBears also communicate with their scent by urinating on or rubbing against trees and other objects. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around to draw attention to the marking post. Pandas establish territories by marking objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.\nReproduction and development.\nThe mating system of bears has variously been described as a form of polygyny, promiscuity and serial monogamy. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalizing. Ovulation is induced by mating, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.\nGestation typically lasts six to nine months, including delayed implantation, and litter size numbers up to four cubs. Giant pandas may give birth to twins but they can only suckle one young and the other is left to die. In northern living species, birth takes place during winter dormancy. Cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair, relying on their mother for warmth. The milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and cubs may suckle for up to a year after they are born. By two to three months, cubs can follow their mother outside the den. They usually follow her on foot, but sloth bear cubs may ride on their mother's back. Male bears play no role in raising young. Infanticide, where an adult male kills the cubs of another, has been recorded in polar bears, brown bears and American black bears but not in other species. Males kill young to bring the female into estrus. Cubs may flee and the mother defends them even at the cost of her life.\nIn some species, offspring may become independent around the next spring, though some may stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach sexual maturity shortly after they disperse; at around three to six years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old. Lifespan may also vary between species. The brown bear can live an average of 25 years.\nHibernation.\nBears of northern regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. In order for their heart rate to slow down to this level during hibernation, a protein found in striated muscle, like the heart, called myosin must enter a super-relaxed state. In the super-relaxed state, the consumption of ATP is kept very low, allowing the bear to make it through the winter without losing all of its energy due to the basic functions such as pumping blood through the body. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is formed in the colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. While larger bears have a larger supply of body fat to keep them alive through hibernation, researchers found that smaller bears were able to hibernate longer than their larger counterparts due to them being able to sustain a lower body temperature, which translates to less energy being spent on keeping their bodies warm. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.\nMortality.\nBears do not have many predators. The most important are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. Felids like the tiger may also prey on bears, particularly cubs, which may also be threatened by canids.\nBears are parasitized by eighty species of parasites, including single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally, they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan \"Sarcocystis\", the parasitic worm \"Diphyllobothrium mansonoides\", and the nematodes \"Dirofilaria immitis\", \"Capillaria aerophila\", \"Physaloptera\" sp., \"Strongyloides\" sp. and others. Of these, \"D. mansonoides\" and adult \"C. aerophila\" were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan \"Toxoplasma gondii\" has been found in polar bears, and the nematode \"Trichinella nativa\" can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a \"Morbillivirus\" similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.\nRelationship with humans.\nConservation.\nIn modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable; even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the American black bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain areas. In general, these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.\nLaws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public perception of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. The giant panda has become a worldwide symbol of conservation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, which are home to around 30% of the wild panda population, gained a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation in 2006. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears, and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.\nAttacks.\nSeveral bear species are dangerous to humans, especially in areas where they have become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans. Injuries caused by bears are rare, but are widely reported. Bears may attack humans in response to being startled, in defense of young or food, or even for predatory reasons.\nEntertainment, hunting, food and folk medicine.\nBears in captivity have for centuries been used for entertainment. They have been trained to dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe from at least the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London, at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear handlers called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.\nBears have been hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. Their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In Cantonese cuisine, bear paws are considered a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, as it can be infected with the parasite \"Trichinella spiralis\".\nThe peoples of eastern Asia use bears' body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of traditional Chinese medicine. More than 12,000 bears are thought to be kept on farms in China, Vietnam, and South Korea for the production of bile. Trade in bear products is prohibited under CITES, but bear bile has been detected in shampoos, wine and herbal medicines sold in Canada, the United States and Australia.\nCultural depictions.\nBears have been popular subjects in art, literature, folklore and mythology. The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female's devotion and protection of her cubs. In many Native American cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence. A widespread belief among cultures of North America and northern Asia associated bears with shaman; this may be based on the solitary nature of both. Bears have thus been thought to predict the future and shaman were believed to have been capable of transforming into bears.\nThere is evidence of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists. It is possible that bear worship existed in early Chinese and Ainu cultures. The prehistoric Finns, Siberian peoples and more recently Koreans considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers. Artio (\"Dea Artio\" in the Gallo-Roman religion) was a Celtic bear goddess. Evidence of her worship has notably been found at Bern, itself named for the bear. Her name is derived from the Celtic word for \"bear\", \"artos\". In ancient Greece, the archaic cult of Artemis in bear form survived into Classical times at Brauron, where young Athenian girls passed an initiation rite as \"arktoi\" \"she bears\".\nThe constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the great and little bears, are named for their supposed resemblance to bears, from the time of Ptolemy. The nearby star Arcturus means \"guardian of the bear\", as if it were watching the two constellations. Ursa Major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since Paleolithic times, in the widespread Cosmic Hunt myths. These are found on both sides of the Bering land bridge, which was lost to the sea some 11,000 years ago.\nBears are popular in children's stories, including Winnie the Pooh, Paddington Bear, Gentle Ben and \"The Brown Bear of Norway\". An early version of \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\", was published as \"The Three Bears\" in 1837 by Robert Southey, many times retold, and illustrated in 1918 by Arthur Rackham. The Hanna-Barbera character Yogi Bear has appeared in numerous comic books, animated television shows and films. The Care Bears began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film. Around the world, many children\u2014and some adults\u2014have teddy bears, stuffed toys in the form of bears, named after the American statesman Theodore Roosevelt when in 1902 he had refused to shoot an American black bear tied to a tree.\nBears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. The Russian Bear has been a common national personification for Russia from the 16th century onward. Smokey Bear has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message \"Only you can prevent forest fires\".\nOrganizations.\nThe International Association for Bear Research &amp; Management, also known as the International Bear Association, and the Bear Specialist Group of the Species Survival Commission, a part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature focus on the natural history, management, and conservation of bears. Bear Trust International works for wild bears and other wildlife through four core program initiatives, namely Conservation Education, Wild Bear Research, Wild Bear Management, and Habitat Conservation.\nSpecialty organizations for each of the eight species of bears worldwide include:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A sea eagle, it has two known subspecies and forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle (\"Haliaeetus albicilla\"), which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle in the Palearctic. Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder that subsists mainly on fish, upon which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest nest of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to deep, wide, and in weight. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of four to five years.\nBald eagles are not bald; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, \"white-headed\". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in plumage, but females are about 25% larger than males. The yellow beak is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.\nThe bald eagle is the national bird and national symbol of the United States and appears on its seal. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States, but measures such as banning the practice of hunting bald eagles and banning the use of the harmful pesticide DDT slowed the decline of their population. Populations have since recovered, and the species' status was downgraded from \"endangered\" to \"threatened\" in 1995 and removed from the list altogether in 2007.\nTaxonomy.\nThe bald eagle is placed in the genus \"Haliaeetus\" (sea eagles), and gets both its common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. \"Bald\" in the English name is from an older usage meaning \"having white on the face or head\" rather than \"hairless\", referring to the white head feathers contrasting with the darker body. \nThe genus name is Neo-Latin: \"Haliaeetus\" (from the ), and the specific name, \"leucocephalus\", is Latinized () and ().\nThe bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work \"Systema Naturae\", under the name \"Falco leucocephalus\".\nThe bald eagle forms a species pair with the white-tailed eagle of Eurasia. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same ecological niche in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early Miocene (c. 10\u00a0Ma BP) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle Oligocene, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this genus.\nSubspecies.\nThere are two historically recognized subspecies of bald eagle, although it is believed these may be the same species with size differences according to Bergmann's Rule.\nDescription.\nThe plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (\"Haliaeetus vocifer\") (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body (albeit of somewhat more rufous hue), white head and tail, but differs from the bald eagle in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.\nThe plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity. Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the golden eagle (\"Aquila chrysaetos\"), the only other very large, non-vulturine raptorial bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger beak, straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its nape and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing.\nThe bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor (accipitrid) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the California condor (\"Gymnogyps californianus\"), a New World vulture that today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids. However, the golden eagle, averaging and in wing chord length in its American race (\"Aquila chrysaetos canadensis\"), is merely lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around . Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed white-tailed eagle and the overall larger Steller's sea eagle (\"Haliaeetus pelagicus\"), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.\nThe bald eagle has a body length of . Typical wingspan is between and mass is normally between . Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging as much as , and against the males' average weight of .\nThe size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with Bergmann's rule: the species increases in size further away from the equator and the tropics. For example, eagles from South Carolina average in mass and in wingspan, smaller than their northern counterparts. One field guide in Florida listed similarly small sizes for bald eagles there, at about . Of intermediate size, 117 migrant bald eagles in Glacier National Park were found to average but this was mostly (possibly post-dispersal) juvenile eagles, with six adults here averaging . Wintering eagles in Arizona (winter weights are usually the highest of the year since, like many raptors, they spend the highest percentage of time foraging during winter) were found to average .\nThe largest eagles are from Alaska, where large females may weigh more than and span across the wings. A survey of adult weights in Alaska showed that females there weighed on average , respectively, and males weighed against immatures which averaged and in the two sexes. An Alaskan adult female eagle that was considered outsized weighed some . R.S. Palmer listed a record from 1876 in Wyoming County, New York of an enormous adult bald eagle that was shot and reportedly scaled . Among standard linear measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is long, and the tarsus is . The culmen reportedly ranges from , while the measurement from the gape to the tip of the bill is . The bill size is unusually variable: Alaskan eagles can have up to twice the bill length of birds from the Southern United States (Georgia, Louisiana, Florida), with means including both sexes of and in culmen length, respectively, from these two areas.\nThe call consists of weak staccato, chirping whistles, \"kleek kik ik ik ik\", somewhat similar in cadence to a gull's call. The calls of young birds tend to be harsher and shriller than those of adults.\nRange.\nThe bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of Canada, all of the continental United States, and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, northern and eastern Canada, and Florida. From 1966 to 2015 bald eagle numbers increased substantially throughout its winter and breeding ranges, and as of 2018 the species nests in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.\nThe majority of bald eagles in Canada are found along the British Columbia coast while large populations are found in the forests of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Bald eagles also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in Squamish, British Columbia, about halfway between Vancouver and Whistler. In March 2024, bald eagles were found nesting in Toronto for the first time. The birds primarily gather along the Squamish and Cheakamus Rivers, attracted by the salmon spawning in the area. Similar congregations of wintering bald eagles at open lakes and rivers, wherein fish are readily available for hunting or scavenging, are observed in the Northern United States.\nIt has occurred as a vagrant twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in County Fermanagh on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a white-tailed eagle), and an exhausted juvenile was captured near Castleisland in County Kerry on November 15, 1987. There is also a record of it from Llyn Coron in Anglesey, United Kingdom, from October 17, 1978; the provenance of this individual eagle has remained in dispute.\nHabitat.\nThe bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American wetland habitat such as seacoasts, rivers, large lakes or marshes or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than , and lakes with an area greater than are optimal for breeding bald eagles.\nThe bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of coniferous or hardwood trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location. Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low as above the ground. In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from in height. In Chesapeake Bay, nesting trees averaged in diameter and in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands high and is in diameter. Trees used for nesting in the Greater Yellowstone area average high. Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water. Most nests have been found within of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over , in Florida.\nBald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at wide and deep.\nIn Florida, nesting habitats often consist of mangrove swamps, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, pinelands, seasonally flooded flatwoods, hardwood swamps, and open prairies and pastureland with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are slash pines (\"Pinus elliottii\"), longleaf pines (\"P. palustris\"), loblolly pines (\"P. taeda\") and cypress trees, but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In Wyoming, groves of mature cottonwoods or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of ponderosa pines (\"Pinus ponderosa\") to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In Southeast Alaska, Sitka spruce (\"Picea sitchensis\") provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by hemlocks (\"Tsuga\") at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in human-made reservoirs stocked with fish.\nThe bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than from low-density human disturbance and more than from medium- to high-density human disturbance. However, bald eagles will occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, or John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity. Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the Harlem neighborhood in New York City in 2010.\nWhile wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as prairies, meadows or tundra, or open forests with regular carrion access.\nBehavior.\nThe bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on thermal convection currents. It reaches speeds of when gliding and flapping, and about while carrying fish. Its dive speed is between , though it seldom dives vertically. Regarding their flying abilities, despite being morphologically less well adapted to faster flight than golden eagles (especially during dives), the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast. It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer. The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of thermals, updrafts, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00\u00a0a.m. and 6:00\u00a0p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.\nDiet and feeding.\nThe bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey. Fish often comprise most of the eagle's diet throughout their range. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. More than 400 species are known to be included in the bald eagle's prey spectrum, far more than its ecological equivalent in the Old World, the white-tailed eagle, is known to take. Despite its considerably lower population, the bald eagle may come in second amongst all North American accipitrids, slightly behind only the red-tailed hawk, in number of prey species recorded.\nBehavior.\nTo hunt fish, the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its talons. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. Ospreys also have this adaptation. Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight, with prey up to the size of Canada geese attacked and killed in mid-air. It has been estimated that the bald eagle's grip (measured as newtons per square meter, or pounds per square inch) is ten times stronger than that of a human. Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. Bald eagles can swim, but in some cases, they drag their catch ashore with their talons. Still, some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions. On numerous occasions, when large prey such as large fish including mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey. When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable. Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it. While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.\nThey obtain much of their food as carrion or via a practice known as kleptoparasitism, by which they steal prey away from other predators. Due to their dietary habits, bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans. Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience, adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles, which often obtain their food from scavenging. They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass's presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of whales, though carcasses of ungulates and large fish are seemingly preferred. Congregated wintering waterfowl are frequently exploited for carcasses to scavenge by immature eagles in harsh winter weather. Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska) and fish-processing plants.\nFish.\nIn Southeast Alaska, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-round diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the Columbia River Estuary in Oregon were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. At least 100 species of fish have been recorded in the bald eagle's diet. From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught alive by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.\nIn the Pacific Northwest, spawning trout and salmon provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall. Though bald eagles occasionally catch live salmon, they usually scavenge spawned salmon carcass. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on pink salmon (\"Oncorhynchus gorbuscha\"), coho salmon (\"O. kisutch\") and, more locally, sockeye salmon (\"O. nerka\"), with Chinook salmon (\"O. tshawytscha\"). Due to the Chinook salmon's large size ( average adult size), it is probably taken only as carrion and a single carcass can attract several eagles. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are Pacific herring (\"Clupea pallasii\"), Pacific sand lance (\"Ammodytes hexapterus\") and eulachon (\"Thaleichthys pacificus\"). In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were largescale suckers (\"Catostomus macrocheilus\") (17.3% of the prey selected there), American shad (\"Alosa sapidissima\"; 13%) and common carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\"; 10.8%). Eagles living at Chesapeake Bay in Maryland were found to subsist largely on American gizzard shad (\"Dorosoma cepedianum\"), threadfin shad (\"Dorosoma petenense\") and white bass (\"Morone chrysops\"). Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on catfish, most prevalently the brown bullhead (\"Ameiurus nebulosus\") and any species in the genus \"Ictalurus\" as well as mullet, trout, needlefish, and eels. Chain pickerels (\"Esox niger\") and white suckers (\"Catostomus commersonii\") are frequently taken in interior Maine. Wintering eagles on the Platte River in Nebraska preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp. Bald eagles are also known to eat the following fish species: rainbow trout (\"Oncorhynchus mykiss\"), white catfish (\"Ameiurus catus\"), rock greenling (\"Hexagrammos lagocephalus\"), Pacific cod (\"Gadus macrocephalus\"), Atka mackerel (\"Pleurogrammus monopterygius\"), largemouth bass (\"Micropterus salmoides\"), northern pike (\"Esox lucius\"), striped bass (\"Morone saxatilis\"), dogfish shark (\"Squalidae.sp\") and blue walleye (\"Sander vitreus\").\nFish taken by bald eagles varies in size, but bald eagles take larger fish than other piscivorous birds in North America, typically range from and prefer fish. When experimenters offered fish of different sizes in the breeding season around Lake Britton in California, fish measuring were taken 71.8% of the time by parent eagles while fish measuring were chosen only 25% of the time. At nests around Lake Superior, the remains of fish (mostly suckers) were found to average in total length. In the Columbia River Estuary, most preyed on by eagles were estimated to measure less than , but larger fish between or even exceeding in length also taken especially during the non-breeding seasons. They can take fish up to at least twice their own weight, such as large mature salmons, carps, or even muskellunge (\"Esox masquinongy\"), by dragging its catch with talons and pull toward ashore. Much larger marine fish such as Pacific halibut (\"Hippoglossus stenolepis\") and lemon sharks (\"Negaprion brevirostris\") have been recorded among bald eagle prey though probably are only taken as young, as small, newly mature fish, or as carrion.\nBenthic fishes such as catfish are usually consumed after they die and float to the surface, though while temporarily swimming in the open may be more vulnerable to predation than most fish since their eyes focus downwards. Bald eagles also regularly exploit water turbines which produce battered, stunned or dead fish easily consumed. Predators who leave behind scraps of dead fish that they kill, such as brown bears (\"Ursus arctos\"), gray wolves (\"Canis lupus\") and Red foxes (\"Vulpes vulpes\"), may be habitually followed in order to scavenge the kills secondarily. Once North Pacific salmon die off after spawning, usually local bald eagles eat salmon carcasses almost exclusively. Eagles in Washington need to consume of fish each day for survival, with adults generally consuming more than juveniles and thus reducing potential energy deficiency and increasing survival during winter.\nBirds.\nBehind fish, the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other waterbirds. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Overall, birds are the most diverse group in the bald eagle's prey spectrum, with 200 prey species recorded.\nBird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as western grebes (\"Aechmophorus occidentalis\"), mallards (\"Anas platyrhynchos\"), and American coots (\"Fulica americana\") as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. American herring gull (\"Larus smithsonianus\") are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Black ducks (\"Anas rubripes\"), common eiders (\"Somateria mollissima\"), and double-crested cormorants (\"Phalacrocorax auritus\") are also frequently taken in coastal Maine and velvet scoter (\"Melanitta fusca\") was dominant prey in San Miguel Island.\nDue to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense against eagles by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and they can effectively cull large portions of a colony. Along some portions of the North Pacific coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly kelp-dwelling fish and supplementally sea otter (\"Enhydra lutris\") pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had steep population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation. Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist has expressed concern that murres are heading for a \"conservation collision\" due to heavy eagle predation. Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as storm petrels and shearwaters by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside. If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle in other cases. When the birds fly away from a colony, this exposes their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as gulls.\nWhile they usually target small to medium-sized seabirds, larger seabirds such as great black-backed gulls (\"Larus marinus\") and northern gannets (\"Morus bassanus\") and brown pelicans (\"Pelecanus occidentalis\") of all ages can successfully be taken by bald eagles. Similarly, large waterbirds are occasionally killed. Geese such as wintering emperor geese (\"Chen canagica\") and snow geese (\"C. caerulescens\"), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Smaller Ross's geese (\"Anser rossii\") are also taken, as well as large-sized Canada geese (\"Branta canadensis\"). Predation on the largest subspecies (\"Branta canadensis maxima\") has been reported. Other large waterbird prey include common loons (\"Gavia immer\") of all ages. Large wading birds can also fall prey to bald eagles. For the great blue herons (\"Ardea herodias\"), bald eagles are their only serious enemies of all ages. Slightly larger Sandhill cranes (\"Grus canadensis\") can be taken as well. While adult whooping cranes (\"Grus americana\") are too large and formidable, their chicks can fall prey to bald eagles. They even occasionally prey on adult tundra swans (\"Cygnus columbianus\"). Young trumpeter swans (\"Cygnus buccinator\") are also taken, and an unsuccessful attack on an adult swan has been photographed.\nBald eagles have been occasionally recorded as killing other raptors. In some cases, these may be attacks of competition or kleptoparasitism on rival species but end with the consumption of the dead victims. Nine species of other accipitrids and owls are known to have been preyed upon by bald eagles. Owl prey species have ranged in size from western screech owls (\"Megascops kennicotti\") to snowy owls (\"Bubo scandiacus\"). Larger diurnal raptors known to have fallen victim to bald eagles have included red-tailed hawks (\"Buteo jamaicensis\"), peregrine falcons (\"Falco peregrinus\"), northern goshawks (\"Accipiter gentilis\"), ospreys (\"Pandion haliaetus\") and black (\"Coragyps atratus\") and turkey vultures (\"Cathartes aura\").\nMammals.\nMammalian preys are generally less frequently taken than fish or avian prey. However, in some regions, such as landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals that occur in colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (\"Cynomys\" sp.) and jackrabbits (\"Lepus\" sp.). Bald eagles in Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge often hunt in pair to catch cottontails, jackrabbits and prairie dogs. They can attack and prey on rabbits and hares of nearly any size, from marsh rabbits (\"Sylvilagus palustris\") to black and white-tailed jackrabbits (\"Lepus californicus\" &amp; \"L. townsendii\"), and Arctic hares (\"Lepus arcticus\"). In the San Luis Valley, white-tailed jackrabbits can be important prey. Additionally, rodents such as montane voles (\"Microtus montanus\"), brown rats (\"Rattus norvegicus\"), and various squirrels are taken as supplementary prey. Larger rodents such as muskrats (\"Ondatra zibethicus\"), young or small adult nutrias (\"Myocastor coypus\") and groundhogs (\"Marmota monax\") are also preyed upon. Even North American porcupines (\"Erethizon dorsatum\") are reportedly attacked and killed.\nWhere available, seal colonies can provide a lot of food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (\"Phoca vitulina\") afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. Similarly, bald eagles in Alaska readily prey on sea otter (\"Enhydra lutris\") pups. Small to medium-sized terrestrial mammalian carnivores can be taken infrequently. Mustelid including American martens (\"Martes pennanti\"), American minks (\"Neogale vison\"), and larger fisher cats (\"Pekania pennanti\") are known to be hunted. Foxes are also taken, including island foxes (\" Urocyon littoralis \"), Arctic foxes (\"Vulpes lagopus\"), and grey foxes (\"Urocyon cinereoargenteus\"). Although fox farmers claimed that bald eagle heavily prey on young and adult free-range Arctic fox, the predation events are sporadic. In one instance, two bald eagles fed upon a red fox (\"Vulpes vulpes\") that had tried to cross a frozen Delaware Lake in Ohio. Other medium-sized carnivorans such as striped skunks (\"Mephitis mephitis\"), American hog-nosed skunks (\"Conepatus leuconotus\"), and common raccoons (\"Procyon lotor\") are taken, as well as domestic cats (\"Felis catus\") and dogs (\"Canis familiaris\").\nOther wild mammalian prey include fawns of deer such as white-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\") and Sitka deer (\"Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis\"), which weigh around can be taken alive by bald eagles. In one instance, a bald eagle was observed carrying mule deer (\"Odocoileus hemionus\") fawn. Additionally, Virginia opossums (\"Didelphis virginiana\") can be preyed upon. Still, predation events are rare due to their nocturnal habits.\nTogether with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (\"Ovis aries\"). There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation, some specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles. Still, they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle. Both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least three other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.\nReptiles and other prey.\nSupplemental prey is readily taken given the opportunity. In some areas, reptiles may become regular prey, especially in warm areas such as Florida where reptile diversity is high. Turtles are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile. In coastal New Jersey, 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles. The main species found were common musk turtles (\"Sternotherus odoratus\"), diamondback terrapin (\"Malaclemys terrapin\") and juvenile common snapping turtles (\"Chelydra serpentina\"). In these New Jersey nests, mainly subadult and small adults were taken, ranging in carapace length from . Similarly, many turtles were recorded in the diet in the Chesapeake Bay. In Texas, softshell turtles are the most frequently taken prey, and a large number of Barbour's map turtles are taken in Torreya State Park. Other reptilian and amphibian prey includes southern alligator lizards (\"Elgaria multicarinata\"), snakes such as garter snakes and rattlesnakes, and Greater siren (\"Siren lacertina\").\nInvertebrates are occasionally taken. In Alaska, eagles feed on sea urchins (\"Strongylocentrotus\" sp.), chitons, mussels, and crabs. Other various mollusks such as land snails, abalones, bivalves, periwinkles, blue mussels, squids, and starfishes are taken as well.\nInterspecific predatory relationships.\nWhen competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing mammals such as coyotes (\"Canis latrans\") and foxes, and birds such as corvids, gulls, vultures and other raptors. Occasionally, coyotes, bobcats (\"Lynx rufus\") and domestic dogs (\"Canis familiaris\") can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine. Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed). However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved. Wintering bald and golden eagles in Utah both sometimes won conflicts, though in one recorded instance a single bald eagle successfully displaced two consecutive golden eagles from a kill.\nThough bald eagles face few natural threats, an unusual attacker comes in the form of the common loon (\"G. immer\"), which is also taken by eagles as prey. While common loons normally avoid conflict, they are highly territorial and will attack predators and competitors by stabbing at them with their knife-like bill; as the range of the bald eagle has increased following conservation efforts, these interactions have been observed on several occasions, including a fatality of a bald eagle in Maine that is presumed to have come about as a result of it attacking a nest, then having a fatal puncture wound inflicted by one or both loon parents.\nThe bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many as there are golden eagles estimated to live in North America. Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources. Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in New Jersey during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt snow geese alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut piles and carcasses of white-tailed deer (\"Odocoileus virginianus\") in remote forest clearings in the eastern Appalachian Mountains without apparent conflict. Bald eagles are frequently mobbed by smaller raptors, due to their infrequent but unpredictable tendency to hunt other birds of prey. Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as ospreys, herons and even otters. They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from peregrine falcons (\"Falco peregrinus\"), prairie dogs from ferruginous hawks (\"Buteo regalis\") and even jackrabbits from golden eagles. When they approach scavengers such as dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often attack them in an attempt to force them to disgorge their food. Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed upon in the wild and are thus considered apex predators.\nReproduction.\nBald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. Bald eagles have high mate fidelity and generally mate for life. However, if one pair member dies or disappears, the survivor will choose a new mate. A pair that has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates. Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays by the males.\nThe flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free-fall, separating just before hitting the ground. Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be of waterside habitat.\nCompared to most other raptors, which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid-April to early May, and the young fledge from late June to early July. The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as deep, across and weigh . One nest in Florida was found to be deep, across, and to weigh . This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal. Usually nests are used for under five years, as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the Midwest was occupied continuously for at least 34 years. The nest is built of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska.\nIn Sonora, Mexico, eagles have been observed nesting on top of hecho cactuses (\"Pachycereus pectin-aboriginum\"). Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in California, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, but currently are only verified to occur only in Alaska and Arizona. The eggs average about long, ranging from , and have a breadth of , ranging from . Eggs in Alaska averaged in mass, while in Saskatchewan they averaged . As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase with distance from the equator. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests, but these may be exceptional cases of polygyny. Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs. It is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledgling stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of a larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents' attention towards it. Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different. However, nearly half of the known bald eagles produce two fledglings (more rarely three), unlike in some other \"eagle\" species such as some in the genus \"Aquila\", in which a second fledgling is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).\nA young eaglet can gain up to a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird. The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise in the air. The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and be attended to by their parents for a further six weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about eight weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development. For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce.\nMale eagles have been observed killing and cannibalizing their chicks. In 2024, at the National Conservation Training Center (NCTC) in West Virginia, the NCTC's Eagle Cam recorded two bald eagle chicks being attacked and devoured by their father as soon as the mother departed from the nest. The NCTC noted in its statement on the incident that such behavior \"has been observed in other nests and is not uncommon in birds of prey.\"\nOn rare occasions, bald eagles have been recorded to adopt other raptor fledglings into their nests, as seen in 2017 by a pair of eagles in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary near Sidney, British Columbia. The pair of eagles in question are believed to have carried a juvenile red-tailed hawk back to their nest, presumably as prey, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three nestlings. The hawk, nicknamed \"Spunky\" by biologists monitoring the nest, fledged successfully.\nLongevity and mortality.\nThe average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In Prince William Sound, Alaska, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil spill adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by the National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today, eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species' protected status. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study of 1,490 bald eagle deaths from 1986 through 2017 in Michigan found that 532 (36%) died due to being struck by cars while scavenging roadkill and 176 (12%) died due to lead poisoning from ingesting fragments of lead ammo and fishing gear present in carrion, with the proportion of both causes of death increasing significantly towards the end of the study period.\nMost non-human-related mortality involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive their first year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived to their first year. Nestling or egg fatalities may be due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. Nest predators include large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (\"Gulo gulo\"), fishers (\"Pekania pennanti\"), red-tailed hawks, owls, other eagles, bobcats, American black bears (\"Ursus americanus\") and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage, thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (\"Vulpes lagopus\") occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.\nRelationship with humans.\nPopulation decline and recovery.\nOnce a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with their calcium metabolism, making them either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs; many of their eggs were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for them to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century the bald eagle population was 300,000\u2013500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the U.S.\nOther factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the territory of Alaska in the previous 12 years, approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent). Illegal shooting was described as \"the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles\" by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1978. Leading causes of death in bald eagles include lead pollution, poisoning, collision with motor vehicles, and power line electrocution. A study published in 2022 in the Journal Science found that more than half of adult eagles across 38 U.S. states suffered from lead poisoning. The primary cause is when eagles scavenge carcasses of animals shot by hunters. These are often tainted with lead shotgun pellets, rifle rounds, or fishing tackle.\nThe species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the 1918 Migratory Bird Treaty, later extended to all of North America. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the golden eagle, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds as well as collecting their eggs. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.\nWith regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000\u2013115,000 by 1992; the U.S. state with the largest resident population is Alaska, with about 40,000\u201350,000, with the next highest population the Canadian province of British Columbia with 20,000\u201330,000 in 1992. Obtaining a precise count of the bald eagle population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in Florida, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the contiguous state with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is Minnesota, with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Florida's most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles. In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980. That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests. Further population increases in Washington may be limited by the availability of late winter food, particularly salmon.\nThe bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, when it was reclassified from \"endangered\" to \"threatened\". On July 6, 1999, a proposal was initiated \"To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife\". It was de-listed on June 28, 2007. It has also been assigned a risk level of \"least-concern\" category on the IUCN Red List. In the \"Exxon Valdez\" oil spill of 1989, an estimated 247 were killed in Prince William Sound, though the local population returned to its pre-spill level by 1995. In some areas, the increase in eagles has led to decreases in other bird populations and the eagles may be considered a pest.\nKilling permits.\nIn December 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed extending the permits issued to wind generation companies to allow them to kill up to 4,200 bald eagles per year without facing a penalty, four times the previous number. The permits would last 30 years, six times the previous five-year term.\nIn captivity.\nPermits are required to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles that they show are permanently injured individuals that cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles. The bald eagle can be long-lived in captivity if well cared for, but does not breed well even under the best conditions.\nIn Canada and England, a license is required to keep bald eagles for falconry. Bald eagles cannot legally be kept for falconry in the United States, but a license may be issued in some jurisdictions to allow use of such eagles in birds-of-prey flight shows.\nCultural significance.\nThe bald eagle is important in various Native American cultures and, as the national symbol of the United States, is prominent in seals and logos, coinage, postage stamps, and other items relating to the U.S. federal government.\nRole in Native American culture.\nThe bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, like those of the golden eagle, are central to many religious and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many powwow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo tradition an eagle feather is represented to be a protector, along with the feather Navajo medicine men use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee consider eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw consider the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.\nDuring the Sun Dance, which is practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.\nEagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the First Amendment by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.\nThe National Eagle Repository, a division of the FWS, exists as a means to receive, process, and store bald and golden eagles which are found dead and to distribute the eagles, their parts and feathers to federally recognized Native American tribes for use in religious ceremonies.\nNational symbol of the United States.\nThe bald eagle is the national symbol of the United States. It was adopted as a national emblem in 1782. It has long been considered the \"national bird\", though unofficially until an act of Congress in December 2024.\nThe founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States, depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and an olive branch with 13 leaves with its talons.\nThe bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, and in the logos of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which gave rise to the urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.\nContrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that Benjamin Franklin ever publicly supported the wild turkey (\"Meleagris gallopavo\"), rather than the bald eagle, as a symbol of the United States. However, in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris, criticizing the Society of the Cincinnati, he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle's behavior. In the letter Franklin states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For my own part. I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living honestly\u00a0... besides he is a rank coward: The little king bird not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district.\nFranklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a noble order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom the Society was named. His reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.\nPopular culture.\nLargely because of its role as a symbol of the United States, but also because it is a large predator, the bald eagle is often represented in popular culture. In film and television, the call of the red-tailed hawk is often substituted for the bald eagle's because the former is much louder and more powerful.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Of the land carnivorans, it is rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear, which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on average. The brown bear is a sexually dimorphic species, as adult males are larger and more compactly built than females. The fur ranges in color from cream to reddish to dark brown. It has evolved large hump muscles, unique among bears, and paws up to wide and long, to effectively dig through dirt. Its teeth are similar to those of other bears and reflect its dietary plasticity.\nThroughout the brown bear's range, it inhabits mainly forested habitats in elevations of up to . It is omnivorous, and consumes a variety of plant and animal species. Contrary to popular belief, the brown bear derives 90% of its diet from plants. When hunting, it will target animals as small as insects and rodents to those as large as moose or muskoxen. In parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears predominantly feed on spawning salmon that come near shore to lay their eggs. For most of the year, it is a usually solitary animal that associates only when mating or raising cubs. Females give birth to an average of one to three cubs that remain with their mother for 1.5 to 4.5 years. It is a long-lived animal, with an average lifespan of 25 years in the wild. Relative to its body size, the brown bear has an exceptionally large brain. This large brain allows for high cognitive abilities, such as tool use. Attacks on humans, though widely reported, are generally rare.\nWhile the brown bear's range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions across its wide range, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated population in 2017 of 110,000. Populations that were hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries are the Atlas bear of North Africa and the Californian, Ungavan and Mexican populations of the grizzly bear of North America. Many of the populations in the southern parts of Eurasia are highly endangered as well. One of the smaller-bodied forms, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered: it occupies only 2% of its former range and is threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts. The Marsican brown bear of central Italy is one of several currently isolated populations of the Eurasian brown bear and is believed to have a population of only about 50 bears.\nThe brown bear is considered to be one of the most popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It has been kept in zoos since ancient times, and has been tamed and trained to perform in circuses and other acts. For thousands of years, the brown bear has had a role in human culture, and is often featured in literature, art, folklore, and mythology.\nEtymology.\nThe brown bear is sometimes referred to as the , from Middle English. This name originated in the fable \"History of Reynard the Fox\", translated by William Caxton, from the Middle Dutch word or , meaning \"brown\". In the mid-19th-century United States, the brown bear was given the nicknames \"Old Ephraim\" and \"Moccasin Joe\".\nThe scientific name of the brown bear, \"Ursus arctos\", comes from the Latin , meaning \"bear\", and the Greek /, also meaning \"bear\".\nEvolution and taxonomy.\nTaxonomy and subspecies.\nCarl Linnaeus scientifically described the species under the name \"Ursus arctos\" in the 1758 edition of \"Systema Naturae\". Brown bear taxonomy and subspecies classification has been described as \"formidable and confusing\", with few authorities listing the same set of subspecies. There are hundreds of obsolete brown-bear subspecies. As many as 90 subspecies have been proposed. A 2008 DNA analysis identified as few as five main clades, which comprise all extant brown bear species, while a 2017 phylogenetic study revealed nine clades, including one representing polar bears. As of 2005[ [update]], 15 extant, or recently extinct, subspecies were recognized by the general scientific community.\nDNA analysis shows that, apart from recent, human-caused population fragmentation, brown bears in North America are generally part of a single interconnected population system, with the exception of the population (or subspecies) in the Kodiak Archipelago, which has probably been isolated since the end of the last Ice Age. These data demonstrate that \"U. a. gyas\", \"U. a. horribilis\", \"U. a. sitkensis\", and \"U. a. stikeenensis\" are not distinct or cohesive groups, and would more accurately be described as ecotypes. For example, brown bears in any particular region of the Alaska coast are more closely related to adjacent grizzly bears than to distant populations of brown bears.\nThe history of the bears of the Alexander Archipelago is unusual in that these island populations carry polar bear DNA, presumably originating from a population of polar bears that was left behind at the end of the Pleistocene, but have since been connected with adjacent mainland populations through the movement of males, to the point where their nuclear genomes indicate more than 90% brown bear ancestry. MtDNA analysis revealed that brown bears are apparently divided into five different clades, some of which coexist or co-occur in different regions.\nEvolution.\nThe brown bear is one of eight extant species in the bear family Ursidae and of six extant species in the subfamily Ursinae. One possible phylogeny is based on complete mitochondrial DNA sequences from Yu et al. (2007). The polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping, while the relationships of the other species are not very well resolved.\nA more recent phylogeny is based on the genetic study of Kumar et al. (2017). It concludes that Ursine bears originated around five million years ago, with extensive hybridization among the different species.\nThe brown bear is thought to have evolved from the Etruscan bear (\"Ursus etruscus\") in Asia during the early Pliocene. A genetic analysis indicated that the brown bear lineage diverged from the cave bear species-complex approximately 1.2\u20131.4\u00a0million years ago, but did not clarify if \"U. savini\" persisted as a paraspecies for the brown bear before perishing. The oldest brown bear fossils occur in Asia from about 500,000 to 300,000 years ago. They entered Europe 250,000 years ago and North Africa shortly after. Brown bear remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the British Isles, where, amongst other factors, they may have contributed to the extinction of cave bears (\"Ursus spelaeus\").\nBrown bears first emigrated to North America from Eurasia via Beringia during the Illinoian Glaciation. Genetic evidence suggests that several brown bear populations migrated into North America, aligning with the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene. The founding population of most North American brown bears arrived first, with the genetic lineage developing around ~177,000 BP. Genetic divergences suggest that brown bears first migrated south during MIS-5 (~92,000\u201383,000 BP), upon the opening of the ice-free corridor. After a local extinction in Beringia ~33,000 BP, two new but closely related lineages repopulated Alaska and northern Canada from Eurasia after the Last Glacial Maximum (&gt;25,000 BP).\nBrown-bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky, and Labrador show that the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records. In North America, two types of the subspecies \"Ursus arctos horribilis\" are generally recognized\u2014the coastal brown bear and the inland grizzly bear.\nHybrids.\nA grizzly\u2013polar bear hybrid is a rare ursid hybrid resulting from a crossbreeding of a brown bear with a polar bear. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid was confirmed by testing the DNA of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the Canadian Arctic, and seven more hybrids have since been confirmed in the same region, all descended from a single female polar bear. Previously, the hybrid had been produced in zoos and was considered a \"cryptid\" (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild). Analyses of the genomes of bears have shown that introgression between species was widespread during the evolution of the genus \"Ursus\", including the introgression of polar-bear DNA introduced to brown bears during the Pleistocene.\nDescription.\nSize.\nThe brown bear is the most variable in size of modern bears. The typical size depends upon which population it is from, as most accepted subtypes vary widely in size. This is in part due to sexual dimorphism, as male brown bears average at least 30% larger than females in most subtypes. Individual bears vary in size seasonally, weighing the least in spring due to lack of foraging during hibernation, and the most in late fall, after a period of hyperphagia to put on additional weight to prepare for hibernation.\nBrown bears generally weigh , with males outweighing females. They have a head-and-body length of and a shoulder height of . The tail is relatively short, as in all bears, ranging from in length. The smallest brown bears, females during spring among barren-ground populations, can weigh so little as to roughly match the body mass of males of the smallest living bear species, the sun bear (\"Helarctos malayanus\"), while the largest coastal populations attain sizes broadly similar to those of the largest living bear species, the polar bear. Brown bears of the interior are generally smaller, being around the same weight as an average lion, at an average of in males and in females, whereas adults of the coastal populations weigh about twice as much. The average weight of adult male bears, from 19 populations, was found to be while adult females from 24 populations were found to average .\nColoration.\nBrown bears are often not fully brown. They have long, thick fur, with a moderately elongated mane at the back of the neck which varies somewhat across bear types. In India, brown bears can be reddish with silver-tipped hairs, while in China, brown bears are bicolored, with a yellowish-brown or whitish collar across the neck, chest, and shoulders. Even within well-defined subspecies, individuals may show highly variable hues of brown. North American grizzlies can be from dark brown (almost black) to cream (almost white) or yellowish-brown and often have darker-colored legs. The common name \"grizzly\" stems from their typical coloration, with the hairs on their back usually being brownish-black at the base and whitish-cream at the tips, giving them their distinctive \"grizzled\" color. Apart from the cinnamon subspecies of the American black bear (\"U. americanus cinnamonum\"), the brown bear is the only modern bear species to typically appear truly brown. The brown bear's winter fur is very thick and long, especially in northern subspecies, and can reach at the withers. The winter hairs are thin, yet rough to the touch. The summer fur is much shorter and sparser, with its length and density varying among geographic ranges.\nCranial morphology and size.\nAdults have massive, heavily built, concave skulls, which are large in proportion to the body. The projections of the skull are well developed. Skull lengths of Russian brown bears tend to be for males, and for females. Brown bears have the broadest skull of any extant ursine bear. The width of the zygomatic arches in males is , and in females. Brown bears have strong jaws: the incisors and canine teeth are large, with the lower canines being strongly curved. The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single-crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of its alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age. The teeth of brown bears reflect their dietary plasticity and are broadly similar to those of other bears. They are reliably larger than teeth of American black bears, but average smaller in molar length than those of polar bears.\nClaws and feet.\nBrown bears have large, curved claws, with the front ones being larger than the back. They may reach and measure along the curve. Compared with the American black bear (\"Ursus americanus\"), the brown bear has longer and stronger claws, with a blunt curve. Due to their claw structure, in addition to their excessive weight, adult brown bears are not able to climb trees as well as black bears. In rare cases adult female brown bears have been seen scaling trees. The claws of a polar bear are quite different, being notably shorter but broader with a strong curve and sharper point. The species has large paws; the rear feet measure long, while the forefeet tend to measure 40% less. Brown bears are the only extant bears with a hump at the top of their shoulder, which is made entirely of muscle. This feature developed presumably to impart more force in digging, which helps during foraging and facilitates den construction prior to hibernation.\nDistribution and habitat.\nBrown bears inhabit the broadest range of habitats of any living bear species. They seem to have no altitudinal preferences and have been recorded from sea level to an elevation of in the Himalayas. In most of their range, brown bears seem to prefer semi-open country, with a scattering of vegetation, that can allow them a resting spot during the day. However, they have been recorded as inhabiting every variety of northern temperate forest known to occur.\nThis species was once native to Europe, much of Asia, the Atlas Mountains of Africa, and North America, but are now extirpated in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas. There are approximately 200,000 brown bears left in the world. The largest populations are in Russia with 130,000, the United States with 32,500, and Canada with around 25,000. Brown bears live in Alaska, east through the Yukon and Northwest Territories, south through British Columbia, and through the western half of Alberta. The Alaskan population is estimated at a healthy 30,000 individuals. In the lower 48 states, they are repopulating slowly, but steadily along the Rockies and the western Great Plains.\nIn Europe, in 2010, there were 14,000 brown bears in ten fragmented populations, from Spain (estimated at only 20\u201325 animals in the Pyrenees in 2010, in a range shared between Spain, France, and Andorra, and some 210 animals in Asturias, Cantabria, Galicia, and Le\u00f3n, in the Picos de Europa and adjacent areas in 2013) in the west, to Russia in the east, and from Sweden and Finland in the north to Romania (5,000\u20136,000), Bulgaria (900\u20131,200), Slovakia (with about 600\u2013800 animals), Slovenia (500\u2013700 animals), and Greece (with Karamanlidis et al. 2015 estimating &gt;450 animals) in the south. In Asia, brown bears are found primarily throughout Russia, thence more spottily southwest to parts of the Middle East, including the Eastern Black Sea Region, Turkey which has 5,432 individuals of brown bear, to as far south as southwestern Iran, and to the southeast in Northeast China. Brown bears are also found in Western China, Kyrgyzstan, North Korea, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. A population of brown bears can be found on the Japanese island of Hokkaido, which holds the largest number of non-Russian brown bears in eastern Asia, with about 2,000\u20133,000 animals.\nConservation status.\nWhile the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least-concern species by the IUCN, with a total population of approximately 200,000. As of 2012[ [update]], the brown bear and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN. However, the California grizzly bear, Ungava brown bear, Atlas bear, and Mexican grizzly bear, as well as brown bear populations in the Pacific Northwest, were hunted to extinction in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered. The Syrian brown bear (\"U. a. syriacus\") is very rare and it has been extirpated from more than half of its historic range. One of the smallest-bodied subspecies, the Himalayan brown bear (\"U. a. isabellinus\"), is critically endangered: it occupies only 2% of its former range and is threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts. The Marsican brown bear in central Italy is believed to have a population of just 50 bears.\nThe smallest populations are most vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation, whereas the largest are primarily threatened by overhunting. The use of land for agriculture may negatively effect brown bears. Additionally, roads and railway tracks could pose a serious threat, as oncoming vehicles may collide with crossing animals. Poaching has been cited as another mortality factor. In one instance, a 3-year-long survey in the Russian Far East detected the illegal shipping of brown bear gallbladders to Southeast Asian countries. The purpose and motive behind the trade is unknown.\nAn action plan in 2000 aimed to conserve brown bears in Europe by mitigating human\u2013wildlife conflict, educating farm owners as to sustainable practices, and preserving and expanding remaining forests. Compensation was given to people who suffered losses of livestock, food supplies, or shelter. Growing bear populations were recorded in some countries, such as Sweden, where an increase of 1.5% per annum occurred between the 1940s and 1990s. Brown bears in Central Asia are primarily threatened by climate change. In response to this, conservationists plan on building wildlife corridors to promote easy access from one brown bear population to another. In Himalayan Nepal, farmers may kill brown bears in revenge for livestock predation.\nBehavior and life history.\nA 2014 study revealed that brown bears peaked in activity around the morning and early evening hours. Although activity can happen day or night, bears that live in locations where they are apt to interact with humans are more likely to be fully nocturnal. \nIn areas with little interaction, many adult bears are primarily crepuscular, while yearlings and newly independent bears appear to be most active throughout the day. From summer through autumn, a brown bear can double its weight from what it was in the spring, gaining up to of fat, on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes lethargic. Although they are not full hibernators and can be woken easily, both sexes prefer to den in a protected spot during the winter months. Hibernation dens may be located at any spot that provides cover from the elements and that can accommodate their bodies, such as a cave, crevice, cavernous tree roots, or hollow logs.\nBrown bears have one of the largest brains of any extant carnivoran relative to their body size and have been shown to engage in tool use, which requires advanced cognitive abilities. This species is mostly solitary, although bears may gather in large numbers at major food sources (e.g., open garbage dumps or rivers containing spawning salmon) and form social hierarchies based on age and size. Adult male bears are particularly aggressive and are avoided by adolescent and subadult males, both at concentrated feeding opportunities and chance encounters. Females with cubs rival adult males in aggression and are much more intolerant of other bears than single females. Young adolescent males tend to be least aggressive and have been observed in nonantagonistic interactions with each other. Dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing off canine teeth, muzzle twisting, and neck stretching, to which a subordinate will respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head, and by sitting or lying down. During combat, bears use their paws to strike their opponents in the chest or shoulders and bite the head or neck.\nCommunication.\nSeveral different facial expressions have been documented in brown bears. The \"relaxed-face\" is made during everyday activities, a face where the ears pointed to the sides and the mouth closed or slackly open. During social play, bears make \"relaxed open-mouth face\" in which the mouth is open, with a curled upper lip and hanging lower lip, and the ears alert and shifting. When looking at another animal at a distance, the bear makes an \"alert face\" as the ears are cocked and alert, the eyes wide open with the mouth is closed or only open slightly. The \"tense closed mouth face\" is made with the ears laid back and the mouth closed, and occurs when the bear feels threatened. When approached by another individual, the animal makes a \"puckered-lip face\" with a protruding upper lip and ears that go from cocked and alert when at a certain distance to laid back when closer or when retreating. The \"jaw gape face\" consists of an open mouth with visible lower canines and hanging lips while the \"biting face\" is similar to the \"relaxed open-mouth face\" except the ears are flattened and the eyes are wide enough to expose the sclera. Both the \"jaw gape face\" and the \"biting face\" are made when the bear is aggressive and can quickly switch between them.\nBrown bears also produce various vocalizations. Huffing occurs when the animal is tense, while woofing is made when alarmed. Both sounds are produced by exhalations, though huffing is harsher and is made continuously (approximately twice per second). Growls and roars are made when aggressive. Growling is \"harsh\" and \"guttural\" and can range from a simple \"grrr\" to a rumble. A rumbling growl can escalate to a roar when the bear is charging. Roaring is described as \"thunderous\" and can travel . Mothers and cubs wanting physical contact will bawl, which is heard as \"waugh!, waugh!\".\nHome ranges.\nBrown bears usually inhabit vast home ranges; however, they are not highly territorial. Several adult bears roam freely over the same vicinity without contention, unless rights to a fertile female or food sources are being contested. Despite their lack of traditional territorial behavior, adult males seem to have a \"personal zone\" within which other bears are not tolerated if they are seen. Males always wander further than females, due to such behavior giving increasing access to both females and food sources. Females have the advantage of inhabiting smaller territories, which decreases the likelihood of encounters with male bears who may endanger their cubs.\nIn areas where food is abundant, such as coastal Alaska, home ranges for females and males are up to and , respectively. Similarly, in British Columbia, bears of the two sexes travel in relatively compact home ranges of . In Yellowstone National Park, home ranges for females are up to and up to for males. In Romania, the largest home range was recorded for adult males (). In the central Arctic of Canada, where food sources are quite scarce, home ranges range up to for females and for males.\nReproduction.\nThe mating season occurs from mid-May to early July, shifting to later in the year the farther north the bears are found. Brown bears are polygynandrous, remaining with the same mate for a couple of days to a couple of weeks and mating multiply during the mating season. Outside of this narrow time frame, adult male and female brown bears show no sexual interest in each other. Females mature sexually between the ages of four and eight. Males first mate about a year later, when they are large and strong enough to compete with other males for mating rights. Males will try to mate with as many females as they can; usually a successful male will mate with two females in a span of one to three weeks. Similarly, adult female brown bears can mate with up to four, sometimes even eight, males while in oestrus (heat), potentially mating with two in a single day. Females come into oestrus every three to four years, with an outside range of 2.4 to 5.7 years. The urine markings of a female in oestrus can attract several males via scent. Dominant males may try to sequester a female for her entire oestrus period of approximately two weeks, but usually are unable to retain her for the entire time. Copulation is prolonged and lasts for over 20 minutes.\nMales take no part in raising cubs \u2013 parenting is left entirely to the females. Through the process of delayed implantation, a female's fertilized egg divides and floats freely in the uterus for six months. During winter dormancy, the fetus attaches to the uterine wall. The cubs are born eight weeks later, while the mother sleeps. If the mother does not gain enough weight to survive through the winter while gestating, the embryo does not implant and is reabsorbed into the body. Litters consist of as many as six cubs, though litters of one to three are more typical. The size of a litter depends on factors such as geographic location and food supply. At birth, cubs are blind, toothless and hairless and may weigh . There are records of females sometimes adopting stray cubs or even trading or kidnapping cubs when they emerge from hibernation (a larger female may claim cubs from a smaller one). Older and larger females within a population tend to give birth to larger litters. The cubs feed on their mother's milk until spring or early summer, depending on climate conditions. At this time, the cubs weigh and have developed enough to follow and forage for solid food with their mother over long distances.\nThe cubs are dependent on the mother and a close bond is formed. During the dependency stage, the cubs learn (rather than inherit as instincts from birth) survival techniques, such as which foods have the highest nutritional value and where to obtain them; how to hunt, fish, and defend themselves; and where to den. Increased brain size in large carnivores has been positively linked to whether a given species is solitary, as is the brown bear, or raises offspring communally. Thus, the relatively large, well-developed brain of a female brown bear is presumably key in teaching behavior. The cubs learn by following and imitating their mother's actions during the period they are with her. Cubs remain with their mother for an average of 2.5 years in North America, and gain independence from as early as 1.5 years of age to as late as 4.5 years. The stage at which independence is attained may generally be earlier in some parts of Eurasia, as the latest date which mother and cubs were together was 2.3 years. Most families separated in under two years in a study in Hokkaido, and in Sweden most yearlings were their own. Brown bears practice infanticide, as an adult male bear may kill the cubs of another. When an adult male brown bear kills a cub, it is usually because he is trying to bring the female into oestrus, as she will enter that state within two to four days after the death of her cubs. Cubs may flee up a tree when they see a strange male bear approaching. The mother often successfully defends them, even though the male may be twice as heavy as she. However, females have been known to die in such confrontations.\nDietary habits.\nThe brown bear is one of the most omnivorous animals and has been recorded as consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear. Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary food energy from vegetable matter. They often feed on a variety of plant life, including berries, grasses, flowers, acorns, and pine cones, as well as fungi such as mushrooms. Among all bears, brown bears are uniquely equipped to dig for tough foods such as roots, bulbs, and shoots. They use their long, strong claws to dig out earth to reach roots and their powerful jaws to bite through them. In spring, winter-provided carrion, grasses, shoots, sedges, moss, and forbs are the dietary mainstays for brown bears internationally. Fruits, including berries, become increasingly important during summer and early autumn. Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor.\nThey will also commonly consume animal matter, which in summer and autumn may regularly be in the form of insects, larvae, and grubs, including beehives. Bears in Yellowstone eat an enormous number of moths during the summer, sometimes as many as 40,000 army cutworm moths in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects. Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat crabs and clams. In Alaska, bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for clams. This species may eat birds and their eggs, including almost entirely ground- or rock-nesting species. The diet may be supplemented by rodents or similar small mammals, including marmots, ground squirrels, mice, rats, lemmings, and voles. With particular regularity, bears in Denali National Park will wait at burrows of Arctic ground squirrels, hoping to pick off a few of those rodents.\nIn the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears feed mostly on spawning salmon, whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in those areas. The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow water, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of salmon spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutrious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include red foxes, bald eagles, common ravens, and gulls. Despite their normally solitary habits, brown bears will gather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and will sometimes fight over the rights to them.\nBeyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators. While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at large prey at one point in their lives, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive. On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age. Large mammals preyed on can include various ungulate species such as elk, moose, caribou, muskoxen, and wild boar. When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, which are easier to catch. Typically when hunting (especially young prey), the bear pins its prey to the ground and then immediately tears at and eats it alive. It will also bite or swipe some prey to stun it enough to knock it over for consumption. In general, large mammalian prey is killed with raw strength and bears do not display the specialized killing methods of felids and canids. To pick out young or infirm individuals, bears will charge at herds so the more vulnerable, and thus slower-moving, individuals will become apparent. Brown bears may ambush young animals by finding them via scent.\nWhen emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose, whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow. Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil. On rare occasions, while confronting fully-grown, dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison. They feed on carrion, and use their size to intimidate other predators \u2013 such as wolves, cougars, tigers, and American black bears \u2013 away from their kills. Carrion is especially important in the early spring (when the bears are emerging from hibernation), much of it comprising winter-killed big game. Cannibalism is not unheard of, though predation is not normally believed to be the primary motivation when brown bears attack each other.\nWhen forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Among these, domestic cattle are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back, or head, and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating. Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including corn, wheat, sorghum, melons, and any form of berries. They may feed on domestic bee yards, readily consuming both honey and the brood (grubs and pupae) of the honey bee colony. Human foods and trash are eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers. The dump was closed after both brown and American black bears came to associate humans with food and lost their natural fear of them.\nRelations with other predators.\nAdult bears are generally immune to predatory attacks except from large Siberian (Amur) tigers and other bears. Following a decrease of ungulate populations from 1944 to 1959, 32 cases of Siberian tigers attacking both Ussuri brown bears (\"Ursus arctos lasiotus\") and Ussuri black bears (\"U. thibetanus ussuricus\") were recorded in the Russian Far East, and bear hairs were found in several tiger scat samples. Tigers attack black bears less often than brown bears, since the brown bears live in more open habitats and are not able to climb trees. In the same time period, four cases of brown bears killing female tigers and young cubs were reported, both in disputes over prey and in self-defense. In rare cases, when Amur tigers prey on brown bears, they usually target young and sub-adult bears, besides small female adults taken outside their dens, generally when lethargic from hibernation. Predation by tigers on denned brown bears was not detected during a study carried out between 1993 and 2002. Ussuri brown bears, along with the smaller black bears constitute 2.1% of the Siberian tiger's annual diet, of which 1.4% are brown bears.\nBrown bears regularly intimidate wolves to drive them away from their kills. In Yellowstone National Park, bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, \"It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when.\" Despite the animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side. Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other at the same kill. To date, there is a single recorded case of fully-grown wolves being killed by a grizzly bear. Given the opportunity, however, both species will prey on the other's cubs. In some areas, grizzly bears regularly displace cougars from their kills. Cougars kill small bear cubs on rare occasions, but there was only one report of a bear killing a cougar, of unknown age and condition, between 1993 and 1996. \nBrown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, American black bears are at a competitive disadvantage to grizzly bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by grizzly bears has been documented, actual killing of black bears by grizzlies has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the grizzly's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces. Brown bears may also kill Asian black bears, though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the brown bear, due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American black species. As of the 21st century, there has been an increase in interactions between brown bears and polar bears, theorized to be caused by climate change. Brown and grizzly bears have been seen moving increasingly northward into territories formerly claimed by polar bears. They tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses, and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens.\nLongevity and mortality.\nThe brown bear has a naturally long life. Wild females have been observed reproducing at 28 years, which is the oldest known age for reproduction of any ursid in the wild. The peak reproductive age for females ranges from four to 20 years old. The lifespan of both sexes within minimally hunted populations is estimated at an average of 25 years. The oldest recorded wild individual was nearly 37 years old. In captivity, the oldest recorded female was around 40 years old, while males have been known to live up to 47 years.\nWhile male bears potentially live longer in captivity, female grizzly bears have a greater annual survival rate than males within wild populations, per a study done in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Annual mortality for bears of any age is estimated at 10% in most protected areas. Around 13% to 44% of cubs die within their first year. Beyond predation by large predators \u2013 including wolves, Siberian tigers, and other brown bears \u2013 starvation and accidents also claim the lives of cubs. Studies have indicated that the most prevalent cause of mortality for first-year cubs is malnutrition.\nBrown bears are susceptible to parasites such as flukes, ticks, tapeworms, roundworms, and biting lice. It is thought that brown bears may catch canine distemper virus (CDV) from other caniforms such as stray dogs and wolves. A captive individual allegedly succumbed to Aujeszky's disease.\nHibernation physiology.\nA study conducted by the Brown Bear Research Project did a proteomic analysis of the brown bear's blood, organs, and tissues to pinpoint proteins and peptides that either increased or decreased in expression in the winter and summer months. One major finding was that the presence of the plasma protein sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) increased by 45 times during the brown bear's hibernation period. Although scientists do not yet understand the role of SHBG in maintaining the brown bear's health, some believe these findings could potentially help in understanding and preventing human diseases that come from a sedentary lifestyle.\nRelations with humans.\nAttacks on humans.\nBrown bears usually avoid areas where extensive development or urbanization has occurred. They usually avoid people and rarely attack on sight. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and may attack if threatened or surprised. Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of brown bear-caused human fatalities in North America. Attacks tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death. Due to the bears' enormous physical strength, a single bite or swipe can be deadly. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back.\nA study conducted in 2019 found that 664 bear attacks were reported during a 15-year period (2000\u20132015) throughout North America and Eurasia. There were 568 injuries and 95 fatalities. Around 10 people a year are killed by brown bears in Russia, more than all the other parts of the brown bear's range combined. In Japan, a large brown bear nicknamed \"Kesagake\" (\"kesa-style slasher\") caused the worst brown bear attack in Japanese history in Tomamae, Hokkaido, during numerous encounters during December 1915. It killed seven people and wounded three others before being gunned down during a large-scale beast-hunt. A study by U.S. and Canadian researchers has found bear spray to be more effective at stopping aggressive bear behavior than guns, working in 92% of studied incidents, versus 67% for guns.\nBear hunting.\nHumans have been recorded hunting brown bears for over 10,300\u20139,300 years. Bears were hunted throughout their range in Europe, Asia and North America by both the Native Americans and Europeans. The former usually killed bears for survival needs, while the latter for sports or population control. In Europe, between the 17th and 18th centuries, humans sought to control brown bear numbers by awarding those who managed to kill one. This bounty scheme pushed the brown bear population to the brink of extinction before comprehensive protection was offered in the 1900s. Despite this, a 2018 study found hunting to be one of the contributing factors to the drop in brown bear numbers in northern Europe.\nThe earliest known case of a European killing a grizzly bear dates back to 1691. Their arrival in western United States led to the extirpation of local brown bear populations in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During the early years of European settlement in North America, bears were usually killed with a spear or lasso rope. The introduction of rifles in the mid-19th century largely facilitated bear hunts, which allowed for an increasing trend. Bears were also pitted into fights against male cattle, often ending with either animal grievously injured or dead. The last two decades of the 19th century saw an increase in bounties. Conflicts with farmers also contributed to its rapid decline. It wasn't until the 1920s that grizzly bears received some type of protection from the US government. Today, brown bears are legally hunted in some American states, such as Alaska. However, a hunting license is required and killings of nurturing females and cubs will result in a prison sentence.\nBrown bear meat is sometimes consumed and used in recipes such as dumplings, hams and stews. The Indigenous people of James Bay (Eastern) Cree use their flesh in traditional dishes. In Asia and Romania, the paws are consumed as exotic delectables; they have been a prevalent component of traditional Chinese food since 500 BC. The total weight of commercially sold brown bear meat is estimated at 17 tons annually.\nIn captivity.\nBears have been recorded in captivity as early as 1,500 BC. As of 2017, there are more than 700 brown bears in zoos and wildlife parks worldwide. Captive bears are largely lethargic and spend a considerable amount of time doing nothing. When active, captive bears may engage in repetitive back and forth motion, known widely as pacing. This behavior is most prevalent in bears kept in small, cramped cages often with no natural setting. Pacing is a way of coping with stress that comes with being trapped in unnaturally small spaces. These stereotyped behaviors have decreased due to better and larger enclosures being built, and more sustainable management from zoo staff.\nStarting from infancy, brown bears may also be exploited as dancing bears. Cubs, for example, are positioned on hot metal plates, causing them to \"dance\" to the sound of violin music running in the background. The process is repeated, resulting in bears being trained to \"dance\" when a violin is played. Similarly, brown bears are displayed in tiny enclosures near a restaurant, mainly for the purpose of luring customers. Privately owned bears are also placed in insufficient environments and often suffer from malnutrition and obesity. \nBrown bears have been popular attractions at circuses and other acts since ancient times. Due to their large size and imposing demeanor, the Romans used brown bears in the execution of criminals, and pitted bears in fights with other animals. Gladiators would also fight bears, in what was essentially a fight to the death. Such events occurred in amphitheaters housing thousands of spectators. In later times, street performances became popular in the Middle Ages; acts included \"dancing\" and \"sleeping on command\". These performances became increasingly widespread, and from the 1700s to 1800s, traveling circuses would perform in the streets of many European and Asian countries. Such circuses made use of bears that wore special clothing, and were usually run by musicians. A short while later, modern circuses began utilizing bears around the second half of the 18th century. Brown bears were said to be the easiest bear species to train due to their intelligence, unique personalities, and exceptional stability. According to a 2009 analysis, the brown bear was the second most exploited circus animal after the tiger.\nCulture.\nBears have been popular subjects in art, literature, folklore, and mythology. The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female's devotion and protection of her cubs. The earliest cave paintings of bears occurred in the Paleolithic, with over 100 recorded paintings. Brown bears often figure in the literature of Europe and North America as \"cute and cuddly\", in particular that which is written for children. \"The Brown Bear of Norway\" is a Scottish fairy tale telling of the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love after many trials and tribulations. With \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\", a story from England, the Three Bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German-speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of \"Snow White and Rose Red\"; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book \"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?\" to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals. Smokey Bear, the famous mascot of U.S. Forest Service, has since the 1940s been used to educate people on the dangers of human-caused wildfire.\nBrown bears have been extensively featured in the culture of Native Americans, and are considered sacred. To stop a bear's spirit from escaping after it was killed, the Denaa people severed all 4 of its paws. They delayed consuming brown-bear flesh, owing to the belief that the bear's spirit was overwhelming in fresh kills. In addition, community members that wore bear claw necklaces were highly respected, as wearing one was seen as a sign of bravery and honor. The clattering caused by repeatedly shaking these necklaces were believed to bring forth therapeutic powers. In Haida culture, one legend has it that a marriage between a woman and a grizzly bear commenced the lineage of the native people. This is thought to have allowed the Haida to thrive in bear country.\nThere is evidence of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists. It is possible that bear worship existed in early Chinese and Ainu cultures. The Romans built small carved figures of bears that were used during the burials of infants. In Ancient Greek mythology, bears were considered similar to humans, mainly due to their ability to stand upright. In many western stories and older fables the portrayed attributes of bears are sluggishness, foolishness, and gullibility, which contradicts the actual behavior of the species. For example, bears have been reported tricking hunters by backtracking in the snow. \nIn North America, the brown bear is considered a charismatic megafauna and has long piqued people's interest. The death of Bear 148 at the hands of a trophy hunter in 2017 sparked media outrage and the continued disapproval of trophy hunting. The Russian bear is a common national personification for Russia (as well as the former Soviet Union), despite the country having no officially-designated national animal. The brown bear is Finland's national animal. The grizzly bear is the state animal of Montana. The California golden bear is the state animal of California, despite being extinct. The coat of arms of Madrid depicts a bear reaching up into a madro\u00f1o or strawberry tree (\"Arbutus unedo\") to eat some of its fruit. The Swiss city of Bern's coat of arms depicts a bear and the city's name is popularly thought to derive from the German word for bear. The brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5-kuna coin, minted since 1993.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The theory describes superconductivity as a microscopic effect caused by a condensation of Cooper pairs. The theory is also used in nuclear physics to describe the pairing interaction between nucleons in an atomic nucleus.\nIt was proposed by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer in 1957; they received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this theory in 1972. \nHistory.\nRapid progress in the understanding of superconductivity gained momentum in the mid-1950s. It began with the 1948 paper, \"On the Problem of the Molecular Theory of Superconductivity\", where Fritz London proposed that the phenomenological London equations may be consequences of the coherence of a quantum state. In 1953, Brian Pippard, motivated by penetration experiments, proposed that this would modify the London equations via a new scale parameter called the coherence length. John Bardeen then argued in the 1955 paper, \"Theory of the Meissner Effect in Superconductors\", that such a modification naturally occurs in a theory with an energy gap. The key ingredient was Leon Cooper's calculation of the bound states of electrons subject to an attractive force in his 1956 paper, \"Bound Electron Pairs in a Degenerate Fermi Gas\".\nIn 1957 Bardeen and Cooper assembled these ingredients and constructed such a theory, the BCS theory, with Robert Schrieffer. The theory was first published in April 1957 in the letter, \"Microscopic theory of superconductivity\". The demonstration that the phase transition is second order, that it reproduces the Meissner effect and the calculations of specific heats and penetration depths appeared in the December 1957 article, \"Theory of superconductivity\". They received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972 for this theory.\nIn 1986, high-temperature superconductivity was discovered in La-Ba-Cu-O, at temperatures up to 30\u00a0K. Following experiments determined more materials with transition temperatures up to about 130\u00a0K, considerably above the previous limit of about 30\u00a0K. It is experimentally very well known that the transition temperature strongly depends on pressure. In general, it is believed that BCS theory alone cannot explain this phenomenon and that other effects are in play. These effects are still not yet fully understood; it is possible that they even control superconductivity at low temperatures for some materials.\nOverview.\nAt sufficiently low temperatures, electrons near the Fermi surface become unstable against the formation of Cooper pairs. Cooper showed such binding will occur in the presence of an attractive potential, no matter how weak. In conventional superconductors, an attraction is generally attributed to an electron-lattice interaction. The BCS theory, however, requires only that the potential be attractive, regardless of its origin. In the BCS framework, superconductivity is a macroscopic effect which results from the condensation of Cooper pairs. These have some bosonic properties, and bosons, at sufficiently low temperature, can form a large Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. Superconductivity was simultaneously explained by Nikolay Bogolyubov, by means of the Bogoliubov transformations.\nIn many superconductors, the attractive interaction between electrons (necessary for pairing) is brought about indirectly by the Bardeen\u2013Pines interaction between the electrons and the vibrating crystal lattice (the phonons). Roughly speaking the picture is the following:\nAn electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite spin, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very strongly and form a highly collective condensate. In this \"condensed\" state, the breaking of one pair will change the energy of the entire condensate - not just a single electron, or a single pair. Thus, the energy required to break any single pair is related to the energy required to break \"all\" of the pairs (or more than just two electrons). Because the pairing increases this energy barrier, kicks from oscillating atoms in the conductor (which are small at sufficiently low temperatures) are not enough to affect the condensate as a whole, or any individual \"member pair\" within the condensate. Thus the electrons stay paired together and resist all kicks, and the electron flow as a whole (the current through the superconductor) will not experience resistance. Thus, the collective behavior of the condensate is a crucial ingredient necessary for superconductivity.\nDetails.\nBCS theory starts from the assumption that there is some attraction between electrons, which can overcome the Coulomb repulsion. In most materials (in low temperature superconductors), this attraction is brought about indirectly by the coupling of electrons to the crystal lattice (as explained above). However, the results of BCS theory do \"not\" depend on the origin of the attractive interaction. For instance, Cooper pairs have been observed in ultracold gases of fermions where a homogeneous magnetic field has been tuned to their Feshbach resonance. The original results of BCS (discussed below) described an s-wave superconducting state, which is the rule among low-temperature superconductors but is not realized in many unconventional superconductors such as the d-wave high-temperature superconductors.\nExtensions of BCS theory exist to describe these other cases, although they are insufficient to completely describe the observed features of high-temperature superconductivity.\nBCS is able to give an approximation for the quantum-mechanical many-body state of the system of (attractively interacting) electrons inside the metal. This state is now known as the BCS state. In the normal state of a metal, electrons move independently, whereas in the BCS state, they are bound into Cooper pairs by the attractive interaction. The BCS formalism is based on the reduced potential for the electrons' attraction. Within this potential, a variational ansatz for the wave function is proposed. This ansatz was later shown to be exact in the dense limit of pairs. Note that the continuous crossover between the dilute and dense regimes of attracting pairs of fermions is still an open problem, which now attracts a lot of attention within the field of ultracold gases.\nUnderlying evidence.\nThe hyperphysics website pages at Georgia State University summarize some key background to BCS theory as follows:\n the existence of a critical temperature and critical magnetic field implied a band gap, and suggested a phase transition, but single electrons are forbidden from condensing to the same energy level by the Pauli exclusion principle. The site comments that \"a drastic change in conductivity demanded a drastic change in electron behavior\". Conceivably, pairs of electrons might perhaps act like bosons instead, which are bound by different condensate rules and do not have the same limitation. \n The Debye frequency of phonons in a lattice is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the mass of lattice ions. It was shown that the superconducting transition temperature of mercury indeed showed the same dependence, by substituting the most abundant natural mercury isotope, 202Hg, with a different isotope, 198Hg.\n An exponential increase in heat capacity near the critical temperature also suggests an energy bandgap for the superconducting material. As superconducting vanadium is warmed toward its critical temperature, its heat capacity increases greatly in a very few degrees; this suggests an energy gap being bridged by thermal energy.\n This suggests a type of situation where some kind of binding energy exists but it is gradually weakened as the temperature increases toward the critical temperature. A binding energy suggests two or more particles or other entities that are bound together in the superconducting state. This helped to support the idea of bound particles \u2013 specifically electron pairs \u2013 and together with the above helped to paint a general picture of paired electrons and their lattice interactions.\nImplications.\nBCS derived several important theoretical predictions that are independent of the details of the interaction, since the quantitative predictions mentioned below hold for any sufficiently weak attraction between the electrons and this last condition is fulfilled for many low temperature superconductors - the so-called weak-coupling case. These have been confirmed in numerous experiments:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4405", "revid": "50734473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4405", "title": "Biathlon", "text": "Winter sport of skiing and rifle shooting\nBiathlon is a winter sport that combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. The sport of biathlon involves many different types of races, with the commonality being contestants skiing through a cross-country trail whose distance is divided into shooting rounds called bouts. The shooting rounds do not have a time limit, but depending on the competition, missed shots result in extra distance or time being added to the contestant's total.\nHistory.\nAccording to \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", biathlon \"is rooted in the skiing traditions of Scandinavia, where early inhabitants revered the Norse god Ullr as both the ski god and the hunting god.\" In modern times, the activity that developed into this sport was an exercise for Norwegians as alternative training for the military. Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided into four classes: shooting at mark while skiing at top speed, downhill race among trees, downhill race on big hills without falling, and a long race on flat ground while carrying a rifle and military pack. In modern terminology, these military contests included downhill, slalom, biathlon, and cross-country skiing. One of the world's first known ski clubs, \"Trysil Skytte- og Skil\u00f8berforening\" (the Trysil Rifle and Ski Club), was formed in Norway in 1861 to promote national defense at the local level. 20th century variants include (the military contest), a 17\u00a0km cross-country race with shooting, and the military cross-country race at 30\u00a0km including marksmanship.\nThe modern biathlon is a civilian variant of the old military combined exercise. In Norway, the biathlon was, until 1984, a branch of , an organization set up by the government to promote civilian marksmanship in support of national defence. In Norwegian, the biathlon is called (literally \"ski shooting\"). In Norway, there are still separate contests in , a cross-country race at 12\u00a0km with large-caliber rifle shooting at various targets with unknown range.\nCalled military patrol, the combination of skiing and shooting was contested at the Winter Olympic Games in 1924 and then demonstrated in 1928, 1936, and 1948, during which time Norway and Finland were strong competitors. In 1948, the sport was reorganized under the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon and became re-accepted as an Olympic sport in 1955, with widespread popularity within the Soviet and Swedish winter sport circuits.\nThe first Biathlon World Championship was held in 1958 in Austria, and in 1960 the sport was finally included in the Olympic Games. At Albertville in 1992, women were first allowed in the Olympic biathlon. The pursuit format was added for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, and the IBU added mixed relay as a format for the 2006 Olympics.\nThe competitions from 1958 to 1965 made use of high-power centrefire cartridges, such as the .30-06 Springfield and the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, before the .22 Long Rifle rimfire cartridge was standardized in 1978. The ammunition was carried in several pouches on a belt worn around the competitor's waist. The sole event was the men's 20\u00a0km individual, encompassing four separate ranges and firing distances of 100\u00a0m, 150\u00a0m, 200\u00a0m, and 250\u00a0m. The target distance was reduced to 150\u00a0m with the addition of the relay in 1966. The shooting range was further reduced to 50\u00a0m in 1978 with the mechanical self-indicating targets making their debut at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. For the 2018\u20132019 season, fully electronic targets were approved as an alternative to paper targets used in zeroing or mechanical steel targets for IBU events.\nGoverning body.\nIn 1948, the International Modern Pentathlon Union (UIPM) was founded to standardize the rules for the modern pentathlon and from 1953 also biathlon. In July 1993, the biathlon branch of the UIPMB created the International Biathlon Union (IBU), which officially separated from the UIPMB in 1998.\nPresidents of the UIPMB/IBU:\nChampionships.\nThe following articles list major international biathlon events and medalists. Unlike the Olympics and World Championships (BWCH), the World Cup (BWC) is an entire winter season of (mostly) weekly races, where the medalists are those with the highest sums of World Cup points at the end of the season.\nRules and equipment.\nThe rules of the biathlon are given in the International Biathlon Union Competition Rules and the Annexes to the Event and Competition Rules which are updated by the IBU yearly.\nBasic concepts.\nA biathlon competition consists of a race in which contestants ski a series of loops on a cross-country trail system and includes either two or four shooting rounds called bouts, half in the prone position, the other half in the standing position. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total skiing distance/time. Depending on the event the contestant with the shortest total time or first to cross the finish line wins.\nFor each shooting bout, the biathlete must hit the five targets or receive a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules as follows:\nIn order to keep track of the contestants' progress and relative standing throughout a race, split times (intermediate times) are taken at several points along the skiing track and upon finishing each shooting bout. The large display screens commonly set up at biathlon arenas, as well as the information graphics shown as part of the TV picture, will typically list the split time of the fastest contestant at each intermediate point and the times and time differences to the closest runners-up.\nSkiing details.\nAt Olympic competitions , all cross-country skiing techniques are permitted in the biathlon, allowing the use of skate skiing, which is overwhelmingly the choice of competitors. The minimum ski length is the height of the skier minus 4\u00a0cm. The rifle has to be carried by the skier during the race by use of a harness and must be taken off during the shooting stages.\nShooting details.\nCompetitors carry a rifle chambered in the 22 long rifle diameter (.22 LR ), which must weigh at least , excluding spare ammunition, and loaded or empty magazines. The rifles use .22 LR ammunition which must have a bullet with a weight of 2.55-2.75 grams (39.35-42.43 grains) made of lead or a similar uniform soft material and use a bolt action or Ansch\u00fctz 1827F Fortner (or other straight-pull bolt) action. Each rifle holds 4 magazines using a magazine cassette (holds all 4) or a magazine holder (holds one) mounted to the rifle or available internally, with 5 rounds each. Additional rounds can be kept on the stock of the rifle for a relay race using what is called a spare round holder. Spare rounds can also be stored on the floor plate of the magazine. Spare round holders come in many configurations holding 2, 3, or 6 rounds of ammunition and are mounted in various places in the rifle stock depending on biathlete preferences. Additionally spare round compartments are sometimes built into sight risers, cheek pieces or the standing grip of the rifle's stock.\nThe targets sit a distance of . There are five concentric, circular, shooting targets to be hit in each shooting round or bout. When shooting in the prone position, the target diameter is ; when shooting in the standing position, the target diameter is . This translates to angular target sizes of 0.9 and 2.3 mrad respectively. A large assembly of 5 targets sits in each lane. When changing from prone targets to standing, the hit size or scoring zone of the target changes, but the size of the bull at which the biathlete aims remains unaltered. Meaning the perceived targets size remains the same while the \"hit-zone\" the biathlete's bullet must strike to achieve a hit decreases in the prone position when compared to the standing. The setting of these targets is either done with a pull rope (as is done on mechanical targets) or by use of a wireless remote (as is done on electronic targets). On biathlon ranges, a white paddle covers a hit target by using either the momentum of the bullet to flip a paddle or an acoustic system to determine the shots location moving and internal sliding cover this white indication method gives biathlete, as well as the spectators, instant visual feedback for each shot fired.\nEar protection is not required or generally used during biathlon shooting as the ammunition used is usually subsonic. An eyecup (blinder) is an optional feature of biathlon rifles.\nCompetition format.\nIndividual.\nThe individual race [ for women] is the oldest biathlon event; the distance is skied over five laps. The biathlete performs four bouts or shooting stages at any shooting lane (lanes 1\u201315 are in prone, while lanes 16\u201330 are for standing), in the order of prone, standing, prone, standing, totaling 20 targets. For each missed target, a fixed penalty time, usually one minute, is added to the skiing time of the biathlete. Competitors' starts are staggered, normally by 30 seconds.\nA variation of the standard individual race, called short individual, was introduced during the 2018\u201319 Biathlon IBU Cup. The races are 15\u00a0km for men and 12.5\u00a0km for women, and for each missed target, 45 seconds will be added to the skiing time.\nSprint.\nThe sprint is for men &amp; for women; the distance is skied over three laps. The biathlete performs two bouts or shooting stages at a lane of their choosing, once in the prone position (usually lanes 1\u201315) and once in the standing position (lanes 16\u201330), for a total of 10 shots. Most races designate these lanes for their positions in that is called a \"split range.\" The division of these lanes is marked with a pictorial sign showing an arrow and a representation of the designated position. For each missed shot, a penalty loop of 150\u00a0m must be skied before continuing the race. As in the individual competition, the biathletes start in a set of equal intervals as set by the race director.\nSuper Sprint.\nIntroduced at the 2017\u201318 Biathlon IBU Cup, the Super Sprint is a shorter version of the sprint race. Unlike the traditional sprint race, the Super Sprint is divided into two segments \u2013 qualification and final. The qualification is done like the traditional sprint, but on a 1.5\u00a0km lap with a total length of 4.5\u00a0km. Only the top 30 competitors qualify for the final, in which all competitors start simultaneously and do five laps on the same course (like in mass start) with a total race length of 4\u00a0km. During the final, the competitors have three spare rounds should they miss a target (like in relay race). However, if not all targets are cleared during shooting instead of going on the penalty loop, the biathlete is disqualified from the race.\nChanges were made for the following season with the course now being 1\u00a0km (0.2\u00a0km increase) meaning that the qualification race length will become 3\u00a0km, while the final race becomes 5\u00a0km in length. Also the number of spare rounds was decreased from three to one.\nPursuit.\nIn a pursuit, biathletes' starts are separated by their time differences from a previous race, most commonly a sprint. The contestant crossing the finish line first is the winner. The distance is 12.5\u00a0km for men and 10\u00a0km for women, skied over five laps; there are four shooting bouts (two prone, two standing, in that order) and each miss means a penalty loop of 150\u00a0m. To prevent awkward or dangerous crowding of the skiing loops and overcapacity at the shooting range, World Cup Pursuits are held with only the 60 top-ranking biathletes after the preceding race. The biathletes shoot on a first-come, first-served basis at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived for all shooting bouts. If the pursuit follows an individual biathlon race, the lag behind the winner is halved.\nMass start.\nIn the mass start, racers start in a series of rows and columns as determined by their previous results. The first racer to cross the finish line is declared winner. In this 15\u00a0km for men or 12.5\u00a0km for women competition, the distance is skied over a series of five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone, two standing, in that order), with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to the competitor's bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), with the rest of the shooting bouts being on a first-come, first-served basis (if a competitor arrives at the lane in fifth place, they shoot at lane 5). As in sprint and pursuit, competitors must ski one 150\u00a0m penalty loop for each miss. Here again, to avoid unwanted congestion, World Cup Mass starts are held with only the 30 top ranking athletes on the start line (half that of the Pursuit as here all contestants start simultaneously).\nMass start 60.\nStarting in the 2018/2019 season, the Mass Start 60 became part of the International Biathlon Union (IBU) competition formats. The Mass Start with 60 starters does not replace the current Mass Start with 30 starters.\nAll participants ski the first lap, but only the first 30 competitors perform a prone shooting bout, the next 30 consecutive contestants (designated by bib number) perform another lap on the course. At the end of the second lap, the second groups performs their first shooting bout, and the first 30 perform another lap on the course. After all biathletes have completed their first prone bout, the race progresses like a typical mass-start, all competitors complete their remaining prone bout, and two stages of standing shooting concurrently. Put more simply:\nBib 1\u201330 = lap, shoot1, lap, lap, shoot2, lap, shoot3, lap, shoot4, lap\nBib 31\u201360 = lap, lap, shoot1, lap, shoot2, lap, shoot3, lap, shoot4, lap\nRelay.\nThe relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski 7.5\u00a0km (men) or 6\u00a0km (women), each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets, there are eight rounds available. However, the last three can only be single-loaded manually, into the chamber of the firearm, one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If there are still remaining targets after 8 fired shots, one 150\u00a0m (490\u00a0ft) penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants all start simultaneously, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of their position in the race), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots on a first-come, first-served basis (arrive at the range in fifth place, shoot at lane 5).\nMixed relay.\nThe mixed relay is similar to the ordinary relay, but the teams are composed of two women and two men. From its first instance at the world championships in 2005 until the end of the 2017 season, the first two legs were always run by the women, followed by the men on legs 3 and 4. Since the 2018 season however, the race can be started by either the men or women. Additionally, for most of the event's history, the women's legs have been and the men's legs as in ordinary relay competitions. However, since the 2019 season the event has all four legs being either or .\nThis event was added to the Olympics starting in 2014.\nSingle mixed relay.\nIn 2015, the single mixed relay was introduced to the Biathlon World Cup by the IBU. The event is run on a course with a penalty loop, and each team consists of a female and a male biathlete. The race is divided into four legs, with the first three being or 2 laps and the final leg being or 3 laps, totalling . After each leg, the biathletes exchange so that each biathlete completes two legs. Specific to this format, the exchange happens immediately after the last shooting of each leg without skiing an additional lap (as is usually the case). The race can be started by either the female or male member of the relay, with the finishing member performing an extra lap. This event was added to the world championships in 2019.\nTeam (obsolete).\nA team consists of four biathletes, but unlike the relay competition, all team members start at the same time. Two athletes must shoot in the prone shooting round, the other two in the standing round. In case of a miss, the two non-shooting biathletes must ski a penalty loop of 150\u00a0m (490\u00a0ft). The skiers must enter the shooting area together and must also finish within 15 seconds of each other; otherwise, a time penalty of one minute is added to the total time. Since 2004, this race format has been obsolete at the World Cup level.\nBroadcasting.\nBiathlon events are broadcast most regularly where the sport enjoys its greatest popularity, namely Germany (ARD, ZDF), Austria (ORF), Norway (NRK), France (L'\u00c9quipe 21), Finland (YLE), Estonia (ETV), Latvia (LTV), Lithuania (LRT), Croatia (HRT), Poland (TVP), Ukraine (), Sweden (SVT), Russia (Match TV, Channel One), Belarus (TVR), Slovakia (RTVS), Slovenia (RTV), Bosnia and Herzegovina (BHRT), Bulgaria (BNT), and South Korea (KBS); it is broadcast on European-wide Eurosport, which also broadcasts to the Asia-Pacific region. World Cup races are streamed via the IBU website.\nBiathlon records and statistics.\nThe IBU maintains biathlon records, rules, news, videos, and statistics for many years back, all of which are available at its web site.\nHealth risks.\nBiathlon is generally considered to be a sport with a low risk of injuries or accidents, as is also the case with cross country skiing. While some injuries from firearms accidents were more common in the past, these led to higher safety standards.\nSince biathletes usually benefit from low body weight, professionals have a relatively high risk of eating disorders. Popular athletes who suffered from them were Miriam Neureuther, Elisa Gasparin and Lena H\u00e4cki-Gro\u00df. A study about female Norwegian junior athletes from 2016 also proofed the high amount of cases among them. Paul Schommer suffered from an eating disorder as a junior athlete too.\nSee also.\nBiathlon's two sports disciplines:\nOther multi-discipline sports (otherwise unrelated to biathlon):\nNotes and sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The food writer Howard Hillman classes it as one of the \"great peasant dishes of the world\". The dish has been known since at least the 18th century, and in its early versions it contained cooked beef; by the mid-20th century the two vegetables had become the principal ingredients.\nHistory.\nThe name of the dish, according to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (OED), alludes to the sounds made by the ingredients when being fried. The first recorded use of the name listed in the OED dates from 1762; \"The St James's Chronicle\", recording the dishes served at a banquet, included \"Bubble and Squeak, garnish'd with Eddowes Cow Bumbo, and Tongue\". A correspondent in \"The Public Advertiser\" two years later reported making \"a very hearty Meal on fryed Beef and Cabbage; though I could not have touched it had my Wife recommended it to me under the fashionable Appellation of \"Bubble and Squeak\"\". In 1791 another London paper recorded the quarterly meeting of the Bubble and Squeak Society at Smithfield.\nThe dish as it is made in modern times differs considerably from its first recorded versions, in which cooked beef was the main ingredient and potatoes did not feature. The earliest-known recipe is in Maria Rundell's \"A New System of Domestic Cookery\", published in 1806. It consists wholly of cabbage and rare roast beef, seasoned and fried. This method is followed by William Kitchiner in his book \"Apicius Redivivus, or The Cook's Oracle\" (1817); in later editions he adds a couplet at the top of his recipe:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n When 'midst the frying Pan in accents savage,\n The Beef, so surly, quarrels with the Cabbage. &lt;/poem&gt;\nMrs Beeton's recipe in her \"Book of Household Management\" (1861) similarly combines cooked beef with cabbage (and, in her recipe, onions) but no potato. An 1848 recipe from the US is similar, but adds chopped carrots. In all of these, the meat and vegetables are served next to each other, and not mixed together.\nIn 1872 a Lancashire newspaper offered a recipe for \"delicious bubble and squeak\", consisting of thinly sliced beef fried with cabbage and carrot, but not potatoes, although by then they had been a major crop in Lancashire for decades. In the 1880s potatoes began to appear in recipes. In 1882 the \"Household\" column of \"The Manchester Times\" suggested:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Bubble and Squeak. \u2013 Mash four potatoes, chop a plateful of cold greens, season with a small saltspoonful of salt and the same of pepper; mix well together, and fry in dissolved dripping or butter (three ounces), stirring all the time. Cut about three-quarters of a pound of cold, boiled beef into neat, thin slices. Fry slightly over a slow fire six minutes. Put the vegetables round the dish and the meat in the centre. Serve very hot.\nPotatoes featured in a recipe printed in a Yorkshire paper in 1892 but, as in earlier versions, the main ingredients were beef and cabbage.\nModern versions.\nPossibly because of the scarcity of beef during food rationing in and after the Second World War, by the latter half of the 20th century the basic ingredients were widely considered to be cooked and mashed (or coarsely crushed) potato and chopped cooked cabbage. Those are the only two ingredients in Delia Smith's 1987 recipe. Clarissa Dickson Wright's 1996 version consists of crushed cooked potatoes, finely chopped raw onion, and cooked cabbage (or Brussels sprouts), seasoned with salt and pepper, mixed together and shallow-fried until browned on the exterior. Like Smith, Dickson Wright specifies dripping (or lard) for frying, finding vegetable oil unsuitable for frying bubble and squeak, because the mixture will not brown adequately. Several other cooks find oil or butter satisfactory.\nFiona Beckett (2008), like Smith and Dickson Wright, stipulates no ingredients other than potato and cabbage,\nbut there are many published variants of the basic recipe. Gary Rhodes favours sliced Brussels sprouts, rather than cabbage, with gently cooked sliced onions and mashed potato, fried in butter. He comments that although the basic ingredients of bubble and squeak and colcannon are similar, the two are very different dishes, the former being traditionally made from leftovers and fried to give a brown crust, and the latter \"a completely separate dish of potato, spring onion and cabbage, served almost as creamed potatoes\".\nJeff Smith (1987) adds grated courgettes and chopped ham and bacon. Mark Hix (2005) adds cooked and chopped leeks and swede to the mix. Jamie Oliver (2007) adds chestnuts and \"whatever veg you like \u2013 carrots, Brussels, swedes, turnips, onions, leeks or Savoy cabbage\". Nigel Slater, in a 2013 recipe using Christmas leftovers, adds chopped goose, ham and pumpkin to the mixture.\nThe mixture is then shallow-fried, either shaped into round cakes or as a single panful and then sliced. The first method is suggested by Delia Smith, Hix and Slater; Rhodes finds both methods satisfactory; Dickson Wright, Oliver and Jeff Smith favour the whole-pan method.\nOutside Britain.\nBubble and squeak is familiar in Australia; a 1969 recipe adds peas and pumpkin to the basic mix. The dish is not common in the US but is not unknown; an American recipe from 1913 resembles Rundell's version, with the addition of a border of mashed potato. In 1983 the American food writer Howard Hillman included bubble and squeak in his survey \"Great Peasant Dishes of the World\". More recently \"Forbes\" magazine ran an article about the dish in 2004. A Canadian newspaper in 1959 reported a minor controversy about the origins of the dish, with readers variously claiming it as Australian, English, Irish and Scottish. In 1995, another Canadian paper called the dish \"universally beloved\".\nSimilar dishes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOther uses of term.\nThe OED gives a secondary definition of \"bubble and squeak\": \"figurative and in figurative contexts. Something resembling or suggestive of bubble and squeak, especially in consisting of a variety of elements\". In 1825 a reviewer in \"The Morning Post\" dismissed a new opera at Covent Garden as \"a sort of bubble and squeak mixture of English and Italian\". The OED gives examples from the 18th to the 21st centuries, including, from Coleridge, \"... the restless Bubble and Squeak of his Vanity and Discontent\", and from D. H. Lawrence, \"I can make the most lovely bubble and squeak of a life for myself\". In cockney rhyming slang the phrase was formerly used for \"beak\" (magistrate) and more recently \"Bubble\" has been used for \"Greek\".\nThe term has been borrowed by authors of children's books as names for a pair of puppies and (by two different authors) pairs of mice.\nIn the late 1940s, George Moreno Jr., an American animator living and working in England, borrowed the term, re-spelling it \"Bubble and Squeek,\" for a series of cartoon shorts released by Associated British-Pathe. The star characters of Moreno's cartoons were a humanized taxi (Squeek) and its driver (Bubble).\nReferences and sources.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was born to a musical family in Lubbock, Texas, during the Great Depression, and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his two siblings. \nHolly made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group Buddy and Bob with his friend Bob Montgomery. In 1955, after opening once for Elvis Presley, Holly decided to pursue a career in music. He played with Presley three times that year, and his band's style shifted from country and western to rock and roll. In October that year, when Holly opened for Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, he was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with Decca Records.\nHolly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley, who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like Patsy Cline. Unhappy with Bradley's musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis, New Mexico, and recorded a demo of \"That'll Be the Day\", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records, which released it as a single credited to the Crickets, a name chosen by the band to subvert Decca's contract limitations. In September 1957, as the band toured, \"That'll Be the Day\" topped the US and UK singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, \"Peggy Sue\".\nThe album \"The \"Chirping\" Crickets\", released in November 1957, reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. Holly made his second appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in January 1958 and soon after toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of Waylon Jennings (bass), Tommy Allsup (guitar), and Carl Bunch (drums), and embarked on a tour of the mid-western US. After a show in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in Moorhead, Minnesota. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper, and pilot Roger Peterson in a crash later referred to by Don McLean as \"The Day the Music Died\" in his song \"American Pie\".\nDuring his short career, Holly wrote and recorded many songs. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums. Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists, including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, the Hollies, Elvis Costello and Elton John. Holly was among the first artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1986. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of 100 Greatest Artists in 2010.\nLife and career.\nEarly life and career (1936\u20131955).\nCharles Hardin Holley (spelled \"-ey\") was born in Lubbock, Texas, on September 7, 1936, the youngest of four children of Lawrence Odell \"L.O.\" Holley (1901\u20131985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902\u20131990). His elder siblings were Larry (1925\u20132022), Travis (1927\u20132016), and Patricia Lou (1929\u20132008). Holly was of mostly English and Welsh descent and had small amounts of Native American ancestry as well. From early childhood, Holly was nicknamed \"Buddy.\" During the Great Depression, the Holleys frequently moved residence within Lubbock; L.O. changed jobs several times. Buddy Holly was baptized a Baptist, and the family were members of the Tabernacle Baptist Church.\nThe Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the bow so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest. During World War II, Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, at his mother's urging, Buddy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a steel guitar, but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought him an acoustic guitar from a local pawnshop, and he learned how to play it from Travis.\nDuring his early childhood, Holly was influenced by the music of Hank Williams, Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, Bill Monroe, Hank Snow, Bob Wills, and the Carter Family. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, Holly became friends with Bob Montgomery, and the two played together, practicing with songs by The Louvin Brothers and Johnnie &amp; Jack. They both listened to the radio programs \"Grand Ole Opry\" on WSM, \"Louisiana Hayride\" on KWKH, and \"Big D Jamboree\". At the same time, Holly played with other musicians he met in high school, including Sonny Curtis and Jerry Allison. In 1952 Holly and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as Buddy and Jack in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Bob Montgomery, and they were billed as Buddy and Bob. They soon started performing on the \"Sunday Party\" show on KDAV in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock. At that time, Holly was influenced by late-night radio stations that played blues and rhythm and blues (R&amp;B). He would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could be received only at night, when local transmissions ceased. Holly then modified his music by blending his earlier country and western influence with R&amp;B. \nBy 1955, after graduating from Lubbock High School, Holly decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley perform live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holly opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, Holly had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from country and western to rock and roll due to seeing Presley's performances and hearing his music. In October, Stone booked Bill Haley &amp; His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded Grand Ole Opry manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to Paul Cohen, who signed the band to Decca Records in February 1956. In the contract, Decca misspelled Holly's surname as \"Holly\", and from then on he was known as Buddy Holly, instead of his real name Holley.\nOn January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by Owen Bradley. He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control. In April 1956, Decca released \"Blue Days, Black Nights\" as a single, with \"Love Me\" on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for Faron Young. During the tour, they were promoted as Buddy Holly and the Two Tones, while later Decca called them Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes. The label later released Holly's second single \"Modern Don Juan\", backed with \"You Are My One Desire\". Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.\nThe Crickets (1956\u20131957).\nHolly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca, and inspired by the success of Buddy Knox's \"Party Doll\" and Jimmy Bowen's \"I'm Stickin' with You\", he visited Norman Petty, who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist Joe B. Mauldin, and rhythm guitarist Niki Sullivan, he went to Petty's studio in Clovis, New Mexico. The group recorded a demo of \"That'll Be the Day\", a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. In June 1956, Holly along with his older brother Larry as well as Allison and Sonny Curtis had gone to see the film \"The Searchers\", starring John Wayne, in which Wayne repeatedly used the phrase \"That'll be the day\". This line of dialogue inspired the young musicians. Now playing lead guitar, Holly achieved the sound he desired. Petty became his manager and sent the record to Brunswick Records in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name \"Crickets.\" Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release \"That'll Be the Day\", leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings.\nImpressed with the demo, the label's executives released it without recording a new version. \"I'm Looking for Someone to Love\" was the B-side; the single was credited to The Crickets. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, Coral Records. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.\nNorman Petty reasoned correctly that disc jockeys would be reluctant to play and promote multiple new records by the same artist, but would have no problem playing these same records if they were credited to different performers. Holly himself was unaware of this strategy; in a 1957 radio interview with Dale Lowery, Holly said, \"We have three records going out right now. Of course, the first one was 'That'll Be the Day', the first one released. Then we have a new one out by The Crickets, called 'Oh Boy!' and 'Not Fade Away', and then there's one out, it's the same group but it's under my name -- I don't know why they did it that way, but it went out under my name -- called 'Peggy Sue' and 'Everyday'.\" Holly's records were released with labels reading \"Buddy Holly\" \"or\" \"The Crickets\"; the band was never credited on records as \"Buddy Holly \"and\" the Crickets\" until 1962, when a compilation album was released.\n\"That'll Be the Day\" was released on July 27, 1957. Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with Irvin Feld, who had noticed the band after \"That'll Be the Day\" appeared on the R&amp;B chart. He booked them for appearances in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and New York City. The band was booked to play at New York's Apollo Theater, a Harlem-based theater widely known for frequently having African American-oriented entertainment, on August 16\u201322. They would be the first white act to perform at the theater. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included \"Bo Diddley\". By the end of their run at the Apollo, \"That'll Be the Day\" was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets. Holly appeared on \"American Bandstand\", hosted by Dick Clark on ABC, on August 26. Before leaving New York, the band befriended The Everly Brothers.\n\"That'll Be the Day\" topped the US \"Best Sellers in Stores\" chart on September 23 and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November. Three days prior, Coral released \"Peggy Sue\", backed with \"Everyday\", with Holly credited as the performer. By October, \"Peggy Sue\" had reached number three on \"Billboard\"'s pop chart and number two on the R&amp;B chart; it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart. As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as \"Buddy Holly and the Crickets\" (although never on records during Holly's lifetime).\nIn the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families. Holly's high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student. Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark. After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his relationship with Clark a temporary one. Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in Oklahoma City, where he was performing with his own band. While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis. The resulting album, \"The \"Chirping\" Crickets\", was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, \"Oh, Boy!\", with \"Not Fade Away\" on the B-side. The single reached number 10 on the pop chart and 13 on the R&amp;B chart. Holly and the Crickets performed \"That'll Be the Day\" and \"Peggy Sue\" on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on December 1, 1957. Following the appearance, Niki Sullivan left the group because he was tired of the intensive touring, and wished to resume his education. On December 29, Holly and the Crickets performed \"Peggy Sue\" on \"The Arthur Murray Party\".\nInternational tours (1958).\nOn January 8, 1958, Holly and the Crickets joined \"America's Greatest Teenage Recording Stars\" tour. On January 25, Holly recorded \"Rave On\"; the next day, he made his second appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", singing \"Oh, Boy!\" Holly departed to perform in Honolulu, Hawaii, on January 27, and then started a week-long tour of Australia billed as the \"Big Show\" with Paul Anka, Jerry Lee Lewis and Jodie Sands. In March, the band toured the United Kingdom, playing 50 shows in 25 days. The same month, his debut solo album, \"Buddy Holly\", was released. Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's \"Big Beat Show\" tour for 41 dates. In April, Decca released \"That'll Be the Day\", featuring the songs recorded with Bradley during his early Nashville sessions.\nA new recording session in Clovis was arranged in May; Holly hired Tommy Allsup to play lead guitar. The session produced the recordings of \"It's So Easy\" and \"Heartbeat\". Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&amp;B band, recording \"Now We're One\" and Bobby Darin's \"Early in the Morning\".\nHolly in New York.\nIn June 1958, during a visit to the New York offices of music publisher Peer-Southern, Holly met Maria Elena Santiago, a receptionist for executive Murray Deutch there. Holly managed to have Santiago invited to a luncheon at Howard Johnson's, thanks to Deutch's secretary, Jo Harper. He asked her to have dinner with him that night at P. J. Clarke's. Holly proposed marriage to her on their very first date. \"While we were having dinner, he got up and came back with his hands behind his back. He brought out a red rose and said, 'This is for you. Would you marry me?' Within the beautiful red rose, there was a ring. I melted.\" Holly went to her guardian's house the next morning and Maria came running at him and jumped into his arms, which was a sign to him that it was a \"yes\".\nThey married in Lubbock on August 15, 1958, less than two months later. On what would have been their 50th wedding anniversary, she told the \"Lubbock Avalanche-Journal\":I'd never had a boyfriend in my life. I'd never been on a date before. But when I saw Buddy, it was like magic. We had something special: love at first sight. It was like we were made for each other. He came into my life when I needed him, and I came into his. The newlyweds honeymooned in Acapulco. Norman Petty had tried to dissuade Holly from marriage; he felt that it would disappoint Holly's public and damage his career.\nHolly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including the Village Gate, Blue Note, Village Vanguard, and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with Ray Charles and Mahalia Jackson. Holly also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio.\nSantiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of its habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico.\nAlthough Holly had already begun to become disillusioned with Norman Petty before meeting Santiago, it was through her and her aunt Provi Garcia, an executive in the Latin American music department at Peer-Southern, that he began to fully realize what was going on with his manager, who was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and later to fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties -- the Brothers had engaged Orenstein following disputes with their own manager, Wesley Rose. The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly's royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled.\nIn September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded \"Reminiscing\" and \"Come Back Baby\". During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ Waylon Jennings. Holly produced the single \"Jole Blon\" and \"When Sin Stops (Love Begins)\" for Jennings. Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Holly and Santiago settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village, where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including \"Crying, Waiting, Hoping\" and \"What to Do\". The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire. Holly's subsequent song \"True Love Ways\", on the other hand, was about his relationship with his wife, Maria.\nOn October 21, 1958, Holly's final studio session was recorded at the Pythian Temple on West 70th Street (now a luxury condominium). Known by Holly fans as \"the string sessions\", Holly recorded four songs for Coral in an innovative collaboration with an 18-piece ensemble composed of former members of the NBC Symphony Orchestra (including saxophonist Boomie Richman), produced and conducted by Dick Jacobs, Coral-Brunswick's new head of Artists and Repertoire. Maria Holly was in attendance. \nAccording to Billy Altman's liner notes to the Geffen/Universal compilation, \"Buddy Holly: The Definitive Collection\", the four songs recorded during the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442-hour session were: \nThese four songs were the only ones Coral ever mixed in stereo, but only \"Raining in My Heart\" was released that way (in 1959, on an obscure promotional LP titled \"Hitsville\"). All four records otherwise received releases in mono. The original stereo mixes were consulted many years later for compilation albums.\nHolly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager and split from Holly. The split was amicable and based on logistics: Holly had decided to settle permanently in New York, where the business and publishing offices were, and the Crickets preferred not to leave their home state. \nYet, with the money still being withheld by Petty, and with apartment rent due, Buddy was forced to go back on the road.\nWinter Dance Party tour and death (1959).\nHolly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings's radio station in December 1958. For the start of the Winter Dance Party tour, he assembled a band consisting of Waylon Jennings (electric bass), Tommy Allsup (guitar), and Carl Bunch (drums). Holly and Jennings left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959. Jennings stayed at Holly's apartment by Washington Square Park on the days prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the General Artists Corporation, which organized the tour. They then traveled by train to Chicago to join the rest of the band.\nThe Winter Dance Party tour began in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for frostbite to his toes (sustained while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation. On February 2, before their appearance in Clear Lake, Iowa, Holly chartered a four-seat Beechcraft Bonanza airplane for Jennings, Allsup, and himself, from Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, Iowa. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in Moorhead, Minnesota, via Fargo, North Dakota, allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid an arduous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with Ritchie Valens. Valens called heads; when he won, he reportedly said, \"That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life.\" Allsup later opened a restaurant/bar in Fort Worth, Texas, called Heads Up Saloon. Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson (the Big Bopper), who had influenza and complained that the tour bus was too cold and uncomfortable for a man of his size.\nThe pilot, Roger Peterson, took off in inclement weather, even though he was not certified to fly by instruments only. Buddy's brother Larry Holley said, \"I got the full report from the Civil Aeronautics \u2013 it took me a year to get it, but I got it \u2013 and they had installed a new Sperry gyroscope in the airplane. The Sperry works different than any other gyro. One of them, the background moves and the plane stays like this [stationary], and in the other one the background stays steady and the plane moves, it works just backwards. He [the pilot] could have been reading this backwards... they were going down, they thought they were still climbing.\"\nShortly after 1:00\u00a0a.m. on February 3, 1959, Holly, Valens, Richardson, and Peterson were killed when the aircraft crashed into a cornfield five miles northwest of Clear Lake shortly after takeoff. The three musicians, who were ejected from the fuselage upon impact, sustained severe head and chest injuries. Holly was 22 years old when he died.\nThe report did not mention a gun belonging to Holly that was found by a farmer two months after the crash. Newspaper accounts of the gun discovery fueled rumors among fans that the pilot was somehow shot, causing the crash. Another curious finding at the crash was that Richardson's body was discovered nearly away from the crash while the others were found in or near the wreckage. However, an autopsy done at the request of Richardson's son in 2007 found no evidence to support the rumors. Dr. Bill Bass, a forensic anthropologist at the University of Tennessee, stated that \"There was no indication of foul play,\" and that Richardson \"died immediately.\"\nHolly's funeral was held on February 7, 1959, at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Lubbock. The service was officiated by Ben D. Johnson, who had presided at the Hollys' wedding just months earlier. The pallbearers were Jerry Allison, Joe B. Mauldin, Niki Sullivan, Bob Montgomery, and Sonny Curtis. Some sources say that Phil Everly, one half of The Everly Brothers, was also pallbearer, but Everly said that he attended the funeral but was not a pallbearer. Waylon Jennings was unable to attend because of his commitment to the still-touring Winter Dance Party. Holly's body was interred in the City of Lubbock Cemetery, in the eastern part of the city. Holly's headstone carries the correct spelling of his surname (Holley) and a carving of his Fender Stratocaster guitar.\nSantiago watched the first reports of Holly's death on television. The following day, she suffered a miscarriage. Holly's mother, who heard the news on the radio in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. Because of Elena's miscarriage, in the months following the accident, some government authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims' names until after families are informed. Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the gravesite. She later told the \"Avalanche-Journal\", \"In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane.\"\nPersonal life.\nHolly married Mar\u00eda Elena Santiago, a New York record company receptionist, on August 15, 1958, at Tabernacle Baptist Church in his hometown of Lubbock, Texas. In 1959, Santiago was pregnant with their first child, but suffered a miscarriage immediately after Holly's death. They had been married for only six months.\nPeggy Sue Gerron was the inspiration behind Holly's hit song \"Peggy Sue\". Holly and Gerron had a flirtatious relationship, and Gerron had known Holly since her schooldays when she was dating drummer Jerry Allison. Gerron married Allison on July 22, 1958. The two newlywed couples had a shared honeymoon in Acapulco, Mexico.\nHolly's own marriage to Santiago was distant and tense, and the couple were supposedly headed for divorce. In late 1958, Holly had also encouraged Gerron to divorce Allison over his drunken behavior, but she declined. The act of divorce went against her Catholic beliefs (however, Gerron eventually did divorce Allison in 1965). In December 1958, Holly recorded a demo of one of his last songs \"Peggy Sue Got Married\"\u2014about Gerron and Allison's marriage.\nImage and style.\nHolly's singing style was characterized by his vocal hiccups, a technique he acquired after hearing Elvis do it in 1955 on the Hayride show, and his alternation between his regular voice and falsetto. Holly's \"stuttering vocals\" were complemented by his percussive guitar playing, solos, stops, bent notes, and rhythm and blues chord progressions. He often strummed downstrokes that were accompanied by Allison's percussion.\nHolly bought his first Fender Stratocaster, which became his signature guitar, at Harrod Music in Lubbock. His innovative playing style was characterized by its blending of chunky rhythm and high string lead work. Holly played his first 1954 Stratocaster until it was stolen during a tour stop in Michigan in 1957. To replace it, he purchased a 1957 model before a show in Detroit. Holly owned four or five Stratocasters during his career.\nAt the beginning of their music careers, Holly and his group wore business suits. When they met the Everly Brothers, Don Everly took the band to Phil's Men's Shop in New York City and introduced them to Ivy League clothes. The brothers advised Holly to replace his old-fashioned glasses with horn-rimmed glasses, which had been popularized by Steve Allen. Holly bought a pair of glasses made in Mexico from Lubbock optometrist Dr. J. Davis Armistead. Teenagers in the United States started to request this style of glasses, which were later popularly known as \"Buddy Holly glasses.\"\nWhile Holly's other belongings were recovered immediately following his fatal plane crash, there was no record of his signature glasses being found. They were presumed lost until, in March 1980, they were discovered in a Cerro Gordo County courthouse storage area by Sheriff Gerald Allen. They had been found in the spring of 1959, after the snow had melted, and had been given to the sheriff's office. They were placed in an envelope dated April 7, 1959, along with the Big Bopper's watch, a lighter, two pairs of dice and part of another watch, and misplaced when the county moved courthouses. The glasses frames were returned to Santiago a year later, after a legal contest over them with his parents. They are now on display at the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas.\nThe rarest and only known Buddy Holly poster from \"The Day the Music Died,\" was sold at Heritage Auctions for a record-breaking $447,000 in 2022.\nLegacy.\nBuddy Holly left behind dozens of unfinished recordings\u00a0\u2014 solo transcriptions of his new compositions, informal jam sessions with bandmates, and tapes demonstrating songs intended for other artists. The last known recordings, made in Holly's apartment in late 1958, were his last six original songs. In June 1959, Coral Records overdubbed two of them with backing vocals by the Ray Charles Singers and studio musicians in an attempt to simulate the established Crickets sound. The finished tracks became the first posthumous Holly single, \"Peggy Sue Got Married\"/\"Crying, Waiting, Hoping\". The new release was successful enough to warrant an album drawing upon the other Holly demos, using the same studio personnel, in January 1960. All six songs were included in \"The Buddy Holly Story, Vol. 2\" (1960).\nThe demand for Holly records was so great (although none saw much chart success on the US billboards), and Holly had recorded so prolifically, that his record label was able to release new Holly albums and singles for the next 10 years. Norman Petty produced most of these new editions, drawing upon unreleased studio masters, alternate takes, audition tapes, and even amateur recordings (some dating back to 1954 with low-fidelity vocals). The final \"new\" Buddy Holly album, \"Giant\", was released in 1969; the single chosen from the album was \"Love Is Strange\".\n\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" stated that Holly \"produced some of the most distinctive and influential work in rock music.\" AllMusic defined him as \"the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll.\" \"Rolling Stone\" ranked him number 13 on its list of \"100 Greatest Artists.\" The \"Telegraph\" called him a \"pioneer and a revolutionary [...] a multidimensional talent [...] (who) co-wrote and performed (songs that) remain as fresh and potent today.\" In 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked Holly at number 74 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included Holly among its first class in 1986. On its entry, the Hall of Fame remarked upon the large quantity of material he produced during his short musical career, and said it \"made a major and lasting impact on popular music.\" It called him an \"innovator\" for writing his own material, his experimentation with double tracking and the use of orchestration; he is also said to have \"pioneered and popularized the now-standard\" use of two guitars, bass, and drums by rock bands. The Songwriters Hall of Fame also inducted Holly in 1986, and said his contributions \"changed the face of Rock 'n' Roll.\" Holly developed in collaboration with Petty techniques of overdubbing and reverb, while he used innovative instrumentation later implemented by other artists. Holly became \"one of the most influential pioneers of rock and roll\" who had a \"lasting influence\" on genre performers of the 1960s.\nIn 1980, Grant Speed sculpted a statue of Holly playing his Fender guitar. This statue is the centerpiece of Lubbock's Walk of Fame, which honors notable people who contributed to Lubbock's musical history. Other memorials to Buddy Holly include a street named in his honor and the Buddy Holly Center, which contains a museum of Holly memorabilia and fine arts gallery. The center is located on Crickets Avenue, one street east of Buddy Holly Avenue, in a building that previously housed the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway Depot. In 2010, the statue was taken down for refurbishment, and construction of a new Walk of Fame began.\nIn 1997, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences gave Holly the Lifetime Achievement Award. He was inducted into the Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2000. On May 9, 2011, the City of Lubbock held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Buddy and Maria Elena Holly Plaza, the new home of the statue and the Walk of Fame. On what would have been his 75th birthday, a star bearing Holly's name was placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nGroundbreaking was held on April 20, 2017, for the construction of a new performing arts center in Lubbock, the Buddy Holly Hall of Performing Arts and Sciences, a downtown $153\u00a0million project expected to be completed in 2020. Thus far, the private group, the Lubbock Entertainment and Performing Arts Association, has raised or received pledges in the amount of $93\u00a0million to underwrite the project.\nAccording to a June 2019 article in \"The New York Times Magazine\", \"virtually all\" of Holly's masters were lost in the 2008 Universal fire. This is disputed by Chad Kassem of Analogue Productions, who claims to have used the master tapes of Holly's first two albums in Analogue Productions reissues of these albums on LP and SACD in 2017.\nInfluence.\nThe Beatles.\nJohn Lennon and Paul McCartney saw Holly for the first time when he appeared on \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\". The two had recently met and begun their musical association. They studied Holly's records, learned his performance style and lyricism, and based their act around his persona. Inspired by Holly's insect-themed Crickets, they chose to name their band \"the Beatles\". Lennon and McCartney later cited Holly as one of their main influences.\nLennon's band the Quarrymen covered \"That'll Be the Day\" in their first recording session, in 1958. During breaks in the Beatles' first appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", on February 9, 1964, Lennon asked CBS coordinator Vince Calandra about Holly's performances; Calandra said Lennon and McCartney repeatedly expressed their appreciation of Holly. The Beatles recorded a close cover of Holly's version of \"Words of Love\", which was released on their 1964 album \"Beatles for Sale\" (in the US, in June 1965 on \"Beatles VI\"). During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album \"Let It Be\", the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of \"Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues\" \u2013 which Holly popularized but did not write \u2013 with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style. Lennon recorded a cover version of \"Peggy Sue\" on his 1975 album \"Rock 'n' Roll\". McCartney owns the publishing rights to Holly's song catalog.\nBob Dylan.\nOn January 31, 1959, two nights before Holly's death, 17-year-old Bob Dylan attended Holly's performance in Duluth. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for \"Time Out of Mind\" in 1998: \"...\u00a0when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him\u00a0... and he looked at me. And I just have some sort of feeling that he was\u00a0... with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.\"\nThe Rolling Stones.\nMick Jagger saw Holly performing live in Woolwich, London, during a tour of the UK; Jagger particularly remembered Holly's performance of \"Not Fade Away\" \u2013 a song that also inspired Keith Richards, who modeled his early guitar playing on the track. The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964. Richards later said, \"[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones]\u00a0...\u00a0He's in everybody.\"\nSteve Marriott.\nFrom a young age, Steve Marriott was a huge fan of Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. Marriott wrote his first song, called \"Shelia My Dear\", after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him 'Buddy'. Marriott also recorded a version of Kenny Lynch's song \"Give Her My Regards\" b/w \"Imaginary Love\", the B-side written by Marriott, and released as a 45-rpm in 1963 on Decca, inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets. His band, Humble Pie released a cover version of \"Heartbeat\" on their 1969 album \"Town and Country\".\nDon McLean.\nDon McLean's popular 1971 ballad \"American Pie\" was inspired by Holly's death and the day of the plane crash. The song's lyric, which calls the incident \"The Day the Music Died\", became popularly associated with the crash. McLean's album \"American Pie\" is dedicated to Holly. In 2015, McLean wrote, \"Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments\u00a0...\u00a0By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself\u00a0...\u00a0in my view and the view of many others, a hit\u00a0...\u00a0Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed.\"\nEric Clapton.\n\"The Chirping Crickets\" was the first album Eric Clapton ever bought; he later saw Holly on \"Sunday Night at the London Palladium\". In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, \"I thought I'd died and gone to heaven\u00a0...\u00a0it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: 'That's the future \u2013 that's what I want'\". In 1969, his supergroup Blind Faith released a cover version of Holly's \"Well All Right\" featuring Steve Winwood on vocals.\nBobby Vee.\nThe launch of Bobby Vee's successful musical career resulted from Holly's death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash. Holly's profound influence on Vee's singing style can be heard in the songs \"Rubber Ball\" \u2013 the B-side of which was a cover of Holly's \"Everyday\" \u2013 and \"Run to Him\".\nThe Hollies.\nThe name of the British rock band the Hollies is often claimed as a tribute to Holly; according to the band, they admired Holly, but their name was mainly inspired by sprigs of holly in evidence around Christmas 1962.\nPhil Ochs.\nIn 1970, protest folk singer Phil Ochs released his sarcastic \"Greatest Hits\" (1970) album, and eventually, his live album \"Gunfight at Carnegie Hall\" (1974). During his concert at Carnegie Hall on March 27, 1970, Phil Ochs performed his \"Buddy Holly Medley\" comprising Holly's songs \"Not Fade Away\", \"I'm Gonna Love You Too\", \"Think It Over\", \"Oh, Boy!\", \"Everyday\", and \"It's So Easy\". Before performing the medley, Ochs announced to the audience, \"We're going to do a medley of songs of one of the greatest musicians that ever lived, a man who died prematurely, a man who had a big influence on me\u00a0...\u00a0Before I became a protest and folk singer, I had memorized many other things before Pete Seeger, before Bob Dylan, before the Weavers, before anything you might have ever heard in New York City, and this is Buddy Holly.\"\nElvis Costello.\nDuring the height of punk, Elvis Costello resembled Holly. He wore his stylized glasses and dressed like him. In his 2022 book \"The Philosophy of Modern Song\", Bob Dylan wrote, \"Elvis Costello and the Attractions were a better band than any of their contemporaries. Light years better. Elvis himself was a unique figure. Horn-rimmed glasses, quirky, pigeon-toed and intense. The only singer-guitarist in the band. You couldn't say that he didn't remind you of Buddy Holly. The Buddy stereotype. At least on the surface.\"\nBruce Springsteen.\nIn an August 24, 1978, interview with \"Rolling Stone\", Bruce Springsteen told Dave Marsh, \"I play Buddy Holly every night before I go on; that keeps me honest.\"\nGrateful Dead.\nThe Grateful Dead performed the song \"Not Fade Away\" in concerts.\nRichard Barone.\nIn 2016, Richard Barone released his album \"Sorrows &amp; Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s\", paying tribute to the new wave of singer-songwriters in the Village during that pivotal, post-Holly era. The album opens with Barone's version of \"Learning the Game\", one of the final songs written and recorded by Holly at his home in Greenwich Village, a week before his death.\nFilm and musical depictions.\nFilm.\nHolly's life story inspired a Hollywood biographical film, \"The Buddy Holly Story\" (1978); its lead actor Gary Busey received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Holly. The film was widely criticized by the rock press, and by Holly's friends and family, for its inaccuracies. This led Paul McCartney (whose MPL Communications by then controlled the publishing rights to Buddy Holly's song catalog) to produce and host his own documentary about Holly in 1985, titled \"The Real Buddy Holly Story\". This video includes interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, Sonny Curtis, Jerry Allison, Holly's family, and McCartney, among others.\nIn 1987, musician Marshall Crenshaw portrayed Buddy Holly in the movie \"La Bamba\", which depicts him performing at the Surf Ballroom and boarding the fatal airplane with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. Crenshaw's version of \"Crying, Waiting, Hoping\" is featured on the \"La Bamba\" original motion picture soundtrack.\nHolly's follow up to the hit song \"Peggy Sue\" is featured in the 1986 Francis Ford Coppola film \"Peggy Sue Got Married\", in which a 43-year-old mother and housewife facing divorce played by Kathleen Turner is thrust back in time and given the chance to change the course of her life.\nSteve Buscemi appeared as Holly in a brief cameo as a 1950s-themed restaurant employee in Quentin Tarantino's 1994 film \"Pulp Fiction\", in which he takes Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's orders (portrayed respectively by Uma Thurman and John Travolta).\nIn 1998, the post-apocalyptic film \"Six-String Samurai\" depicted Holly as a guitar-playing samurai traveling to Las Vegas to become the new king of Nevada after the death of Elvis Presley.\nTelevision.\nHolly was depicted in a 1989 episode of the science-fiction television program \"Quantum Leap\" titled \"How the Tess Was Won\"; Holly's identity is only revealed at the end of the episode. Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) influences Buddy Holly to change his lyrics from \"piggy, suey\" to \"Peggy Sue\", setting up Holly's future hit song.\nIn the animated series \"The Venture Bros.\", it is implied that the elderly villains Dragoon and Red Mantle are actually Richardson and Buddy Holly, who were recruited into the supervillain organization the Guild of Calamitous Intent on the night of their supposed deaths.\nThe TV documentaries \"Without Walls: Not Fade Away\" (aired on Channel Four in 1996), and \"Buddy Holly: Rave On\" (aired on BBC Four in 2017). The 2022 documentary \"The Day the Music Died\" explores the story behind Don McLean's song \"American Pie\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4410", "revid": "45179772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4410", "title": "Brewing", "text": "Process in beer production\nBrewing is the production of beer by steeping a starch source (commonly cereal grains, the most popular of which is barley) in water and fermenting the resulting sweet liquid with yeast. It may be done in a brewery by a commercial brewer, at home by a homebrewer, or communally. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that emerging civilisations, including ancient Egypt, China, and Mesopotamia, brewed beer. Since the nineteenth century the brewing industry has been part of most western economies.\nThe basic ingredients of beer are water and a fermentable starch source such as malted barley. Most beer is fermented with a brewer's yeast and flavoured with hops. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum and cassava. Secondary sources (adjuncts), such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, may also be used, sometimes to reduce cost, or to add a feature, such as adding wheat to aid in retaining the foamy head of the beer. The most common starch source is ground cereal or \"grist\" \u2013 the proportion of the starch or cereal ingredients in a beer recipe may be called grist, grain bill, or simply mash ingredients.\nSteps in the brewing process include malting, milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. There are three main fermentation methods: warm, cool and spontaneous. Fermentation may take place in an open or closed fermenting vessel; a secondary fermentation may also occur in the cask or bottle. There are several additional brewing methods, such as Burtonisation, double dropping, and Yorkshire Square, as well as post-fermentation treatment such as filtering, and barrel-ageing.\nHistory.\nBrewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests emerging civilisations including China, ancient Egypt, and Mesopotamia brewed beer. Descriptions of various beer recipes can be found in cuneiform (the oldest known writing) from ancient Mesopotamia. In Mesopotamia the brewer's craft was the only profession which derived social sanction and divine protection from female deities/goddesses, specifically: Ninkasi, who covered the production of beer, Siris, who was used in a metonymic way to refer to beer, and Siduri, who covered the enjoyment of beer. In pre-industrial times, and in developing countries, women are frequently the main brewers.\nAs almost any cereal containing certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air, it is possible that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced as far back as about 7,000 years ago in what is today Iran. This discovery reveals one of the earliest known uses of fermentation and is the earliest evidence of brewing to date. In Mesopotamia, the oldest evidence of beer is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablet depicting people drinking a beverage through reed straws from a communal bowl. A 3900-year-old Sumerian poem honouring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of beer from barley via bread. The invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for humanity's ability to develop technology and build civilisation. The earliest chemically confirmed barley beer to date was discovered at Godin Tepe in the central Zagros Mountains of Iran, where fragments of a jug, at least 5,000 years old was found to be coated with beerstone, a by-product of the brewing process. Beer may have been known in Neolithic Europe as far back as 5,000 years ago, and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.\nAle produced before the Industrial Revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century. The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process, and greater knowledge of the results. Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. More than 133\u00a0billion litres (35\u00a0billion gallons) are sold per year\u2014producing total global revenues of $294.5\u00a0billion (\u00a3147.7\u00a0billion) in 2006.\nIngredients.\nThe basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as malted barley, able to be fermented (converted into alcohol); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring, such as hops, to offset the sweetness of the malt. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary saccharide, such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, these often being termed adjuncts, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include millet, sorghum, and cassava root in Africa, potato in Brazil, and agave in Mexico, among others. The most common starch source is ground cereal or \"grist\" \u2013 the proportion of the starch or cereal ingredients in a beer recipe may be called grist, grain bill, or simply mash ingredients.\nBeer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character. For example, Dublin has hard water well suited to making stout, such as Guinness; while Pilsen has soft water well suited to making pale lager, such as Pilsner Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as Burtonisation.\nThe starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that will allow conversion from starches in the grain into fermentable sugars during the mash process. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.\nNearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because of its fibrous husk, which is important not only in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the mashed barley grains to form the wort) but also as a rich source of amylase, a digestive enzyme that facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and, less frequently, maize (corn) and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced gluten-free beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for people who cannot digest gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.\nHops are the female flower clusters or seed cones of the hop vine \"Humulus lupulus\", which are used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. Hops had been used for medicinal and food flavouring purposes since Roman times; by the 7th century in Carolingian monasteries in what is now Germany, beer was being made with hops, though it isn't until the thirteenth century that widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is recorded. Before the thirteenth century, beer was flavoured with plants such as yarrow, wild rosemary, and bog myrtle, and other ingredients such as juniper berries, aniseed and ginger, which would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used; between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer flavoured with gruit was known as ale, while beer flavoured with hops was known as beer. Some beers today, such as \"Fraoch\" by the Scottish Heather Ales company and \"Cervoise Lancelot\" by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.\nHops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer: they contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; they provide floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours; they have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms; and they aid in \"head retention\", the length of time that the foam on top of the beer (the beer head) will last. The preservative in hops comes from the lupulin glands which contain soft resins with alpha and beta acids. Though much studied, the preservative nature of the soft resins is not yet fully understood, though it has been observed that unless stored at a cool temperature, the preservative nature will decrease. Brewing is the sole major commercial use of hops.\nYeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains, which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide, and thereby turns wort into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.\nThe dominant types of yeast used to make beer are \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", known as ale yeast, and \"Saccharomyces pastorianus\", known as lager yeast; \"Brettanomyces\" ferments lambics, and \"Torulaspora delbrueckii\" ferments Bavarian weissbier. Before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts, and a few styles such as lambics still use this method today. Emil Christian Hansen, a Danish biochemist employed by the Carlsberg Laboratory, developed pure yeast cultures which were introduced into the Carlsberg brewery in 1883, and pure yeast strains are now the main fermenting source used worldwide.\nSome brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear bright and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers.\nExamples of clarifying agents include isinglass, obtained from swim bladders of fish; Irish moss, a seaweed; kappa carrageenan, from the seaweed \"kappaphycus\"; polyclar (a commercial brand of clarifier); and gelatin. If a beer is marked \"suitable for Vegans\", it was generally clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents, although the \"Fast Cask\" method invented by Marston's in 2009 may provide another method.\nBrewing process.\nHot water tank\nMash tun\nMalt\nHops\nCopper\nHopback\nAdd yeast to&lt;br&gt;fermenter\nHeat&lt;br&gt;exchanger\nBottling\nCask or keg\nThere are several steps in the brewing process, which may include malting, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. The brewing equipment needed to make beer has grown more sophisticated over time, and now covers most aspects of the brewing process.\nMalting is the process where barley grain is made ready for brewing. Malting is broken down into three steps in order to help to release the starches in the barley. First, during steeping, the grain is added to a vat with water and allowed to soak for approximately 40 hours. During germination, the grain is spread out on the floor of the germination room for around 5 days. The final part of malting is kilning when the malt goes through a very high temperature drying in a kiln; with gradual temperature increase over several hours. When kilning is complete, the grains are now termed malt, and they will be milled or crushed to break apart the kernels and expose the cotyledon, which contains the majority of the carbohydrates and sugars; this makes it easier to extract the sugars during mashing.\nMashing converts the starches released during the malting stage into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a mash tun. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed together to create a cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This \"conversion\" is called saccharification which occurs between the temperatures . The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or \"wort\", which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as lautering. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about (known as a mashout) to free up more starch and reduce mash viscosity. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as sparging).\nThe wort is moved into a large tank known as a \"copper\" or kettle where it is boiled with hops and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs or sugars. This stage is where many chemical reactions take place, and where important decisions about the flavour, colour, and aroma of the beer are made. The boiling process serves to terminate enzymatic processes, precipitate proteins, isomerise hop resins, and concentrate and sterilise the wort. Hops add flavour, aroma and bitterness to the beer. At the end of the boil, the hopped wort settles to clarify in a vessel called a \"whirlpool\", where the more solid particles in the wort are separated out.\nAfter the whirlpool, the wort is drawn away from the compacted hop trub, and rapidly cooled via a heat exchanger to a temperature where yeast can be added. A variety of heat exchanger designs are used in breweries, with the most common a plate-style. Water or glycol run in channels in the opposite direction of the wort, causing a rapid drop in temperature. It is very important to quickly cool the wort to a level where yeast can be added safely as yeast is unable to grow in very high temperatures, and will start to die in temperatures above . After the wort goes through the heat exchanger, the cooled wort goes into a fermentation tank. A type of yeast is selected and added, or \"pitched\", to the fermentation tank. When the yeast is added to the wort, the fermenting process begins, where the sugars turn into alcohol, carbon dioxide and other components. When the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate. After conditioning for a week to several months, the beer may be filtered and force carbonated for bottling, or fined in the cask.\nMashing.\nMashing is the process of combining a mix of milled grain (typically malted barley with supplementary grains such as corn, sorghum, rye or wheat), known as the \"grist\" or \"grain bill\", and water, known as \"liquor\", and heating this mixture in a vessel called a \"mash tun\". Mashing is a form of steeping, and defines the act of brewing, such as with making tea, sake, and soy sauce. Technically, wine, cider and mead are not brewed but rather vinified, as there is no steeping process involving solids. Mashing allows the enzymes in the malt to break down the starch in the grain into sugars, typically maltose to create a malty liquid called wort. There are two main methods \u2013 infusion mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and decoction mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature. Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably ), and takes place in a \"mash tun\" \u2013 an insulated brewing vessel with a false bottom. The end product of mashing is called a \"mash\".\nMashing usually takes 1 to 2 hours, and during this time the various temperature rests activate different enzymes depending upon the type of malt being used, its modification level, and the intention of the brewer. The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to dextrins and then to fermentable sugars such as maltose. A mash rest from activates various proteases, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as corn and rice, which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at activates \u03b2-glucanase, which breaks down gummy \u03b2-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based \u03b2-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a mash rest temperature of is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest at the lower end of the range favours \u03b2-amylase enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like maltotriose, maltose, and glucose which are more fermentable by the yeast. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in alcohol. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favours \u03b1-amylase enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and dextrins which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result. Duration and pH variances also affect the sugar composition of the resulting wort.\nLautering.\nLautering is the separation of the wort (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls (the ground or milled cereal). The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating rakes or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel. The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectolitre. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates at each end of the structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.\nBoiling.\nAfter mashing, the beer wort is boiled with hops (and other flavourings if used) in a large tank known as a \"copper\" or brew kettle \u2013 though historically the mash vessel was used and is still in some small breweries. The boiling process is where chemical reactions take place, including sterilisation of the wort to remove unwanted bacteria, releasing of hop flavours, bitterness and aroma compounds through isomerisation, stopping of enzymatic processes, precipitation of proteins, and concentration of the wort. Finally, the vapours produced during the boil volatilise off-flavours, including dimethyl sulphide precursors. The boil is conducted so that it is even and intense \u2013 a continuous \"rolling boil\". The boil on average lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, depending on its intensity, the hop addition schedule, and volume of water the brewer expects to evaporate. At the end of the boil, solid particles in the hopped wort are separated out, usually in a vessel called a \"whirlpool\".\nBrew kettle or copper.\nCopper is the traditional material for the boiling vessel for two main reasons: firstly because copper transfers heat quickly and evenly; secondly because the bubbles produced during boiling, which could act as an insulator against the heat, do not cling to the surface of copper, so the wort is heated in a consistent manner. The simplest boil kettles are direct-fired, with a burner underneath. These can produce a vigorous and favourable boil, but are also apt to scorch the wort where the flame touches the kettle, causing caramelisation and making cleanup difficult. Most breweries use a steam-fired kettle, which uses steam jackets in the kettle to boil the wort. Breweries usually have a boiling unit either inside or outside of the kettle, usually a tall, thin cylinder with vertical tubes, called a calandria, through which wort is pumped.\nWhirlpool.\nAt the end of the boil, solid particles in the hopped wort are separated out, usually in a vessel called a \"whirlpool\" or \"settling tank\". The whirlpool was devised by Henry Ranulph Hudston while working for the Molson Brewery in 1960 to utilise the so-called tea leaf paradox to force the denser solids known as \"trub\" (coagulated proteins, vegetable matter from hops) into a cone in the centre of the whirlpool tank. Whirlpool systems vary: smaller breweries tend to use the brew kettle, larger breweries use a separate tank, and design will differ, with tank floors either flat, sloped, conical or with a cup in the centre. The principle in all is that by swirling the wort the centripetal force will push the trub into a cone at the centre of the bottom of the tank, where it can be easily removed.\nHopback.\nA hopback is a traditional additional chamber that acts as a sieve or filter by using whole hops to clear debris (or \"trub\") from the unfermented (or \"green\") wort, as the whirlpool does, and also to increase hop aroma in the finished beer. It is a chamber between the brewing kettle and wort chiller. Hops are added to the chamber, the hot wort from the kettle is run through it, and then immediately cooled in the wort chiller before entering the fermentation chamber. Hopbacks utilising a sealed chamber facilitate maximum retention of volatile hop aroma compounds that would normally be driven off when the hops contact the hot wort. While a hopback has a similar filtering effect as a whirlpool, it operates differently: a whirlpool uses centrifugal forces, a hopback uses a layer of whole hops to act as a filter bed. Furthermore, while a whirlpool is useful only for the removal of pelleted hops (as flowers do not tend to separate as easily), in general hopbacks are used only for the removal of whole flower hops (as the particles left by pellets tend to make it through the hopback). The hopback has mainly been substituted in modern breweries by the whirlpool.\nWort cooling.\nAfter the whirlpool, the wort must be brought down to fermentation temperatures before yeast is added. In modern breweries this is achieved through a plate heat exchanger. A plate heat exchanger has sereral ridged plates, which form two separate paths. The wort is pumped into the heat exchanger, and goes through every other gap between the plates. The cooling medium, usually water from a cold liquor tank, goes through the other gaps. The ridges in the plates ensure turbulent flow. A good heat exchanger can drop wort to while warming the cooling medium from about to . The last few plates often use a cooling medium which can be cooled to below the freezing point, which allows a finer control over the wort-out temperature, and also enables cooling to around . After cooling, oxygen is often dissolved into the wort to revitalise the yeast and aid its reproduction. \nWhile boiling, it is useful to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which unheated water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the output temperature of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary. Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the wort cooling. When cold water is used to cool the wort in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximise the water's temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.\nFermenting.\nFermentation takes place in fermentation vessels which come in various forms, from enormous cylindroconical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats. After the wort is cooled and aerated \u2013 usually with sterile air \u2013 yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the malt are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, and the product can be called beer for the first time.\nMost breweries today use cylindroconical vessels, or CCVs, which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's angle is typically around 60\u00b0, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow towards the cone's apex, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids which have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out of a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, which makes harvesting top-fermenting yeasts very easy. The open tops of the vessels make the risk of infection greater, but with proper cleaning procedures and careful protocol about who enters fermentation chambers, the risk can be well controlled. Fermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. If they are simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends, they are arranged vertically, as opposed to conditioning tanks which are usually laid out horizontally. Only a very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation as wood is difficult to keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched more or less yearly.\nFermentation methods.\nThere are three main fermentation methods, warm, cool, and wild or spontaneous. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation which can take place in the brewery, in the cask or in the bottle.\nBrewing yeasts are traditionally classed as \"top-cropping\" (or \"top-fermenting\") and \"bottom-cropping\" (or \"bottom-fermenting\"); the yeasts classed as top-fermenting are generally used in warm fermentations, where they ferment quickly, and the yeasts classed as bottom-fermenting are used in cooler fermentations where they ferment more slowly. Yeast were termed top or bottom cropping, because the yeast was collected from the top or bottom of the fermenting wort to be reused for the next brew. This terminology is somewhat inappropriate in the modern era; after the widespread application of brewing mycology it was discovered that the two separate collecting methods involved two different yeast species that favoured different temperature regimes, namely \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" in top-cropping at warmer temperatures and \"Saccharomyces pastorianus\" in bottom-cropping at cooler temperatures. As brewing methods changed in the 20th century, cylindro-conical fermenting vessels became the norm and the collection of yeast for both \"Saccharomyces\" species is done from the bottom of the fermenter. Thus the method of collection no longer implies a species association. There are a few remaining breweries who collect yeast in the top-cropping method, such as Samuel Smiths brewery in Yorkshire, Marstons in Staffordshire and several German hefeweizen producers.\nFor both types, yeast is fully distributed through the beer while it is fermenting, and both equally flocculate (clump together and precipitate to the bottom of the vessel) when fermentation is finished. By no means do all top-cropping yeasts demonstrate this behaviour, but it features strongly in many English yeasts that may also exhibit chain forming (the failure of budded cells to break from the mother cell), which is in the technical sense different from true flocculation. The most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", is the same species as the common baking yeast. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, in order to carbonate dough in the shortest amount of time; brewing yeast strains act slower, but tend to tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (normally 12\u201315% abv is the maximum, though under special treatment some ethanol-tolerant strains can be coaxed up to around 20%). Modern quantitative genomics has revealed the complexity of \"Saccharomyces\" species to the extent that yeasts involved in beer and wine production commonly involve hybrids of so-called pure species. As such, the yeasts involved in what has been typically called top-cropping or top-fermenting ale may be both \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and complex hybrids of \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and \"Saccharomyces kudriavzevii\". Three notable ales, Chimay, Orval and Westmalle, are fermented with these hybrid strains, which are identical to wine yeasts from Switzerland.\nWarm fermentation.\nIn general, yeasts such as \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" are fermented at warm temperatures between , occasionally as high as , while the yeast used by Brasserie Dupont for saison ferments even higher at . They generally form a foam on the surface of the fermenting beer, which is called barm, as during the fermentation process its hydrophobic surface causes the flocs to adhere to CO2 and rise; because of this, they are often referred to as \"top-cropping\" or \"top-fermenting\" \u2013 though this distinction is less clear in modern brewing with the use of cylindro-conical tanks. Generally, warm-fermented beers, which are usually termed ale, are ready to drink within three weeks after the beginning of fermentation, although some brewers will condition or mature them for several months.\nCool fermentation.\nWhen a beer has been brewed using a cool fermentation of around , compared to typical warm fermentation temperatures of , then stored (or lagered) for typically several weeks (or months) at temperatures close to freezing point, it is termed a \"lager\". During the lagering or storage phase several flavour components developed during fermentation dissipate, resulting in a \"cleaner\" flavour. Though it is the slow, cool fermentation and cold conditioning (or lagering) that defines the character of lager, the main technical difference is with the yeast generally used, which is \"Saccharomyces pastorianus\". Technical differences include the ability of lager yeast to metabolise melibiose, and the tendency to settle at the bottom of the fermenter (though ale yeasts can also become bottom settling by selection); though these technical differences are not considered by scientists to be influential in the character or flavour of the finished beer, brewers feel otherwise \u2013 sometimes cultivating their own yeast strains which may suit their brewing equipment or for a particular purpose, such as brewing beers with a high abv.\nBrewers in Bavaria had for centuries been selecting cold-fermenting yeasts by storing (\"lagern\") their beers in cold alpine caves. The process of natural selection meant that the wild yeasts that were most cold tolerant would be the ones that would remain actively fermenting \nin the beer that was stored in the caves. A sample of these Bavarian yeasts was sent from the Spaten brewery in Munich to the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen in 1845 who began brewing with it. In 1883 Emile Hansen completed a study on pure yeast culture isolation and the pure strain obtained from Spaten went into industrial production in 1884 as Carlsberg yeast No 1. Another specialised pure yeast production plant was installed at the Heineken Brewery in Rotterdam the following year and together they began the supply of pure cultured yeast to brewers across Europe. This yeast strain was originally classified as \"Saccharomyces carlsbergensis\", a now defunct species name which has been superseded by the currently accepted taxonomic classification \"Saccharomyces pastorianus\".\nSpontaneous fermentation.\nLambic beers are historically brewed in Brussels and the nearby Pajottenland region of Belgium without any yeast inoculation. The wort is cooled in open vats (called \"coolships\"), where the yeasts and microbiota present in the brewery (such as \"Brettanomyces\") are allowed to settle to create a spontaneous fermentation, and are then conditioned or matured in oak barrels for typically one to three years.\nConditioning.\nAfter an initial or primary fermentation, beer is \"conditioned\", matured or aged, in one of several ways, which can take from 2 to 4 weeks, several months, or several years, depending on the brewer's intention for the beer. The beer is usually transferred into a second container, so that it is no longer exposed to the dead yeast and other debris (also known as \"trub\") that have settled to the bottom of the primary fermenter. This prevents the formation of unwanted flavours and harmful compounds such as acetaldehyde.\nKr\u00e4usening (pronounced ) is a conditioning method in which fermenting wort is added to the finished beer. The active yeast will restart fermentation in the finished beer, and so introduce fresh carbon dioxide; the conditioning tank will be then sealed so that the carbon dioxide is dissolved into the beer producing a lively \"condition\" or level of carbonation. The kr\u00e4usening method may also be used to condition bottled beer.\nLagers are stored at cellar temperature or below for 1\u20136 months while still on the yeast. The process of storing, or conditioning, or maturing, or aging a beer at a low temperature for a long period is called \"lagering\", and while it is associated with lagers, the process may also be done with ales, with the same result \u2013 that of cleaning up various chemicals, acids and compounds.\nDuring secondary fermentation, most of the remaining yeast will settle to the bottom of the second fermenter, yielding a less hazy product.\nSome beers undergo an additional fermentation in the bottle giving natural carbonation. This may be a second and/or third fermentation. They are bottled with a viable yeast population in suspension. If there is no residual fermentable sugar left, sugar or wort or both may be added in a process known as priming. The resulting fermentation generates CO2 that is trapped in the bottle, remaining in solution and providing natural carbonation. Bottle-conditioned beers may be either filled unfiltered direct from the fermentation or conditioning tank, or filtered and then reseeded with yeast.\nCask ale (or cask-conditioned beer) is unfiltered, unpasteurised beer that is conditioned by a secondary fermentation in a metal, plastic or wooden cask. It is dispensed from the cask by being either poured from a tap by gravity, or pumped up from a cellar via a beer engine (hand pump). Sometimes a cask breather is used to keep the beer fresh by allowing carbon dioxide to replace oxygen as the beer is drawn off the cask. Until 2018, the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) defined real ale as beer \"served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide\", which would disallow the use of a cask breather, a policy which was reversed in April 2018 to allow beer served with the use of cask breathers to meet its definition of real ale.\nBarrel-ageing (US: Barrel aging) is the process of ageing beer in wooden barrels to achieve a variety of effects in the final product. Sour beers such as lambics are fully fermented in wood, while other beers are aged in barrels which were previously used for maturing wines or spirits. In 2016 \"Craft Beer and Brewing\" wrote: \"Barrel-aged beers are so trendy that nearly every taphouse and beer store has a section of them.\nFiltering.\nFiltering stabilises the flavour of beer, holding it at a point acceptable to the brewer, and preventing further development from the yeast, which under poor conditions can release negative components and flavours. Filtering also removes haze, clearing the beer, and so giving it a \"polished shine and brilliance\". Beer with a clear appearance has been commercially desirable for brewers since the development of glass vessels for storing and drinking beer, along with the commercial success of pale lager, which \u2013 due to the lagering process in which haze and particles settle to the bottom of the tank and so the beer \"drops bright\" (clears) \u2013 has a natural bright appearance and shine. \nThere are several forms of filters; they may be in the form of sheets or \"candles\", or they may be a fine powder such as diatomaceous earth (also called kieselguhr), which is added to the beer to form a filtration bed which allows liquid to pass, but holds onto suspended particles such as yeast. Filters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g., hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters tight enough to strain colour and body from the beer. Filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine, and sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration removes almost all cloudiness. Sterile filtration removes almost all microorganisms. Polysaccharides, proteins, yeast, bacteria and the brewing process may affect filtration..\nThese filters use sheets that allow only particles smaller than a given size to pass through. The sheets are placed into a filtering frame, sanitised (with boiling water, for example) and then used to filter the beer. The sheets can be flushed if the filter becomes blocked. The sheets are usually disposable and are replaced between filtration sessions. Often the sheets contain powdered filtration media to aid in filtration.\nPre-made filters have two sides. One with loose holes, and the other with tight holes. Flow goes from the side with loose holes to the side with the tight holes, with the intent that large particles get stuck in the large holes while leaving enough room around the particles and filter medium for smaller particles to go through and get stuck in tighter holes.\nSheets are sold in nominal ratings, and typically 90% of particles larger than the nominal rating are caught by the sheet.\nFilters that use a powder medium are considerably more complicated to operate, but can filter much more beer before regeneration. Common media include diatomaceous earth and perlite.\nBy-products.\nBrewing by-products are \"spent grain\" and the sediment (or \"dregs\") from the filtration process which may be dried and resold as \"brewers dried yeast\" for poultry feed, or made into yeast extract which is used in brands such as Vegemite and Marmite. The process of turning the yeast sediment into edible yeast extract was discovered by German scientist Justus von Liebig.\nBrewer's spent grain (also called spent grain, brewer's grain or draff) is the main by-product of the brewing process; it consists of the residue of malt and grain which remains in the lauter tun after the lautering process. It consists primarily of grain husks, pericarp, and fragments of endosperm. As it mainly consists of carbohydrates and proteins, and is readily consumed by animals, spent grain is used in animal feed. Spent grains can also be used as fertiliser, whole grains in bread, as well as in the production of flour and biogas. Spent grain is also an ideal medium for growing mushrooms, such as shiitake, and some breweries are already either growing their own mushrooms or supplying spent grain to mushroom farms. Spent grains can be used in the production of red bricks, to improve the open porosity and reduce thermal conductivity of the ceramic mass.\nBrewing industry.\nThe brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of other producers known as microbreweries or regional breweries or craft breweries depending on size, region, and marketing preference. More than are sold per year\u2014producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (\u00a3147.7 billion) as of 2006. SABMiller became the largest brewing company in the world when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand Grolsch. InBev was the second-largest beer-producing company in the world and Anheuser-Busch held the third spot, but after the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by InBev, the new Anheuser-Busch InBev company is currently the largest brewer in the world.\nBrewing at home is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries. Restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the UK in 1963, Australia followed suit in 1972, and the US in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "4419", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4419", "title": "Breast reconstruction", "text": "Surgical rebuilding of a breast\nBreast reconstruction is the surgical process of rebuilding the shape and look of a breast, most commonly in women who have had surgery to treat breast cancer. It involves using autologous tissue, prosthetic implants, or a combination of both with the goal of reconstructing a natural-looking breast. This process often also includes the rebuilding of the nipple and areola, known as nipple-areola complex (NAC) reconstruction, as one of the final stages.\nGenerally, the aesthetic appearance is acceptable to the woman, but the reconstructed area is commonly completely numb afterwards, which results in loss of sexual function as well as the ability to perceive pain caused by burns and other injuries.\nTiming.\nBreast reconstruction can be performed either immediately following the mastectomy or as a separate procedure at a later date, known as immediate reconstruction and delayed reconstruction, respectively. The decision of when breast reconstruction will take place is patient-specific and based on many different factors. Breast reconstruction is a large undertaking that usually requires multiple operations. These subsequent surgeries may be spread out over weeks or months.\nImmediate reconstruction.\nBreast reconstruction is termed \"immediate\" when it takes place during the same procedure as the mastectomy. Within the United States, approximately 35% of women who have undergone a total mastectomy for breast cancer will choose to pursue immediate breast reconstruction. One of the inherent advantages of immediate reconstruction is the potential for a single-stage procedure. This also means that the cost of immediate reconstruction is often far less to the patient. It can also reduce hospital costs by having fewer procedures and requiring a shorter length of the stay as an inpatient. Additionally, immediate reconstruction often has a better cosmetic result because of the preservation of anatomic landmarks and skin. With regards to psychosocial outcomes, opinions on timing have shifted in favor of immediate reconstruction. Originally, delayed reconstruction was believed to provide patients with time to psychologically adjust to the mastectomy and its effects on body image. However, this opinion is no longer widely held. Compared to delayed procedures, immediate reconstruction can have a more positive psychological impact on patients and their self-esteem, most likely due to the post-operative breast more closely resembling the natural breast compared to the defect left by mastectomy alone.\nDelayed reconstruction.\nDelayed breast reconstruction is considered more challenging than immediate reconstruction. Frequently not just breast volume, but also skin surface area needs to be restored. Many patients undergoing delayed breast reconstruction have been previously treated with radiation or have had a reconstruction failure with immediate breast reconstruction. In nearly all cases of delayed breast reconstruction tissue must be borrowed from another part of the body to make the new breast. Patients expected to receive radiation therapy as part of their adjuvant treatment are also commonly considered for delayed autologous reconstruction due to significantly higher complication rates with tissue expander-implant techniques in those patients. While waiting to begin breast reconstruction until several months after radiation therapy may decrease the risk of complications, this risk will always be higher in patients who have received radiation therapy. As with many other surgeries, patients with significant medical comorbidities (e.g., high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes) and smokers are higher-risk candidates. Surgeons may choose to perform delayed reconstruction to decrease this risk.\nTechniques.\nThere are several techniques for breast reconstruction. These options are broadly categorized into two different groups:\nImplant-based reconstruction.\nThis is the most common technique used worldwide. Implant-based reconstruction is an option for patients who have sufficient skin after mastectomy to cover a prosthetic implant and allow for a natural shape. For women undergoing bilateral mastectomies, implants provide the greatest opportunity for symmetrical shape and lift. Additionally, these procedures are generally much faster than flap-based reconstruction since tissue does not have to be taken from another part of the patient's body.\nImplant-based reconstruction may be one- or two-staged. In one-stage reconstruction, a permanent implant is inserted at the time of mastectomy. During two-stage reconstruction, the surgeon will insert a tissue expander underneath the pectoralis major muscle of the chest wall at the time of mastectomy. This temporary silastic implant is used to hold tension on the mastectomy flaps. In doing so, the tissue expander prevents the breast tissue from contracting and allows for use of a larger implant later on compared to what would be safe at the time of the mastectomy. Following this initial procedure, the patient must return to the clinic on multiple occasions for saline to be injected into a tube inside the tissue expander. By doing this slowly over the course of several weeks, the space beneath the pectoralis major muscle is safely expanded to an appropriate size without causing too much stress on the breast tissue. A second procedure is then necessary to remove the tissue expander and replace it with the final, permanent prosthetic implant.\nAlthough in the past, prosthetic implants were placed directly under the skin, this method has fallen out of favor because of the greater risk of complications, including visible rippling of the implant and capsular contracture. The sub-pectoral technique described above is now preferred because it provides an additional muscular layer between the skin and the implant, decreasing the risk of visible deformity. Oftentimes, however, the pectoralis major muscle is not sufficiently large enough to cover the inferior portion of the prosthetic implant. If this is the case, one option is to use an acellular dermal matrix to cover the exposed portion of the prosthetic implant, improving both functional and aesthetic outcomes. This prepectoral space has recently, however, come back into practice, with comparable rates of post-operative complications and implant loss to submuscular placement. Both delayed and direct-to-implant reconstruction in this plane has been shown to be favourable.\nOf note, a Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that implants for use in breast reconstructive surgery have not been adequately studied in good quality clinical trials. \"These days - even after a few million women have had breasts reconstructed \u2013 surgeons cannot inform women about the risks and complications of different implant-based breast reconstructive options on the basis of results derived from Randomized Controlled Trials.\"\nFlap-based reconstruction.\nFlap-based reconstruction uses tissue from other parts of the patient's body (i.e., autologous tissue) such as the back, buttocks, thigh or abdomen. In surgery, a \"flap\" is any type of tissue that is lifted from a donor site and moved to a recipient site using its own blood supply. Usually, the blood supply is a named vessel. Flap-based reconstruction may be performed either by leaving the donor tissue connected to the original site (also known as a pedicle flap) to retain its blood supply (where the vessels are tunneled beneath the skin surface to the new site) or by cutting the donor tissue's vessels and surgically reconnecting them to a new blood supply at the recipient site (also known as a free flap or free tissue transfer). The latissimus dorsi is a prime example of such a flap since it can remain attached to its primary blood source which preserves the skins functioning, and is associated with better outcomes in comparison to other muscle and skin donor sites. \u00a0\nOne option for breast reconstruction involves using the latissimus dorsi muscle as the donor tissue. As a back muscle, the latissimus dorsi is large and flat and can be used without significant loss of function. It can be moved into the breast defect while still attached to its blood supply under the arm pit (axilla). A latissimus flap is often used to recruit soft-tissue coverage over an underlying implant; however, if the latissimus flap can provide enough volume, then occasionally it is used to reconstruct small breasts without the need for an implant. The latissimus dorsi flap has a number of advantages, but despite the advances in surgical techniques, it has remained vulnerable to skin dehiscence or necrosis at the donor site (on the back). The Mannu flap is a form of latissimus dorsi flap which avoids this complication by preserving a generous subcutaneous fat layer at the donor site and has been shown to be a safe, simple and effective way of avoiding wound dehiscence at the donor site after extended latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction.\nAnother possible donor site for breast reconstruction is the abdomen. The TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap or its technically distinct variants of microvascular \"perforator flaps\" like the DIEP/SIEA flaps are all commonly used. In a TRAM procedure, a portion of the abdominal tissue, which includes skin, subcutaneous fat, minor muscles, and connective tissues, is taken from the patient's abdomen and transplanted to the breast site. Both TRAM and DIEP/SIEA use the abdominal tissue between the umbilicus (or \"belly button\") and the pubis. The DIEP flap and free-TRAM flap require advanced microsurgical technique and are less common as a result. Both can provide enough tissue to reconstruct large breasts and are a good option for patients who would prefer to maintain their pre-operative breast volume. These procedures are preferred by some breast cancer patients because removal of the donor site tissue results in an abdominoplasty (tummy tuck) and allow the breast to be reconstructed with one's own tissues instead of a prosthetic implant that uses foreign material. That said, TRAM flap procedures can potentially weaken the abdominal wall and torso strength, but they are generally well tolerated by most patients. Perforator techniques such as the DIEP (deep inferior epigastric perforator) flap and SIEA (superficial inferior epigastric artery) flap require precise dissection of small perforating vessels through the rectus muscle and, thus, do not require removal of abdominal muscle. Because of this, these flaps have the advantage of maintaining the majority of abdominal wall strength.\nOther donor sites for autologous breast reconstruction include the buttocks, which provides tissue for the SGAP and IGAP (superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator, respectively) flaps. The purpose of perforator flaps (DIEP, SIEA, SGAP, IGAP) is to provide sufficient skin and fat for an aesthetic reconstruction while minimizing post-operative complications from harvesting the underlying muscles. DIEP reconstruction generally produces the best outcome for most women. See free flap breast reconstruction for more information.\nMold-assisted reconstruction is a potential adjunctive process to help in flap-based reconstruction. By using a laser and 3D printer, a patient-specific silicone mold can be used as an aid during surgery, used as a guide for orienting and shaping the flap to improve accuracy and symmetry.\nAdjunctive procedures.\nTo restore the appearance of the pre-operative breast, there are a few options regarding the nipple-areolar complex (NAC):\nWhen looking at the entire process of breast reconstruction, patients typically report that NAC reconstruction is the least satisfying step. Compared to a normal nipple, the reconstructed nipple often has less projection (how far the nipple extends beyond the breast mound) and lacks sensation. In women who have undergone a single mastectomy with reconstruction, another challenge is aesthetically matching the reconstructed NAC to the native breast.\nOutcomes.\nThe typical outcome of breast reconstruction surgery is a breast mound with a pleasing aesthetic shape, with a texture similar to a natural breast, but which feels completely or mostly numb for the woman herself. This loss of sensation, called \"somatosensory loss\" or the inability to perceive touch, heat, cold, and pain, sometimes results in women burning themselves or injuring themselves without noticing, or not noticing that their clothing has shifted to expose their breasts. \"I can't even feel it when my kids hug me,\" said one mother, who had nipple-sparing breast reconstruction after a bilateral mastectomy. The loss of sensation has long-term medical consequences, because it makes the affected women unable to feel itchy rashes, infected sores, cuts, bruises, or situations that risk sunburns or frostbite on the affected areas.\nMore than half of women treated for breast cancer develop upper quarter dysfunction, including limits on how well they can move, pain in the breast, shoulder or arm, lymphedema, loss of sensation, and impaired strength. The risk of dysfunction is higher among women who have breast reconstruction surgery. One in three have complications, one in five need further surgery and the procedure fails in 5%.\nSome methods have specific side effects. The transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap method results in weakness and loss of flexibility in the abdominal wall. Reconstruction with implants have a higher risk of long-term pain.\nOutcomes-based research on quality of life improvements and psychosocial benefits associated with breast reconstruction served as the stimulus in the United States for the 1998 Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, which mandated that health care payer cover breast and nipple reconstruction, contralateral procedures to achieve symmetry, and treatment for the sequelae of mastectomy. This was followed in 2001 by additional legislation imposing penalties on noncompliant insurers. Similar provisions for coverage exist in most countries worldwide through national health care programs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

BHRA had a fleet of 16 trolleys (15 PCC trolleys and a leased 1897 trolley car from the Oslo Trams, in Oslo, Norway).\nHistory of project.\nThe BHRA's origin began with the rediscovery of the Cobble Hill Tunnel by the late Bob Diamond in 1980. BHRA was formed in 1982 to restore the historic tunnel. The Atlantic Avenue Tunnel (constructed in 1844) is the world's oldest subway tunnel. BHRA successfully filed and received designation for the tunnel on the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe BHRA received funding and permission from the city to construct a light rail route in Red Hook. However, the project was hampered due to the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) withdrawing its support from the project. The DOT identified several potential improvements which did not include a streetcar, however, that would improve access and mobility for neighborhood residents. Construction was stopped on a 7-block extension to the line due to the removal and scrapping of rails, ties, and other items of railroad equipment by the DOT, which were stored on land that was slated for the Fairway supermarket project.\nOn June 30, 2003, BHRA was ordered to remove and fill in all trolley tracks on public streets by the DOT. The DOT revoked consent for the project to proceed or exist on city streets. Shortly thereafter, BHRA completely ceased operation. All the PCC trolleys except for No. 3303 were removed from Brooklyn.\nThe BHRA ran organized tours of the Cobble Hill Tunnel from time to time, but all tours are currently suspended.\nBob Diamond died on 21 August 2021, with his death confirmed by articles in \"the New York Times\", \"New York Daily News\" and \"Brooklyn Eagle\" newspapers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A \"lactam\" is a cyclic amide, and \"beta\"-lactams are named so because the nitrogen atom is attached to the \u03b2-carbon atom relative to the carbonyl. The simplest \u03b2-lactam possible is 2-azetidinone. \u03b2-lactams are significant structural units of medicines as manifested in many \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Up to 1970, most \u03b2-lactam research was concerned with the penicillin and cephalosporin groups, but since then, a wide variety of structures have been described.\nClinical significance.\nThe \u03b2-lactam ring is part of the core structure of several antibiotic families, the principal ones being the penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and monobactams, which are, therefore, also called \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Nearly all of these antibiotics work by inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. This has a lethal effect on bacteria, although any given bacteria population will typically contain a subgroup that is resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. Bacterial resistance occurs as a result of the expression of one of many genes for the production of \u03b2-lactamases, a class of enzymes that break open the \u03b2-lactam ring. More than 1,800 different \u03b2-lactamase enzymes have been documented in various species of bacteria. These enzymes vary widely in their chemical structure and catalytic efficiencies. When bacterial populations have these resistant subgroups, treatment with \u03b2-lactam can result in the resistant strain becoming more prevalent and therefore more virulent. \u03b2-lactam derived antibiotics can be considered one of the most important antibiotic classes but prone to clinical resistance. \u03b2-lactam exhibits its antibiotic properties by imitating the naturally occurring d-Ala-d-Ala substrate for the group of enzymes known as penicillin binding proteins (PBP), which have as function to cross-link the peptidoglycan part of the cell wall of the bacteria.\nThe \u03b2-lactam ring is also found in some other drugs such as the cholesterol absorption inhibitor drug ezetimibe.\nSynthesis.\nThe first synthetic \u03b2-lactam was prepared by Hermann Staudinger in 1907 by reaction of the Schiff base of aniline and benzaldehyde with diphenylketene in a [2+2] cycloaddition (Ph indicates a phenyl functional group):\nMany methods have been developed for the synthesis of \u03b2-lactams.\nThe Breckpot \u03b2-lactam synthesis produces substituted \u03b2-lactams by the cyclization of beta amino acid esters by use of a Grignard reagent. Mukaiyama's reagent is also used in modified Breckpot synthesis. \nReactions.\nDue to ring strain, \u03b2-lactams are more readily hydrolyzed than linear amides or larger lactams. This strain is further increased by fusion to a second ring, as found in most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. This trend is due to the amide character of the \u03b2-lactam being reduced by the aplanarity of the system. The nitrogen atom of an ideal amide is sp2-hybridized due to resonance, and sp2-hybridized atoms have trigonal planar bond geometry. As a pyramidal bond geometry is forced upon the nitrogen atom by the ring strain, the resonance of the amide bond is reduced, and the carbonyl becomes more ketone-like. Nobel laureate Robert Burns Woodward described a parameter \"h\" as a measure of the height of the trigonal pyramid defined by the nitrogen (as the apex) and its three adjacent atoms. \"h\" corresponds to the strength of the \u03b2-lactam bond with lower numbers (more planar; more like ideal amides) being stronger and less reactive. Monobactams have \"h\" values between 0.05 and 0.10\u00a0angstroms (\u00c5). Cephems have \"h\" values in of 0.20\u20130.25\u00a0\u00c5. Penams have values in the range 0.40\u20130.50\u00a0\u00c5, while carbapenems and clavams have values of 0.50\u20130.60\u00a0\u00c5, being the most reactive of the \u03b2-lactams toward hydrolysis.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "4430", "revid": "16156540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4430", "title": "BASE jumping", "text": "Sport of jumping from fixed objects using a parachute\nBASE jumping () is the recreational sport of jumping from fixed objects, using a parachute to descend to the ground. BASE is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: buildings, antennas (referring to radio masts), spans (bridges) and earth (cliffs). Participants jump from a fixed object such as a cliff and after an optional freefall delay deploy a parachute to slow their descent and land. A popular form of BASE jumping is wingsuit BASE jumping.\nIn contrast to other forms of parachuting, such as skydiving from airplanes, BASE jumps are performed from fixed objects that are generally at much lower altitudes, and BASE jumpers only carry one parachute.\nBASE jumping is significantly more hazardous than other forms of parachuting and is widely considered to be one of the most dangerous extreme sports.\nHistory.\nPrecursors.\nFausto Veranzio is widely believed to have been the first person to build and test a parachute, by jumping from St Mark's Campanile in Venice in 1617 when he was more than 65 years old. However these and other sporadic incidents were one-time experiments, not the actual systematic pursuit of a new form of parachuting.\nBirth of B.A.S.E. jumping.\nPrecursors to the sport date back hundreds of years. In 1966 Michael Pelkey and Brian Schubert jumped from El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. The acronym B.A.S.E. (now more commonly BASE) was later coined by filmmaker Carl Boenish, his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith, and Phil Mayfield. Carl Boenish was an important catalyst behind modern BASE jumping and in 1978 he filmed jumps from El Capitan made using ram-air parachutes and the freefall tracking technique. While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping.\nAfter 1978 the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as an actual publicity exercise or as a movie stunt but as a true recreational activity. It was this that popularized BASE jumping more widely among parachutists. Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE jump off the Troll Wall. By this time the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps.\nDuring the early eighties, nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components. Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping.\nIn recent years, recognizing the sport's growing appeal and the potential for high-impact marketing, companies such as Red Bull have stepped in to sponsor athletes, further elevating the sport's profile.\nBASE numbers.\nUpon completing a jump from all of the four object categories, a jumper may choose to apply for a \"BASE number\", awarded sequentially by Rick and Joy Harrison.\nEquipment.\nIn the early days of BASE jumping, people used modified skydiving gear, such as by removing the deployment bag and slider, stowing the lines in a tail pocket, and fitting a large pilot chute. However, modified skydiving gear is prone to kinds of malfunction that are rare in normal skydiving (such as \"line-overs\" and broken lines). Modern purpose-built BASE jumping equipment is considered to be much safer and more reliable.\nParachute.\nThe biggest difference in gear is that skydivers jump with both a main and a reserve parachute, while BASE jumpers carry only one parachute. BASE jumping parachutes are larger than skydiving parachutes and are typically flown with a wing loading of around . Vents are one element that make a parachute suitable for BASE jumping. BASE jumpers often use extra large pilot chutes to compensate for lower airspeed parachute deployments. On jumps from lower altitudes, the slider is removed for faster parachute opening.\nHarness and container.\nBASE jumpers use a single-parachute harness and container system. Since there is only a single parachute, BASE jumping containers are mechanically much simpler than skydiving containers. This simplicity contributes to the safety and reliability of BASE jumping gear by eliminating many malfunctions that can occur with more complicated skydiving equipment. Since there is no reserve parachute, there is little need to cut-away their parachute, and many BASE harnesses do not contain a 3-ring release system. A modern ultralight BASE system including parachute, container, and harness can weigh as little as .\nClothing.\nWhen jumping from high mountains, BASE jumpers will often use special clothing to improve control and flight characteristics in the air. Wingsuit flying has become a popular form of BASE jumping in recent years, allowing jumpers to glide over long horizontal distances. Tracking suits inflate like wingsuits to give additional lift to jumpers, but maintain separation of arms and legs to allow for greater mobility and safety.\nTechnique.\nBASE jumps can be broadly classified into low jumps and high jumps. The primary distinguishing characteristic of low BASE jumps versus high BASE jumps is the use of a slider reefing device to control the opening speed of the parachute, and whether the jumper falls long enough to reach terminal velocity.\nLow BASE jumps.\nLow BASE jumps are those where the jumper does not reach terminal velocity. Sometimes referred to as \"slider down\" jumps because they are typically performed without a slider reefing device on the parachute. The lack of a slider enables the parachute to open more quickly. Other techniques for low BASE jumps include the use of a static line, direct bag, or P.C.A. (pilot chute assist). These devices form an attachment between the parachute and the jump platform, which stretches out the parachute and suspension lines as the jumper falls, before separating and allowing the parachute to inflate. This enables the very lowest jumps\u2014below to be made. It is common in the UK to jump from around the mark, due to the number of low cliffs at this height. Base jumpers have been known to jump from objects as low as , which leaves little to no canopy time and requires an immediate flare to land safely.\nHigh BASE jumps.\nMany BASE jumpers are motivated to make jumps from higher objects involving free fall. High BASE jumps are those which are high enough for the jumper to reach terminal velocity. High BASE jumps are often called \"slider up\" jumps due to the use of a slider reefing device.\nHigh BASE jumps present different hazards than low BASE jumps. With greater height and airspeed, jumpers can fly away from the cliff during freefall, allowing them to deploy their parachute far away from the cliff they jumped from and significantly reduce the chance of object striking. However, high BASE jumps also present new hazards such as complications resulting from the use of a wingsuit.\nTandem BASE jumps.\nTandem BASE jumping is when a skilled pilot jumps with a passenger attached to their front. It is similar to skydiving and is offered in the US and many other countries. Tandem BASE is becoming a more accessible and legal form of BASE jumping.\nRecords.\n\"Guinness World Records\" first listed a BASE jumping record with married couple Jean and Carl Boenish's 1984 leap from Trollveggen (Troll Wall) in Norway. It was described at the time as the highest cliff jump. The jump was made two days before Carl's death at the same site.\nOn August 26, 1992, Australians Nic Feteris and Glenn Singleman made a BASE jump from an altitude of jump off the Trango Towers in Pakistan. It was the highest BASE jump off the earth at the time.\nOn May 23, 2006, Glenn Singleman and Heather Swan made a BASE jump from an altitude of off Meru Peak in Northern India, breaking Singleman and Feteris's previous record for the highest BASE jump off the earth. They jumped in wingsuits. In 2015, they also made the first ever wingsuit jump across the Grand Canyon, flying approximately 11km from one side to the other.\nDaniel Schilling set the Guinness World Record for the most BASE jumps in a twenty-four-hour period, jumping off the Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, Idaho, a record 201 times on July 8, 2006.\nOn May 5, 2013, Russian Valery Rozov jumped off Changtse (the northern peak of the Mount Everest massif) from a height of . Using a specially developed wingsuit, he glided down to the Rongbuk glacier more than 1,000 meters below, setting a new world record for highest altitude base jump. \nOn October 5, 2016, Rozov broke his own record for highest altitude BASE jump when he leapt from a height of from Cho Oyu, the sixth-highest mountain in the world, landing on a glacier approximately two minutes later . He later died while attempting another high-altitude BASE jump in Nepal in 2017.\nCompetitions.\nBASE competitions have been held since the early 1980s, with accurate landings or free-fall aerobatics used as the judging criteria. Recent years have seen a formal competition held at the high Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, judged on landing accuracy. In 2012 the World Wingsuit League held their first wingsuit BASE jumping competition in China.\nComparison with skydiving.\nBASE jumps are typically performed from much lower altitudes than in skydiving. Skydivers are required to deploy their main parachute above altitude. BASE jumps are frequently made from less than . A BASE jump from a object is only about 5.6 seconds from the ground if the jumper remains in free fall. Standard skydiving parachute systems are not designed for this situation, so BASE jumpers use specially designed harnesses and parachute systems.\nMany BASE jumps, particularly in the UK, are made from around due to the number of low cliffs at this height. Jumpers will use a static line method to ensure their canopy is extracted as they jump, as at this height, it is too low to freefall.\nBASE jumps generally entail slower airspeeds than typical skydives (due to the limited altitude); a BASE jumper does not always reach terminal velocity. Skydivers use the airflow to stabilize their position. BASE jumpers, falling at lower speeds, have less aerodynamic control. The attitude of the body at the moment of jumping determines the stability of flight in the first few seconds, before sufficient airspeed has built up to enable aerodynamic stability. On low BASE jumps, parachute deployment takes place during this early phase of flight. If the parachute is deployed while the jumper is unstable, there is a high risk of entanglement or malfunction. The jumper may also not be facing the right direction. Such an off-heading opening is not as problematic in skydiving, but an off-heading opening that results in object strike has caused many serious injuries and deaths in BASE jumping.\nBASE jumps are more hazardous than skydives primarily due to proximity to the object serving as the jump platform. BASE jumping frequently occurs in mountainous terrain, often having much smaller areas in which to land in comparison to a typical skydiving dropzone. BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than similar sports such as skydiving from aircraft.\nLegality.\nBASE jumping is generally not illegal in most places. However, in some cases such as building and antenna jumps, jumping is often done covertly without the permission of owners, which can lead to charges such as trespassing. In some jurisdictions it may be permissible to use land until specifically told not to. The Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, Idaho, is an example of a man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit.\nIn U.S. National Parks, BASE jumping is allowed pursuant to the terms of a special use permit. There is no record of the U.S. National Parks granting a permit for BASE jumping, with the sole exception of a permit granted for the annual Bridge Day event in New River Gorge National Park. Other U.S. public land, including land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, does not ban BASE jumping, and there are numerous jumpable objects on BLM land.\nThe legal position is different at other sites and in other countries. For example, in Norway's Lysefjord (from the mountain Kjerag), BASE jumpers are made welcome. Many sites in the European Alps, near Chamonix and on the Eiger, are also open to jumpers. Some other Norwegian places, like the Troll Wall, are banned because of dangerous rescue missions in the past. In Austria, jumping from mountain cliffs is generally allowed, whereas the use of bridges (such as the Europabruecke near Innsbruck, Tirol) or dams is generally prohibited. Australia has some of the toughest stances on BASE jumping: it specifically bans BASE jumping from certain objects, such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge.\nSafety.\nRecent statistics reflect improved safety of the activity. The 2024 Bridge Day Event which saw the participation of 325 BASE jumpers completing 755 BASE jumps resulted in zero jumper injuries, in contrast to two non-jumper related medical transports from the same event. And in the year 2023 the United States saw zero BASE fatalities. A study of BASE jumping fatalities estimated that the overall annual fatality risk in 2002 was one fatality per 60 participants. A study of 20,850 BASE jumps from the Kjerag Massif in Norway reported nine fatalities over the 11-year period from 1995 to 2005, or one in every 2,317 jumps. However, at that site, one in every 254 jumps over that period resulted in a nonfatal accident. BASE jumping is one of the most dangerous recreational activities in the world, with a fatality and injury rate 43 times higher than that of parachuting from a plane.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], the BASE Fatality List records 480 deaths for BASE jumping since April 1981.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4431", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4431", "title": "Beauty", "text": "Characteristic that provides pleasure or satisfaction\nBeauty is commonly described as a feature of objects that makes them pleasurable to perceive. Such objects include landscapes, sunsets, humans and works of art. Beauty, art and taste are the main subjects of aesthetics, one of the fields of study within philosophy. As a positive aesthetic value, it is contrasted with ugliness as its negative counterpart.\nOne difficulty in understanding beauty is that it has both objective and subjective aspects: it is seen as a property of things but also as depending on the emotional response of observers. Because of its subjective side, beauty is said to be \"in the eye of the beholder\". It has been argued that the ability on the side of the subject needed to perceive and judge beauty, sometimes referred to as the \"sense of taste\", can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run. This suggests the standards of validity of judgments of beauty are intersubjective, i.e. dependent on a group of judges, rather than fully subjective or objective.\nConceptions of beauty aim to capture what is essential to all beautiful things. \"Classical conceptions\" define beauty in terms of the relation between the beautiful object as a whole and its parts: the parts should stand in the right proportion to each other and thus compose an integrated harmonious whole. \"Hedonist conceptions\" see a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause disinterested pleasure. Other conceptions include defining beautiful objects in terms of their value, of a loving attitude toward them or of their function.\nOverview.\nBeauty, together with art and taste, is the main subject of aesthetics, one of the major branches of philosophy. Beauty is usually categorized as an aesthetic property besides other properties, like grace, elegance or the sublime. As a positive aesthetic value, beauty is contrasted with ugliness as its negative counterpart. Beauty is often listed as one of the three fundamental concepts of human understanding besides truth and goodness.\nObjectivists or realists see beauty as an objective or mind-independent feature of beautiful things, which is denied by \"subjectivists\". The source of this debate is that judgments of beauty seem to be based on subjective grounds, namely our feelings, while claiming universal correctness at the same time. This tension is sometimes referred to as the \"antinomy of taste\". Adherents of both sides have suggested that a certain faculty, commonly called a \"sense of taste\", is necessary for making reliable judgments about beauty. David Hume, for example, suggests that this faculty can be trained and that the verdicts of experts coincide in the long run.\nBeauty is mainly discussed in relation to \"concrete objects\" accessible to sensory perception. It has been suggested that the beauty of a thing supervenes on the sensory features of this thing. It has also been proposed that abstract objects like stories or mathematical proofs can be beautiful. Beauty plays a central role in works of art and nature.\nAn influential distinction among beautiful things, according to Immanuel Kant, is that between \"adherent\" beauty (\"pulchritudo adhaerens\") and \"free beauty\" (\"pulchritudo vaga\"). A thing has adherent beauty if its beauty depends on the conception or function of this thing, unlike free or absolute beauty. Examples of adherent beauty include an ox which is beautiful as an ox but not beautiful as a horse or a photograph which is beautiful, because it depicts a beautiful building but that lacks beauty generally speaking because of its low quality.\nObjectivism and subjectivism.\nJudgments of beauty seem to occupy an intermediary position between objective judgments, e.g. concerning the mass and shape of a grapefruit, and subjective likes, e.g. concerning whether the grapefruit tastes good. Judgments of beauty differ from the former because they are based on subjective feelings rather than objective perception. But they also differ from the latter because they lay claim on universal correctness. This tension is also reflected in common language. On the one hand, we talk about beauty as an objective feature of the world that is ascribed, for example, to landscapes, paintings or humans. The subjective side, on the other hand, is expressed in sayings like \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\".\nThese two positions are often referred to as \"objectivism\" (or realism) and \"subjectivism\". \"Objectivism\" is the traditional view, while subjectivism developed more recently in western philosophy. Objectivists hold that beauty is a mind-independent feature of things. On this account, the beauty of a landscape is independent of who perceives it or whether it is perceived at all. Disagreements may be explained by an inability to perceive this feature, sometimes referred to as a \"lack of taste\". Subjectivism, on the other hand, denies the mind-independent existence of beauty. Influential for the development of this position was John Locke's distinction between primary qualities, which the object has independent of the observer, and secondary qualities, which constitute powers in the object to produce certain ideas in the observer. When applied to beauty, there is still a sense in which it depends on the object and its powers. But this account makes the possibility of genuine disagreements about claims of beauty implausible, since the same object may produce very different ideas in distinct observers. The notion of \"taste\" can still be used to explain why different people disagree about what is beautiful, but there is no objectively right or wrong taste, there are just different tastes.\nThe problem with both the objectivist and the subjectivist position in their extreme form is that each has to deny some intuitions about beauty. This issue is sometimes discussed under the label \"antinomy of taste\". It has prompted various philosophers to seek a unified theory that can take all these intuitions into account. One promising route to solve this problem is to move from subjective to \"intersubjective theories\", which hold that the standards of validity of judgments of taste are intersubjective or dependent on a group of judges rather than objective. This approach tries to explain how genuine disagreement about beauty is possible despite the fact that beauty is a mind-dependent property, dependent not on an individual but a group. A closely related theory sees beauty as a \"secondary\" or \"response-dependent property\". On one such account, an object is beautiful \"if it causes pleasure by virtue of its aesthetic properties\". The problem that different people respond differently can be addressed by combining response-dependence theories with so-called \"ideal-observer theories\": it only matters how an ideal observer would respond. There is no general agreement on how \"ideal observers\" are to be defined, but it is usually assumed that they are experienced judges of beauty with a fully developed sense of taste. This suggests an indirect way of solving the \"antinomy of taste\": instead of looking for necessary and sufficient conditions of beauty itself, one can learn to identify the qualities of good critics and rely on their judgments. This approach only works if unanimity among experts was ensured. But even experienced judges may disagree in their judgments, which threatens to undermine ideal-observer theories.\nConceptions.\nClassical.\nThe \"classical conception\" defines beauty in terms of the relation between the beautiful object \"as a whole\" and its \"parts\": the parts should stand in the right proportion to each other and thus compose an integrated harmonious whole. On this account, which found its most explicit articulation in the Italian Renaissance, the beauty of a human body, for example, depends, among other things, on the right proportion of the different parts of the body and on the overall symmetry. One problem with this conception is that it is difficult to give a general and detailed description of what is meant by \"harmony between parts\" and raises the suspicion that defining beauty through harmony results in exchanging one unclear term for another one. Some attempts have been made to dissolve this suspicion by searching for \"laws of beauty\", like the golden ratio.\n18th century philosopher Alexander Baumgarten, for example, saw laws of beauty in analogy with laws of nature and believed that they could be discovered through empirical research. As of 2003, these attempts have failed to find a general definition of beauty and several authors take the opposite claim that such laws cannot be formulated, as part of their definition of beauty.\nHedonism.\nA very common element in many conceptions of beauty is its relation to pleasure. Hedonism makes this relation part of the definition of beauty by holding that there is a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause pleasure or that the experience of beauty is always accompanied by pleasure. This account is sometimes labeled as \"aesthetic hedonism\" in order to distinguish it from other forms of hedonism. An influential articulation of this position comes from Thomas Aquinas, who treats beauty as \"that which pleases in the very apprehension of it\". Immanuel Kant explains this pleasure through a harmonious interplay between the faculties of understanding and imagination. A further question for hedonists is how to explain the relation between beauty and pleasure. This problem is akin to the Euthyphro dilemma: is something beautiful because we enjoy it or do we enjoy it because it is beautiful? Identity theorists solve this problem by denying that there is a difference between beauty and pleasure: they identify beauty, or the appearance of it, with the experience of aesthetic pleasure.\nHedonists usually restrict and specify the notion of pleasure in various ways in order to avoid obvious counterexamples. One important distinction in this context is the difference between \"pure\" and \"mixed pleasure\". Pure pleasure excludes any form of pain or unpleasant feeling while the experience of mixed pleasure can include unpleasant elements. But beauty can involve mixed pleasure, for example, in the case of a beautifully tragic story, which is why mixed pleasure is usually allowed in hedonist conceptions of beauty.\nAnother problem faced by hedonist theories is that we take pleasure from many things that are not beautiful. One way to address this issue is to associate beauty with a special type of pleasure: \"aesthetic\" or \"disinterested pleasure\". A pleasure is disinterested if it is indifferent to the existence of the beautiful object or if it did not arise owing to an antecedent desire through means-end reasoning. For example, the joy of looking at a beautiful landscape would still be valuable if it turned out that this experience was an illusion, which would not be true if this joy was due to seeing the landscape as a valuable real estate opportunity. Opponents of hedonism usually concede that many experiences of beauty are pleasurable but deny that this is true for all cases. For example, a cold jaded critic may still be a good judge of beauty because of her years of experience but lack the joy that initially accompanied her work. One way to avoid this objection is to allow responses to beautiful things to lack pleasure while insisting that all beautiful things merit pleasure, that aesthetic pleasure is the only appropriate response to them.\nOthers.\nG. E. Moore explained beauty in regard to intrinsic value as \"that of which the admiring contemplation is good in itself\". This definition connects beauty to experience while managing to avoid some of the problems usually associated with subjectivist positions since it allows that things may be beautiful even if they are never experienced.\nAnother subjectivist theory of beauty comes from George Santayana, who suggested that we project pleasure onto the things we call \"beautiful\". So in a process akin to a category mistake, one treats one's subjective pleasure as an objective property of the beautiful thing. Other conceptions include defining beauty in terms of a loving or longing attitude toward the beautiful object or in terms of its usefulness or function. In 1871, functionalist Charles Darwin explained beauty as result of accumulative sexual selection in \"The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex\".\nIn philosophy.\nGreco-Roman tradition.\nThe classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words \"beauty\" or \"beautiful\" was \u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, \"kallos\", and the adjective was \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2, \"kalos\". This is also translated as \"good\" or \"of fine quality\" and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, \"kallos\" was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bore an erotic connotation. The Koine Greek word for beautiful was \u1f61\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2, \"h\u014draios\", an adjective etymologically coming from the word \u1f65\u03c1\u03b1, \"h\u014dra\", meaning \"hour\". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with \"being of one's hour\". Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, \"h\u014draios\" had many meanings, including \"youthful\" and \"ripe old age\". Another classical term in use to describe beauty was \"\" (Latin).\nBeauty for ancient thinkers existed both in , which is the material world as it is, and as embodied in the spirit, which is the world of mental formations. Greek mythology mentions Helen of Troy as the most beautiful woman. Ancient Greek architecture is based on this view of symmetry and proportion.\nPre-Socratic.\nIn one fragment of Heraclitus's writings (\"Fragment 106\") he mentions beauty, this reads: \"To God all things are beautiful, good, right...\" The earliest Western theory of beauty can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the pre-Socratic period, such as Pythagoras, who conceived of beauty as useful for a moral education of the soul. He wrote of how people experience pleasure when aware of a certain type of formal situation present in reality, perceivable by sight or through the ear and discovered the underlying mathematical ratios in the harmonic scales in music. The Pythagoreans conceived of the presence of beauty in universal terms, which is, as existing in a cosmological state, they observed beauty in \"the heavens\". They saw a strong connection between mathematics and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the golden ratio seemed more attractive.\nClassical period.\nThe classical concept of beauty is one that exhibits perfect proportion (Wolfflin). In this context, the concept belonged often within the discipline of mathematics. An idea of spiritual beauty emerged during the classical period, beauty was something embodying divine goodness, while the demonstration of behaviour which might be classified as beautiful, from an inner state of morality which is aligned to the good.\nThe writing of Xenophon shows a conversation between Socrates and Aristippus. Socrates discerned differences in the conception of the beautiful, for example, in inanimate objects, the effectiveness of execution of design was a deciding factor on the perception of beauty in something. By the account of Xenophon, Socrates found beauty congruent with that to which was defined as the morally good, in short, he thought beauty coincident with the good.\nBeauty is a subject of Plato in his work Symposium. In the work, the high priestess Diotima describes how beauty moves out from a core singular appreciation of the body to outer appreciations via loved ones, to the world in its state of culture and society (Wright). In other words, Diotoma gives to Socrates an explanation of how love should begin with erotic attachment, and end with the transcending of the physical to an appreciation of beauty as a thing in itself. The ascent of love begins with one's own body, then secondarily, in appreciating beauty in another's body, thirdly beauty in the soul, which cognates to beauty in the mind in the modern sense, fourthly beauty in institutions, laws and activities, fifthly beauty in knowledge, the sciences, and finally to lastly love beauty itself, which translates to the original Greek language term as \" to \". In the final state, \"auto to kalon\" and truth are united as one. There is the sense in the text, concerning love and beauty they both co-exist but are still independent or, in other words, mutually exclusive, since love does not have beauty since it seeks beauty. The work toward the end provides a description of beauty in a negative sense.\nPlato also discusses beauty in his work \"Phaedrus\", and identifies Alcibiades as beautiful in \"Parmenides\". He considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas. Platonic thought synthesized beauty with the divine. Scruton (cited: Konstan) states Plato states of the idea of beauty, of it (the idea), being something inviting desirousness (cf. ), and, promotes an intellectual (cf. ) of desire. For Alexander Nehamas, it is only the locating of desire to which the sense of beauty exists, in the considerations of Plato.\nAristotle defines beauty in Metaphysics as having order, symmetry and definiteness \"which the mathematical sciences exhibit to a special degree\". He saw a relationship between the beautiful (\"to kalon\") and virtue, arguing that \"Virtue aims at the beautiful.\"\nRoman.\nIn \"De Natura Deorum\", Cicero wrote: \"the splendour and beauty of creation\", in respect to this, and all the facets of reality resulting from creation, he postulated these to be a reason to see the existence of a God as creator.\nWestern Middle Ages.\nIn the Middle Ages, Catholic philosophers like Thomas Aquinas included beauty among the transcendental attributes of being. In his Summa Theologica, Aquinas described the three conditions of beauty as: integritas (wholeness), consonantia (harmony and proportion), and claritas (a radiance and clarity that makes the form of a thing apparent to the mind).\nIn the Gothic Architecture of the High and Late Middle Ages, light was considered the most beautiful revelation of God, which was heralded in design. Examples are the stained glass of Gothic Cathedrals including Notre-Dame de Paris and Chartres Cathedral.\nSt. Augustine said of beauty \"Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it even to the wicked.\"\nRenaissance.\nClassical philosophy and sculptures of men and women produced according to the Greek philosophers' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in Renaissance Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a \"classical ideal\". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose appearance conforms to these tenets is still called a \"classical beauty\" or said to possess a \"classical beauty\", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty and female beauty in western civilization as seen, for example, in the \"Winged Victory of Samothrace\". During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, Renaissance and Humanist thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as Giorgio Vasari in his \"Lives of Artists\") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of Gothic art lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century. Vasari aligned himself to the classical notion and thought of beauty as defined as arising from proportion and order.\nAge of Reason.\nThe Age of Reason saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher Francis Hutcheson argued that beauty is \"unity in variety and variety in unity\". He wrote that beauty was neither purely subjective nor purely objective\u2014it could be understood not as \"any Quality suppos'd to be in the Object, which should of itself be beautiful, without relation to any Mind which perceives it: For Beauty, like other Names of sensible Ideas, properly denotes the \"Perception\" of some mind; ... however we generally imagine that there is something in the Object just like our Perception.\"\nImmanuel Kant believed that there could be no \"universal criterion of the beautiful\" and that the experience of beauty is subjective, but that an object is judged to be beautiful when it seems to display \"purposiveness\"; that is, when its form is perceived to have the character of a thing designed according to some principle and fitted for a purpose. He distinguished \"free beauty\" from \"merely adherent beauty\", explaining that \"the first presupposes no concept of what the object ought to be; the second does presuppose such a concept and the perfection of the object in accordance therewith.\" By this definition, free beauty is found in seashells and wordless music; adherent beauty in buildings and the human body.\nThe Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the nature of beauty, with John Keats arguing in \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" that:\n Beauty is truth, truth beauty, \u2014that is all\n Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\nWestern 19th and 20th century.\nIn the Romantic period, Edmund Burke postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the sublime. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and Kant, suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.\nThe 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in postmodernism's anti-aesthetics. This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, Friedrich Nietzsche, who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.\nIn the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher Guy Sircello proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept. He rejected the subjectivism of Kant and sought to identify the properties inherent in an object that make it beautiful. He called qualities such as vividness, boldness, and subtlety \"properties of qualitative degree\" (PQDs) and stated that a PQD makes an object beautiful if it is not\u2014and does not create the appearance of\u2014\"a property of deficiency, lack, or defect\"; and if the PQD is strongly present in the object.\nElaine Scarry argues that beauty is related to justice.\nBeauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of experimental aesthetics and neuroesthetics respectively. Psychological theories see beauty as a form of pleasure. Correlational findings support the view that more beautiful objects are also more pleasing. Some studies suggest that higher experienced beauty is associated with activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. This approach of localizing the processing of beauty in one brain region has received criticism within the field.\nPhilosopher and novelist Umberto Eco wrote \"\" (2004) and \"On Ugliness\" (2007). The narrator of his novel \"The Name of the Rose\" follows Aquinas in declaring: \"three things concur in creating beauty: first of all integrity or perfection, and for this reason, we consider ugly all incomplete things; then proper proportion or consonance; and finally clarity and light\", before going on to say \"the sight of the beautiful implies peace\". Mike Phillips has described Umberto Eco's \"On Beauty\" as \"incoherent\" and criticized him for focusing only on Western European history and devoting none of his book to Eastern European, Asian, or African history. Amy Finnerty described Eco's work \"On Ugliness\" favorably.\nChinese philosophy.\nChinese philosophy has traditionally not made a separate discipline of the philosophy of beauty. Confucius identified beauty with goodness, and considered a virtuous personality to be the greatest of beauties: In his philosophy, \"a neighborhood with a \"ren\" man in it is a beautiful neighborhood.\" Confucius's student Zeng Shen expressed a similar idea: \"few men could see the beauty in some one whom they dislike.\" Mencius considered \"complete truthfulness\" to be beauty. Zhu Xi said: \"When one has strenuously implemented goodness until it is filled to completion and has accumulated truth, then the beauty will reside within it and will not depend on externals.\"\nHuman attributes.\nThe word \"beauty\" is often used as a countable noun to describe a beautiful woman.\nThe characterization of a person as \"beautiful\", whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of \"inner beauty\", which includes psychological factors such as personality, intelligence, grace, politeness, charisma, integrity, congruence and elegance, and \"outer beauty\" (i.e. physical attractiveness) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.\nStandards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty.\nA strong indicator of physical beauty is \"averageness\". When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the \"ideal\" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when Francis Galton overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive as compared to any of the individual images. Researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer-generated, mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces. It is argued that it is evolutionarily advantageous that sexual creatures are attracted to mates who possess predominantly common or average features, because it suggests the absence of genetic or acquired defects.\nSince the 1970s there has been increasing evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in infancy, and is probably innate,\nand that the rules by which attractiveness is established are similar across different genders and cultures.\nA feature of beautiful women which has been explored by researchers is a waist\u2013hip ratio of approximately 0.70. As of 2004, physiologists had shown that women with hourglass figures were more fertile than other women because of higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates. In 2008, other commentators have suggested that this preference may not be universal. For instance, in some non-Western cultures in which women have to do work such as finding food, men tend to have preferences for higher waist-hip ratios.\nExposure to the thin ideal in mass media, such as fashion magazines, directly correlates with body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and the development of eating disorders among female viewers. Further, the widening gap between individual body sizes and societal ideals continues to breed anxiety among young girls as they grow, highlighting the dangerous nature of beauty standards in society.\nWestern concept.\nA study using Chinese immigrants and Hispanic, Black and White American citizens found that their ideals of female beauty were not significantly different. Participants in the study rated Asian and Latina women as more attractive than White and Black women, and it was found that Asian and Latina women had more of the attributes that were considered attractive for women. Exposure to Western media did not influence or improve the Asian men's ratings of White women.\nOne study found that East Asian women in the United States are closer to the ideal figure promoted in Western media, and that East Asian women conform to both Western and Eastern influences in the United States. East Asian men were found to be more impacted by Western beauty ideals then East Asian women, in the United States. East Asian men felt as though their bodies were not large enough and therefore deviated from the Western norm. East Asian men and white Western women were found to have the highest levels of body dissatisfaction in the United States. A study of African American and South Asian women found that some had internalized a white beauty ideal that placed light skin and straight hair at the top.\nEurocentric standards for men include tallness, leanness, and muscularity, which have been idolized through American media, such as in Hollywood films and magazine covers.\nIn of the United States, African Americans have historically been subjected to beauty ideals that often do not reflect their own appearance, which can lead to issues of low self-esteem. African-American philosopher Cornel West elaborates that, \"much of black self-hatred and self-contempt has to do with the refusal of many black Americans to love their own black bodies-especially their black noses, hips, lips, and hair.\" According to Patton (2006), the stereotype of African-American women's inferiority (relative to other races of women) maintains a system of oppression based on race and gender that operates to the detriment of women of all races, and also black men. In the 1960s, the black is beautiful cultural movement sought to dispel the notion of a Eurocentric concept of beauty.\nMuch criticism has been directed at models of beauty which depend solely upon Western ideals of beauty, as seen, for example, in the Barbie franchise. Criticisms of Barbie are often centered around concerns that children consider Barbie a role model of beauty and will attempt to emulate her. One of the most common criticisms of Barbie is that she promotes an unrealistic idea of body image for a young woman, leading to a risk that girls who attempt to emulate her will become anorexic.\nAs of 1998, these criticisms of the lack of diversity in such franchises as the Barbie model of beauty in Western culture, had led to a dialogue to create non-exclusive models of Western ideals in body type for young girls who do not match the thinness ideal that Barbie represents. Mattel responded to these criticisms.\nIn East Asian cultures, familial pressures and cultural norms shape beauty ideals. A 2017 experimental study concluded that Asian cultural idealization of \"fragile\" girls was impacting Asian American women's lifestyle, eating, and appearance choices.\nEffects on society.\nResearchers have found that good-looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance. Some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive \"defendants\" are less likely to be convicted\u2014and if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentences\u2014than less attractive ones (although the opposite effect was observed when the alleged crime was swindling, perhaps because jurors perceived the defendant's attractiveness as facilitating the crime). Studies among teens and young adults, such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author Eva Ritvo show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity.\nHow much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary-looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good-looking. In the market for loans, the least attractive people are less likely to get approvals, although they are less likely to default. In the marriage market, women's looks are at a premium, but men's looks do not matter much. The impact of physical attractiveness on earnings varies across races, with the largest beauty wage gap among black women and black men.\nConversely, being very unattractive increases the individual's propensity for criminal activity for a number of crimes ranging from burglary to theft to selling illicit drugs.\nDiscrimination against others based on their appearance is known as lookism.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The traditional mathematical formulation of Brownian motion is that of the Wiener process, which is often called Brownian motion, even in mathematical sources.\nThis motion pattern typically consists of random fluctuations in a particle's position inside a fluid sub-domain, followed by a relocation to another sub-domain. Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume. This pattern describes a fluid at thermal equilibrium, defined by a given temperature. Within such a fluid, there exists no preferential direction of flow (as in transport phenomena). More specifically, the fluid's overall linear and angular momenta remain null over time. The kinetic energies of the molecular Brownian motions, together with those of molecular rotations and vibrations, sum up to the caloric component of a fluid's internal energy (the equipartition theorem).\nThis motion is named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown, who first described the phenomenon in 1827, while looking through a microscope at pollen of the plant \"Clarkia pulchella\" immersed in water. In 1900, the French mathematician Louis Bachelier modeled the stochastic process now called Brownian motion in his doctoral thesis, The Theory of Speculation (Th\u00e9orie de la sp\u00e9culation), prepared under the supervision of Henri Poincar\u00e9. Then, in 1905, theoretical physicist Albert Einstein published a paper in which he modelled the motion of the pollen particles as being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first major scientific contributions.\nThe direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist and was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 \"for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter\".\nThe many-body interactions that yield the Brownian pattern cannot be solved by a model accounting for every involved molecule. Consequently, only probabilistic models applied to molecular populations can be employed to describe it. Two such models of the statistical mechanics, due to Einstein and Smoluchowski, are presented below. Another, pure probabilistic class of models is the class of the stochastic process models. There exist sequences of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes which converge (in the limit) to Brownian motion (see random walk and Donsker's theorem).\nHistory.\nThe Roman philosopher-poet Lucretius' scientific poem \"On the Nature of Things\" (c.\u200960 BC) has a remarkable description of the motion of dust particles in verses 113\u2013140 from Book II. He uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [i.e., spontaneously]. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible.\nAlthough the mingling, tumbling motion of dust particles is caused largely by air currents, the glittering, jiggling motion of small dust particles is caused chiefly by true Brownian dynamics; Lucretius \"perfectly describes and explains the Brownian movement by a wrong example\".\nThe discovery of this phenomenon is credited to the botanist Robert Brown in 1827. Brown was studying plant reproduction when he observed pollen grains of the plant \"Clarkia pulchella\" in water under a microscope. These grains contain minute particles on the order of 1/4000th of an inch in size. He observed these particles executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.\nThe mathematics of much of stochastic analysis including the mathematics of Brownian motion was introduced by Louis Bachelier in 1900 in his PhD thesis \"The theory of speculation\", in which he presented an analysis of the stock and option markets. However this work was largely unknown until the 1950s.\nAlbert Einstein (in one of his 1905 papers) provided an explanation of Brownian motion in terms of atoms and molecules at a time when their existence was still debated. Einstein proved the relation between the probability distribution of a Brownian particle and the diffusion equation. These equations describing Brownian motion were subsequently verified by the experimental work of Jean Baptiste Perrin in 1908, leading to his Nobel prize. Norbert Wiener gave the first complete and rigorous mathematical analysis in 1923, leading to the underlying mathematical concept being called a Wiener process.\nThe instantaneous velocity of the Brownian motion can be defined as \"v\" = \u0394\"x\"/\u0394\"t\", when \u0394\"t\" \u00ab \"\u03c4\", where \u03c4 is the momentum relaxation time. \nIn 2010, the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle (a glass microsphere trapped in air with optical tweezers) was measured successfully. The velocity data verified the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann velocity distribution, and the equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle.\nStatistical mechanics theories.\nEinstein's theory.\nThere are two parts to Einstein's theory: the first part consists in the formulation of a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the mean squared displacement of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities. In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas. In accordance to Avogadro's law, this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as the Avogadro number, and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom, since the latter is obtained by dividing the molar mass of the gas by the Avogadro constant.\nThe first part of Einstein's argument was to determine how far a Brownian particle travels in a given time interval. Classical mechanics is unable to determine this distance because of the enormous number of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo, roughly of the order of 1014 collisions per second.\nHe regarded the increment of particle positions in time formula_1 in a one-dimensional (\"x\") space (with the coordinates chosen so that the origin lies at the initial position of the particle) as a random variable (formula_2) with some probability density function formula_3 (i.e., formula_4 is the probability density for a jump of magnitude formula_2, i.e., the probability density of the particle incrementing its position from formula_6 to formula_7 in the time interval formula_1). Further, assuming conservation of particle number, he expanded the number density formula_9 (number of particles per unit volume around formula_6) at time formula_11 in a Taylor series,\nformula_12\nwhere the second equality is by definition of formula_13. The integral in the first term is equal to one by the definition of probability, and the second and other even terms (i.e. first and other odd moments) vanish because of space symmetry. What is left gives rise to the following relation:\nformula_14\nWhere the coefficient after the Laplacian, the second moment of probability of displacement formula_2, is interpreted as mass diffusivity \"D\":\nformula_16\nThen the density of Brownian particles \u03c1 at point x at time t satisfies the diffusion equation:\nformula_17\nAssuming that \"N\" particles start from the origin at the initial time \"t\" = 0, the diffusion equation has the solution:\nformula_18\nThis expression (which is a normal distribution with the mean formula_19 and variance formula_20 usually called Brownian motion formula_21) allowed Einstein to calculate the moments directly. The first moment is seen to vanish, meaning that the Brownian particle is equally likely to move to the left as it is to move to the right. The second moment is, however, non-vanishing, being given by\nformula_22\nThis equation expresses the mean squared displacement in terms of the time elapsed and the diffusivity. From this expression Einstein argued that the displacement of a Brownian particle is not proportional to the elapsed time, but rather to its square root. His argument is based on a conceptual switch from the \"ensemble\" of Brownian particles to the \"single\" Brownian particle: we can speak of the relative number of particles at a single instant just as well as of the time it takes a Brownian particle to reach a given point.\nThe second part of Einstein's theory relates the diffusion constant to physically measurable quantities, such as the mean squared displacement of a particle in a given time interval. This result enables the experimental determination of the Avogadro number and therefore the size of molecules. Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces. The beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium.\nIn his original treatment, Einstein considered an osmotic pressure experiment, but the same conclusion can be reached in other ways.\nConsider, for instance, particles suspended in a viscous fluid in a gravitational field. Gravity tends to make the particles settle, whereas diffusion acts to homogenize them, driving them into regions of smaller concentration. Under the action of gravity, a particle acquires a downward speed of \"v\" = \"\u03bcmg\", where m is the mass of the particle, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and \u03bc is the particle's mobility in the fluid. George Stokes had shown that the mobility for a spherical particle with radius r is formula_23, where \u03b7 is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, and under the hypothesis of isothermal fluid, the particles are distributed according to the barometric distribution\nformula_24\nwhere \"\u03c1\" \u2212 \"\u03c1\"o is the difference in density of particles separated by a height difference, of formula_25, \"k\"B is the Boltzmann constant (the ratio of the universal gas constant, \"R\", to the Avogadro constant, \"N\"A), and \"T\" is the absolute temperature.\nDynamic equilibrium is established because the more that particles are pulled down by gravity, the greater the tendency for the particles to migrate to regions of lower concentration. The flux is given by Fick's law,\nformula_26\nwhere \"J\" = \"\u03c1v\". Introducing the formula for \u03c1, we find that\nformula_27\nIn a state of dynamical equilibrium, this speed must also be equal to \"v\" = \"\u03bcmg\". Both expressions for v are proportional to \"mg\", reflecting that the derivation is independent of the type of forces considered. Similarly, one can derive an equivalent formula for identical charged particles of charge q in a uniform electric field of magnitude E, where \"mg\" is replaced with the electrostatic force \"qE\". Equating these two expressions yields the Einstein relation for the diffusivity, independent of \"mg\" or \"qE\" or other such forces:\nformula_28\nHere the first equality follows from the first part of Einstein's theory, the third equality follows from the definition of the Boltzmann constant as \"k\"B = \"R\" / \"N\"A, and the fourth equality follows from Stokes's formula for the mobility. By measuring the mean squared displacement over a time interval along with the universal gas constant \"R\", the temperature T, the viscosity \u03b7, and the particle radius r, the Avogadro constant \"N\"A can be determined.\nThe type of dynamical equilibrium proposed by Einstein was not new. It had been pointed out previously by J. J. Thomson in his series of lectures at Yale University in May 1903 that the dynamic equilibrium between the velocity generated by a concentration gradient given by Fick's law and the velocity due to the variation of the partial pressure caused when ions are set in motion \"gives us a method of determining Avogadro's constant which is independent of any hypothesis as to the shape or size of molecules, or of the way in which they act upon each other\".\nAn identical expression to Einstein's formula for the diffusion coefficient was also found by Walther Nernst in 1888 in which he expressed the diffusion coefficient as the ratio of the osmotic pressure to the ratio of the frictional force and the velocity to which it gives rise. The former was equated to the law of van 't Hoff while the latter was given by Stokes's law. He writes formula_29 for the diffusion coefficient k\u2032, where formula_30 is the osmotic pressure and k is the ratio of the frictional force to the molecular viscosity which he assumes is given by Stokes's formula for the viscosity. Introducing the ideal gas law per unit volume for the osmotic pressure, the formula becomes identical to that of Einstein's. The use of Stokes's law in Nernst's case, as well as in Einstein and Smoluchowski, is not strictly applicable since it does not apply to the case where the radius of the sphere is small in comparison with the mean free path.\nConfirming Einstein's formula experimentally proved difficult.\nInitial attempts by Theodor Svedberg in 1906 and 1907 were critiqued by Einstein and by Perrin as not measuring a quantity directly comparable to the formula. Victor Henri in 1908 took cinematographic shots through a microscope and found quantitative disagreement with the formula but again the analysis was uncertain. Einstein's predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaudesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909. The confirmation of Einstein's theory constituted empirical progress for the kinetic theory of heat. In essence, Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of thermal equilibrium. The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory's account of the second law of thermodynamics as being an essentially statistical law.\nSmoluchowski model.\nSmoluchowski's theory of Brownian motion starts from the same premise as that of Einstein and derives the same probability distribution \"\u03c1\"(\"x\", \"t\") for the displacement of a Brownian particle along the x in time t. He therefore gets the same expression for the mean squared displacement: formula_31. However, when he relates it to a particle of mass m moving at a velocity u which is the result of a frictional force governed by Stokes's law, he finds\nformula_32\nwhere \u03bc is the viscosity coefficient, and a is the radius of the particle. Associating the kinetic energy formula_33 with the thermal energy \"RT\"/\"N\", the expression for the mean squared displacement is 64/27 times that found by Einstein. The fraction 27/64 was commented on by Arnold Sommerfeld in his necrology on Smoluchowski: \"The numerical coefficient of Einstein, which differs from Smoluchowski by 27/64 can only be put in doubt.\"\nSmoluchowski attempts to answer the question of why a Brownian particle should be displaced by bombardments of smaller particles when the probabilities for striking it in the forward and rear directions are equal.\nIf the probability of m gains and \"n\" \u2212 \"m\" losses follows a binomial distribution,\nformula_34\nwith equal a priori probabilities of 1/2, the mean total gain is\nformula_35\nIf n is large enough so that Stirling's approximation can be used in the form\nformula_36\nthen the expected total gain will be\nformula_37\nshowing that it increases as the square root of the total population.\nSuppose that a Brownian particle of mass M is surrounded by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be \"mu\"/\"M\". This ratio is of the order of . But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between . Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.\nThese orders of magnitude are not exact because they do not take into consideration the velocity of the Brownian particle, U, which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it. The larger U is, the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a Brownian particle can never increase without limit. Could such a process occur, it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type. And since equipartition of energy applies, the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle, formula_38, will be equal, on the average, to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid particle, formula_33.\nIn 1906, Smoluchowski published a one-dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing Brownian motion. The model assumes collisions with \"M\" \u226b \"m\" where M is the test particle's mass and m the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid. It is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right. It is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of \u0394\"V\". If \"N\"R is the number of collisions from the right and \"N\"L the number of collisions from the left then after N collisions the particle's velocity will have changed by \u0394\"V\"(2\"N\"R \u2212 \"N\"). The multiplicity is then simply given by:\nformula_40\nand the total number of possible states is given by 2\"N\". Therefore, the probability of the particle being hit from the right \"N\"R times is:\nformula_41\nAs a result of its simplicity, Smoluchowski's 1D model can only qualitatively describe Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid, many of the assumptions don't apply. For example, the assumption that on average there are an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible \u0394\"V\"s instead of always just one in a realistic situation.\nLangevin equation.\nThe diffusion equation yields an approximation of the time evolution of the probability density function associated with the position of the particle going under a Brownian movement under the physical definition. The approximation becomes valid on timescales much larger than the timescale of individual atomic collisions, since it does not include a term to describe the acceleration of particles during collision. The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle over all time scales described using the Langevin equation, an equation that involves a random force field representing the effect of the thermal fluctuations of the solvent on the particle. At longer times scales, where acceleration is negligible, individual particle dynamics can be approximated using Brownian dynamics in place of Langevin dynamics.\nAstrophysics: star motion within galaxies.\nIn stellar dynamics, a massive body (star, black hole, etc.) can experience Brownian motion as it responds to gravitational forces from surrounding stars. The rms velocity V of the massive object, of mass M, is related to the rms velocity formula_42 of the background stars by\nformula_43\nwhere formula_44 is the mass of the background stars. The gravitational force from the massive object causes nearby stars to move faster than they otherwise would, increasing both formula_42 and V. The Brownian velocity of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, is predicted from this formula to be less than 1\u00a0km\u00a0s\u22121.\nMathematics.\nIn mathematics, Brownian motion is described by the Wiener process, a continuous-time stochastic process named in honor of Norbert Wiener. It is one of the best known L\u00e9vy processes (c\u00e0dl\u00e0g stochastic processes with stationary independent increments) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, economics and physics.\nThe Wiener process \"Wt\" is characterized by four facts:\nformula_48 denotes the normal distribution with expected value \u03bc and variance \"\u03c3\"2. The condition that it has independent increments means that if formula_49 then formula_50 and formula_51 are independent random variables. In addition, for some filtration formula_52, formula_53 is formula_52 measurable for all formula_55.\nAn alternative characterisation of the Wiener process is the so-called \"L\u00e9vy characterisation\" that says that the Wiener process is an almost surely continuous martingale with \"W\"0 = 0 and quadratic variation \nA third characterisation is that the Wiener process has a spectral representation as a sine series whose coefficients are independent formula_56 random variables. This representation can be obtained using the Kosambi\u2013Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve theorem.\nThe Wiener process can be constructed as the scaling limit of a random walk, or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as Donsker's theorem. Like the random walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed neighborhood of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. Unlike the random walk, it is scale invariant.\nA d-dimensional Gaussian free field has been described as \"a d-dimensional-time analog of Brownian motion.\"\nStatistics.\nThe Brownian motion can be modeled by a random walk.\nIn the general case, Brownian motion is a Markov process and described by stochastic integral equations.\nL\u00e9vy characterisation.\nThe French mathematician Paul L\u00e9vy proved the following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous R\"n\"-valued stochastic process \"X\" to actually be n-dimensional Brownian motion. Hence, L\u00e9vy's condition can actually be used as an alternative definition of Brownian motion.\nLet \"X\" = (\"X\"1, ..., \"X\"\"n\") be a continuous stochastic process on a probability space (\u03a9, \u03a3, P) taking values in R\"n\". Then the following are equivalent:\nSpectral content.\nThe spectral content of a stochastic process formula_57 can be found from the power spectral density, formally defined as\nformula_58\nwhere formula_59 stands for the expected value. The power spectral density of Brownian motion is found to be\nformula_60\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient of \"Xt\". For naturally occurring signals, the spectral content can be found from the power spectral density of a single realization, with finite available time, i.e.,\nformula_61\nwhich for an individual realization of a Brownian motion trajectory, it is found to have expected value formula_62\nformula_63\nand variance formula_64\nformula_65\nFor sufficiently long realization times, the expected value of the power spectrum of a single trajectory converges to the formally defined power spectral density formula_66, but its coefficient of variation formula_67 tends to formula_68. This implies the distribution of formula_69 is broad even in the infinite time limit.\nRiemannian manifolds.\nBrownian motion is usually considered to take place in Euclidean space. It is natural to consider how such motion generalizes to more complex shapes, such as surfaces or higher dimensional manifolds. The formalization requires the space to possess some form of a derivative, as well as a metric, so that a Laplacian can be defined. Both of these are available on Riemannian manifolds.\nRiemannian manifolds have the property that geodesics can be described in polar coordinates; that is, displacements are always in a radial direction, at some given angle. Uniform random motion is then described by Gaussians along the radial direction, independent of the angle, the same as in Euclidean space.\nThe infinitesimal generator (and hence characteristic operator) of Brownian motion on Euclidean R\"n\" is \u0394, where \u0394 denotes the Laplace operator. Brownian motion on an m-dimensional Riemannian manifold (\"M\", \"g\") can be defined as diffusion on M with the characteristic operator given by \u0394LB, half the Laplace\u2013Beltrami operator \u0394LB.\nOne of the topics of study is a characterization of the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence time for such systems.\nNarrow escape.\nThe narrow escape problem is a ubiquitous problem in biology, biophysics and cellular biology which has the following formulation: a Brownian particle (ion, molecule, or protein) is confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape. The narrow escape problem is that of calculating the mean escape time. This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a singular perturbation problem.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.7 million within city limits, its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.7 million people, making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan. It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.\nAccording to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast. In the Middle Ages, Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the composite monarchy of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and its main economic and administrative centre, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1516. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. Experiencing industrialization and several workers movements during the 19th and early 20th century, it became the capital of autonomous Catalonia in 1931 and it was the epicenter of the revolution experienced by Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia.\nBarcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed and Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here.\nBarcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe, as well as the main biotech hub in Spain. As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).\nBarcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port, an international airport, Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport, which handles over 50-million passengers per year, an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.\nNames.\nThe name \"Barcelona\" comes from the ancient Iberian \"Ba\u0155keno\", attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as , in Ancient Greek sources as , \"Barkin\u1e53n\"; and in Latin as \"Barcino\", \"Barcilonum\" and \"Barcenona\".\nOther sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC, but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, \"Barcino\", was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar. During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as \"Barchinona\", \"Bar\u00e7alona\", \"Barchelonaa\", and \"Barchenona\".\nAn abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is \"Barna\". \"Bar\u00e7a\" is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport.\nThe city is referred to as the \"Ciutat Comtal\" in Catalan and \"Ciudad Condal\" in Spanish (i.e., \"Comital City\" or \"City of Counts\"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.\nHistory.\nLegendary founding.\nThe origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC. In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules.\nPunic Barcelona.\nAccording to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast. In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city \"Barcino\" after his family in the 3rd century BC, but this theory has been questioned. Iberia and Barcelona was controlled by the Carthaginian Empire and was an important location for trade due to its proximity to Punic Ibiza. Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montju\u00efc with the name B\u00e1rkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language. Thus, some has argued that the Laietani, an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3\u20132 BC after the Punic withdrawal from Iberia, called the area B\u00e0rkeno, which means \"The Place of the Plains\" (Barrke = plains/terrace).\nRoman Barcelona.\nIn about 15\u00a0BC, the Romans redrew the town as a \"castrum\" (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years.\nUnder the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of \"Faventia\", or, in full, \"Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino\" or \"Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino\". Pomponius Mela mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour \"Tarraco\" (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour. It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens. The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive.\nImportant Roman vestiges are displayed in Pla\u00e7a del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the \"Barri G\u00f2tic\" (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral. The cathedral, Catedral Bas\u00edlica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called \"La Seu\", which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan. It is said to have been founded in 343.\nMedieval Barcelona.\nThe city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (\"Marca Hispanica\"), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.\nThe Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor. The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved. In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century.\nBarcelona also had a substantial Jewish community at the time, then the largest Jewish community in the Crown of Aragon. Called \"https://,\" for the many small streets that defined the area, it later became enclosed. Montju\u00efc or Montjuich, in medieval Latin and Catalan, meaning \"Jewish Mountain\" and the birthplace of the city, is the site of a medieval Jewish cemetery, Jews continued to live in Barcelona until the Massacre of 1391 diminished their numbers. The Spanish Inquisition forced the remaining Jews who refused to convert to Christianity to be burned at the stake, or sell their property and leave.\nBarcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia. It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.\nThe Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).\nBarcelona under the Spanish monarchy.\nIn the beginning of the early modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports. In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century. In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault. In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante. A fortress was built at Montju\u00efc that overlooked the harbour. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve.\nDuring the 19th century, Catalan business interests, many of them based in Barcelona, became increasingly involved in the Atlantic slave trade, taking advantage of the void left by the British abolition of the trade in 1807. Catalan immigrants in Spanish America also became heavily involved in owning and running slave plantations in Cuba and Puerto Rico. Between 1817 and 1867, Catalans were involved in the transportation of 700,000 slaves from West Africa to the Caribbean, which \"financed much of the industrialisation of Catalonia and the 19th-century building boom in Barcelona.\" Although the Spanish government had abolished slave trading in 1817, it turned a blind eye to illicit slave trading. When slavery was abolished in the Spanish Empire in 1886, many Catalans returned to Barcelona and invested their newfound fortunes in constructing opulent mansions in areas such as La Rambla.\nTransforming the city.\nIn the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons Cerd\u00e0 proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. Cerd\u00e0 thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic.\nUrban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for Cerd\u00e0's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerd\u00e0's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build \"the biggest, tallest, most attractive house\" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, Cerd\u00e0's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.\nThe Spanish Civil War and the Franco period.\nShortly after the establishment of the Second Spanish Republic, in 1931, it became the capital of the autonomous region of Catalonia. During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished, and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization.\nLate twentieth century.\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.\nRecent history.\nThe death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government. Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.\nThe development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (\u221216.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.\nIn 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.\nIn July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024\u20132026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nBarcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Bes\u00f2s river to the north. This plain covers an area of , of which are occupied by the city itself. It is south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.\nTibidabo, high, offers striking views over the city and is topped by the Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (), (es) () and Rovira (). The escarpment of Montju\u00efc (), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montju\u00efc Castle, a fortress built in the 17\u201318th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montju\u00efc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.\nThe city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f2s to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west.\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\"), with mild winters and warm to hot summers, while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") found in inland areas.\nBarcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2\u00a0\u00b0C of difference in temperatures throughout the year. Its average annual temperature is during the day and at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about . In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from during the day, at night and the average sea temperature is . In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from during the day, about at night and the average sea temperature is . Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months \u2013 April and November \u2013 are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds , with an average temperature of during the day and at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around during the day and at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.\nBarcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (\u2265 1\u00a0mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September\u2013November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June\u2013August), with a secondary winter minimum (February\u2013March). Sunshine duration is 2,524\u00a0hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5\u00a0hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10\u00a0hours of sunshine a day) in July.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;As of 2024, Barcelona has a population of 1,686,208, on a land area of . It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000. It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.\nIn 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000, which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.\nLanguages spoken.\nCatalan is the \"own language\" of Catalonia and Barcelona, and therefore its the main language used by the City Council, in schools and it dominates the linguistic landscape. All toponymy of Barcelona, including the stops of the metro system, are exclusively in the Catalan language. Despite this, Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.\nAfter Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Punjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.\nPopulation density.\nBarcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2\u00a0km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.\nIn the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2\u00a0km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montju\u00efc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5\u00a0million inhabitants living on the remaining at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.\nOf the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6\u00a0km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.\nAge structure.\nIn 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.\nMigration.\nIn 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.\nThe most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506). Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.\nThere exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.\nOther significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines. There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.\nReligion.\nIn 2007, most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208\u00a0churches). In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCat\u00f3lica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic. This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians. The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined. In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).\nThe province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion. A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169\u00a0locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain). In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5\u00a0million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim, which makes 5.6% of the total population.\nThe city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city. There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71\u00a0locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21\u00a0Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13\u00a0locations), and Eastern Orthodox.\nEconomy.\nGeneral information.\nThe Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to \u20ac28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177\u00a0billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009. Barcelona city had a very high GDP of \u20ac80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat. Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[ [update]].\nBarcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine \"Monocle\". Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on \"Innovation Cities\u2122 Global Index\". At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.\nBarcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\nBarcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential, by \"FDi Magazine\" in their bi-annual rankings.\nTrade fair and exhibitions.\nIt also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona \u2013 the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is , not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.\nAn important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour.\nThe city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 \"Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona\", the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.\nTourism.\nIn 2023, Barcelona was the 9th most visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after Paris, Madrid, Amsterdam, and Rome, with around 9 million international arrivals. Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world, mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March\u00a02016[ [update]] including 35 five-star hotels, and developed tourist infrastructure.\nDue to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by \"Business Insider\" in 2016.\nWhile tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report, the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7\u00a0million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62\u00a0million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated \u20ac30\u00a0billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.\nA May 2017 article in the British online daily \"The Independent\" included Barcelona among the \"Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most\" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop\", citing Venice as an example. To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb \u20ac30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors. One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success\", he said. \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\". In April 2024 protests against overtourism began in the city, reaching its peak in July 2024. These protests caught further attention again in July 2025, as similar protests took place in Southern Europe and included Palma, and Lisbon, organized by the Southern Europe Network Against Touristification (SET). During the protests some protesters used large water guns to spray water on tourists.\nManufacturing sector.\nIndustry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region, with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production. The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.\nBarcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Art\u00e9s de Arcos, Balandr\u00e1s, Baradat-Esteve, Bisc\u00fater, J. Castro, Cl\u00faa, David, Delf\u00edn, D\u00edaz y Grill\u00f3, Ebro trucks, Edis, Elizalde, Autom\u00f3viles Espa\u00f1a, Eucort, Fenix, F\u00e1brica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, F\u00e1brica Espa\u00f1ola de Autom\u00f3viles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Hurac\u00e1n Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Autom\u00f3viles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Autom\u00f3viles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-Espa\u00f1a, Industrias Salvador, Siata Espa\u00f1ola, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compa\u00f1\u00eda, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Autom\u00f3viles Victoria, Manufacturas Mec\u00e1nicas Aleu.\nToday, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city. The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.\nAs in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services.\nFashion.\nThe traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably \"Gaudi Home\".\nBeginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread &amp; Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought \u20ac100\u00a0m to the city in just three days.\nFrom 2009, \"The Brandery\", an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.\nTechnology.\nSeveral technology companies have offices in Barcelona, most of them in the El Poblenou neighborhood. Examples of technology companies based in Barcelona: Factorial (software company), Glovo, TravelPerk, Wallapop, EDreams.\nTechnology companies not based in Barcelona but having an office in the city include Oracle Corporation, Amazon (company), King (company), Dynatrace, Clarivate, Ocado, Sage Group, Smallpdf, Proton Mail, Hewlett-Packard, Personio, Semrush.\nBarcelona was ranked as the number 1 startup hub in Southern Europe, and as the 33rd best city in the Global Started Ecosystem published by Startupblink.\nThe Barcelona Supercomputing Center is located in Barcelona and hosts the MareNostrum supercomputer.\nGovernment and administrative divisions.\nAs the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the \"Generalitat de Catalunya\"; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelon\u00e8s comarca (district).\nBarcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the \"Carta Municipal\" (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.&lt;ref name=\"ley 1/2006\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level. This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions. It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.\nThe \"Comissi\u00f3 de Govern\" (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors. The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions. The six \"Commissions del Consell Municipal\" (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary. The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the \"Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana\" (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.\nThe executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.\nThe seat of the city council is on the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.\nAfter 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.\nDistricts.\nSince 1987, the city has been divided into 10\u00a0administrative districts (\"districtes\" in Catalan, \"distritos\" in Spanish):\nThe districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.\nEducation.\nBarcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University. Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.\nThe city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as \"escoles concertades\", they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (\"escoles privades\").\nThe language of instruction at public schools and \"escoles concertades\" is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or \"escola concertada\" in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or \"escola concertada\" offer International Baccalaureate programmes.\nCulture.\nBarcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network. It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.\nEntertainment and performing arts.\nBarcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue. It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the S\u00f3nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention. Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.\nMedia.\n\"El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya\", \"La Vanguardia\" and \"Ara\" are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, \"Ara\" only in Catalan) while \"Sport\" and \"El Mundo Deportivo\" (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as \"Ara\" and \"El Punt Avui\" (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as \"El Pa\u00eds\" (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and \"El Mundo\" (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like \"20 minutos\" and \"Qu\u00e8\" (all bilingual).\nBarcelona's oldest and main online newspaper \"VilaWeb\" is also the oldest one in Europe (with Catalan and English editions).\nSeveral major FM stations include Catalunya R\u00e0dio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, Betev\u00e9, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, in Barcelona's metropolitan area.\nSports.\nBarcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance. FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world. It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona.\nBarcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornell\u00e0-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narc\u00eds Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500.\nBarcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.\nSeveral road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Ingl\u00e9s in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Merc\u00e8, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat God\u00f3, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place. Near Barcelona, in Montmel\u00f3, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.\nSquatter movement.\nBarcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists. Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services. The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.\nTransport.\nAirports.\nBarcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17\u00a0million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend. It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.\nSome low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about to the north, Reus Airport, to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights.\nSeaport.\nThe Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72\u00a0million TEU's in 2013. The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river to the south.\nThe Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base. In 2013, 3.6\u00a0million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.\nThe Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums \u2013 Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.\nNational and international rail.\nBarcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.\nRENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of , was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseille and Toulouse, through Perpignan\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.\nMetro and regional rail.\nBarcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolit\u00e0 (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.\nThe Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.\nIn addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region.\nTram.\nThe city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambes\u00f2s, are operated by TRAMMET. A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.\nFunicular and cable car.\nBarcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montju\u00efc up Montju\u00efc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montju\u00efc Cable Car, which serves Montju\u00efc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebasti\u00e0 over the port.\nBus.\nBuses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as Aerob\u00fas, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\nThe Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.\nTaxi.\nBarcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolit\u00e0 del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.\nOn 22 March 2007, Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station. The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.\nRoads and highways.\nBarcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60.\nThe city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.\nThe city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Gl\u00f2ries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.\nMain sights.\nThe \"Barri G\u00f2tic\" (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan \"modernista\" architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[ [update]], completion is planned for 2026.\nBarcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details\". The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.\nBarcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture, the first (and as of 2015[ [update]], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:\nMuseums.\nBarcelona has many museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Picasso Museum, and Fundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundaci\u00f3 Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum of Barcelona. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.\nThe Museum of Mathematics of Catalonia is a place where mathematics is approached from a practical and playful point of view. The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueolog\u00eda y Ciencias Naturales\" (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the \"Laboratori de Natura\", at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too.\nThe FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.\nParks.\nBarcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest. They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (). The total park surface grows about per year, with a proportion of of park area per inhabitant.\nOf Barcelona's parks, Montju\u00efc is the largest, with 203\u00a0ha located on the mountain of the same name, and includes the Botanical Garden of Barcelona, the Moss\u00e8n Costa i Llobera Gardens, and more. It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); including the zoo), the Guinard\u00f3 Park (), Park G\u00fcell (designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed; ), Oreneta Castle Park (also ), Diagonal Mar Park (, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (), Can Drag\u00f3 Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both ), the Labyrinth Park (), named after the garden maze it contains. There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aig\u00fces (). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona. Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride.\nBeaches.\nBarcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to \"National Geographic\" and \"Discovery Channel\". Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling of coastline. Sant Sebasti\u00e0, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both in length, are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona.\nThe Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Ic\u00e0ria, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nBarcelona is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPartnership and friendship.\nBarcelona also cooperates with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4444", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4444", "title": "Bandy", "text": "Ballgame on ice\nBandy is a winter sport and ball sport played by two teams wearing ice skates on a large ice surface (either indoors or outdoors) while using sticks to direct a ball into the opposing team's goal. It is the predecessor of ice hockey.\nThe playing surface, called a bandy field or bandy rink, is a sheet of ice which measures by , about the size of a football pitch. The field is considerably larger than the ice rinks commonly used for ice hockey.\nThe sport has a common background with association football, ice hockey, shinty, and field hockey. Bandy's origins are debatable, but its first rules were organized and published in England in 1882.\nInternationally, bandy's strongest nations in both men's and women's competitions have long been Sweden and Russia; both countries have established professional men's bandy leagues. In Russia, it is estimated that more than one million people play bandy. The sport also has organized league play and fans in other countries, including Finland, Norway, and Kazakhstan. The premier international bandy competition for men is the Bandy World Championship and for women it is the Women's Bandy World Championship.\nOrganized bandy started in the late 19th century; however, until 1955, there was no established international governing body for the sport. The international governing body for bandy today is the Federation of International Bandy (FIB) which formed in February 1955. In 2001, bandy was recognized as a sport by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Both traditional eleven-a-side bandy and rink bandy (which is played on a smaller rink) are recognized by the IOC. Based on the number of participating athletes, the FIB has claimed bandy is the world's second-most participated winter sport after ice hockey.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe earliest origin of the sport is debated. Though many Russians see their old countrymen as the creators of the sport \u2013 reflected by the unofficial title for bandy, \"Russian hockey\" (\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0439) \u2013 Russia, Sweden, medieval Iceland (it has been compared to knattleikr), the Netherlands, England, and Wales each had pastimes, such as bando, which can be seen as forerunners of bandy. The mid-eighteenth-century \"Devonshire Dialogue\" collection lists Bandy as \"a game, like that of Golf, in which the adverse parties endeavour to beat a ball (generally a knob or gnarl from the trunk of a tree,) opposite ways... the stick with which the game is played is crook'd at the end\".\nThe sport's first published set of organized rules was codified in 1882 by Charles Goodman Tebbutt of the Bury Fen Bandy Club. When the international federation was founded in 1955, it came about after a compromise between Russian and English rules, in which more of the English rules prevailed.\nSince association football was already popular in England, the codified bandy rules took after much of the football rules. Like association football, games are normally two 45 minute halves and there are 11 players per side. Players sticks are curved like large field hockey sticks and the bandy ball is roughly the size of a tennis ball with a cork core and hard plastic coating. Bandy balls were originally usually red but are now either orange or more commonly cerise.\nEarly days.\n19th Century: the sport is formalised.\nBandy as an ice skating sport first developed in Britain. It developed as a winter sport in the Fens of East Anglia. Large expanses of ice would form on the flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters where fen skating, which has been a tradition dating back to at least medieval times, took place. Bandy's early recorded modernization period can be traced back to 1813.\nMembers of the Bury Fen Bandy Club published rules of the game in 1882, and introduced it into other European countries. A variety of stick and ball games involving ice skating were introduced to North America by the 1800s but failed to organize and develop popular rules codes. However, these stick and ball games became one of the eventual antecedents of the modern sport of ice hockey, whose first rules were codified in Canada in 1875, almost a decade before the rules of modern bandy were established in Britain.\nThe first international bandy match took place in 1891 between Bury Fen and the Haarlemsche Hockey &amp; Bandy Club from the Netherlands (a club which after a couple of club fusions now is named HC Bloemendaal). The same year, the National Bandy Association was established as a governing body for the sport in England. National governing federations for bandy were also founded in the 1890s in the Netherlands and Russia and in the following decade in Finland (then part of the Russian Empire), Sweden, and Norway.\nThe match later dubbed \"the original bandy match\", was actually held in 1875 at The Crystal Palace in London. However, at the time, the game was called \"hockey on the ice\", probably as it was considered an ice variant of field hockey.\nAn early maker of bandy sticks was the firm of Gray's, Cambridge. One such stick, now in the collections of the Museum of Cambridge, has a length of rope twisted round the handle to rescue any player who might fall through the ice, as the game was played on frozen lakes back then. An 1899 photo of two players demonstrating the game shows the sticks being held single-handed.\nHistorically, bandy was a popular sport in some central and western European countries until the First World War, and from 1901 to 1926 it was played in the Scandinavian Nordic Games, the first international multi-sport event focused on winter sports.\nFirst national bandy league.\nThe first national bandy league in modern history was started in Sweden in 1902.\nBandy in the Nordic Games.\nBandy was played at the Nordic Games in both Stockholm and Kristiania (present day Oslo) in 1901, 1903, 1905, 1909, 1913, 1917, 1922 and 1926, and between Swedish, Finnish and Russian teams at similar games in Helsinki in 1907. Bandy appeared as a sport in all eight editions of the Nordic Games from 1901 to 1926.\nBandy at the Winter Spartakiad.\nThe Spartakiad was an international multisport event arranged by workers' sports clubs and sponsored by the Soviet Union. In the first Winter Spartakiad, held in Oslo, Norway, in 1928, bandy was played by teams from Norway, the Soviet Union and Sweden.\nEtymology.\nThe sport's English name comes from the verb \"to bandy\", from the Middle French (\"to strike back and forth\"), and originally referred to a seventeenth-century Irish game similar to field hockey. The curved stick was also called a \"bandy\". The etymological connection to the similarly named Welsh hockey game of bando is not clear.\nAn old name for bandy is \"hockey on the ice\"; in the first rule books from England at the turn of the century 1900, the sport is literally called \"bandy or hockey on the ice\". Since the early 20th century, the term bandy is usually preferred to prevent confusion with ice hockey.\nThe sport is known as bandy in many languages, with a few exceptions. In Russia, bandy is called \"Russian hockey\" () or more frequently, and officially, \"hockey with a ball\" () while ice hockey is called \"hockey with a puck\" () or more frequently just \"hockey\". If the context makes it clear that bandy is the subject, it as well can be called just \"hockey\". In Belarusian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian it is also called \"hockey with a ball\" (, and respectively). In Slovak \"bandy hockey\" () is the name. In Armenian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongol and Uzbek, bandy is known as \"ball hockey\" (, , , and respectively). In Finnish the two sports are distinguished as \"ice ball\" () and \"ice puck\" (), as well as in Hungarian (), although in Hungarian it is more often called \"bandy\" nowadays. In Estonian and Lithuanian bandy is also called \"ice ball\" (; ). In Mandarin Chinese it is \"bandy ball\" (). In Scottish Gaelic the name is \"ice shinty\" (). In old times shinty or shinney were also sometimes used in English for bandy.\nBecause of its similarities with association football, bandy is also nicknamed \"winter football\" ().\nHistorical relationship with other sports.\nBandy and association football.\nWith association football and \"hockey on ice\" or bandy both being popular sports in parts of Europe around 1900, bandy was highly influenced by football and taking after its main rules: having a field approximately the same size, having the same number of players on each team and having the same game time (2\u00d745 minutes). It is natural that bandy got the nickname 'winter football'.\nIt was common for sports clubs to have both a bandy and a football section, with athletes playing both sports but at different times of the year. Some examples are \"Nottingham Forest Football and Bandy Club\" in England (today known just as Nottingham Forest F.C.) and Norwegian Str\u00f8msgodset IF and Mj\u00f8ndalen IF, with both having an active bandy section.\nIn Sweden, most football clubs that were active during the first half of the 20th century also played bandy. Swedish player Orvar Bergmark earned silver medals in the world championships of both sports in the 1950s. Later, as the season for each sport increased in time, it was not as easy for the players to engage in both sports, so some clubs came to concentrate on one or the other. Many old clubs still have both sports on their program. Sten-Ove Ramberg is the last Swedish male player in both national teams (1978 in bandy, 1979\u20131984 in football).\nBandy and ice hockey.\nNo clear distinction between bandy and ice hockey was made before the 1920s. As bandy in a way can be seen as a precursor to ice hockey, bandy has influenced the development and history of ice hockey, mainly in European and former Soviet countries. While modern ice hockey was created in Canada, a variety of games which bore a closer resemblance to bandy were initially played there after British soldiers introduced the game of bandy in the late 19th century. At the same time as modern ice hockey rules were formalized in British North America (present-day Canada), bandy rules were decided upon in Europe. A cross between English and Russian bandy rules eventually developed with the football-inspired English rules (\"cf\" the passage above about bandy and Association football) becoming dominant, together with the Russian low-border along most of the two sidelines, an addition to the sport which has maintained its presence since the 1950s.\nBefore Canadians introduced ice hockey into Europe in the early 20th century, \"hockey\" was another name for bandy, and still is in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan.\nBoth bandy and ice hockey were played in Europe during the 20th century, especially in Sweden, Finland, and Norway. Ice hockey became more popular than bandy in most of Europe, mostly because it had become an Olympic sport, while bandy had not. Athletes in Europe who had played bandy switched to ice hockey in the 1920s to compete in the Olympics. The smaller ice fields needed for ice hockey also made its rinks easier to maintain, especially in countries with short winters. On the other hand, ice hockey was not played in the Soviet Union until the 1950s, when the USSR wanted to compete internationally. The typical European style of ice hockey, with flowing, less physical play, represents a heritage of bandy.\nModern development.\nWorld Championships and Russian performance.\nSince the 1950s, when the Soviet Union ended its isolation and started to take part in international sports events, there has been a reason to play world championships. The International Bandy Federation was founded in 1955 and the first world championships were played in 1957 with the Soviet Union and then Russia (as its successor country in 1993) almost consistently in a top position in the sport of bandy alongside Sweden. Finland has won once, in 2004.\nIn a similar fashion, Russia, along with Sweden, has emerged as one of the two dominant women's bandy nations internationally in the Women's Bandy World Championship.\nWomen's bandy.\nWomen's bandy uses the exact same rules as men, but the women's game is played separately. Women have been playing bandy since the sport was originally developed. Although there were several attempts in the early part of the 19th century to organize bandy leagues for women's teams, regular leagues only started in the 1970s in Sweden and Finland and then later in the 1980s in Norway and the Soviet Union.\nHighest altitude.\nThe highest altitude where bandy has been played is in Khorugh, the capital of the Tajik autonomous province of Gorno-Badakhshan. Khorugh is situated above sea level in the Pamir Mountains.\nBandy moving indoors.\nStarting in the 1980s and increasingly since the turn of the millennium, more and more indoor arenas for bandy have been built (often as joint arenas to be used also for football or speed skating). The use of indoor arenas makes the effects of the weather on a game virtually insignificant, something which earlier always have been a factor to consider for the teams and the audiences. However, unlike some other sports, bandy is still the same game with the same rules indoors or outdoors and no changes are made to the rules depending on whether there's a roof overhead or not. Many games, even in the highest leagues, are still played outdoors. In Sweden there are more indoor arenas than in all other countries combined.\nOverview.\nBandy is played on ice, using a single round bandy ball. Two teams of 11 players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal using bandy sticks, thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. If both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then, with some exceptions, the game is a draw. The game is designed to be played on a rectangular sheet of ice, called a bandy field, which is the same size as a football (soccer) field.\nIn a typical game, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as by dribbling, passing the ball to a teammate, and taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or tackling the opponent who controls the ball. However, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the referee. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football's throw-in.\nIn terms of rules, bandy has several rules that are similar to football. Each team has 11 players, one of whom is a goalkeeper. Goalkeepers use gloves made specifically for their position and wear them on both hands but do not use any type of stick. The offside rule, which in general is similar to the one used in football, is also employed. A goal cannot be scored from a goal throw, but unlike football, a goal can be scored from a stroke-in. All free strokes are \"direct\" and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball. A primary rule is that players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their heads, hands or arms during play. Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner.\nThe rules do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of player specialisations have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories:\nPlayers in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to discern them from the single goalkeeper. These positions are further differentiated by which side of the field the player spends most time in. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in these positions in any combination (for example, there may be three defenders, five midfielders, and two forwards), and the number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders would create a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse would create a slower, more defensive style of play. While players may spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of the players on the pitch is called the team's formation, and defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager(s). Formation in bandy is often comparable to the formation in association football.\nShouldering is allowed in checking situations and body contact therefore does occur, but body checking and fighting are illegal.\nBandy is a swift game. Elite players have a mean skating velocity of over and the skating velocity can in some cases reach .\nRules.\nThere are eighteen rules in official play, designed to apply to all levels of bandy, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, veterans or women are permitted. The rules are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. A game is officiated by a referee, the authority and enforcer of the rules, whose decisions are final. The referee may have one or two assistant referees. A secretary outside of the field often takes care of the match protocol.\nThe Bandy Playing Rules can be found on the official website of the Federation of International Bandy, and are overseen by the Rules and Referee Committee.\nPlayers.\nEach team consists of a maximum of 11 players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. A team of fewer than eight players may not start a game. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, and they are only allowed to do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal.\nThough there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the rules of the game.\nThe positions and formations of the players in bandy are virtually the same as the common association football positions and the same terms are used for the different positions of the players. A team usually consists of defenders, midfielders and forwards. The defenders can play in the form of centre-backs, full-backs and sometimes wing-backs, midfielders playing in the centre, attacking or defensive, and forwards in the form of centre forward, second strikers and sometimes a winger. Sometimes one player is also taking up the role of a libero.\nAny number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. Substitutions can be performed without notifying the referee and can be performed while the ball is in play. However, the substitute must leave the ice before the teammate enters it. A team can bring at the most four substitutes to the game, five if one of these is an extra goalkeeper.\nFormation.\nFormation in bandy describes how the players in a team generally position themselves on the rink and is often comparable to the formation in association football. The team's manager(s) define the team's formation while tactics are usually their prerogative as well.\nBandy is a fluid and fast-moving game, and (with the exception of the goalkeeper) a player's position in a formation defines their role less rigidly than \u2014 for instance \u2014 for a rugby player, nor are there episodes in play where players must expressly line up in formation (as in gridiron football). The bandy games are more similar to association football in this regard. Nevertheless, a player's position in a formation generally defines whether a player has a mostly defensive or attacking role, and whether they tend to play towards one side of the pitch or centrally.\nDuration and tie-breaking measures.\nA standard adult bandy match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play; the referee can, however, make allowance for time lost through significant stoppages as described below. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break. The end of the match is known as full-time.\nThe referee is the official timekeeper for the match and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as \"stoppage time\" or \"injury-time\", and must be reported to the match secretary and the two captains. The referee alone signals the end of the match.\nIf it is very cold or if it is snowing, the match can be broken into thirds of 30 minutes each. At the extremely cold 1999 World Championship some matches were played in four periods of 15 minutes each and with extra long breaks in between. In the World Championships the two halves can be 30 minutes each for the nations in the B division.\nIn league competitions, games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which usually consists of two further 10-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be decided on penalties. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn't settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.\nBall in and out of play.\nUnder the rules, the two basic states of play during a game are \"ball in play\" and \"ball out of play\". From the beginning of each playing period with a stroke-off (a set strike from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of six restart methods depending on how it went out of play:\nIf the time runs out while a team is preparing for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal. Similarly, a goal made via a corner stroke should be allowed, but it must be executed using only one shot in addition to the strike needed to put the ball in play.\nFree-strokes and penalty shots.\nFree-strokes can be awarded to a team if a player of the opposite team breaks any rule, for example, by hitting with the stick against the opponent's stick or skates. Free-strokes can also be awarded upon incorrect execution of corner-strikes, free-strikes, goal-throws, and so on, or the use of incorrect equipment, such as a broken stick.\nRather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue when its continuation will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as \"playing an advantage\". The referee may \"call back\" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised because the referee plays an advantage, the offender may still be sanctioned (see below) for any associated misconduct at the next stoppage of play.\nIf a defender violently attacks an opponent within the penalty area, a penalty shot is awarded. Certain other offences, when carried out within the penalty area, for instance a defender holding or hooking an attacker, or blocking a goal situation with a lifted skate, thrown stick or glove and so on result in a penalty shot. Also, the defenders (with the exception of the goal-keeper) are not allowed to kneel or lie on the ice. The final offences that might mandate a penalty shot are those of hitting or blocking an opponent's stick or touching the ball with the hands, arms, stick or head. A 10-minute penalty or a red card may be issued to the offending player as well.\nWarnings and penalties.\nA yellow card indicates a warning given to an entire team for technical fouls such as errors in the execution of goal-throws or free strokes, or the obstruction of a player without ball. Subsequent technical fouls by the same team result in a five-minute penalty indicated by a white card. A five-minute penalty is traditionally indicated using a white card but today the card is rarely shown, rather an announcement from the match secretary or the referee is used instead. In a similar manner, traditionally a ten-minute penalty is indicated by use of a blue card. A ten-minute penalty can be given for protesting or behaving incorrectly, attacking an opponent violently or stopping the ball incorrectly to get an advantage.\nThe third time a player receives a time penalty, it will be a personal penalty, meaning he or she will miss the remainder of the match. A substitute can enter the field after five or ten minutes, depending on the type of time penalty received. A full game penalty can be received upon using abusive language or directly attacking an opponent and means that the player can neither play nor be substituted for the remainder of the game. A match penalty is indicated through the use of a red card.\nOffside.\nThe offside rule effectively limits the ability to attack players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal-line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line. This rule is in general similar to that of soccer.\nEquipment.\nThe basic equipment players are required to wear includes a pair of bandy skates, a helmet, a mouthguard and, in the case of the goalkeeper, a faceguard.\nThe teams must wear uniforms that make it easy to distinguish the two teams. The goalkeeper wears distinct colours to be singled out from his or her teammates, just as in football. The ice skates, sticks and any tape on the stick must be of another colour than the bandy ball, which is orange or cerise.\nIn addition to the aforementioned items, various pieces of gear are used to protect the knees, elbows, genitals and throat. The pants and gloves may contain padding.\nBandy ball.\nThe core of the ball is made of cork and is surrounded by rubber or rubber-like plastic. Balls should be manufactured in a diameter of (the latter is called a \"Russian ball\"). Originally, bandy balls were red, then later became orange or cerise. According to the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy, any of these are allowed, but all balls used in one game must be of the same colour and type.\nBandy stick.\nThe stick used in bandy is an essential part of the sport. It should be made of an approved material such as wood or a similar material and should not contain any metal or sharp parts which can hurt the surrounding players.\nSticks are crooked and are available in five angles, where 1 has the smallest bend and 5 has the most. Bend 4 is the most common size in professional bandy.\nThe bandy stick should not have similar colours to the ball, such as orange or pink; it should be no longer than , and no wider than .\nBandy field.\nA bandy field is by , a total of , or about the same size as a football pitch and considerably larger than an ice hockey rink, which is by . Along the sidelines a high border (vant, sarg, wand, wall) is placed to prevent the ball from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, to glide upon collisions, and should end away from the corners.\nCentered at each shortline is a wide and high goal cage and in front of the cage is a half-circular penalty area with a radius. A penalty spot is located in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a circle.\nA centre spot with a circle of radius denotes the center of the field. A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot parallel with the shortlines.\nAt each of the corners, a radius quarter-circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, from the shortline.\nThe goal cage used in bandy is wide and high and is the largest one used by any organized winter team sport.\nProtective equipment.\nBandy players require protective equipment, some of which is designed specifically for the sport such as the bandy chinguard. Equipment is similar to that worn in ice hockey but is typically smaller, lighter, and more flexible, and more closely resembles the equipment worn in the modern sport of ringette.\nAll players are required to wear helmets. While some bandy players are required to wear facemasks such as young players, some outfield players only wear a helmet with a bandy chin guard. Goaltenders are the exception and must wear a helmet and facemask at all times.\nInternational.\nInternational games in the early years.\nThe first international games were played by club teams in the 1890s.\nStarting in the first decade of the 20th century, friendlies were played between national teams of some European countries. While games like this did not take place in central and western Europe after the 1910s, the Nordic countries of Estonia, Finland, Norway, and Sweden continued, doing it more regularly during the 1920s and 1930s with annually or semi-annually recurring friendlies between some of them.\nSweden tried to arrange for friendly games against the Soviet Union in the latter half of the 1940s, but it did not come to be until the mid-1950s.\nNordic Games.\nBandy was played as one of the sports at the Nordic Games, international winter sports events held during the first few decades of the 20th century.\nInternational federation.\nThe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale de hockey sur glace, or International Ice Hockey Federation as it is more well known as today, was founded in 1908 and was governing some bandy competitions in its early years, before only concentrating on ice hockey.\nThe Federation of International Bandy (FIB) was formed as \"International Bandy Federation\" in 1955 and has had 33 members at most, each representing a country where bandy is played. Currently, there are 27 members of the federation. The name of the federation was changed to the present one in 2001 after the International Olympic Committee approved it as a so-called \"recognized sport\". The abbreviation \"IBF\" was at the time already used by another recognized sports federation, and IOC considers it important that the official abbreviations of sports federations are unique, so that the federations are not mistaken for one another.\nIn 2004, FIB was fully accepted by IOC. FIB is now a member of Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations.\nWorld Championships.\nMen.\nThe Bandy World Championship for men is arranged by the FIB and was first held in 1957. It was held every two years starting in 1961, and every year since 2003.\nCurrently, the record number of countries participating in the World Championships is twenty (2019). Since the number of countries playing bandy is not large, every country which can set up a team is welcome to take part in the World Championship. The quality of the teams varies; however, with only six nations, Sweden, the Soviet Union, Russia, Finland, Norway, and Kazakhstan, having won medals (allowing for the fact that Russia's team took over from the Soviet Union in 1993). Finland won the 2004 world championship in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden, while all other championships have been won by Sweden, the Soviet Union and Russia.\nThe Soviet Union won all championships until 1981, when Sweden managed to break the streak of eleven straight gold medals. Sweden won again in the next tournament in 1983, but Soviet again seized the victory in 1985. The Soviet Union also won at its last two appearances, and then Sweden won in 1993, 1995 and 1997. Russia, having taken over after the Soviet Union, and Sweden have kept on winning all championships between them except for 2004, when Finland managed to claim the win.\nIn 2020, the B division of the World Championship was played, but the A division \u2013 which was to be played about a month later \u2013 was first postponed a couple of times due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and later moved to the next year as the pandemic did not end. The championship tournament could however not be played in 2021 either. In 2022, the championship was finally to be held, but since it was scheduled to be played in Russia, many national federations said they did not want to participate because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and it was cancelled by the FIB since this meant there would have been too few competing teams.\nWomen.\nThe first World Championship for women took place in February 2004 in Lappeenranta, Finland. Sweden won the championship without conceding a goal. In the 2014 women's World Championship Russia won for the first time, defeating Sweden, making it the first time Sweden did not win the world title. In 2016 Sweden took the title back.\nThe 2018 women's tournament was played in a country situated completely in Asia for the first time, when it was hosted in Chengde, China. It was the same for the men's tournament that same year (the area north and west of the Ural River is located in Europe, thus Kazakhstan, which had hosted a world championship before, is a transcontinental country), when Harbin hosted the 2018 Division B tournament.\nThe 2020 championship saw China withdraw its participation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the tournament was held in Norway in February and the pandemic had not yet reached Europe. In 2022 when the championship was played in Sweden, China did not yet return, while Russia and Ukraine both withdrew because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nYouth.\nThere are also Youth Bandy World Championships in different age groups for boys and young men and in one age group for girls. The oldest group is the under 23 championship, Bandy World Championship Y-23.\nOlympic Movement.\nDuring most of the 20th century, a host nation for Olympic Games had the right to arrange demonstration games for almost any sport of its own choosing. In 1952, the Winter Olympic Games were arranged in Oslo, Norway, and the Norwegians presented bandy as a demonstration sport. The tournament of bandy at the 1952 Winter Olympics was played by three countries, Norway, Finland and Sweden. This is the only time bandy has been played at Olympic Games.\nBandy was officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) under the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations (ARISF) in 2004, and was played as a demonstration sport at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. However, it has yet to officially be played at the Olympics.\nAccording to the FIB, bandy is the world's second-most participated winter sport after ice hockey based on the number of participating athletes. It is unclear how many of the players participate in the male category and how many in the female category. The FIB has also recorded bandy (men's) as having ranked as the number two winter sport in terms of tickets sold per day of competitions at the sport's world championship.\nHowever, compared with the seven Winter Olympic sports, bandy's popularity among other winter sports across the globe is considered by the International Olympic Committee to have a, \"gap between popularity and participation and global audiences\", which is a roadblock to future Olympic inclusion.\nIn addition, the Olympic Charter requires a sport to be widely practiced by men in at least 75 countries and on four continents, and by women in no fewer than 40 countries and on three continents in order to be accepted.\nFIB president Boris Skrynnik lobbied for bandy to be included in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, given Russia's prominence in the sport. Members of the Chinese Olympic Committee were present at the 2017 world championships to meet with Skrynnik about the possibility of considering the sport for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, in 2018 it was announced no new sports would be added for 2022.\nAsian Winter Games.\nAt the 2011 Asian Winter Games, open to members of the Olympic Council of Asia, men's bandy was included for the first time. Three teams contested the inaugural competition, and Kazakhstan won the gold medal. The President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, attended the final.\nThere was no bandy competition at the next Games, the 2017 Asian Winter Games held in Japan.\nWinter Universiade/Winter World University Games.\nBandy made its debut at the Winter Universiade during the 2019 Games in Krasonyarsk, Russia. Originally a six-team tournament for men and a four-team tournament for women were planned to be held. However, later China withdrew from the men's tournament and was supposed to be replaced by Belarus. Since that did not happen either, participating teams among women were Russia, Sweden, Norway and the United States, while among men Russia, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Kazakhstan.\nIn 2019, the International University Sports Federation expected bandy to be a part of the 2023 Winter World University Games (Winter World University Games being the new name of the Winter Universiade) too, however, this did not turn out to be so, as the hosts in Lake Placid, USA, did not included it in its schedules and no bandy teams were invited to the games.\nWorld Cup.\nThe World Championships should not be confused with the annual Bandy World Cup competitions. The World Cup is for club teams.\nMen.\nThe Bandy World Cup for men in Ljusdal, Sweden, has been played annually since the 1970s and is the biggest bandy tournament for elite-level club teams. It is played indoors in Sandviken since 2009 because Ljusdal has no indoor arena. It is expected to return to Ljusdal once an indoor arena has been built. World Cup matches are played day and night, and the tournament is played in four days in late October. The teams participating are mostly, and some years exclusively, from Sweden and Russia, which has the two best leagues in the world.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to the Cup being cancelled in 2020 and 2021.\nWomen.\nThere is also a club competition for women's bandy teams called Bandy World Cup Women. Its inaugural year was in 2007.\nEuropean Cup.\nThe European Cup was first played in 1974 and was a competition featuring the national men's champion team from any European country which had a national bandy championship. This meant, at the time, that only four teams competed every year, which were the men's champions from Finland, Norway, the Soviet Union, and Sweden. After the Soviet Union had been dissolved in 1991, the Russian champions took part instead. The cup is not formally defunct, but the last installment was played in 2009.\n4 Nations Tournament.\nThe Federation of International Bandy usually arranges a four nations tournament every year between national teams from Norway, Finland, Russia and Sweden. The 2022 tournament was originally set for 21\u201323 January, but was cancelled after the Swedish Bandy Association announced they would not be hosting it for that season.\nRossiya Tournament (Russian Government Cup).\nDuring the period 1972\u20131990, the Rossiya Tournament was held semi-annually for national teams in the years when there was no world championship. This tournament was always played in the Soviet Union and arranged by the newspaper \"Sovetskaya Rossiya\". It was affectionately called \"the small world championship\". From 1992 the tournament was renamed Russian Government Cup. The last instalment was played in 2012.\nEuropean Bandy Championship.\nThere has likely never been any European Championship played in bandy. Some sources describe a 1913 European Bandy Championships as having been held in February 1913, in Switzerland, at the same time as the bandy tournament at the 1913 Nordic Games. However, this European Championship tournament likely never happened, or is a conflation of titles, since no contemporary sources have been found.\nOverview of international competitions.\nThere are several existing international bandy competitions with events varying based upon age, competitive level, and sex.\nVariants of bandy and sports developed from bandy.\n7-a-side bandy.\nVarieties of bandy exist, utilising the same rules only with slight differences, like seven-a-side bandy with regulation sized goal cages but without corner strokes and often on a smaller sized rink. Seven-a-side bandy was popular in central Europe and in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, while eleven-a-side bandy was preferred in the Nordic countries and in Russia. Seven-a-side bandy rules were applied at the Davos Cup in 2016.\nRink bandy.\nRink bandy is a bandy variant played on an ice hockey-size rink. It was originally conceived as a way of practicing bandy in the summertime, when there were no bandy sized indoor rinks but ice hockey rinks had started to be built indoors. Rink bandy is played by basically the same rules as regular bandy but on a playing surface the size of an ice hockey rink with ice hockey goal cages and six players on each team (or five in the case of the USA Rink Bandy League).\nThere have been international competitions for rink bandy played by the best bandy players in the 1980s and 1990s, both for club teams and for national teams, there were world championships in rink bandy in those days and the Hofors World Cup for clubs was played annually from 1984 to 1998. When more indoor bandy rinks have been built, rink bandy has more become a sport for lower league teams and recreational play.\nRink bandy was played in the 2012 European Company Sports Games program.\nSome member nations of the Federation of International Bandy, which is the international governing body for rink bandy as well as bandy, do not have regulation sized bandy surfaces which are larger than the more common ice hockey ice rink and therefore only play rink bandy at home; this includes most of the World Championships Group B participants.\nShort bandy.\nIn Czechia, the national federation has developed its own version of rink bandy with somewhat different rules, which is meant to help the players transition to playing on a full-sized bandy rink. This is called short bandy. Read more in the section on Czechia below.\nRinkball.\nRink bandy has in turn led to the creation of the sport of rinkball. The sport of rinkball has at times been referred to as a variant of bandy, however it organized by the 1980s and has since become an established organized sport with its own governing body and differs considerably from both bandy and ice hockey, the sport's two major influences.\nFloorball.\nBandy is also the predecessor of floorball, which was invented when people started playing with plastic bandy shaped sticks and lightweight balls when running on the floors of indoor gym halls.\u2063\nLandbandy.\nIn Sweden, informal games played like bandy but on ice-free ground (usually on gravel or asphalt concrete) are called \"landbandy\" (see ). The term should not be confused with \"landhockey\", the Swedish term for field hockey.\nNo roller or parasport variants exist.\nThere is no formal roller sport companion to bandy involving either inline skates or parallel wheel roller skates, even if rink hockey can be considered to have some similarities with bandy. There is also no formally organized skateless ice variant of bandy, and bandy does not have any parasport variant.\nCountries.\nCanada.\nBandy has been played in Canada since the 1980s, but is not nearly as popular as ice hockey in this country. Friendlies are played against the United States. The Canadian bandy federation is called Canada Bandy.\nChina.\nThe China Bandy Federation was set up in 2014. Since them, China has since participated in a number of world championship tournaments, with men's, women's and youth teams. China Bandy is mainly financed by private resources. The development of the sport in China is supported by the Harbin Sport University.\nCzechia.\nA team from Prague in present-day Czechia became Austrian national bandy champions in 1911.\nCzechia has been playing in the World Championship since 2016. As a way of preparing as well as possible for international matches, the Czechs have invented modified rules for games on ice hockey rinks, a variety called short bandy, which differs from rink bandy. The Czech (former rink bandy) national league is now called \"Liga \u010desk\u00e9ho n\u00e1rodn\u00edho bandy\".\nEstonia.\nBandy as an organized sport was played in Estonia in the 1910s to 1930s and the country had a national championship for some years. The national team played friendlies against Finland in the 1920s and 1930s. The sport was played sporadically during the Soviet occupation 1944\u20131991. It has since then become more organized again, partly through exchange with Finnish clubs and enthusiasts. As of 2018, Estonia takes part in both the Bandy World Championship for men, and the Women's Bandy World Championship.\nFinland.\nBandy as an organized sport was introduced to Finland from Russia in the 1890s. Finland has been playing bandy friendlies against Sweden and Estonia since its independence in 1917.\nThe first men's Finnish national championships were held in 1908 and was the first national Finnish championship held in any team sport. National champions have been named every year except for three years in the first half of the 20th century when Finland was at war. The top national league is called Bandyliiga and is semi-professional. The best players turn fully professional by being recruited by clubs in Sweden or Russia. As of the 2020\u201321 season, Bandyliiga consisted of the following teams: Akilles, Botnia-69, HIFK, JPS, Kampparit, Naruker\u00e4, OLS, Veiter\u00e4 and WP 35.\nFinland was an original member of the Federation of International Bandy and is the only country besides Russia/Soviet Union and Sweden to have won a Bandy World Championship, which it did in 2004.\nThe Federation of International Bandy (FIB) is planning for a major premiere for indoor bandy in Finland in 2023 with the venue taking place at an indoor arena in Lappeenranta. When the arena is ready, an international inauguration is to take place with a 4-nation bandy tournament. Participants will include teams from Russia, Sweden, Norway and Finland. The tournament is scheduled for 20\u201322 January 2023.\nGermany.\nBandy was played in Germany in the early 20th century, including by Crown Prince Wilhelm, but the interest died out in favour of ice hockey. The Leipziger Sportclub, which arguably had the best team, was also the last club to give bandy up. The sport was reintroduced to Germany in the 2010s, with the German Bandy Federation being founded in 2013. Germany has been participating in the Bandy World Championship, a competition for male competitors, since 2014.\nIndia.\nBandy is being played in northern parts of India close to the Himalayas, where there is usually cold weather and snow in the winter time. A national championship is contested every year, but India has yet to send a national team to the World Championships or any other international competition.\nKazakhstan.\nBandy has a long history in many parts of Kazakhstan and it used to be one of the most popular sports in Soviet times. However, after independence it suffered a rapid decline in popularity and only remained in Oral (often called by the Russian name, \"Uralsk\"), where the country's only professional club Akzhaiyk is located. They presently compete in the Russian second tier division, the Russian Bandy Supreme League.\nRecently bandy has started to gain popularity again outside of Oral, most notably in Petropavl and Khromtau. Those were for example the three Kazakh cities which had players in the team at the Youth-17, Youth Bandy World Championship for boys in 2016. The capital Astana has hosted national youth championships in rink bandy as well as championships in traditional eleven-a-side bandy.\nIn recent years the former capital Almaty has hosted both the Asian Winter Games (with bandy on the program) as well as the Bandy World Championship for men in which Kazakhstan finished 3rd. Plans are being made to reinvigorate the bandy section of the club Dynamo Almaty, who won the Soviet Championships in 1977 and 1990 as well as the European Cup in 1978. Almaty is also the home of the headquarters of the Asian Bandy Federation. Since bandy began regaining popularity and acceptance, the state has begun supporting bandy. Medeu in Almaty is the only arena with artificial ice. A second arena in Almaty was built for the World Championship 2012, but it was taken down afterwards. Stadion Yunost in Oral was supposed to get artificial ice for the 2017\u201318 season. It got delayed but in 2018 it was officially ready for use.\nMongolia.\nThe national team took a silver medal at the 2011 Asian Winter Games, which led to being chosen as the best Mongolian sport team of 2011. Mongolia was proud to win the bronze medal of the B division at the 2017 Bandy World Championship after which the President of Mongolia, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, held a reception for the team.\nNetherlands.\nBandy as an organized sport was introduced to the Netherlands in the 1890s by Pim Mulier and the sport became popular. However, in the 1920s, the interest turned to ice hockey, but in contrast to other countries in central and western Europe, the sport has been continuously played in the Netherlands and since the 1970s, the country has become a member of FIB and games have been more formalised again. The national team started to compete at the WCS in 1991. However, without a proper venue, only rink bandy is played within the country. The national governing body is the Bandy Bond Nederland.\nNorway.\nBandy as an organized sport was introduced to Norway in the 1910s. The Swedes contributed largely and clubs sprang up around the capital of Kristiania (present day Oslo). Oslo, including neighbouring towns, is in the twenty-first century still the region where bandy enjoys most popularity in Norway.\nIn 1912 the Norwegians played their first National Championship, which was played annually up to 1940. During World War II, when Norway was occupied by Germany, illegal bandy was played in hidden places in forests, on ponds and lakes. In 1943, 1944 and 1945, illegal championships were held. In 1946 legal play resumed and still goes on in form of the Norwegian Bandy Premier League (\"Eliteserien\"). After World War II the number of teams rose, as well as attendance which regularly were in the thousands, but mild winters in the 1970s and 1980s shrunk the league, and in 2003 only five clubs (teams) fought out the 1st division with low attendance numbers and little media coverage. As of 2021 there are 10 teams in the Norwegian Bandy Premier League.\nNorway's best result in the World Championship is a second place in 1965.\nNorwegian Championship.\nThe Norwegian bandy champion is decided each year by a play-off among the best teams in the Norwegian Bandy Premier League. The first Norwegian bandy champions was decided in 1912 and the championship has been held almost every year since. Until 1928, the championship was played as 7-a-side bandy.\nRussia.\nIn Russia bandy is known as hockey with a ball or simply Russian hockey. A similar game became popular among the Russian nobility in the early 1700s, with the imperial court of Peter the Great playing a predecessor of modern bandy on Saint Petersburg's frozen Neva river. Russians initially played this game using ordinary footwear with sticks made out of juniper wood, but it wasn't until later that ice skates were introduced. Bandy did not become popular among the masses throughout the Russian Empire until the second half of the 19th century. The predecessor of the current Russian Bandy Federation was founded in 1898. Bandy is considered a national sport in Russia and is the only discipline to have official support of the Russian Orthodox Church.\nTraditionally the Russians used a longer skate blade than other nations, giving them the advantage of skating faster. However, they would find it more difficult to turn quickly. A bandy skate has a longer blade than an ice hockey skate, and the \"Russian skate\" is even longer.\nThough bandy was still played in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution, they did not partake in any international games for many decades. While agreements had previously been made to play friendlies against Sweden in the late 1940s, these plans had not come to fruition. The bandy event at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Norway, where men's bandy featured as a demonstration sport, was played without any Soviet team. However, the Soviets reconsidered their position following this competition.\nWhen the Federation of International Bandy was formed in 1955, with the Soviet Union as one of its founding members, the Russians largely adopted the international rules of the game developed in England in the 19th century, with one notable exception. The other countries adopted the border which until then had only been used in Russia.\nSince the 1950s, when the Soviet Union ended its isolation and started to take part in international sports events, the Soviet Union and then Russia (as its successor country in 1991) has consistently held a top position in the sport of bandy, both as a founding nation of the International Federation in 1955, and fielding the most successful team in the Bandy World Championship, the premiere international competition for men, (when counting the previous Soviet Union team and Russia together).\nThe men's Russian professional bandy league is called the Russian Bandy Super League. The Russian Bandy Supreme League is the second tier of men's Russian bandy, below the Russian Bandy Super League. In Sweden, the Elitserien (literally, the \"Elite League\") is the highest bandy league in the country for men, while Bandyallsvenskan is the second division. In Finland, the highest bandy league for men is the Bandyliiga.\nIn a similar fashion, Russia, along with Sweden, has emerged as one of the two dominant women's bandy nations internationally, regularly placing first or second at the premier international bandy competition for women, the Women's Bandy World Championship.\nAfter the victory in the 2016 World Championship, the fourth in a row, President Vladimir Putin received four players of the national team, Head Coach and Vice-President of the Russian Bandy Federation Sergey Myaus, the Russian Bandy Federation as well as Federation of International Bandy President Boris Skrynnik in The Kremlin. He talked, among other things, about the need to give more support to Russian bandy. It was the first time a head of state had accepted a meeting to talk about Russian bandy. Attending the meeting were also Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth policy Vitaly Mutko and presidential adviser Igor Levitin. The month after, Igor Levitin held a follow-up meeting.\nRussian Championship.\nThe men's Russian professional bandy league is called the Russian Bandy Super League. The Russian Bandy Supreme League is the second tier of men's Russian bandy, below the Russian Bandy Super League.\nThe Russian Bandy Super League is the top tier of the Russian bandy league system. It is professional and played every year. The winner in the final becomes Russian champion. It is considered a continuation of the Soviet Union championship, which was played annually until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nRussian Cup.\nThe Russian Cup has been played annually most years since 1937, originally called the Soviet Cup.\nSweden.\nBandy as an organized sport was introduced to Sweden in 1895. The Swedish royal family, noblemen and diplomats were among the first players. While the original inspiration mainly came from England, there also were early exchanges with Germany and Russia. Bandy was taken up as one of the sports at the international Nordic Games held in Sweden semi-annually from 1901. Swedish championships for men have been played annually since 1907 and Sweden was the first country to have an annual bandy league.\nIn the 1920s students played the game, then it spread across the country and became a largely middle-class sport. The games could attract huge crowds of spectators in those days. After Slottsbrons IF won the Swedish championship in 1934 it became popular amongst workers in many smaller industrial towns and villages. Where there was a bandy club the local factory corporation also usually sponsored the club to mutual benefit as a successful team led to good PR for the company. Bandy remains the main sport in many of these places.\nIn the mid-20th Century, bandy was the most popular spectator sport in Sweden, drawing huge crowds for most events and having bigger audiences than football or ice hockey. While not having the same numbers now, bandy is increasing the number of spectators in the 2020s, in contrast to many other sports.\nBandy in Sweden is famous for its \"culture\" where both playing bandy and being a spectator requires great fortitude and dedication. A \"bandy briefcase\" is the classic accessory for spectating and is typically made of brown leather, well worn, and contains a warm drink in a thermos and/or a bottle of liquor. Bandy is most often played at outdoor arenas during winter time, so the need for spectators to carry flasks or thermoses of 'warming' liquid like gl\u00f6gg is a natural effect. With the sport moving indoors in recent decades and the arenas urging for non-alcoholic policies for the audiences, this tradition has partly changed, though not without opposition.\nA notable tradition is \"annandagsbandy\", bandy games played on Saint Stephen's Day (\"annandagen\" = \u2019the second day [of Christmas]\u2019), which for many Swedes is an important Christmas season tradition and always draws bigger crowds than usual. Games traditionally begin at 1:15\u00a0pm.\nSwedish Championship.\nIn Sweden, the Elitserien (literally, the \"Elite League\") is the highest bandy league in the country for men, while Bandyallsvenskan is the second division. The Elite League is the top tier of Swedish bandy and is fully professional. At the end of the season, a play-off is made to make out the two teams playing the final match for the Swedish Championship. The Final is played every year on the third Saturday of March. From 1991 to 2012, it was played at Studenternas Idrottsplats in Uppsala, often drawing crowds in excess of 20,000. One reason the play-off match was set in Uppsala is because of IFK Uppsala's success at the beginning of the 20th century. IFK Uppsala won 11 titles in the Swedish Championships between 1907 and 1920, which made them the most successful bandy club in the entire country (now, however, the record is held by V\u00e4ster\u00e5s SK). A contributing factor was also the poor quality of the ice at S\u00f6derstadion, where the finals were held from 1967 to 1989.\nIn 2013 and 2014 the final was played indoors in Friends Arena, the national stadium for football in Solna, Stockholm, with a retractable roof and a capacity of 50,000. The first final at Friends Arena in 2013 drew a record crowd of 38,474 when Hammarby IF Bandy, after ending up in second place in six finals during the 2000s, won their second title. Due to declining attendance from 2015 through 2017 Tele2 Arena in southern Stockholm was chosen as a new venue. However, the new indoor venue failed to attract much more than half of the total capacity. In May 2017 it was announced that the finals will again be held at Studenternas IP in Uppsala from 2018 through at least 2021.\nSvenska Cupen (The Swedish Cup).\nThe \"Svenska Cupen\" (), \"Svenska Cupen i bandy\", takes place exclusively in Sweden. It is a single-elimination tournament competition in Swedish bandy and the second-most prominent bandy competition which is open only to domestic Swedish teams, after the national championship. Its inaugural year was 2005. The first women's competition was played in 2019.\nSwitzerland.\nIn the late nineteenth and early 20th century, Switzerland had become a popular place for winter vacations and people went there from all over Europe. Winter sports like skiing, sledding and bandy was played in Geneva and other towns. Students from Oxford and Cambridge went to Switzerland to play each other \u2013 the predecessor of the recurring Ice Hockey Varsity Match was a bandy match played in St. Moritz in 1885. This popularity for Swiss venues of winter sport may have been a reason, the European Championship was held there in 1913.\nBandy has mainly been played as a recreational sport in Switzerland in the 2000s and 2010s. A Swiss men's national team was finally started up in 2017 and a Swiss women's national team made its international d\u00e9but in the 2018 Women's Bandy World Championship.\nUkraine.\nBandy was played in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. After independence in 1991, it took some years before organized bandy formed again, but Ukrainian champions have been named annually since 2012.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe first recorded games of what may be considered bandy on ice took place in The Fens during the great frost of 1813\u20131814, although it is probable that the game had already been played there in the previous century. Bury Fen Bandy Club from Bluntisham-cum-Earith, near St Ives, was the most successful team, said to have remained unbeaten for a hundred years until the winter of 1890\u20131891. Charles Goodman Tebbutt of the Bury Fen Bandy Club was responsible for the first published rules of bandy in 1882, and also for introducing the game into the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as elsewhere in England where it became popular with cricket, rowing, and hockey clubs. Tebbutt's homemade bandy stick can be seen in the Norris Museum in St Ives.\nThe first Ice Hockey Varsity Matches between Oxford University and Cambridge University were played to bandy rules, even if it was called hockey on the ice at the time.\nIt is sometimes claimed that a national team for England won the European Bandy Championships in 1913, but that tournament likely never took place. While bandy is often thought to have been a popular sport in England in the decades around 1900, few records seem to have been kept.\nA statue of a bandy player, designed by Peter Baker, was erected at the village pond of Earith to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the first documented game in 2013.\nIn March 2004, Norwegian ex-player Edgar Malman invited two big clubs to play a rink bandy exhibition game in Streatham, London. Russian Champions and World Cup Winner Vodnik met Swedish Champions Edsbyns IF in a match that ended 10\u201310. In 2010 England became a Federation of International Bandy member. The national federation is based in Cambridgeshire, the historical heartland.\nThe England Bandy Federation, was set up on 2 January 2017 at a meeting held in the historic old skaters public house, the Lamb and Flag in Welney in Norfolk, England, replacing the Bandy Federation of England which had been founded in 2010 but had had dwindling activity. In September 2017, the federation decided to widen its territory to all of the United Kingdom and changed its name to Great Britain Bandy Association. Great Britain entered a national team in the 2019 World Championships Group B in January and undefeated up to the final, won the silver medal in their final match against Estonia. They were set to return to the 2020 World Championships, but were refused visas to Russia. Since then they have not participated. However, the comeback will come in 2025.\nIn 2022, Great Britain premiered its national women's bandy team at the 2022 Women's Bandy World Championship.\nUnited States.\nBandy in its original, informal manner disappeared from the North American continent entirely once it and elements from the early game had become absorbed into a new sport of ice hockey. While ice hockey was growing and organizing in the United States, bandy was doing the same, but only in Europe and Scandinavia. It would not arrive in its organized format in the United States until the 1970s, almost a century after its initial development.\nBandy has been played in the United States since around the 1970s, after its promotion by Russians, Swedes and Finns in an exchange with softball, a sport which was promoted by Americans during the same time in the Soviet Union, Sweden and Finland. A key-person in the establishment of the sport in America was Bob Kojetin of Minnesota Softball. The sport is centered in Minnesota, with very few teams based elsewhere. The United States national bandy team has participated in the Bandy World Championships since 1985 and is also regularly playing friendly matches against Canada. The leading organization for bandy in the US is USA Bandy. The US has a men's national bandy team and a women's national bandy team.\nThe first bandy game in the US was played in December 1979 at the Lewis Park Bandy Rink in Edina, Minnesota. It was a friendly game between the Swedish junior national team and Swedish club team Brobergs IF.\nUnited States bandy championships have been played annually since the early 1980s, but the sport is not widely covered by American sports media. The championship trophy is called the Gunnar Cup, named after Gunnar Fast, a Swedish army captain who helped introduce bandy to the United States around 1980.\nPlaying surfaces.\nWhile North American ice hockey rinks can be used for playing the bandy variant of rink bandy, places where the traditional game of bandy can be played require a larger sized playing surface, a bandy field, and are almost non-existent in North America. Minnesota is home to the only regulation sized bandy \"rink\" in North America, the Guidant John Rose Minnesota Oval, commonly referred to as, \"The Oval\", and is also the largest outdoor refrigerated skating rink in North America. The rink is 10,219 square meters with more than 800 tons of refrigeration and 135\u00a0km of pipes underneath the ice. The ice can be maintained in temperatures up to +10 degrees Celsius. The Oval can hold up to 300 spectators and has hosted World Cup Speedskating, the 2016 Women's Bandy World Championship, and Aggressive Skating/Biking competitions. The Oval is used mostly for inline hockey during the summer.\nNational bandy federations.\nThe following associations are the governing bodies for bandy in different countries and are member organizations of the Federation of International Bandy.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "4446", "revid": "17779267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4446", "title": "Booker Prize", "text": "British literary award\nThe Booker Prize, formerly the Booker Prize for Fiction (1969\u20132001) and the Man Booker Prize (2002\u20132019), is a literary award conferred each year for the best single work of sustained fiction written in the English language, which was published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. It is regarded as one of the most prestigious literary awards, and the winner receives , as well as international publicity that usually leads to a significant sales boost. When the prize was created, only novels written by Commonwealth, Irish and South African (and later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to receive the prize; in 2014, eligibility was widened to any English-language novel\u2014a change that proved controversial.\nA five-person panel consisting of authors, publishers and journalists, as well as politicians, actors, artists and musicians, is appointed by the Booker Prize Foundation each year to choose the winning book. Gaby Wood has been the chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation since 2015.\nA high-profile literary award in British culture, the Booker Prize is greeted with anticipation and fanfare around the world. Literary critics have noted that it is a mark of distinction for authors to be selected for inclusion in the shortlist or to be nominated for the \"longlist\".\nA sister prize, the International Booker Prize, is awarded for a work of fiction translated into English and published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. Unlike the Booker Prize, short story collections are eligible for the International Booker Prize. The \u00a350,000 prize money is split evenly between the author and translator of the winning book. A third award, the Children's Booker Prize, was launched in 2025, with the inaugural winner to be announced in 2027.\nHistory and administration.\nThe prize was established as the \"Booker Prize for Fiction\" after the company Booker, McConnell Ltd began sponsoring the event in 1969 with the first award ceremony being held on Aprill 22 at Drapers' Hall on Throgmorton Street in the City of London; it became commonly known as the \"Booker Prize\" or the \"Booker\". Jock Campbell, Charles Tyrrell and Tom Maschler were instrumental in establishing the prize.\nWhen administration of the prize was transferred to the Booker Prize Foundation in 2002, the title sponsor became the investment company Man Group, which opted to retain \"Booker\" as part of the official title of the prize. The foundation is an independent registered charity funded by the entire profits of Booker Prize Trading Ltd, of which it is the sole shareholder. The prize money awarded with the Booker Prize was originally \u00a35,000. It doubled in 1978 to \u00a310,000 and was subsequently raised to \u00a350,000 in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the world's richest literary prizes. Each of the shortlisted authors receives \u00a32,500 and a specially bound edition of their book.\nThe original Booker Prize trophy was designed by the artist Jan Pie\u0144kowski and the design was revived for the 2023 prize.\n1969\u20131979.\nThe first winner of the Booker Prize was P. H. Newby in 1969 for his novel \"Something to Answer For\". W. L. Webb, \"The Guardian\"'s Literary Editor, was chair of the inaugural set of judges, which included Rebecca West, Stephen Spender, Frank Kermode and David Farrer.\nIn 1970, the prize's second year, Bernice Rubens became the first woman to win the Booker Prize, for \"The Elected Member\".\nThe rules of the Booker changed in 1971; previously, it had been given retrospectively, to books published in the year prior to each award. In 1971, eligibility was changed to make the year of a novel's publication the same as the year of the award, which was made in November; in effect, this meant that books published in 1970 were not considered for the Booker in either year. Forty years later, the Booker Prize Foundation announced in January 2010 the creation of a special award called the \"Lost Man Booker Prize\", with the winner chosen from a longlist of 22 novels published in 1970. The prize was won by J. G. Farrell for \"Troubles\", though the author had died in 1979.\nIn 1972, winning writer John Berger, known for his Marxist worldview, protested during his acceptance speech against Booker McConnell. He blamed Booker's 130 years of sugar production in the Caribbean for the region's modern poverty. Berger donated half of his \u00a35,000 prize to the British Black Panther movement, because it had a socialist and revolutionary perspective in agreement with his own.\n1980\u20131999.\nIn 1980, Anthony Burgess, writer of \"Earthly Powers\", refused to attend the ceremony unless it was confirmed to him in advance whether he had won. His was one of two books considered likely to win, the other being \"Rites of Passage\" by William Golding. The judges decided only 30 minutes before the ceremony, giving the prize to Golding. Both novels had been seen as favourites to win leading up to the prize, and the dramatic \"literary battle\" between two senior writers made front-page news.\nAlice Munro's \"The Beggar Maid\" was shortlisted in 1980, and remains the only short-story collection to be shortlisted (although another short-story collection, Banu Mushtaq's \"\" later won the International Booker Prize in 2025).\nIn 1981, nominee John Banville wrote a letter to \"The Guardian\" requesting that the prize be given to him so that he could use the money to buy every copy of the longlisted books in Ireland and donate them to libraries, \"thus ensuring that the books not only are bought but also read\u00a0\u2013 surely a unique occurrence\". The prize was eventually won by Salman Rushdie's \"Midnight's Children\".\nJudging for the 1983 award produced a draw between J. M. Coetzee's \"Life &amp; Times of Michael K\" and Salman Rushdie's \"Shame\", leaving chair of judges Fay Weldon to choose between the two. According to Stephen Moss in \"The Guardian\", \"Her arm was bent and she chose Rushdie\", only to change her mind as the result was being phoned through. At the award ceremony, Fay Weldon used her speech to attack the assembled publishers, accusing them of exploiting and undervaluing authors. \"I will ask you if in your dealings with authors you are really being fair, and honourable, and right? Or merely getting away with what you can? If you are not careful, you will kill the goose that lays your golden eggs.\"\nIn 1992, the jury split the prize between Michael Ondaatje's \"The English Patient\" and Barry Unsworth's \"Sacred Hunger\". This prompted the foundation to draw up a rule that made it mandatory for the appointed jury to make the award to just a single author/book.\nThe choice of James Kelman's book \"How Late It Was, How Late\" as 1994 Booker Prize winner proved to be one of the most controversial in the award's history. Rabbi Julia Neuberger, one of the judges, declared it \"a\u00a0disgrace\" and left the event, later deeming the book to be \"crap\"; WHSmith's marketing manager called the award \"an embarrassment to the whole book trade\"; Waterstones in Glasgow sold a mere 13 copies of Kelman's book the following week. In 1994, \"The Guardian\"'s literary editor Richard Gott, citing the lack of objective criteria and the exclusion of American authors, described the prize as \"a\u00a0significant and dangerous iceberg in the sea of British culture that serves as a symbol of its current malaise\".\nIn 1996, A. L. Kennedy served as a judge; in 2001, she called the prize \"a\u00a0pile of crooked nonsense\" with the winner determined by \"who knows who, who's sleeping with who, who's selling drugs to who, who's married to who, whose turn it is\".\nIn 1997, the decision to award Arundhati Roy's \"The God of Small Things\" proved controversial. Carmen Callil, chair of the previous year's Booker judges, called it an \"execrable\" book and said on television that it should not even have been on the shortlist. Booker Prize chairman Martyn Goff said Roy won because nobody objected, following the rejection by the judges of Bernard MacLaverty's shortlisted book due to their dismissal of him as \"a\u00a0wonderful short-story writer and that \"Grace Notes\" was three short stories strung together\".\n2000\u20132019.\nBefore 2001, each year's longlist of nominees was not publicly revealed. From 2001, the longlisted novels started to be published each year, and in 2007 the number of nominees was capped at 12 or 13 each year.\nJohn Sutherland, who was a judge for the 1999 prize, was reported as saying in 2001:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is a well-established London literary community. Rushdie doesn't get shortlisted now because he has attacked that community. That is not a good game plan if you want to win the Booker. Norman Mailer has found the same thing in the US \u2013 you have to \"be a citizen\" if you want to win prizes. The real scandal is that [Martin] Amis has never won the prize. In fact, he has only been shortlisted once and that was for \"Time's Arrow\", which was not one of his strongest books. That really is suspicious. He pissed people off with \"Dead Babies\" and that gets lodged in the culture. There is also the feeling that he has always looked towards America.\nIn 2001, Peter Carey become the first author to win the Booker Prize for a second time. Carey was the first of four writers to have won the Booker Prize twice, the others being J. M. Coetzee, Hilary Mantel, and Margaret Atwood.\nThe Booker Prize created a permanent home for the archives from 1968 to present at Oxford Brookes University Library. The Archive, which encompasses the administrative history of the Prize from 1968 to date, collects together a diverse range of material, including correspondence, publicity material, copies of both the Longlists and the Shortlists, minutes of meetings, photographs and material relating to the awards dinner (letters of invitation, guest lists, seating plans). Embargoes of ten or twenty years apply to certain categories of material; examples include all material relating to the judging process and the Longlist prior to 2002.\nBetween 2005 and 2008, the Booker Prize alternated between writers from Ireland and India. \"Outsider\" John Banville began this trend in 2005 when his novel \"The Sea\" was selected as a surprise winner: Boyd Tonkin, literary editor of \"The Independent\", famously condemned it as \"possibly the most perverse decision in the history of the award\" and rival novelist Tibor Fischer poured scorn on Banville's victory. Kiran Desai of India won in 2006. Anne Enright's 2007 victory came about due to a jury split over Ian McEwan's novel \"On Chesil Beach\". The following year it was India's turn again, with Aravind Adiga narrowly defeating Enright's fellow Irishman Sebastian Barry.\nHistorically, the winner of the Booker Prize was required to be a citizen of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Republic of Ireland, or Zimbabwe. It was announced on 18 September 2013 that future Booker Prize awards would consider authors from anywhere in the world, so long as their work was in English and published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. This change proved controversial in literary circles. Former winner A. S. Byatt and former judge John Mullan said the prize risked diluting its identity, whereas former judge A. L. Kennedy welcomed the change. Following this expansion, the first winner not from the Commonwealth, Ireland, or Zimbabwe was American Paul Beatty in 2016. Another American, George Saunders, won the following year. In 2018, publishers sought to reverse the change, arguing that the inclusion of American writers would lead to homogenisation, reducing diversity and opportunities everywhere, including in America, to learn about \"great books that haven't already been widely heralded\".\nMan Group announced in early 2019 that the year's prize would be the last of eighteen under their sponsorship. A new sponsor, Crankstart\u00a0\u2013 a charitable foundation run by Sir Michael Moritz and his wife, Harriet Heyman\u00a0\u2013 then announced it would sponsor the award for five years, with the option to renew for another five years. The award title was changed to simply \"The Booker Prize\".\nIn 2019, despite having been unequivocally warned against doing so, the foundation's jury \u2013 under the chair Peter Florence \u2013 split the prize, awarding it to two authors, in breach of a rule established in 1993. Florence justified the decision, saying: \"We came down to a discussion with the director of the Booker Prize about the rules. And we were told quite firmly that the rules state that you can only have one winner\u00a0... and as we have managed the jury all the way through on the principle of consensus, our consensus was that it was our decision to flout the rules and divide this year's prize to celebrate two winners.\" The two were British writer Bernardine Evaristo for her novel \"Girl, Woman, Other\" and Canadian writer Margaret Atwood for \"The Testaments\". Evaristo's win marked the first time the Booker had been awarded to a black woman, while Atwood's win, at 79, made her the oldest winner. Atwood had also previously won the prize in 2000.\n2020\u2013present.\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual award ceremony was replaced with a livestream from the Roundhouse in London, without the shortlisted authors in attendance. The winner was Douglas Stuart for his debut novel \"Shuggie Bain\", which had been rejected by more than 30 publishers.\n2021's small-scale ceremony, once again impacted by COVID-19, saw South African writer Damon Galgut, who had been shortlisted in 2003 and 2010, win the prize for \"The Promise\".\n2022 saw a re-imagined winner ceremony at the Roundhouse, hosted by comedian Sophie Duker and featuring a keynote speech by singer Dua Lipa. The prize was won by Sri Lankan author Shehan Karunatilaka for his second novel, \"The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida\".\nIn 2023, for the first time, the shortlist featured three writers named Paul (Paul Lynch, Paul Murray and Paul Harding). The prize was won by Irish writer Paul Lynch for his novel \"Prophet Song\". In the media, reaction was mixed. In \"The Guardian\", Justine Jordan wrote that \"This is a novel written to jolt the reader awake to truths we mostly cannot bear to admit\", while in \"The Daily Telegraph\", Cal Revely-Calder wrote that \"Prophet Song\" is \"political fiction at its laziest\" and \"the weak link in a strong shortlist\".\nThe 2024 prize was won by Samantha Harvey for \"Orbital\", the first book set in space to win the prize and, at 136 pages, the second shortest book to win the Booker after Penelope Fitzgerald's \"Offshore\". Harvey was also the first woman to win the Booker since 2019. Since winning the Booker, \"Orbital\" became a UK bestseller, selling more than 20,000 print copies in the UK in the week following its win, making it the fastest selling winner of the Booker Prize since records began.\nThe 2025 Booker Prize was won by the Hungarian-British writer David Szalay for his novel Flesh.\nJudging.\nThe selection process for the winner of the prize commences with the appointment of a panel of five judges, which changes each year. Gaby Wood, the chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation, chooses the judges in consultation with an advisory committee made up of senior figures from the UK publishing industry. On rare occasions a judge may be selected a second time. Judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics, and public figures.\nUnlike some other literary prizes, each judge is expected to read all of the books that have been submitted. In 2023, the judges read 163 books over seven months. After doing so, they select a longlist of 12 or 13 titles (the \"Booker Dozen\"), before each reading those books for a second time. They then select a shortlist of six titles, and read the six books a third time before selecting a winner.\nThe Booker judging process and the very concept of a \"best book\" being chosen by a small number of literary insiders is controversial for many. \"The Guardian\" introduced the \"Not the Booker Prize\" voted for by readers partly as a reaction to this. Author Amit Chaudhuri wrote: \"The idea that a 'book of the year' can be assessed annually by a bunch of people \u2013 judges who have to read almost a book a day \u2013 is absurd, as is the idea that this is any way of honouring a writer.\"\nThe author Julian Barnes once dismissed the prize as \"posh bingo\" for the apparently arbitrary way winners are selected. On winning the prize in 2011 he joked that he had revised his opinion, telling reporters that he had realised \"the judges are the wisest heads in literary Christendom\".\nFor many years, the winner was announced at a formal, black-tie dinner in London's Guildhall in early October. However, in 2020, with COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in place, the winner ceremony was broadcast in November from the Roundhouse, in partnership with the BBC. The ceremony returned to the Roundhouse for a more casual in-person ceremony in 2022, before moving to Old Billingsgate in London in 2023 and 2024.\nSpecial awards.\nIn 1971, the nature of the prize was changed so that it was awarded to novels published in that year instead of in the previous year; therefore, no novel published in 1970 could win the Booker Prize. This was rectified in 2010 by the awarding of the \"Lost Man Booker Prize\" to J. G. Farrell's \"Troubles\".\nIn 1993, a special Booker of Bookers prize was awarded to mark the prize's 25th anniversary. Three previous judges of the award, Malcolm Bradbury, David Holloway and W. L. Webb, met and chose Salman Rushdie's \"Midnight's Children\", the 1981 winner, as \"the best novel out of all the winners\".\nIn 2006, the Man Booker Prize set up a \"Best of Beryl\" prize, for the author Beryl Bainbridge, who had been nominated five times and yet failed to win once. The prize is said to count as a Booker Prize. The nominees were \"An Awfully Big Adventure\", \"Every Man for Himself\", \"The Bottle Factory Outing\", \"The Dressmaker\" and \"Master Georgie\", which won.\nSimilarly, The Best of the Booker was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the prize's 40th anniversary. A shortlist of six winners was chosen \u2014 Rushdie's \"Midnight's Children\", Coetzee' \"Disgrace\", Carey's \"Oscar and Lucinda\", Gordimer's \"The Conservationist\", Farrell's \"The Siege of Krishnapur\", and Barker's \"The Ghost Road\" \u2014 and the decision was left to a public vote; the winner was again \"Midnight's Children\".\nIn 2018, to celebrate the 50th anniversary, the Golden Man Booker was awarded. One book from each decade was selected by a panel of judges: Naipaul's \"In a Free State\" (the 1971 winner), Lively's \"Moon Tiger\" (1987), Ondaatje's \"The English Patient\" (1992), Mantel's \"Wolf Hall\" (2009) and Saunders's \"Lincoln in the Bardo\" (2017). The winner, by popular vote, was \"The English Patient\".\nNomination.\nSince 2014, each publisher's imprint may submit a number of titles based on their longlisting history (previously they could submit two). Non-longlisted publishers can submit one title, publishers with one or two longlisted books in the previous five years can submit two, publishers with three or four longlisted books are allowed three submissions, and publishers with five or more longlisted books can have four submissions.\nIn addition, previous winners of the prize are automatically considered if they enter new titles. Books may also be called in: publishers can make written representations to the judges to consider titles in addition to those already entered. In the 21st century the average number of books considered by the judges has been approximately 130.\nRelated awards for translated works.\nA separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the Man Booker International Prize, was inaugurated in 2005. Until 2015, it was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. In 2016, the award was significantly reconfigured, and is now given annually to a single book in English translation, with a \u00a350,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator. The award has been known as the International Booker Prize since the Man Group ended its association with the prizes in 2019.\nA Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize, also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the Man Asian Literary Prize, an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.\nFor many years, as part of \"The Times\"'s Literature Festival in Cheltenham, a Booker event was held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debated a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker Prize, and a winner was chosen. Unlike the real Booker Prize (1969 through 2014), writers from outside the Commonwealth were also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was Alan Paton's \"Cry, the Beloved Country\", beating Norman Mailer's \"The Naked and the Dead\", Graham Greene's \"The Heart of the Matter\" and Evelyn Waugh's \"The Loved One\". In 2015, the winner for 1915 was Ford Madox Ford's \"The Good Soldier\", beating \"The Thirty-Nine Steps\" (John Buchan), \"Of Human Bondage\" (W. Somerset Maugham), \"Psmith, Journalist\" (P. G. Wodehouse) and \"The Voyage Out\" (Virginia Woolf).\nIn October 2025, the Booker Foundation announced a new Children's Booker Prize, supported by AKO Foundation, for the best contemporary fiction for children aged 8-12. The inaugural prize would be awarded in 2027 and be awarded annually thereafter.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The first line attributes authorship to \"Joel the son of Pethuel\". It forms part of the Book of the twelve minor prophets or the Nevi'im (\"Prophets\") in the Hebrew Bible, and is a book in its own right in the Christian Old Testament where it has three chapters. In the New Testament, his prophecy of the outpouring of God's Holy Spirit upon all people was notably quoted by Saint Peter in his Pentecost sermon.\nThe Book of Joel's frequent allusions to earlier Hebrew Bible texts and signs of literary development suggest a late origin and its potential to have been a unifying piece within the prophetic canon.\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nThe original text was written in Hebrew.\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895 CE), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this book in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q78 (4QXIIc; 75\u201350 BCE) with extant verses 1:10\u201320, 2:1, 2:8\u201323, and 3:6\u201321; and 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 1:12\u201314, 2:2\u201313, 3:4\u20139, 3:11\u201314, 3:17, 3:19\u20132; Sch\u00f8yen MS 4612/1 (DSS F.117; DSS F.Joel1; 50\u201368 CE) with extant verses 3:1\u20134); and Wadi Murabba'at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75\u2013100 CE) with extant verses 2:20, 2:26\u201327, 2:28\u201332, and 3:1\u201316.\nAncient manuscripts in Koine Greek containing this book are mainly of the Septuagint version, including Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century).\nContent.\nAfter the initial attribution, the book may be broken down into the following sections:\nChapters.\nThe Book of Joel's division into chapters and verses differs widely between editions of the Bible; some editions have three chapters, others four. Translations with four chapters include the Jewish Publication Society's version of the Hebrew Bible (1917), the Jerusalem Bible (1966), New American Bible (Revised Edition, 1970), Complete Jewish Bible (1998), and Tree of Life Version (2015).\nIn the 1611 King James Bible, the Book of Joel consists of three chapters: the second one has 32 verses, and it is equivalent to the union of the chapter 2 (with 27 verses) and chapter 3 (with 5 verses) of other editions of the Bible.\nThe differences of the divisions are as follows:\nDate.\nAs there are no explicit references in the book to datable persons or events, scholars have assigned a wide range of dates to the book. The main positions are:\nEvidence produced for these positions includes allusions in the book to the wider world, similarities with other prophets, and linguistic details. Some commentators, such as John Calvin, attach no great importance to the precise dating.\nHistory of interpretation.\nThe Masoretic Text places Joel between Hosea and Amos (the order inherited by the Tanakh and Old Testament), while the Septuagint order is Hosea\u2013Amos\u2013Micah\u2013Joel\u2013Obadiah\u2013Jonah. The Hebrew text of Joel seems to have suffered little from scribal transmission, but is at a few points supplemented by the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate versions, or by conjectural emendation. While the book purports to describe a plague of locusts, some ancient Jewish opinion saw the locusts as allegorical interpretations of Israel's enemies. This allegorical interpretation was applied to the church by many Church Fathers. Calvin took a literal interpretation of chapter 1, but allegorical view of chapter 2, a position echoed by some modern interpreters. Most modern interpreters, however, see Joel speaking of a literal locust plague given a prophetic or apocalyptic interpretation.\nThe traditional ascription of the whole book to the prophet Joel was challenged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by a theory of a three-stage process of composition: 1:1\u20132:27 were from the hand of Joel, and dealt with a contemporary issue; 2:28\u20133:21/3:1\u20134:21 were ascribed to a continuator with an apocalyptic outlook. Mentions in the first half of the book to the day of the Lord were also ascribed to this continuator. 3:4\u20138/4:4\u20138 could be seen as even later. Details of exact ascriptions differed between scholars.\nThis splitting of the book's composition began to be challenged in the mid-twentieth century, with scholars defending the unity of the book, the plausibility of the prophet combining a contemporary and apocalyptic outlook, and later additions by the prophet. The authenticity of 3:4\u20138 has presented more challenges, although a number of scholars still defend it.\nBiblical quotes and allusions.\nThere are many parallels of language between Joel and other Old Testament prophets. They may represent Joel's literary use of other prophets, or vice versa.\nIn the New Testament, his prophecy of the outpouring of God's Holy Spirit upon all people was notably quoted by Saint Peter in his Pentecost sermon.\nJoel 3:10 / 4:10 is a variation of Isaiah 2:4 and Micah 4:3's prophecy, \"They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks\", instead commanding, \"Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears.\"\nThe table below represents some of the more explicit quotes and allusions between specific passages in Joel and passages from the Old and New Testaments.\nLiturgical usage.\nPlange quasi virgo (\"Lament like a virgin\"), the third responsory for Holy Saturday, is loosely based on verses from the Book of Joel: the title comes from Joel 1:8.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nSee also works on the Minor Prophets as a whole."}
{"id": "4449", "revid": "42601261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4449", "title": "Book of Hosea", "text": "Book of the Hebrew Bible\nThe Book of Hosea () is one of the books of the Twelve Minor Prophets of the \"Nevi'im\" (\"Prophets\") in the Tanakh and a book in the Christian Old Testament, having fourteen chapters in both. According to the traditional order of most Hebrew Bibles, it is the first of the Twelve.\nSet around the fall of the northern Kingdom of Israel, the Book of Hosea denounces the worship of gods other than Yahweh (the God of Israel), metaphorically comparing Israel's abandonment of Yahweh to a woman being unfaithful to her husband. According to the book's narrative, the relationship between Hosea and his unfaithful wife Gomer is comparable to the relationship between Yahweh and his unfaithful people Israel: this text \"for the first time\" describes the latter relationship in terms of a marriage. The eventual reconciliation of Hosea and Gomer is treated as a hopeful metaphor for the eventual reconciliation between Yahweh and Israel.\nSome redaction-critical studies of Hosea since the 1980s have postulated that the theological and literary unity was created by editors, though scholars differ significantly in their interpretations of the redaction process, stages, and the extent of the eighth-century BCE prophet's original contributions. Nevertheless, many scholars agree that the bulk of the book was probably composed around the times of Jeroboam II of Israel (c.\u2009793\u2013753 BCE). Hosea is the source of the phrase \"reap the whirlwind\", which has passed into common usage in English and other languages.\nBackground and content.\nHosea prophesied during a dark and melancholic era of Israel's history: the period of the Northern Kingdom's decline and fall in the 8th century BCE. According to the book, the apostasy of the people was rampant, having turned away from God in order to serve both the calves of Jeroboam and Baal, a Canaanite god.\nThe Book of Hosea recounts that, during Hosea's lifetime, the kings of the Northern Kingdom, their aristocratic supporters, and the priests had led the people away from the Law of God, as given in the Torah. It reports that they forsook the worship of God; they worshiped other gods, especially Baal, the Canaanite storm god. Other sins followed, recounts the book's author, including homicide, perjury, theft, and adultery. Hosea declares that unless the Israelites' repent of these sins, God will allow their nation to be destroyed, and the people will be taken into captivity by Assyria, the greatest nation of the time.\nThe prophecy of Hosea centers on God's unending love towards a sinful Israel. In this text, God's agony is expressed over his betrayal by Israel. Stephen Cook asserts that the prophetic efforts of the book can be summed up in this passage: \"I have been the LORD your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no god but me, and besides me there is no savior\". Hosea's role was to speak these words during a time when they had been essentially forgotten.\nSummary.\nThe Book of Hosea, ascribed in Hosea 1:1 to the prophet Hosea (), contains a number of prophecies and messages from God for both the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel. The prophet's context is predominantly in the Northern Kingdom (i.e., Israel), but there are several references to Judah. The editors of the Catholic Jerusalem Bible comment that there had been a tendency among biblical scholars to treat all the references to Judah as later additions, but argued from the 1960s that \"more sober conclusions are being urged today\". In their opinion, while some references may have been additions, such as Hosea 1:7, 2:1-3, and 14:10, others may indicate that Hosea continued to preach in Judah\u2014the Southern Kingdom\u2014after the fall of Israel.\nA summary of Hosea's story.\nFirst, Hosea was directed by God to marry a promiscuous woman of ill repute, and he did so. Marriage here symbolizes the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. However, Israel has been unfaithful to God by following other gods and breaking the commandments, which are the terms of the covenant; hence, Israel is symbolized by a harlot who violates the obligations of marriage to her husband.\nSecond, Hosea and his wife, Gomer, have a son. God commands that the son be named Jezreel (). This name refers to Jezreel Valley, in which much blood had been shed in Israel's history, especially by the kings of the Northern Kingdom. The naming of this son was to stand as a prophecy against the reigning house of the Northern Kingdom, that they would pay for that bloodshed.\nThird, the couple has a daughter. God commands that she be named Lo-ruhamah (, 'unloved, or 'pitiful') to show Israel that, though God will still pity Judah, God will no longer pity Israel; its destruction is imminent. In the Christian New International Version, the omission of the word \"him\" leads to speculation about whether Lo-ruhamah was Hosea's daughter or one of Gomer's lovers. James Luther Mays, however, argues that the failure to mention Hosea's paternity is \"hardly an implication\" of Gomer's adultery.\nFourth, a son is born to Gomer. It is questionable whether this child was Hosea's, for God commands that his name be Lo-ammi (). The child bore a shame-laden name to show that the Northern Kingdom would also be shamed, for its people would no longer be known as God's people. In other words, the Northern Kingdom had been rejected by God.\nUsage in the New Testament.\nIn the Christian New Testament, cites Hosea's prophecy in Hosea 11:1 that God would call his son out of Egypt as foretelling the flight into Egypt and return to Israel of Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus.\nIn Luke 23:30, Jesus is recorded referencing Hosea 10:8 when he says, \"Then they will begin to say to the mountains, 'cover us', and to the hills, 'fall on us'.\" The reference is also echoed in Revelation 6:16.\nInterpretation and context.\nIn Hosea 2, the woman in the marriage metaphor could be Hosea's wife, Gomer, or it could refer to the nation of Israel, invoking the metaphor of Israel as God's bride. The woman is not portrayed in a positive light. This is reflected throughout the beginning of Hosea 2: \nBiblical scholar Ehud Ben Zvi reminds readers of the socio-historical context in which Hosea was composed. In his article \"Observations on the marital metaphor of YHWH and Israel in its ancient Israelite context: general considerations and particular images in Hosea 1.2\", Ben Zvi describes the role of the Gomer in the marriage metaphor as one of the \"central attributes of the ideological image of a human marriage that was shared by the male authorship and the primary and intended male readership as building blocks for their imagining of the relationship.\"\nTristanne J. Connolly makes a similar observation, stating that the husband-wife motif reflects marriage as it was understood at the time. Connolly also suggests that, in context, the marriage metaphor was necessary in that it truly exemplified the unequal interaction between God and the people of Israel. Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan describes the importance of understanding the covenant in relation to interpreting Hosea. According to Coogan, Hosea falls within a unique genre called \"covenant lawsuit\", where God accuses Israel of breaking their previously made agreement. God's disappointment with Israel is therefore expressed through the broken marriage covenant made between husband and wife.\nBrad E. Kelle refers to \"many scholars\" finding references to cultic sexual practices in the worship of Baal, in Hosea 2, to be evidence of an historical situation in which Israelites were either giving up Yahweh worship for Baal, or engaging in religious syncretism of the deities, Hosea's references to sexual acts being metaphors for Israelite 'apostasy'.\nHosea 13:1\u20133 describes how the Israelites are abandoning Yahweh for the worship of Baal, and accuses them of making or using molten images for idol worship. Chief among these was the image of the bull at the northern shrine of Bethel, which by the time of Hosea was being worshipped as an image of Baal.\nTheological contribution.\nHosea portrays a message of repentance to God's people. Through Hosea's marriage to Gomer, God shows his great love for his people, comparing himself to a husband whose wife has committed adultery, using this image as a metaphor for the covenant between God and Israel. God's love was \"misunderstood\" by his people. Hosea influenced latter prophets such as Jeremiah. He is among the first writing prophets, and Hosea 14, the book's final chapter, has a format similar to wisdom literature.\nLike Amos, Hosea elevated the religion of Israel to the altitude of ethical monotheism, being the first to emphasize the moral side of God's nature. Israel's faithlessness, which resisted all warnings, compelled him to punish the people because of his own holiness. Hosea considers infidelity as the chief sin, of which Israel, the adulterous wife, has been guilty against her loving husband, God. Against this, he sets the unquenchable love of God, who, despite this infidelity, does not cast Israel away forever, but will draw his people to himself again after the judgment.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Obadiah is one of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the final section of Nevi'im, the second main division of the Hebrew Bible. The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses with 440 Hebrew words, making it the shortest book in the Tanakh (The Hebrew Bible), though there are three shorter New Testament epistles in Greek (Philemon with 335 words, 2 John with 245 words, and 3 John with 219 words). The Book of Obadiah is a prophecy concerning the divine judgment of Edom and the restoration of Israel.\nThe majority of scholars date the Book of Obadiah to shortly after the fall of Jerusalem in 587 BC. Other scholars hold that the book was shaped by the conflicts between Yehud and the Edomites in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE and evolved through a process of redaction.\nContent.\nThe Book of Obadiah is based on a prophetic vision concerning the fall of Edom, a mountain-dwelling nation whose founding father was Esau. Obadiah describes an encounter with Yahweh, who addresses Edom's arrogance and charges them for their \"violence against your brother Jacob\".\nThroughout most of the history of Judah, Edom was controlled absolutely from Jerusalem as a vassal state. Obadiah said that the high elevation of their dwelling place in the mountains of Seir had gone to their head, and they had puffed themselves up in pride. \"'Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down,' declares the LORD\".\nIn the Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC), Nebuchadnezzar II sacked Jerusalem, carted away the King of Judah, and installed a puppet ruler. The Edomites helped the Babylonians loot the city. Obadiah, writing this prophecy around 590 BCE, suggests the Edomites should have remembered that blood was thicker than water. \"On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them... You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster.\"\nObadiah said in judgment that Yahweh would wipe out the house of Esau forever, and not even a remnant would remain. The Edomites' land would be possessed by the lands of the south and they would cease to exist as a people. The Day of the Lord was at hand for all nations, and one day, the children of Israel would return victorious from their exile and possess the land of Edom, the fields of Ephraim, the land of Gilead, the lowland of Philistia, and the fields of Samaria.\nScholarly issues.\nDating Obadiah.\nThe date of composition is disputed and is difficult to determine due to the lack of personal information about Obadiah, his family, and his historical milieu: the date must therefore be determined based on the prophecy itself. Edom is to be destroyed due to its lack of defense for its brother nation, Israel, when it was under attack. There are two major historical contexts within which the Edomites could have committed such an act. These are during 853\u2013841 BCE when Jerusalem was invaded by Philistines during the reign of Jehoram of Judah (recorded in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles or 607\u2013586 BCE when Jerusalem was attacked by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, which led to the Babylonian exile of Israel. \nThe earlier period would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet Elijah. The later date would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet Jeremiah. A sixth-century date for Obadiah is a \"near consensus\" position among scholars. contains parallels to . The passage in the Book of Jeremiah dates from the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (604 BCE), and therefore seems to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II (586 BCE). It is more likely that Obadiah and the Book of Jeremiah together were drawing on a common source presently unknown to us rather than Jeremiah drawing on previous writings of Obadiah as his source. There is also much material found in which Jeremiah does not quote, and which, had he had it laid out before him, would have suited his purpose admirably.\nScriptural parallels.\nThe exact expression \"the Day of the Lord\", from , has been used by other authors throughout the Old and New Testaments, as follows:\nNew Testament.\nFor other parallels, compare with .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4451", "revid": "50892790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4451", "title": "Book of Jonah", "text": "Book of the Bible\nThe Book of Jonah is one of the twelve minor prophets of the Nevi'im (\"Prophets\") in the Hebrew Bible, and an individual book in the Old Testament where it has four chapters. The book tells of a Hebrew prophet named Jonah, son of Amittai, who is sent by God to prophesy the destruction of Nineveh, but attempts to escape his divine mission.\nThe story has a long interpretive history and has become well known through popular children's stories. In Judaism, it is the Haftarah portion read during the afternoon of Yom Kippur to instill reflection on God's willingness to forgive those who repent, and it remains a popular story among Christians. The story is also retold in the Quran.\nMainstream Bible scholars generally regard the story of the Book of Jonah as fictional, and often at least partially satirical. Most scholars consider the Book of Jonah to have been composed long after the events it describes due to its use of words and motifs exclusive to postexilic Aramaic sources.\nDate.\nThe prophet Jonah (, ) is mentioned in 2 Kings 14:25, which places Jonah's life during the reign of Jeroboam II, King of Israel, (786\u2013746\u00a0BC), but the book of Jonah itself does not name a king or give any other details that would give the story a firm date. Most scholars consider the Book of Jonah to have been composed long after the events it describes due to its use of words and motifs exclusive to postexilic Aramaic sources. A later date is sometimes proposed, with Katherine Dell arguing for the Hellenistic period (332\u2013167 BC).\nEvangelical Assyriologist Donald Wiseman takes issue with the idea that the story is late (or a parable). Among other arguments he mentions that the \"Legends of Agade\" (see Sargon of Akkad and Rabisu) date to the time of the Old Babylonian Empire, though later versions \"usually taken as a late composition, propagandistic fairy tale or historical romance can now, on the basis of new discoveries of earlier sources, be shown to be based on a serious and reliable historical record\".\nNarrative.\nUnlike the other Minor Prophets, the book of Jonah is almost entirely narrative with the exception of the psalm in the second chapter. The actual prophetic word against Nineveh is given only in passing through the narrative. The story of Jonah has a setting, characters, a plot, and themes; it also relies heavily on such literary devices as irony.\nChapter and verse divisions.\nThe original text was written in Hebrew language. Chapters 1 and 2 are divided differently in the Hebrew and English versions: verse 2:1 in the Hebrew version is equivalent to Jonah 1:17 in the English version.\nOutline.\nAn outline of the book of Jonah:\nSummary.\nJonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which God (\"the LORD\") commands him to go to the city of Nineveh to prophesy against it for their great wickedness against God. However, Jonah instead attempts to run from God by going to Jaffa and sailing to Tarshish. A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, cast lots and discover that Jonah is to blame. Jonah admits this and states that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease. The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail and they are eventually forced to throw Jonah overboard. As a result, the storm calms and the sailors then offer sacrifices to God. Jonah is miraculously saved by being swallowed by a \"great fish\", in whose belly he spends three days and three nights.\nWhile inside the great fish, Jonah prays to God in thanksgiving and commits to paying what he has vowed. Jonah's prayer has been compared with some of the Psalms, and with the Song of Hannah in 1 Samuel 2:1-10.\nGod then commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.\nIn chapter 3, God once again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and to prophesy to its inhabitants. This time he obeys God's command, and goes into the city, crying, \"In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown.\" After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people of Nineveh begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast. The king of Nineveh then puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer, and repentance. God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time. The entire city is humbled and broken, with the people (and even the animals) in sackcloth and ashes.\nIn chapter 4, displeased by the Ninevites' repentance, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities. He then leaves the city on its eastern side, and makes himself a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed. God causes a plant, in Hebrew a , also called a gourd in the King James Version, to grow over Jonah's shelter to give him some shade from the sun. Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant's root and it withers. Jonah, now being exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him. In response, God offers Jonah one final rebuke:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe book ends abruptly at this point.\nInterpretive history.\nEarly Jewish interpretation.\nFragments of the book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, most of which follow the Masoretic Text closely and with Mur XII reproducing a large portion of the text. As for the non-canonical writings, the majority of references to biblical texts were made as appeals to authority. The Book of Jonah appears to have served less purpose in the Qumran community than other texts, as the writings make no references to it.\nLate Jewish interpretation.\nThe 18th century Lithuanian master scholar and kabbalist, Elijah of Vilna, known as the Vilna Gaon, authored a commentary on the biblical Book of Jonah as an allegory of reincarnation.\nEarly Christian interpretation.\nNew Testament.\nThe earliest Christian interpretations of Jonah are found in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. Both Matthew and Luke record a tradition of Jesus' interpretation of the Book of Jonah (notably, Matthew includes two very similar traditions in chapters 12 and 16).\nAs with most Old Testament interpretations found in the New Testament, the interpretation ascribed to Jesus is primarily typological. Jonah becomes a \"type\" for Jesus. Jonah spent three days in the belly of the fish; Jesus will spend three days in the tomb. Here, Jesus plays on the imagery of Sheol found in Jonah's prayer. While Jonah metaphorically declared, \"Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,\" Jesus will literally be in the belly of Sheol. Finally, Jesus compares his generation to the people of Nineveh. Jesus fulfills his role as a type of Jonah, however his generation fails to fulfill its role as a type of Nineveh. Nineveh repented, but Jesus' generation, which has seen and heard one even greater than Jonah, fails to repent. Through his typological interpretation of the Book of Jonah, Jesus has weighed his generation and found it wanting.\nAugustine of Hippo.\nThe debate over the credibility of the miracle of Jonah is not simply a modern one. The credibility of a human being surviving in the belly of a great fish has long been questioned. In c.\u2009409\u00a0AD, Augustine of Hippo wrote to Deogratias concerning the challenge of some to the miracle recorded in the Book of Jonah. He writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The last question proposed is concerning Jonah, and it is put as if it were not from Porphyry, but as being a standing subject of ridicule among the Pagans; for his words are:\n\"In the next place, what are we to believe concerning Jonah, who is said to have been three days in a whale's belly? The thing is utterly improbable and incredible, that a man swallowed with his clothes on should have existed in the inside of a fish. If, however, the story is figurative, be pleased to explain it. Again, what is meant by the story that a gourd sprang up above the head of Jonah after he was vomited by the fish? What was the cause of this gourd's growth?\" Questions such as these I have seen discussed by Pagans amidst loud laughter, and with great scorn.\u2014\u200a\nAugustine responds that if one is to question one miracle, then one should question all miracles as well (section 31). Nevertheless, despite his apologetic, Augustine views the story of Jonah as a figure for Christ. For example, he writes: \"As, therefore, Jonah passed from the ship to the belly of the whale, so Christ passed from the cross to the sepulchre, or into the abyss of death. And as Jonah suffered this for the sake of those who were endangered by the storm, so Christ suffered for the sake of those who are tossed on the waves of this world.\" Augustine credits his allegorical interpretation to the interpretation of Christ himself (Matthew 12:39\u201340), and he allows for other interpretations as long as they are in line with Christ's.\nMedieval commentary tradition.\nThe \"Ordinary Gloss\", or , was the most important Christian commentary on the Bible in the later Middle Ages. Ryan McDermott comments that \"The Gloss on Jonah relies almost exclusively on Jerome's commentary on Jonah (c.\u2009396), so its Latin often has a tone of urbane classicism. But the Gloss also chops up, compresses, and rearranges Jerome with a carnivalesque glee and scholastic directness that renders the Latin authentically medieval.\" \"The Ordinary Gloss on Jonah\" has been translated into English and printed in a format that emulates the first printing of the Gloss.\nThe relationship between Jonah and his fellow Jews is ambivalent, and complicated by the Gloss's tendency to read Jonah as an allegorical prefiguration of Jesus Christ. While some glosses in isolation seem crudely supersessionist (\"The foreskin believes while the circumcision remains unfaithful\"), the prevailing allegorical tendency is to attribute Jonah's recalcitrance to his abiding love for his own people and his insistence that God's promises to Israel not be overridden by a lenient policy toward the Ninevites. For the glossator, Jonah's pro-Israel motivations correspond to Christ's demurral in the Garden of Gethsemane (\"My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me\") and the Gospel of Matthew's and Paul's insistence that \"salvation is from the Jews\" (John 4:22). While in the Gloss the plot of Jonah prefigures how God will extend salvation to the nations, it also makes abundantly clear\u2014as some medieval commentaries on the Gospel of John do not\u2014that Jonah and Jesus are Jews, and that they make decisions of salvation-historical consequence as Jews.\nModern.\nIn Jungian analysis, the belly of the whale can be seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, which is also an important stage in comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell's \"hero's journey\".\nNCSY Director of Education David Bashevkin sees Jonah as a thoughtful prophet who comes to religion out of a search for theological truth and is constantly disappointed by those who come to religion to provide mere comfort in the face of adversity inherent to the human condition. \"If religion is only a blanket to provide warmth from the cold, harsh realities of life,\" Bashevkin imagines Jonah asking, \"did concerns of theological truth and creed even matter?\" The lesson taught by the episode of the tree at the end of the book is that comfort is a deep human need that religion provides, but that this need not obscure the role of God.\nJonah and the \"big fish\".\nThe Hebrew text of Jonah reads (, ), literally meaning \"great fish\". The Septuagint translated this into Greek as (), \"huge whale/sea monster\"; and in Greek mythology the term was closely associated with sea monsters. Saint Jerome later translated the Greek phrase as in his Latin Vulgate, and as in Matthew. At some point, became synonymous with whale (cf. cetyl alcohol, which is alcohol derived from whales). In his 1534 translation, William Tyndale translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as \"greate fyshe\", and he translated the word (Greek) or (Latin) in Matthew as \"whale\". Tyndale's translation was later followed by the translators of the King James Version of 1611 and has enjoyed general acceptance in English translations.\nIn the book of Jonah chapter 1 verse 17, the Hebrew bible refers to the fish as , \"great fish\", in the masculine. However, in chapter 2 verse 1, the word which refers to fish is written as , meaning female fish. The verses therefore read: \"And the lord provided a great fish (, , masculine) for Jonah, and it swallowed him, and Jonah sat in the belly of the fish (still male) for three days and nights; then, from the belly of the (, , female) fish, Jonah began to pray.\"\nJonah and the gourd vine.\nThe Book of Jonah closes abruptly, with an epistolary warning based on the emblematic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized in fables such as \"The Gourd and the Palm-tree\" during the Renaissance, for example by Andrea Alciato.\nSt. Jerome differed from St. Augustine in his Latin translation of the plant known in Hebrew as (), using (from the Greek, meaning \"ivy\") over the more common Latin , \"gourd\", from which the English word \"gourd\" (Old French , ) is derived. The Renaissance humanist artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer memorialized Jerome's decision to use an analogical type of Christ's \"I am the Vine, you are the branches\" in his woodcut \"Saint Jerome in His Study\".\nSurviving ancient manuscripts.\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008).\nFragments of this book in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (cumulatively covering the whole book), including 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 1:1\u20119, 2:3\u201111, 3:1, 3:3, and 4:5\u201111; and Wadi Murabba'at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75\u2013100 CE) with extant verses 1:14\u201116, 2:1\u20117; 3:2\u20115, 3:7\u201110; 4:1\u20112, and 4:5.\nThe oldest known complete version of the book is the Crosby-Sch\u00f8yen Codex, part of the Bodmer Papyri, which dates to the 3rd century, and is written in Coptic.\nThere is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century).\nFragments containing parts of this book in Greek were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q76 (4QXIIa; 150\u2013125 BCE) with extant verses 1:1\u20135, 1:7\u201310, 1:15\u201317 (1:17 = 2:1 in Hebrew Bible), 2:6 (verses 2:1,7 in Masoretic Text), and 3:2; 4Q81 (4QXIIf; 175\u201350 BCE) with extant verses 1:6\u20138, 1:10\u201316; 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 1:1\u20139, 2:2\u201310 (verses 2:3\u201311 in Masoretic Text), 3:1\u20133, and 4:5\u201311; and Wadi Murabba'at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75\u2013100 CE) with extant verses 1:1\u201317 (1:1\u201316, 2:1 in Hebrew Bible), 2:1\u201310 (verses 2:1\u201311 in Masoretic Text), 3:1\u201310, and 4:1\u201311., and Na\u1e25al \u1e24ever (8\u1e24evXIIgr; 1st century CE) with extant verses 2:1\u20136 (verses 2:1\u20137 in Masoretic Text), 3:2\u20135, 3:7\u201310, 4:1\u20132, and 4:5.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4452", "revid": "4796325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4452", "title": "Book of Micah", "text": "Book in the Hebrew Bible\nThe Book of Micah is the sixth of the twelve minor prophets in the Hebrew Bible. The book has seven chapters. Ostensibly, it records the sayings of Micah, whose name is \"Mikayahu\" (), meaning \"Who is like Yahweh?\", an 8th-century BCE prophet from the village of Moresheth in Judah (Hebrew name from the opening verse: \u05de\u05d9\u05db\u05d4 \u05d4\u05de\u05e8\u05e9\u05ea\u05d9).\nThe book has three major divisions, chapters 1\u20132, 3\u20135 and 6\u20137, each introduced by the word \"Hear\", with a pattern of alternating announcements of doom and expressions of hope within each division. Micah reproaches unjust leaders, defends the rights of the poor against the rich and powerful; while looking forward to a world at peace centered on Zion under the leadership of a new Davidic monarch.\nWhile the book is relatively short, it includes lament (1:8\u201316; 7:8\u201310), theophany (1.3\u20134), a hymnic prayer of petition and confidence (7:14\u201320), and the \"covenant lawsuit\" (6:1\u20138), a distinct genre in which Yahweh (God) sues Israel for breach of contract of the Mosaic covenant.\nThe formation of the Book of Micah is debated, with a consensus that its final stage occurred during the Persian period or Hellenistic period, but uncertainty remains about whether it was formed at the time or merely finalized.\nSetting.\nThe opening verse identifies the prophet as \"Micah of Moresheth\" (a town in southern Judah), and states that he lived during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, roughly 750\u2013700\u00a0BCE.\nThis corresponds to the period when, after a long period of peace, Israel, Judah, and the other nations of the region came under increasing pressure from the aggressive and rapidly expanding Neo-Assyrian empire. Between 734 and 727 Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria conducted almost annual campaigns in the Levant, reducing the Kingdom of Israel, the Kingdom of Judah and the Philistine cities to vassalage, receiving tribute from Ammon, Moab and Edom, and absorbing Damascus (the Kingdom of Aram) into the Empire. On Tiglath-Pileser's death Israel rebelled, resulting in an Assyrian counter-attack and the destruction of the capital, Samaria, in 721 after a three-year siege. Micah 1:2\u20137 draws on this event: Samaria, says the prophet, has been destroyed by God because of its crimes of idolatry, oppression of the poor, and misuse of power. The Assyrian attacks on Israel (the northern kingdom) led to an influx of refugees into Judah, which would have increased social stresses, while at the same time the authorities in Jerusalem had to invest huge amounts in tribute and defense.\nWhen the Assyrians attacked Judah in 701 they did so via the Philistine coast and the Shephelah, the border region which included Micah's village of Moresheth, as well as Lachish, Judah's second largest city. This in turn forms the background to verses 1:8\u201316, in which Micah warns the towns of the coming disaster (Lachish is singled out for special mention, accused of the corrupt practices of both Samaria and Jerusalem). In verses 2:1\u20135 he denounces the appropriation of land and houses, which might simply be the greed of the wealthy and powerful, or possibly the result of the militarizing of the area in preparation for the Assyrian attack.\nComposition.\nThe formation of the Book of Micah is a topic of scholarly debate. The 2021 Oxford Handbook of the Minor Prophets summarizes:\n\"There is a consensus that the book has a long history of formation with the Persian (or even Hellenistic) period as its last stage. However, it is contested whether it was formed in these days or only finalized after a longer history of tradition.\"\nSome, but not all, scholars accept that only chapters 1\u20133 contain material from the late 8th-century BCE prophet Micah. According to scholars, the latest material comes from the post-Exilic period after the Temple was rebuilt in 515\u00a0BCE, so that the early 5th century BCE seems to be the period when the book was completed. The first stage was the collection and arrangement of some spoken sayings of the historical Micah (the material in chapters 1\u20133), in which the prophet attacks those who build estates through oppression and depicts the Assyrian invasion of Judah as Yahweh's punishment on the kingdom's corrupt rulers, including a prophecy that the Temple will be destroyed.\nThe prophecy was not fulfilled in Micah's time, but a hundred years later when Judah was facing a similar crisis with the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Micah's prophecies were reworked and expanded to reflect the new situation. Still later, after Jerusalem fell to the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the book was revised and expanded further to reflect the circumstances of the late exilic and post-exilic community.\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nThe oldest surviving manuscripts were made hundreds of years after the period or periods of authorship. The earliest surviving Masoretic Text versions include the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Since 1947, the current text of the Aleppo Codex is missing Micah 1:1 to 5:1.\nFragments containing parts of this book in the original Biblical Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q82 (25 BCE); and Wadi Murabba'at Minor Prophets (75\u2013100 CE).\nThere is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (6th century). The Book of Micah is missing in the extant Codex Sinaiticus. Some fragments containing parts of this book in Greek were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, that is, Na\u1e25al \u1e24ever 8\u1e24ev1 (late 1st century BCE).\nContent.\nStructure.\nAt the broadest level, Micah can be divided into three roughly equal parts:\nJames Limburg sees the word \"Hear\" in Micah 1:2, 3:1 and 6:1 as the marker for three separate sections, noting that Amos 3:1, 4:1, 5:1 and 8:4 mark similar divisions within the Book of Amos, another of the minor prophets.\nWithin this broad three-part structure are a series of alternating oracles of judgment and promises of restoration:\nVerse numbering.\nThere is a difference in verse numbering between English Bibles and Hebrew texts, with Micah 4:14 in Hebrew texts being Micah 5:1 in English Bibles, and the Hebrew 5:1 etc. being numbered 5:2 etc. in English Bibles. This article generally follows the common numbering in Christian English Bible versions.\nThemes.\nMicah addresses the future of Judah/Israel after the Babylonian exile. Like Isaiah, the book has a vision of the punishment of Israel and creation of a \"remnant\", followed by world peace centered on Zion under the leadership of a new Davidic monarch; the people should do justice, turn to Yahweh, and await the end of their punishment. However, whereas Isaiah sees Jacob/Israel joining \"the nations\" under Yahweh's rule, Micah looks forward to Israel ruling over the nations. Insofar as Micah appears to draw on and rework parts of Isaiah, it seems designed at least partly to provide a counterpoint to that book.\nAllusions in the New Testament.\nThere are several allusions to the Book of Micah in the New Testament:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Jud\u00e6a: for thus it is written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A man\u2019s enemies will be those of his own household.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.\nAlthough the wording is different, Jerome comments that \"we should always take note when a passage is cited out of the Old Testament, whether the sense only, or the very words are given\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvellous things.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4453", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4453", "title": "Book of Nahum", "text": "Book of the Bible\nThe Book of Nahum is the seventh book of the 12 minor prophets of the Hebrew Bible. The book has three chapters. It is attributed to the prophet Nahum. The most general historical setting of Nahum as a prophet was 663 BC to 612 BC, while the historical setting that produced the book of Nahum is debated, with proposed timeframes ranging from shortly after the fall of Thebes in 663 BC to the Maccabean period around 175-165 BC. Another view, held by the ancient historian Josephus, proposes that the book of Nahum was from the reign of Jotham. This identification is supported by both the Greek Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, both of which refer to Thebes in the present tense rather than the past tense. Its principal theme is the destruction of the Assyrian city of Nineveh.\nBackground.\nScholars with a preference for Hebrew manuscripts place the writing of the book after the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal's Sack of Thebes in 663 B.C. This view is the current majority opinion because the city of Thebes is referred to in the past tense in the Masoretic Text of Nahum 3:8-10. However, both the Septuagint and Vulgate refer to the city in the present tense, and the former opinion held by scholars was that Nahum lived about a century earlier, before both the captivity of the ten lost tribes and the Sack of Thebes. \nThe first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus places Nahum's life during the reign of Jotham. This view was also held by the Catholic scholar Thomas Worthington in his notes for the original Douay-Rheims Bible, writing: \"Nahum prophesied about 50 years after Jonah ... 135 before the destruction of Niniveh.\" In this view, rather than Ashurbanipal, Nahum's prophecy would have been directed at Tiglath-Pileser III, who revitalized the Neo-Assyrian Empire into a world power again and conquered most of the Levant, defeating and subjugating previously influential kingdoms, including Aram-Damascus. Tiglath-Pileser was contemporary with the reign of Jotham.\nSome scholars hold that \"the book of the vision\" was written at the time of the fall of Nineveh, at the hands of the Medes and Babylonians in 612 BC. possibly around 615 BC, before the downfall of Assyria. For those who do not believe in the validity of prophecy, the oracles must be dated after the Assyrian destruction of Thebes, Egypt in 663\u00a0BC, as this event is mentioned in Nahum 3:8.\nAuthor.\nLittle is known about Nahum's personal history. His name means \"comfort\", and he came from the town of \"Elkosh\" or \"Alqosh\" (Nahum 1:1), which scholars have attempted to identify with several cities, including the modern `Alqush of Assyria and Capernaum of northern Galilee. He was a very nationalistic Hebrew, and lived among the Elkoshites in peace.\nHistorical context.\nThe subject of Nahum's prophecy is the approaching complete and final destruction of Nineveh, which was the capital of the great and flourishing Assyrian empire at that time. Ashurbanipal was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the center of the civilization and commerce of the world, according to Nahum a \"bloody city all full of lies and robbery\", a reference to the Neo-Assyrian Empire's military campaigns and demand of tribute and plunder from conquered cities.\nJonah had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by Zephaniah, who also predicted the destruction of the city.\nNineveh was destroyed apparently by fire around 625 BC, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia. Archaeological digs have uncovered the splendor of Nineveh in its zenith under Sennacherib (705\u2013681 BC), Esarhaddon (681\u2013669 BC), and Ashurbanipal (669\u2013633 BC). Massive walls were eight miles in circumference. It had a water aqueduct, palaces and a library with 20,000 clay tablets, including accounts of a creation in Enuma Elish and a flood in the Epic of Gilgamesh.\nThe Babylonian chronicle of the fall of Nineveh tells the story of the end of Nineveh. Nabopolassar of Babylon joined forces with Cyaxares, king of the Medes, and laid siege for three months.\nAssyria lasted a few more years after the loss of its fortress, but attempts by Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II to rally the Assyrians failed due to opposition from king Josiah of Judah, and it seemed to be all over by 609 BC.\nOverview.\nBeyond its superscription, Nahum 1:1, the Book of Nahum consists of two parts: a prelude in chapter one, followed by chapters two and three, which describe the fall of Nineveh, which later took place in 612\u00a0BC. Davidson notes that there are two parts to the superscription:\nNineveh is compared to Thebes, the Egyptian city that Assyria itself had destroyed in 663\u00a0BC. Nahum describes the siege and frenzied activity of Nineveh's troops as they try in vain to halt the invaders. Poetically, he becomes a participant in the battle, and with subtle irony, barks battle commands to the defenders. Nahum uses numerous similes and metaphor that Nineveh will become weak \"like the lion hiding in its den\". It concludes with a taunt song and funeral dirge of the impending destruction of Nineveh and the \"sleep\" or death of the Assyrian people and demise of the once great Assyrian conqueror-rulers.\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nThe original text was written in Biblical Hebrew.\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008).\nFragments of this book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls including 4QpNah, known as the \"Nahum Commentary\" (1st century BC); 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 1st century BC). and Wadi Murabba'at MurXII (1st century AD).\nThere is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC, with extant manuscripts including Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter (a revision of the Septuagint) were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., Na\u1e25al \u1e24ever (8\u1e24evXIIgr; 1st century AD).\nThemes.\nThe fall of Nineveh.\nNahum's prophecy carries a particular warning to the Ninevites of coming events, although he is partly in favor of the destruction. One might even say that the book of Nahum is \"a celebration of the fall of Assyria\". And this is not just a warning or speaking positively of the destruction of Nineveh, it is also a positive encouragement and \"message of comfort for Israel, Judah, and others who had experienced the \"endless cruelty\" of the Assyrians.\"\nThe prophet Jonah shows us where God shows concern for the people of Nineveh, while Nahum's writing testifies to his belief in the righteousness/justice of God and how God dealt with those Assyrians in punishment according to \"their cruelty\". The Assyrians had been used as God's \"rod of [\u2026] anger, and the staff in their hand [as] indignation.\"\nThe nature of God.\nFrom its opening, Nahum affirms God to be slow to anger, but that God will by no means ignore the guilty; God will bring his vengeance and wrath to pass. God is presented as a God who will punish evil, but will protect those who trust in Him. The opening passage states: \"God is jealous, and the L revengeth; the L revengeth, and is furious; the L will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. The L is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked\".\n\"The L is slow to anger and Quick to love; the L will not leave the guilty unpunished.\"\n\"The L is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him.\"\nImportance.\nGod's judgement on Nineveh is \"all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.\" Infidelity, according to the prophets, related to spiritual unfaithfulness. For example: \"the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the L.\" John of Patmos used a similar analogy in Revelation chapter 17.\nThe prophecy of Nahum was referenced in the deuterocanonical Book of Tobit. In Tobit 14:4 (NRSV) a dying Tobit says to his son Tobias and Tobias' sons:\n[My son] hurry off to Media, for I believe the word of God that Nahum spoke about Nineveh, that all these things will take place and overtake Assyria and Nineveh. Indeed, everything that was spoken by the prophets of Israel, whom God sent, will occur. \nHowever, some versions, such as the King James Version, refer to the prophet Jonah instead.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nCommentary"}
{"id": "4454", "revid": "39166520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4454", "title": "Book of Haggai", "text": "Book of the Bible\nThe Book of Haggai (; ) is a book of the Hebrew Bible or Tanakh, and is the third-to-last of the Twelve Minor Prophets. It is a short book, consisting of only two chapters. The historical setting dates around 520\u00a0BC, before the Temple had been rebuilt. The original text was written in Biblical Hebrew.\nAuthorship.\nThe Book of Haggai is named after the prophet Haggai whose prophecies are recorded in the book. The authorship of the book is uncertain. Some presume that Haggai wrote the book himself but he is repeatedly referred to in the third person which makes it unlikely that he wrote the text: it is more probable that the book was written by a disciple of Haggai who sought to preserve the content of Haggai's spoken prophecies.\nThere is no biographical information given about the prophet in the Book of Haggai. Haggai's name is derived from the Hebrew verbal root \"hgg\", which means \"to make a pilgrimage\". W. Sibley Towner suggests that Haggai's name might come \"from his single-minded effort to bring about the reconstruction of that destination of ancient Judean pilgrims, the Temple in Jerusalem\".\nDate.\nThe \"Book of Haggai\" records events in 520\u00a0BC, some 18 years after Cyrus had conquered Babylon and issued a decree in 538\u00a0BC, allowing the captive Judahites to return to Judea. Cyrus saw the restoration of the temple as necessary for the restoration of religious practices and a sense of peoplehood, after the long exile. The precise date of the written text is uncertain but most likely dates to within a generation of Haggai himself. A traditional consensus dates the completion of the text to c. 515 BC. Other scholars consider the book to be completed around 417 BC, arguing that it did not refer to Darius the Great (Darius I), but to Darius II (424-405 BC).\nEarly surviving manuscripts.\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Biblical Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments of the Hebrew text of this book were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q77 (4QXIIb; 150\u2013125 BCE) 4Q80 (4QXIIe; 75\u201350 BCE); and Wadi Murabba'at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75-100 CE).\nThere is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century).\nSynopsis.\nHaggai's message is filled with an urgency for the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the second Jerusalem temple. Haggai attributes a recent drought to the people's refusal to rebuild the temple, which he sees as key to Jerusalem\u2019s glory. The book ends with the prediction of the downfall of kingdoms, with one Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, as the Lord's chosen leader.\nThe first chapter contains the first address (2\u201311) and its effects (12\u201315). The second chapter contains the second prophecy (1\u20139), delivered a month after the first; the third prophecy (10\u201319), delivered two months and three days after the second; and the fourth prophecy (20\u201323), delivered on the same day as the third.\nThese discourses are referred to in Ezra 5:1 and 6:14. (Compare Haggai 2:7, 8 and 22)\nHaggai reports that three weeks after his first prophecy the rebuilding of the Temple began on September 7 521\u00a0BC. \"They came and began to work on the house of the LORD Almighty, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the King.\" (Haggai 1:14\u201315) and the Book of Ezra indicates that it was finished on February 25 516\u00a0BC \"The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.\" (Ezra 6:15)\nMusical usage.\nThe King James Version of Haggai 2:6\u20137 is used in the libretto of the English-language oratorio \"Messiah\" by George Frideric Handel (HWV 56).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4455", "revid": "7770027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4455", "title": "Book of Malachi", "text": "Book of the Bible\nThe Book of Malachi () is the last book of the Nevi'im in the Tanakh and canonically the final book of the Twelve Minor Prophets. In most Christian traditions, the prophetic books form the last section of the Old Testament, making Malachi the last book before the New Testament. The book is divided into three chapters in the Hebrew Bible and Septuagint, and four in the Latin Vulgate. The fourth chapter in the Vulgate consists of the remainder of the third chapter, starting at verse 3:19.\nThe author of Malachi may or may not have been identified by the title itself. While often understood as a proper name, its Hebrew meaning is simply \"my messenger\" (the Septuagint translates it as \"his messenger\"). It was not a proper name at the time of its writing. Jewish tradition states that the book was written by the Scribe Ezra.\nMost scholars believe the book underwent multiple stages of redaction. The majority of its text originates in the Persian period; the oldest portions dating to c.\u2009500\u00a0BCE. Later modifications occurred into the Hellenistic period.\nOldest surviving manuscripts.\nThe oldest surviving Hebrew manuscripts, containing some or all of this book, are found in the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), the Aleppo Codex (tenth century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this book were also found among the Dead Sea Scrolls 4Q76 (150\u2013125 BCE) and 4Q78 (75\u201350 BCE).\nA translation of the Hebrew Bible into Koine Greek, known as the Septuagint, was made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (fourth century), Codex Sinaiticus (fourth century), Codex Alexandrinus (fifth century), and Codex Marchalianus (sixth century).\nAuthorship.\nThe identity of the author of the Book of Malachi is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the author may have been Levitical. Due to the similarities between Malachi and Ezra's emphasis on forbidding marriage to foreign pagan women, the Talmud and certain Targums, such as Targum Jonathan, identify Ezra as the author of Malachi. This is the traditional view held by most Jews and some Christians. The Catholic priest and historian Jerome suggests that this may be because Ezra was seen as an intermediary between the prophets and the \"great synagogue.\" According to Josephus, Ezra died and was buried \"in a magnificent manner in Jerusalem\". If the tradition that Ezra wrote under the name \"Malachi\" is correct, then he was likely buried in the Tomb of the Prophets, the traditional resting place of Malachi, Haggai, and Zechariah.\nThe name \"Malachi\" occurs in the superscription at 1:1 and 3:1, although most consider it unlikely that the word refers to the same character in both references. According to the editors of the 1897 Easton's Bible Dictionary, some scholars believe the name \"Malachi\" is not a proper noun, but an abbreviation of \"messenger of Yah.\" This reading could be based on Malachi 3:1, \"Behold, I will send \"my messenger\"...\", if \"my messenger\" is taken literally as the name Malachi. Thus, many believe that \"Malachi\" is an anonymous pseudonym. Other scholars, including the editors of the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", argue that the grammatical evidence leads to the conclusion that Malachi is a name, asserting: \"We are no doubt in presence of an abbreviation of the name \"M\u00e1l'akh\u00eeyah\", that is Messenger of Yah.\"\nSome scholars consider the authorship of Zechariah 9\u201314 and Malachi to be anonymous which explains their placement at the end of the Twelve Minor Prophets. Julius Wellhausen, Abraham Kuenen, and Wilhelm Gustav Hermann Nowack argue that is a late addition, pointing to and as evidence. Another interpretation of the authorship comes from the Septuagint superscription , which can be read as either \"by the hand of his messenger\" or as \"by the hand of his angel.\" The \"angel\" reading found an echo among the ancient Church Fathers and ecclesiastical writers. It even gave rise to the \"strangest fancies,\" especially among the disciples of Origen.\nPeriod.\nThe Book of Malachi contains a few historical details. A clue as to its dating lies in the fact that the Persian-era term for governor () is used in 1:8 to refer to the governor of Judah. This points to a post-exilic (that is, after 538 BCE) date of composition both because of the use of this term and because Judah had a king before the exile. Moreover, because the same verse alludes to the rebuilt temple, the book must date to after 515 BCE. The author of the Book of Sirach, written early in the second century BCE, apparently knew of Malachi. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position after the Book of Haggai and the Book of Zechariah, close to the time when Ezra and Nehemiah came to Jerusalem in 445 BCE.\nAim.\nThe Book of Malachi was written to correct what the author saw as the lax religious and social behavior of the Israelites\u2014particularly the priests\u2014in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with God, it was not long after they had been returned to the land, the Second Temple built, and proper worship restored, that the people's commitment to their God began to wane once again. It was in this context that the prophet, commonly referred to as Malachi, delivered his prophecy.\nIn 1:2, Malachi portrays the people of Israel as questioning God's love for them. This introduction to the book illustrates the severity of the situation that Malachi addresses, as does dialectical style with which Malachi confronts his audience. Malachi accuses his audience of failing to respect God as God deserves. One way this disrespect manifests is through the substandard sacrifices that Malachi claims the priests offer. While God demands animals that are \"without blemish\" (Leviticus 1:3, NRSV), the priests, who were \"to determine whether the animal was acceptable\" (Mason 143), were offering blind, lame, and sick animals for sacrifice because they thought nobody would notice.\nIn 2:1, Malachi states that \"Yahweh Sabaoth\" is sending a curse on the priests who have not honoured him with appropriate animal sacrifices: \"Now, watch how I am going to paralyze your arm and throw dung in your face\u2014the dung from your very solemnities\u2014and sweep you away with it. Then you shall learn that it is I who have given you this warning of my intention to abolish my covenant with Levi, says \"Yahweh Sabaoth\".\"\nIn 2:10\u201311, Malachi addresses the issue of divorce. On this topic, Malachi deals with divorce both as a social problem (\"Why then are we faithless to one another ... ?\") and as a religious problem (\"Judah...has married the daughter of a foreign god\"). In contrast to the Book of Ezra, Malachi urges each to remain steadfast to the wife of his youth.\nMalachi also criticizes his audience for questioning God's justice. He reminds them that God is just and exhorts them to be faithful as they await that justice. Malachi states that the people have not been faithful and have not given God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so the people have been neglecting to offer their full tithe to God.\nInterpretations.\nJudaism.\nIn Judaism the book is known as \"the seal of the prophets\" because it brings the books of biblical prophecy to a close.\nChristianity.\nThe New Revised Standard Version of the Bible supplies headings for the book as follows:\nThe majority of scholars consider the book to be made up of six distinct oracles. According to this scheme, the Book of Malachi consists of a series of disputes between Yahweh and the various groups within the Israelite community. In the book's three or four chapters, Yahweh is vindicated, while those who do not adhere to the Mosaic Law are condemned. Some scholars have suggested that the book, as a whole, is structured along the lines of a judicial trial, a suzerain treaty, or a covenant\u2014one of the major themes throughout the Hebrew Bible. Implicit in the prophet's condemnation of Israel's religious practices is a call to keep Yahweh's statutes.\nThe Book of Malachi draws upon various themes found in other books of the Hebrew Bible. Malachi appeals to the rivalry between Jacob and Esau and Yahweh's preference for Jacob contained in the Book of Genesis 25\u201328. Malachi reminds his audience that, as descendants of Jacob (Israel), they have been and continue to be favoured by God as God's chosen people. In the second dispute, Malachi draws upon the Levitical Code (e.g., Leviticus 1:3) in condemning the priest for offering unacceptable sacrifices.\nIn the third dispute (concerning divorce), the author of the Book of Malachi likely intends his argument to be understood on two levels. Malachi appears to be attacking either the practice of divorcing Jewish wives in favour of foreign ones (a practice which Ezra vehemently condemns) or, alternatively, Malachi could be condemning the practice of divorcing foreign wives in favour of Jewish wives (a practice which Ezra promoted). Malachi appears adamant that nationality is not a valid reason to terminate a marriage, \"For I hate divorce, says the Lord...\" (2:16).\nIn many places throughout the Hebrew Bible, particularly in the Book of Hosea, Israel is figured as Yahweh's wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce may also be understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi could be urging his audience not to break faith in Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh's love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might have been tempted to adopt foreign gods. William Sanford LaSor, an American Christian pastor, suggests that because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendour of the Messianic Age, which had been foretold, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.\nIndeed, the fourth dispute asserts that judgment is coming in the form of a messenger who \"is like refiner's fire and like fullers' soap...\" (3:2).\nFollowing this, the prophet provides another example of wrongdoing in the fifth dispute: failing to offer full tithes. In this discussion, Malachi has Yahweh request that the people \"Bring the full tithe ... [and] see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down on you an overflowing blessing\" (3:10). This request offers the opportunity for the people to amend their ways. It also stresses that keeping the Lord's statutes will allow the people to avoid God's wrath and lead to God's blessing. It is this portion of Malachi that supports the view that tithing remains one of the Hebrew Biblical commandments Christians must observe.\nIn the sixth dispute, the people of Israel illustrate the extent of their disillusionment. According to Malachi, they say, \"'It is vain to serve God ... Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape'\" (3:14\u201315). Once again, Yahweh assures the people that the wicked will be punished and the faithful will be rewarded.\nIn the light of what Malachi understands to be an imminent judgment, he exhorts his audience to \"Remember the teaching of my servant Moses, that statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel\" (4:4; 3:22, MT). Before the Day of the Lord, Malachi declares that Elijah (who \"ascended in a whirlwind into heaven...\" 2 Kings 2:11) will return to earth so that people might follow in God's ways.\nThe Book of Malachi is frequently cited in the Christian New Testament, primarily due to its messianic themes. The following is a brief comparison between the Book of Malachi and the New Testament passages that reference it, as outlined by Hill 84-88.\nAlthough many Christians believe that the messianic prophecies of the Book of Malachi have been fulfilled in Jesus's life, religious Jews, who do not share that belief with Christians, continue to await the coming of the prophet Elijah, who will prepare the way for the Messiah.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In the Hebrew Bible, the text is included as part of the Twelve Minor Prophets, itself a part of the second division of that work. In the Christian Old Testament, the Book of Zechariah is considered to be a separate book and consists of fourteen chapters.\nHistorical context.\nOne of the three prophets from the post-exilic period, Zechariah's prophecies took place during the reign of Darius the Great. Chapters 1\u20138 of the book are contemporary with the prophecies of Haggai, while chapters 9\u201314 (often termed Second Zechariah) are thought to have been written much later\u2014in the 5th century, during the late Persian or early Ptolemaic period. Scholars believe that Ezekiel, with his blending of ceremony and vision, heavily influenced the visionary works of Zechariah 1\u20138.\nDuring the exile, a significant portion of the population of the Kingdom of Judah was taken to Babylon, where the prophets told them to make their homes, suggesting they would spend a long time there. Cyrus the Great conquered the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BC. The following year, he released the Edict of Cyrus, which marked the beginning of the first return to Judah under Sheshbazzar.\nDarius acceded to the throne in 522 BC. He divided the many regions of the empire into provinces, each of which was overseen by a governor. Zerubbabel was appointed by Darius as governor over Judah (now redesignated the province of Yehud Medinata of the Persian Empire). Under the reign of Darius, Zechariah also emerged, focusing his prophecies on the rebuilding of the Temple. Unlike the Babylonians, the Persian Empire went to great lengths to keep cordial relations between vassal and lord. The rebuilding of the Temple was encouraged by the Persian monarchs in hopes that it would stabilize the local population. This policy was good politics on the part of the Persians, and the Jews viewed it as a blessing from God.\nProphet.\nThe name \"Zechariah\" means \"God remembered.\" Not much is known about Zechariah's life other than what may be inferred from the book. It has been speculated that his grandfather Iddo was the head of a priestly family who returned with Zerubbabel and that Zechariah may have been a priest as well as a prophet. This is supported by Zechariah's interest in the Temple and the priesthood, and from Iddo's preaching in the Books of Chronicles.\nAuthorship.\nMost modern scholars believe the Book of Zechariah was written by at least two different people. Zechariah 1\u20138, sometimes referred to as First Zechariah, was written in the 6th century BC and contains oracles from the historical prophet Zechariah, who lived in the Achaemenid Empire during the kingdom of Darius the Great. Zechariah 9\u201314, often called Second Zechariah, contains within the text no datable references to specific events or individuals, but most scholars give the text a date in the 5th century BC. Second Zechariah, in the opinion of some scholars, appears to make use of the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, the Deuteronomistic history, and the themes from First Zechariah. This has led some to believe that the writer(s) or editor(s) of Second Zechariah may have been a disciple of the prophet Zechariah. There are some scholars who go even further and divide Second Zechariah into Second Zechariah (9\u201311) and Third Zechariah (12\u201314) since each begins with a heading oracle.\nComposition.\nThe return from exile is the theological premise of the prophet's visions in chapters 1\u20136. Chapters 7\u20138 address the quality of life God wants his renewed people to enjoy, containing many encouraging promises to them. Chapters 9\u201314 comprise two \"oracles\" of the future.\nChapters 1 to 6.\nThe book begins with a in verses 1:1-6, which recalls the role of the \"former prophets\" in calling Israel in times past to repentance. Then follows a series of eight visions succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and to stir up hope in their minds. These visions include seeing four horses, four horns and four craftsmen, a man with a measuring line, Joshua the High Priest, a gold lampstand and two olive trees, a flying scroll and a woman in a basket, and four chariots. The symbolic action, the crowning of Joshua, describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God's Messiah.\nThe German commentators Carl Friedrich Keil and Franz Delitzsch enumerate seven visions, arguing that the visions conventionally numbered as the sixth and the seventh are better treated as a single vision.\nChapters 7 and 8.\nTwo years after the initial visions, chapters 7 and 8 are delivered. They are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be kept any longer. The answer is addressed to the entire people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing.\nChapters 9 to 14.\nThis section consists of two \"oracles\" or \"burdens\": the opening words of both chapter 9 and chapter 12 (and also the first chapter of Malachi) announce \"The burden of the word of the Lord\".\nKatrina Larkin argues that there is a unity across these six chapters established by a series of short \"linking passages\" at 9:9-10, 10:1-2, 11:1-3, 11:17 and 13:7-9\". She refers to these passages as compact and metrical, addressed directly to their audience, which contain material linking with both the previous and the subsequent text.\nThemes.\nThe purpose of this book is not strictly historical but theological and pastoral. The main emphasis is that God is at work, and all his good deeds, including the construction of the Second Temple, are accomplished \"not by might nor by power, but by [his] Spirit\". Ultimately, YHWH plans to live again with his people in Jerusalem. He will save them from their enemies and cleanse them from sin. However, God requires repentance, a turning away from sin towards faith in him.\nZechariah's concern for purity is apparent in the temple, priesthood, and all areas of life as the prophecy gradually eliminates the governor's influence in favour of the high priest, and the sanctuary becomes ever more clearly the centre of messianic fulfillment. The prominence of prophecy is quite apparent in Zechariah, but it is also true that Zechariah (along with Haggai) allows prophecy to yield to the priesthood; this is particularly apparent in comparing Zechariah to Third Isaiah (chapters 55\u201366 of the Book of Isaiah), whose author was active sometime after the first return from exile.\nMost Christian commentators read the series of predictions in chapters 7 to 14 as Messianic prophecies, either directly or indirectly. These chapters helped the writers of the Gospels understand Jesus's suffering, death, and resurrection, which they quoted as they wrote of Jesus's final days. Much of the Book of Revelation, which narrates the denouement of history, is also colored by images in Zechariah.\nApocalyptic literature.\nChapters 9\u201314 of the Book of Zechariah are an early example of apocalyptic literature. Although not as fully developed as the apocalyptic visions described in the Book of Daniel, the \"oracles\", as they are titled in these chapters, contain apocalyptic elements. One theme these oracles contain is descriptions of the Day of the Lord, when \"the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle\". These chapters also contain \"pessimism about the present, but optimism for the future based on the expectation of an ultimate divine victory and the subsequent transformation of the cosmos\".\nThe final portion in Zechariah states that on the Day of the Lord, \"there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD\", proclaiming the need for purity in the Temple, which would come when God judged at the end of time. The Hebrew word , often translated as \"Canaanite\", is alternatively translated as \"trader\" or \"trafficker\", as in other translations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The book has three chapters. Zephaniah is a male given name which is usually interpreted to mean \"Yahweh has hidden/protected\", or \"Yahweh hides\". The church father Jerome of Stridon interpreted Zephaniah's name to mean \"the watchman of the Lord\". The original text of the prophecy was written in Biblical Hebrew.\nScholars propose various dates of composition; some scholars argue that the book was probably composed during the reign of Josiah (late-seventh century BCE), while others hold that an original core of oracles was expanded and edited in exilic or later times.\nAuthorship and date.\nThe book's superscription attributes its authorship to \"Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah\". All that is known of Zephaniah comes from within the text.\nThe name \"Cushi,\" Zephaniah's father, means \"Cushite\" or \"Ethiopian\", and the text of Zephaniah mentions the sin and restoration of \"Cushim\". While some have concluded from this that Zephaniah was dark-skinned or African, Ehud Ben Zvi maintains that, based on the context, \"Cushi\" must be understood as a personal name rather than an indicator of nationality. Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted the name Hezekiah in the superscription as King Hezekiah of Judah, though that is not a claim advanced in the text of Zephaniah.\nAs with many of the other prophets, there is no external evidence to directly associate composition of the book with a prophet by the name of Zephaniah. Some scholars, such as Kent Harold Richards and Jason DeRouchie, consider the words in Zephaniah to reflect a time early in the reign of King Josiah (640\u2013609 BC) before his reforms of 622 BC took full effect, in which case the prophet may have been born during the reign of Manasseh (698/687\u2013642 BC). Others argue that some portion of the book is postmonarchic, that is, dating to later than 586 BC when the Kingdom of Judah fell in the Siege of Jerusalem. Some who consider the book to have largely been written by a historical Zephaniah have suggested that he may have been a disciple of the prophet Isaiah, because of the two books' similar focus on rampant corruption and injustice in Judah. The Jerusalem Bible links Zephaniah 2:11 and 3:9-10 with the Book of Consolation (Isaiah 40-55).\nPurpose.\nIf Zephaniah was largely composed during the monarchic period, then its composition was occasioned by Judah's refusal to obey its covenant obligations toward Yahweh despite having seen northern Israel's exile a generation or two previously, an exile which the Judahite literary tradition attributed to Yahweh's anger aroused by Israel's disobedience to the covenant. In this historical context, Zephaniah urges Judah to obedience to Yahweh, saying that \"perhaps\" he will forgive them if they do.\nThemes.\n\"The HarperCollins Study Bible\" supplies headings for sections within the book as follows:\nMore consistently than any other prophetic book, Zephaniah focuses on \"the day of the Lord\", developing this tradition from its first appearance in Amos. The day of the Lord tradition also appears in Isaiah, Ezekiel, Obadiah, Joel, and Malachi.\nThe book begins by describing Yahweh's judgement. With a triple repetition of \"I will sweep away\" in Zephaniah 1:2\u20133, Zephaniah emphasizes the totality of the destruction, as the number three often signifies perfection in the Bible. The order of creatures in Zephaniah 1:2 (\"humans and animals ... the birds ... the fish\") is the opposite of the creation order in Genesis 1:1\u201328, signifying an undoing of creation. This is also signified by the way that \"from the face of the earth\" forms an \"inclusio\" around Zephaniah 1:2-3, hearkening back to how the phrase is used in the Genesis flood narrative in Genesis 6:7, Genesis 7:4, and Genesis 8:8, where it also connotes an undoing of creation.\nAs is common in prophetic literature in the Bible, a \"remnant\" survives Yahweh's judgement, by humbly seeking refuge in Yahweh. The book concludes with an announcement of hope and joy, as Yahweh \"bursts forth in joyful divine celebration\" over his people.\nLater influence.\nBecause of its hopeful tone of the gathering and restoration of exiles, has been included in Jewish liturgy.\nZephaniah served as a major inspiration for the medieval Catholic hymn \"Dies Irae,\" whose title and opening words are from the Vulgate translation of .\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nThe original manuscript of this book has been lost. Some early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008).

{"id": "4458", "revid": "8796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4458", "title": "Book of Habakkuk", "text": "Book of the Bible\nThe Book of Habakkuk is the eighth book of the Twelve Minor Prophets of the Hebrew Bible. The book has three chapters. It is attributed to the prophet Habakkuk. Most scholars agree that the book was probably composed in the period during Jehoiakim's reign as king of Judah (609\u2013597 BC). It is an important text in Judaism, and passages from the book are quoted by authors of the New Testament, and its message has inspired modern Christian hymn writers.\nOf the three chapters in the book, the first two are a dialogue between Yahweh and the prophet. Verse 4 in chapter 2, stating that \"the just shall live by his faith\", plays an important role in Christian thought. It is used in the Epistle to the Romans, Epistle to the Galatians, and the Epistle to the Hebrews as the starting point of the concept of faith. A copy of these two chapters is included in the Habakkuk Commentary, found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Chapter 3 is now recognized as a liturgical piece. It is debated whether chapter 3 and the first two chapters were written by the same author.\nBackground.\nThe prophet Habakkuk is generally believed to have written his book in the mid-to-late 7th century BC. It was likely written shortly after the Battle of Nineveh (612 BC) established the Neo-Babylonian Empire but before the Babylonian Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC) and subsequent Babylonian captivity.\nAuthor.\nIn the opening verse, Habakkuk identifies himself as a prophet. Due to the liturgical nature of Habakkuk's book, some scholars think that the author may have been a temple prophet. Temple prophets are described in 1 Chronicles 25:1 as using lyres, harps and cymbals. Some feel that this is echoed in Habakkuk 3:19b, and that Habakkuk may have been a Levite and cantor in Solomon's Temple.\nThere is no biographical information on the prophet Habakkuk. The only canonical information that exists comes from the book that is named for him. His name comes either from the Hebrew word \u05d7\u05d1\u05e7 (\"\u1e25avaq\") meaning \"embrace\", or else from an Akkadian word \"hambakuku\", for a kind of plant.\nAlthough his name does not appear in any other part of the Bible, Rabbinic tradition holds Habakkuk to be the Shunammite woman's son, who was restored to life by Elisha in 2 Kings 4:16. The prophet Habakkuk is also mentioned in the narrative of Bel and the Dragon, part of the deuterocanonical additions to Daniel in a late section of that book. In the superscription of the Old Greek version, Habakkuk is called the son of Joshua of the tribe of Levi. In this book, Habakkuk is lifted by an angel to Babylon to provide Daniel with food while he is in the lion's den.\nHistorical context.\nIt is unknown when Habakkuk lived and preached, but the reference to the rise and advance of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 1:6\u201311 places him in the middle to last quarter of the 7th century BC. One possible period might be during the reign of Jehoiakim, from 609 to 598 BC. The Neo-Babylonian Empire was growing in power in this period. The Babylonians marched against Jerusalem in 598 BC. Jehoiakim died while the Babylonians marched towards Jerusalem, and Jehoiakim's eighteen-year-old son Jeconiah assumed the throne. Upon the Babylonians' arrival, Jehoiachin and his advisors quickly surrendered Jerusalem and Zedekiah was appointed as a puppet king. With the transition of rulers and the young age and inexperience of Jehoiachin, they could not stand against the Babylonian forces. There is a sense of an intimate knowledge of the Babylonian brutality in 1:12\u201317.\nOverview.\nThe book of Habakkuk is a book of the Hebrew Bible and stands eighth in a section known as the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint. In the Masoretic Text, it follows Nahum and precedes Zephaniah, who are considered to be his contemporaries.\nThe book consists of three chapters and it is neatly divided into three different genres:\nThemes.\nThe major theme of Habakkuk is trying to grow from a faith of perplexity and doubt to the height of absolute trust in God. Habakkuk addresses his concerns over the fact that God will use the Babylonian empire to execute judgment on Judah for their sins.\nHabakkuk openly questions the wisdom of God. In the first part of the first chapter, the Prophet sees the injustice among his people and asks why God does not take action. \"Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you \u201cViolence!\u201d and will you not save?\"\u00a0\u2013 (Habakkuk 1:2)\nIn the middle part of Chapter 1, God explains that he will send the Chaldeans (also known as the Babylonians) to punish his people. In 1:5: \"Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you.\" In 1:6: \"For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.\"\nOne of the \"Eighteen Emendations to the Hebrew Scriptures\" appears at 1:12. According to the professional Jewish scribes, the Sopherim, the text of 1:12 was changed from \"You [God] do not die\" to \"We shall not die\". The Sopherim considered it disrespectful to say to God, \"\"You\" do not die.\"\nIn the final part of the first chapter, the prophet expresses shock at God's choice of instrument for judgment, in 1:13: \"You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he[...]?\"\nIn Chapter 2, he awaits God's response to his challenge. God explains that He will also judge the Chaldeans, and much more harshly. \"Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men\u2019s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it. Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house.\" (Habakkuk 2:8-9)\nFinally, in Chapter 3, Habakkuk expresses his ultimate faith in God, even if he does not fully understand: \"For though the fig tree doesn\u2019t flourish, nor fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive fails, the fields yield no food; the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls: 3:18 yet I will rejoice in Yahweh. I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!\" Some scholars suggest that the final chapter may be a later independent addition to the book, in part because it is not included among the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nSurviving early manuscripts.\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this book in Hebrew language are found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., 1QpHab, known as the \"Habakkuk Commentary\" (later half of the 1st century BC), and of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes Codex Cairensis (895 CE), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this book in Hebrew were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 25 BCE) with extant verses 4?; and Wadi Murabba'at Minor Prophets (Mur88; MurXIIProph; 75-100 CE) with extant verses 1:3\u201313, 1:15, 2:2\u20133, 2:5\u201311, 2:18\u201320, and 3:1\u201319.\nThere is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; formula_1B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: formula_1S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; formula_1A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; formula_1Q; 6th century). Fragments containing parts of this book in Greek were also found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, that is, Na\u1e25al \u1e24ever 8\u1e24ev1 (8\u1e24evXIIgr); (late 1st century BCE) with extant verses 1:5\u201311, 1:14\u201317, 2:1\u20138, 2:13\u201320, and 3:8\u201315.\nImportance.\nThe Book of Habakkuk is accepted as canonical by adherents of the Jewish and Christian faiths.\nJudaism.\nThe Book of Habakkuk is the eighth book of the Twelve Prophets of the Hebrew Bible, and this collection appears in all copies of texts of the Septuagint, the Ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible completed by 132 BC. Likewise, the book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus), also written in the 2nd century BC, mentions \"The Twelve Prophets\".\nA partial copy of Habakkuk itself is included in the Habakkuk Commentary, a \"pesher\" found among the original seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947. The Commentary contains a copy of the first two chapters of Habakkuk, but not of the third chapter. The writer of the \"pesher\" draws a comparison between the Babylonian invasion of the original text and the Roman threat of the writer's own period. What is even more significant than the commentary in the \"pesher\" is the quoted text of Habakkuk itself. The divergences between the Hebrew text of the scroll and the standard Masoretic Text are startlingly minimal. The biggest differences are word order, small grammatical variations, addition or omission of conjunctions, and spelling variations, but these are small enough not to damage the meaning of the text.\nSome scholars suggest that Chapter 3 may be a later independent addition to the book, in part because it is not included among the Dead Sea Scrolls. However, this chapter does appear in all copies of the Septuagint, as well as in texts from as early as the 3rd century BC. This final chapter is a poetic praise of God, and has some similarities with Exodus 19, and with texts found in the Book of Daniel. However, the fact that the third chapter is written in a different style, as a liturgical piece, does not necessarily mean that Habakkuk was not also its author.\nQumran community.\nA commentary on the first two chapters of the book was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran. The omission of chapter 3 from the version within the Dead Sea Scrolls has been attributed to incompatibilities with the theology of the Qumran sect.\nHabakkuk 2:4.\nThe Talmud (Makkot 24a) mentions that various Biblical figures grouped the 613 commandments into categories that encapsulated all of the 613. At the end of this discussion, the Talmud concludes, \"Habakkuk came and established [the 613 mitzvoth] upon one, as it is stated: 'But the righteous person shall live by his faith' (Habakkuk 2:4)\".\nHabakkuk 2:4 is well known in Christianity. In the New International Version of the bible it reads:\n\"See, the enemy is puffed up; his desires are not upright\"\n\"but the righteous person will live by his faithfulness.\"\nAlthough the second half of this passage is only three words in the original Hebrew, it is quoted three times in the New Testament. Paul the Apostle quotes it once in his Epistle to the Romans, and again in his Epistle to the Galatians; its third use is in the Epistle to the Hebrews. It became one of the most important of the verses that were used as foundations of the doctrines of the Protestant reformation.\nThere is controversy about the translation of the verse: the word \"emunah\" is most often translated as \"faithfulness\", though the word in this verse has been traditionally translated as \"faith\".\nThe word \"emunah\" is not translated as \"belief\" other than in Habakkuk 2:4, Clendenen, E. Ray defended the translation of the word as \"faith\" on the basis of the context of the verse, arguing that it refers to \"Genesis 15:6\", which used the word \"he\u2019\u0115min\" 'believed' of which \"\u2019\u0115m\u0217n\u0101h\" is derived from, he also argued that the Essenes in the Qumran community likely understood the verse as referring to faith in the Teacher of Righteousness instead of faithfulness.\nMartin Luther believed that Habakkuk 2:4 taught the doctrine of faith alone, commenting on the verse \"For this is a general saying applicable to all of God's words. These must be believed, whether spoken at the beginning, middle, or end of the world\".\nRashi interpreted the verse to be about Jeconiah.\nThe Targum interpreted the verse as \"The wicked think that all these things are not so, but the righteous live by the truth of them\".\nPseudo-Ignatius understood the verse to be about faith.\nHabakkuk 2:6-20: the taunting riddle.\nThe melitzah \u1e25idah, or the taunting riddle, is the oracle revealed to Habakkuk the prophet. It is a mashal, which is a proverb and a parable. It is also known as a witty satire, a mocking and an enigma. The riddle is 15 verses long, from verse 6 to verse 20, and is divided into five woes which consist of three verses each.\nHebrew Text.\nThe following table shows the Hebrew text of Habakkuk 2:6-20 with vowels alongside an English translation based upon the JPS 1917 translation (now in the public domain).\n\"A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, according to Shigionoth.\"\nHabakkuk 3:1.\nThis verse is a heading for the final chapter. The exact meaning of \"Shigionoth\" is not known. The New Living Translation treats the word as an addition in the Hebrew text which \"probably\" indicates the prayer's musical setting, and the Jerusalem Bible suggests that the prayer adopts \"the tone as for dirges\".\nMusical uses.\nModern Christian hymns have been inspired by the words of the prophet Habakkuk:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Though vine nor fig-tree neither,Their wonted fruit shall bear,Though all the field should wither,Nor flocks nor herds be there;\nYet God the same abiding, His praise shall tune my voice, For, while in Him confiding, I cannot but rejoice.\u2014\u200a\nIrish composer Charles Villiers Stanford set slightly revised portions of text from the first and second chapters of Habakkuk in his choral composition for choir, soprano and tenor soloist and organ, \"For Lo, I Raise Up\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nHistoric manuscripts\nJewish translations\nChristian translations\nFurther information"}
{"id": "4459", "revid": "48546149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4459", "title": "Backward compatibility", "text": "Technological ability to interact with older technologies\nIn telecommunications and computing, backward compatibility (or backwards compatibility) is a property of an operating system, software, real-world product, or technology that allows for interoperability with an older legacy system, or with input designed for such a system.\nModifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is sometimes called \"breaking\" backward compatibility. Such breaking usually incurs various types of costs, such as switching cost.\nA complementary concept is \"forward compatibility\"; a design that is forward-compatible usually has a roadmap for compatibility with future standards and products.\nUsage.\nIn hardware.\nA simple example of both backward and forward compatibility is the introduction of FM radio in stereo. FM radio was initially mono, with only one audio channel represented by one signal. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, many listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved by sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one signal and the difference in another signal. That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the sum signal while ignoring the difference signal, which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a sum signal to left and right channels if both sum and difference signals are received. Without the requirement for backward compatibility, a simpler method could have been chosen.\nFull backward compatibility is particularly important in computer instruction set architectures, two of the most successful being the IBM 360/370/390/Zseries families of mainframes, and the Intel x86 family of microprocessors.\nIBM announced the first 360 models in 1964 and has continued to update the series ever since, with migration over the decades from 32-bit register/24-bit addresses to 64-bit registers and addresses.\nIntel announced the first Intel 8086/8088 processors in 1978, again with migrations over the decades from 16-bit to 64-bit. (The 8086/8088, in turn, were designed with easy machine-translatability of programs written for its predecessor in mind, although they were not instruction-set compatible with the 8-bit Intel 8080 processor of 1974. The Zilog Z80, however, was fully backward compatible with the Intel 8080.)\nFully backward compatible processors can process the same binary executable software instructions as their predecessors, allowing the use of a newer processor without having to acquire new applications or operating systems. Similarly, the success of the Wi-Fi digital communication standard is attributed to its broad forward and backward compatibility; it became more popular than other standards that were not backward compatible.\nIn software.\nIn software development, backward compatibility is a general notion of interoperation between software pieces that will not produce any errors when its functionality is invoked via API. The software is considered stable when its API that is used to invoke functions is stable across different versions.\nIn operating systems, upgrades to newer versions are said to be backward compatible if executables and other files from the previous versions will work as usual.\nIn compilers, backward compatibility may refer to the ability of a compiler for a newer version of the language to accept source code of programs or data that worked under the previous version.\nA data format is said to be backward compatible when a newer version of the program can open it without errors just like its predecessor.\nTradeoffs.\nBenefits.\nThere are several incentives for a company to implement backward compatibility. One is that it can be used to preserve older software that would have otherwise been lost when a manufacturer decides to stop supporting older hardware. A great example of this approach would be that of video games, since it is a common example used when discussing the value of supporting older software. The cultural impact of video games is a large part of their continued success, and some believe ignoring backward compatibility would cause these titles to disappear. Backward compatibility also acts as a selling point for new hardware, as an existing player base can more affordably upgrade to subsequent generations of a console. This also helps to make up for the lack of titles at the launch of new systems, as users can pull from the previous console's library of games while developers transition to the new hardware. Backward compatibility with the original PlayStation (PS) software discs and peripherals is considered to have been a key selling point for the PlayStation 2 (PS2) during its early months on the market. Moreover, studies in the mid-1990s found that even consumers who never play older games after purchasing a new system consider backward compatibility a highly desirable feature, valuing the mere ability to continue to play an existing collection of games even if they choose never to do so.\nDespite not being included at launch, Microsoft slowly incorporated backward compatibility for select titles on the Xbox One several years into its product life cycle. Players have racked up over a billion hours with backward-compatible games on Xbox. A large part of the success and implementation of this feature is that the hardware within newer generation consoles is both powerful and similar enough to legacy systems that older titles can be broken down and re-configured to run on the Xbox One. This program has proven incredibly popular with Xbox players and goes against the recent trend of studio-made remasters of classic titles, creating what some believe to be an important shift in console makers' strategies. The current generation of consoles such as the PlayStation 5 (PS5) and Xbox Series X/S also support this feature as well.\nCosts.\nThe monetary costs of supporting old software is considered to be a large drawback to the usage of backward compatibility. The associated costs of backward compatibility are a larger bill of materials if hardware is required to support the legacy systems; increased complexity of the product that may lead to longer time to market, technological hindrances, and slowing innovation; and increased expectations from users in terms of compatibility. Furthermore, it also introduces the risk that developers will favor developing games that are compatible with both the old and new systems, since this gives them a larger base of potential buyers, resulting in a dearth of software which uses the advanced features of the new system. Because of this, several console manufacturers phased out backward compatibility towards the end of the console generation in order to reduce cost and briefly reinvigorate sales before the arrival of newer hardware. One such example of this approach was the PlayStation 3 (PS3), where it had removed backward compatibility with PlayStation 2 (PS2) games on later systems (which includes eliminating the onboard Emotion Engine and Graphics Synthesizer hardware chips that were previously used on earlier revisions) to reduce hardware costs and improve console sales.\nDespite this, it is still possible to bypass some of these hardware costs. For instance, earlier PS2 systems had the core of the original PlayStation (PS1) CPU integrated into the I/O processor for dual-purpose use; it could act as either the main CPU in PS1 mode or it can up-clock itself to offload I/O in PS2 mode. The original I/O core was replaced with a PowerPC-based core in later systems to serve the same functions, emulating the same functions as the PS1 CPU core. Such an approach can backfire, however, as was the case of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES). It opted for the more peculiar 65C816 CPU over the more popular 16-bit microprocessors on the basis that it would allow for easier backwards compatibility with the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) due to the 65C816's software compatibility with the 6502 CPU in emulation mode, but ultimately did not proved to be workable once the rest of the Super NES's architecture was designed.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4460", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4460", "title": "Bacterial conjugation", "text": "Method of bacterial gene transfer\nBacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacterial cells by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. This takes place through a pilus. It is a parasexual mode of reproduction in bacteria.\nIt is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer as are transformation and transduction although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact.\nClassical \"E. coli\" bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of sexual reproduction or mating, since it involves the exchange of genetic material. However, it is not sexual reproduction, since no exchange of gamete occurs, and indeed no generation of a new organism: instead, an existing organism is transformed. During classical \"E. coli\" conjugation, the \"donor\" cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a plasmid or transposon. Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the \"recipient\" cell does not already contain a similar element.\nThe genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient. Benefits may include antibiotic resistance, xenobiotic tolerance or the ability to use new metabolites. Other elements can be detrimental, and may be viewed as bacterial parasites.\nConjugation in \"Escherichia coli\" by spontaneous zygogenesis and in \"Mycobacterium smegmatis\" by distributive conjugal transfer differ from the better studied classical \"E. coli\" conjugation in that these cases involve substantial blending of the parental genomes.\nHistory.\nThe process was discovered by Joshua Lederberg and Edward Tatum in 1946.\nMechanism.\nConjugation diagram\nThe F-factor is an episome (a plasmid that can integrate itself into the bacterial chromosome by homologous recombination) with a length of about 100 kb. It carries its own origin of replication, the \"oriV\", and an origin of transfer, or \"oriT\". There can only be one copy of the F-plasmid in a given bacterium, either free or integrated, and bacteria that possess a copy are called \"F-positive\" or \"F-plus\" (denoted F+). Cells that lack F plasmids are called \"F-negative\" or \"F-minus\" (F\u2212) and as such can function as recipient cells.\nAmong other genetic information, the F-plasmid carries a \"tra\" and \"trb\" locus, which together are about 33 kb long and consist of about 40 genes. The \"tra\" locus includes the \"pilin\" gene and regulatory genes, which together form pili on the cell surface. The locus also includes the genes for the proteins that attach themselves to the surface of F\u2212 bacteria and initiate conjugation. Though there is some debate on the exact mechanism of conjugation it seems that the pili are the structures through which DNA exchange occurs. The F-pili are extremely resistant to mechanical and thermochemical stress, which guarantees successful conjugation in a variety of environments. Several proteins coded for in the \"tra\" or \"trb\" locus seem to open a channel between the bacteria and it is thought that the traD enzyme, located at the base of the pilus, initiates membrane fusion. \nWhen conjugation is initiated by a signal, the relaxase enzyme creates a nick in one of the strands of the conjugative plasmid at the \"oriT\". Relaxase may work alone, or in a complex of over a dozen proteins known collectively as a relaxosome. In the F-plasmid system, the relaxase enzyme is called TraI and the relaxosome consists of TraI, TraY, TraM and the integrated host factor IHF. The nicked strand, or \"T-strand\", is then unwound from the unbroken strand and transferred to the recipient cell in a 5'-terminus to 3'-terminus direction. The remaining strand is replicated either independent of conjugative action (vegetative replication beginning at the \"oriV\") or in concert with conjugation (conjugative replication similar to the rolling circle replication of lambda phage). Conjugative replication may require a second nick before successful transfer can occur. A recent report claims to have inhibited conjugation with chemicals that mimic an intermediate step of this second nicking event.\nIf the F-plasmid that is transferred has previously been integrated into the donor's genome (producing an Hfr strain [\"High Frequency of Recombination\"]) some of the donor's chromosomal DNA may also be transferred with the plasmid DNA. The amount of chromosomal DNA that is transferred depends on how long the two conjugating bacteria remain in contact. In common laboratory strains of \"E. coli\" the transfer of the entire bacterial chromosome takes about 100 minutes. The transferred DNA can then be integrated into the recipient genome via homologous recombination.\nA cell culture that contains in its population cells with non-integrated F-plasmids usually also contains a few cells that have accidentally integrated their plasmids. It is these cells that are responsible for the low-frequency chromosomal gene transfers that occur in such cultures. Some strains of bacteria with an integrated F-plasmid can be isolated and grown in pure culture. Because such strains transfer chromosomal genes very efficiently they are called Hfr (high frequency of recombination). The \"E. coli\" genome was originally mapped by interrupted mating experiments in which various Hfr cells in the process of conjugation were sheared from recipients after less than 100 minutes (initially using a Waring blender). The genes that were transferred were then investigated. \nSince integration of the F-plasmid into the \"E. coli\" chromosome is a rare spontaneous occurrence, and since the numerous genes promoting DNA transfer are in the plasmid genome rather than in the bacterial genome, it has been argued that conjugative bacterial gene transfer, as it occurs in the \"E. coli\" Hfr system, is not an evolutionary adaptation of the bacterial host, nor is it likely ancestral to eukaryotic sex.\nSpontaneous zygogenesis in \"E. coli\"\nIn addition to classical bacterial conjugation described above for \"E. coli\", a form of conjugation referred to as spontaneous zygogenesis (Z-mating for short) is observed in certain strains of \"E. coli\". In Z-mating there is complete genetic mixing, and unstable diploids are formed that throw off phenotypically haploid cells, of which some show a parental phenotype and some are true recombinants. \nConjugal transfer in mycobacteria.\nConjugation in \"Mycobacteria smegmatis\", like conjugation in \"E. coli\", requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. However, unlike \"E. coli\" Hfr conjugation, mycobacterial conjugation is chromosome rather than plasmid based. Furthermore, in contrast to \"E. coli\" Hfr conjugation, in \"M. smegmatis\" all regions of the chromosome are transferred with comparable efficiencies. The lengths of the donor segments vary widely, but have an average length of 44.2kb. Since a mean of 13 tracts are transferred, the average total of transferred DNA per genome is 575kb. This process is referred to as \"Distributive conjugal transfer.\" Gray et al. found substantial blending of the parental genomes as a result of conjugation and regarded this blending as reminiscent of that seen in the meiotic products of sexual reproduction.\nConjugation-like DNA transfer in hyperthermophilic archaea.\nHyperthermophilic archaea encode pili structurally similar to the bacterial conjugative pili. However, unlike in bacteria, where conjugation apparatus typically mediates the transfer of mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids or transposons, the conjugative machinery of hyperthermophilic archaea, called Ced (Crenarchaeal system for exchange of DNA) and Ted (Thermoproteales system for exchange of DNA), appears to be responsible for the transfer of cellular DNA between members of the same species. It has been suggested that in these archaea the conjugation machinery has been fully domesticated for promoting DNA repair through homologous recombination rather than spread of mobile genetic elements. In addition to the VirB2-like conjugative pilus, the Ced and Ted systems include components for the VirB6-like transmembrane mating pore and the VirB4-like ATPase.\nInter-kingdom transfer.\nBacteria related to the nitrogen fixing \"Rhizobia\" are an interesting case of inter-kingdom conjugation. For example, the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of \"Agrobacterium\" and the root-tumor inducing (Ri) plasmid of \"A. rhizogenes\" contain genes that are capable of transferring to plant cells. The expression of these genes effectively transforms the plant cells into opine-producing factories. Opines are used by the bacteria as sources of nitrogen and energy. Infected cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.\nThe Ti and Ri plasmids can also be transferred between bacteria using a system (the \"tra\", or transfer, operon) that is different and independent of the system used for inter-kingdom transfer (the \"vir\", or virulence, operon). Such transfers create virulent strains from previously avirulent strains.\nGenetic engineering applications.\nConjugation is a convenient means for transferring genetic material to a variety of targets. In laboratories, successful transfers have been reported from bacteria to yeast, plants, mammalian cells, diatoms and isolated mammalian mitochondria. Conjugation has advantages over other forms of genetic transfer including minimal disruption of the target's cellular envelope and the ability to transfer relatively large amounts of genetic material (see the above discussion of \"E. coli\" chromosome transfer). In plant engineering, \"Agrobacterium\"-like conjugation complements other standard vehicles such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). While TMV is capable of infecting many plant families these are primarily herbaceous dicots. \"Agrobacterium\"-like conjugation is also primarily used for dicots, but monocot recipients are not uncommon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Galjoen is the national fish of South Africa.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe galjoen is indigenous to the coasts of southern Africa from Angola to South Africa, and is generally found around reefs at shallow depths around , often near the shore.\nDescription.\nThis species can reach in total length and a weight of . The body is compressed, and the fins are well developed, with prominent spines, 10 of them, with between 18 and 23 rays. The anal fin has three spines, and usually 13 or 14 rays, the pelvic fins have 1 spine and 5 rays, and the pectoral fins are typically shorter than the head. The body, fins, and head, with the except of the front of the snout, are covered in scales. The lips are thick, with strong curved incisors at the front of the mouth, with smaller teeth behind the front incisors.\nEcology.\nDiet.\nThe species usually feeds on red and coraline seaweed and red bait, small mussels and barnacles found off rocky shores, and appear in particular to be a partial to the white mussels residing in the sandy beaches and inlets of the rocky outcrops along the southern coast.\nHome area.\nIn 2005, the movements of the species were extensively studied. Some 25,000 galjoen were tagged at four sites in reserves in South Africa and their overall movement was found to remain localised, with some 95% of fish studied seeming to frequent a particular area.\nConservation status.\nAccording to the South African Association for Marine Biological Research, the population of the galljoen is depleted at less than 20% of its optimal size; the existing stock is maintained due to natural refuges and no-take MPAs.\nIn the 2018 National Biodiversity Assessment by SANBI, it is listed as Near Threatened. It is listed on the South African Sustainable Seafood Initiative List as a red-listed fish that cannot be sold nor bought; only recreational anglers with a permit may catch a minimum size of 35 cm with a limit of 2 a day.\nImportance to humans.\nFishing.\nIt is important to local commercial fisheries and is also popular as a game fish.\nAs food.\nDue to their abundance in the shores off South Africa, galjoen is common in South African cuisine. A notable dish is the fish sprinkled with pepper and lemon \u2014 or alternatively with lemon, mayonnaise, and melted garlic butter \u2014 and served with fresh bread and apricot jam.\nAs the national fish of South Africa.\nGaljoen is the national fish of South Africa. The suggestion to make it the national fish came from Margaret Smith, the wife of ichthyologist J. L. B. Smith, to find a marine equivalent to the springbok.\nEtymology.\nThe scientific name of \"Coracinus capensis\" is a reference to its black colour when found in rocky areas, \"Coracinus\" meaning \"raven\" or \"black coloured\"; in sandy areas it gives off a silver-bronze colour.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN.\nDescription.\nThe blue crane is a tall, ground-dwelling bird, but is fairly small by the standards of the crane family. It is tall, with a wingspan of and weighs . Among standard measurements, the wing chord measures , the exposed culmen measures and the tarsus measures . This crane is pale blue-gray in color becoming darker on the upper head, neck and nape. From the crown to the lores, the plumage is distinctly lighter, sometimes whitish. The bill is ochre to greyish, with a pink tinge. The long wingtip feathers which trail to the ground. The primaries are black to slate grey, with dark coverts and blackish on the secondaries. Unlike most cranes, it has a relatively large head and a proportionately thin neck. Juveniles are similar but slightly lighter, with tawny coloration on the head, and no long wing plumes.\nHabitat.\nBlue cranes are birds of the dry grassy uplands, usually the pastured grasses of hills, valleys, and plains with a few scattered trees. They prefer areas in the nesting season that have access to both upland and wetland areas, though they feed almost entirely in dry areas. They are altitudinal migrants, generally nesting in the lower grasslands of an elevation of around 1,300 to 2,000 m and moving down to lower altitudes for winter.\nMovements and behaviour.\nOf the 15 species of crane, the blue crane has the most restricted distribution of all. Even species with lower population numbers now (such as Siberian or whooping cranes) are found over a considerable range in their migratory movements. The blue crane is migratory, primarily altitudinal, but details are little known.\nThe blue crane is partially social, less so during the breeding season. There is a strict hierarchy in groups, with the larger adult males being dominant. They overlap in range with three other crane species but interactions with these species and other \"large wader\" type birds are not known. They are aggressively protective of their nesting sites during the nesting season, even attacking innocent, non-predatory animals such as antelope, cattle, tortoises, plovers and the smallest of birds, such as sparrows. Humans are also attacked if they approach a nest too closely, with the aggressive male having torn clothes and drawn blood in such cases. Threats to their eggs and chicks include large savannah and white-throated monitor lizards, egg-eating snakes, foxes, jackals, birds-of-prey, meerkats, and mongoose.\nFeeding.\nBlue cranes feed from the ground and appear to rarely feed near wetland areas. Most of their diet is comprised by grasses and sedges, with many types fed on based on their proximity to the nests. They are also regularly insectivorous, feeding on numerous, sizeable insects such as grasshoppers. Small animals such as crabs, snails, frogs, small lizards and snakes may supplement the diet, with such protein-rich food often being broken down and fed to the young.\nBreeding.\nThe breeding period is highly seasonal, with eggs being recorded between October and March. Pair-formation amongst groups often starts in October, beginning with both potential parents running in circles with each other. The male then engages in a \"dance\" flings various objects in the air and then jumps. Eventually, a female from the group and the male appear to \"select\" each other and both engage in the dance of throwing objects and jumping. After the dance, mating commences in around two weeks.\nIn a great majority of known nests, two eggs are laid (rarely one or three). Both males and females will incubate, with the male often incubating at night and, during the day, defending the nest territory while the female incubates. The incubation stage lasts around 30 days. The young are able to walk after two days and can swim well shortly thereafter. They are fed primarily by their mothers, who regurgitates food into the mouths. The chicks fledge in the age of 3\u20135 months. The young continue to be tended to until the next breeding season, at which time they are chased off by their parents.\nDecline.\nWhile it remains common in parts of its historic range, and approx. 26\u00a0000 individuals remain, it began a sudden population decline from around 1980 and is now classified as vulnerable.\nIn the last two decades, the blue crane has largely disappeared from the Eastern Cape, Lesotho, and Eswatini. The population in the northern Free State, Limpopo, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and North West Province has declined by up to 90%. The majority of the remaining population is in eastern and southern South Africa, with a small and separate population in the Etosha Pan of northern Namibia. Occasionally, isolated breeding pairs are found in five neighbouring countries.\nThe primary causes of the sudden decline of the blue crane are human population growth, the conversion of grasslands into commercial tree plantations, and poisoning: deliberate (to protect crops) or accidental (baits intended for other species, and as a side-effect of crop dusting).\nThe South African government has stepped up legal protection for the blue crane. Other conservation measures are focusing on research, habitat management, education, and recruiting the help of private landowners.\nThe blue crane is one of the species to which the \"Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds\" (AEWA) applies.\nSince October 2021, the Blue Crane has been classified as Moderately Depleted by the IUCN.\nCultural references.\nThe blue crane is culturally significant to the Xhosa people, who call it \"indwe\" (flag). Traditionally, when a man distinguished himself in battle or otherwise, he was often decorated by a chief with blue crane feathers in a ceremony called \"ukundzabela\". Men so honoured, who would wear the feathers sticking out of their hair, were known as men of (trouble)\u2014the implication being that if trouble arose, they would reinstate peace and order.\nIt is also of significance to the Zulu people, whose kings and warriors wore a single or many feathers as a headdress.\nBecause of the association with warriors and heroism, the Isitwalandwe Medal was created to honour those who had \"made an outstanding contribution and sacrifice to the liberation struggle\", that is, those who resisted the apartheid regime in South Africa (1949\u20131991) in various ways. Isitwalandwe means \"the one who wears the plumes of the rare bird\", or blue crane.\nThe blue crane is also the national bird of South Africa.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

He became a founding member of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) and eventually became the leader of the Parcham faction when the PDPA split in 1967, with their ideological nemesis being the Khalq faction. K\u0101rmal was elected to the Lower House after the 1965 parliamentary election, serving in parliament until losing his seat in the 1969 parliamentary election.\nUnder K\u0101rmal's leadership, the Parchamite PDPA participated in Mohammad Daoud Khan's rise to power in 1973, and his subsequent regime. While relations were good at the beginning, Daoud began a major purge of leftist influence in the mid-1970s. This in turn led to the reformation of the PDPA in 1977, and K\u0101rmal played a role in the 1978 Saur Revolution when the PDPA took power. K\u0101rmal was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a PDPA Central Committee meeting voted in favor of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which Hafizullah Amin, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. K\u0101rmal survived this purge but was exiled to Prague and eventually dismissed from his post. Instead of returning to Kabul, he feared for his life and lived with his family in the forests protected by the Czechoslovak secret police StB. The Afghan secret police KHAD had allegedly sent members to Czechoslovakia to assassinate K\u0101rmal. In late 1979 he was brought to Moscow by the KGB and eventually, in December 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan (with the consent of Amin's government) to stabilize the country. The Soviet troops staged a coup and assassinated Amin, replacing him with K\u0101rmal.\nK\u0101rmal was promoted to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers in December 1979. He remained in the latter office until 1981, when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Keshtmand. Throughout his term, K\u0101rmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the \"Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan\", introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Taraki's and Amin's rule. He also replaced the red Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people and the Afghan mujahidin rebels, and he was widely seen as a Soviet puppet amongst the populace. These policy failures, and the stalemate that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become highly critical of K\u0101rmal's leadership. Under Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union deposed K\u0101rmal in 1986 and replaced him with Mohammad Najibullah. After losing power, he was exiled to Moscow. It was Anahita Ratebzad who persuaded Najibullah to allow Babrak K\u0101rmal to return to Afghanistan in 1991, where K\u0101rmal became an associate of Abdul Rashid Dostum and possibly helped remove the Najibullah government from power in 1992. He eventually left Afghanistan again for Moscow. In 1996, K\u0101rmal died from liver cancer.\nEarly life and career.\nK\u0101rmal was born Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929 in Kamari, a village in Kabul. He was the son of Muhammad Hussein, a \"dagar jenral\" (lieutenant general, three-star rank) in the Royal Afghan Army and former governor of Paktia and Herat provinces, and was the first of six siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background was publicly disputed, with some sources claiming he was Pashtun and that he was Tajik while some other sources claim that he was of Kashmiri origin. Throughout his tenure in the Afghan Parliament, Karmal strategically sowed confusion by alternately identifying himself as Pashtun and Tajik, demonstrating a deliberate avoidance of strict ethnic categorization. K\u0101rmal's ethnicity was a subject of persistent dispute, with conflicting claims made by Pashtun sympathizers and affiliates asserting that he belonged to the \"Mullahkhel\" Kakar or Khilji tribe of Khost and Paktia as a Pashtun, while Tajik sympathizers and affiliates insisted that he was a Tajik. Although Karmal was only Pashtun Mullahkhel by maternal lineage which itself was Persianised, it is important to note that during and after the Cold War, many English language sources tended to categorize him as a Tajik, often with the intention of discrediting him and providing a rationale for the Russians' decision to oust him from power for not being Pashtun.\nHe attended Nejat High School, a German-speaking school, and graduated from it in 1948, and applied to enter the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Kabul University. Karmal's application was initially denied admission to Kabul University because of his student political activist and his openly leftist views. He was always a charismatic speaker and became involved in the student union and the Wikh-i-Zalmayan (Awakened Youth Movement), a progressive and leftist organization. He studied at the College of Law and Political Science at Kabul University from 1951 to 1953. In 1953 Karmal was arrested because of his student union activities, but was released three years later in 1956 in an amnesty by Muhammad Daoud Khan. Shortly after, in 1957, Karmal found work as an English and German translator, before quitting and leaving for military training. Karmal graduated from the College of Law and Political Science in 1960, and in 1961, he found work as an employee in the Compilation and Translation Department of the Ministry of Education. From 1961 to 1963 he worked in the Ministry of Planning. When his mother died, Karmal left with his maternal aunt to live somewhere else. His father disowned him because of his leftist views. Karmal was involved in much debauchery, which was controversial in the mostly conservative Afghan society.\nCommunist politics.\nImprisoned from 1953 to 1956, Karmal befriended fellow inmate Mir Akbar Khyber, who introduced Karmal to Marxism. Karmal changed his name from Sultan Hussein to Babrak Karmal, which means \"Comrade of the Workers'\" in Pashto, to disassociate himself from his bourgeois background. When he was released from prison, he continued his activities in the student union, and began to promote Marxism. Karmal spent the rest of the 1950s and the early 1960s becoming involved with Marxist organizations, of which there were at least four in Afghanistan at the time; two of the four were established by Karmal. When the 1964 Afghan Provisional Constitution, which legalised the establishment of new political entities, was introduced several prominent Marxists agreed to establish a communist political party. The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA, the Communist Party) was established in January 1965 in Nur Muhammad Taraki's home. Factionalism within the PDPA quickly became a problem; the party split into the Khalq led by Taraki alongside Hafizullah Amin, and the Parcham led by Karmal.\nDuring the 1965 parliamentary election Karmal was one of four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were Anahita Ratebzad (whom he would later have an affair with according to Vasili Mitrokhin), Nur Ahmed Nur and Fezanul Haq Fezan. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by the simple fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership. In 1966 inside parliament, Karmal was physically assaulted by an Islamist MP, Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi.\nIn 1967, the PDPA unofficially split into two formal parties, one Khalqist and one Parchamist. The dissolution of the PDPA was initiated by the closing down of the Khalqist newspaper, \"Khalq\". Karmal criticised the \"Khalq\" for being too communist, and believed that its leadership should have hidden its Marxist orientation instead of promoting it. According to the official version of events, the majority of the PDPA Central Committee rejected Karmal's criticism. The vote was a close one, and it is reported that Taraki expanded the Central Committee to win the vote; this plan resulted in eight of the new members becoming politically unaligned with and one switching to the Parchamite side. Karmal and half the PDPA Central Committee left the PDPA to establish a Parchamite-led PDPA. Officially the split was caused by ideological differences, but the party may have divided between the different leadership styles and plans of Taraki versus Karmal. Taraki wanted to model the party after Leninist norms while Karmal wanted to establish a democratic front. Other differences were socioeconomic. The majority of Khalqists came from rural areas; hence they were poorer, and were of Pashtun origin. The Parchamites were urban, richer, and spoke Dari more often than not. The Khalqists accused the Parchamites of having a connection with the monarchy, and because of it, referred to the Parchamite PDPA as the \"Royal Communist Party\". Both Karmal and Amin retained their seats in the lower house of parliament in the 1969 parliamentary election.\nThe Daoud era.\nMohammed Daoud Khan, in collaboration with the Parchamite PDPA and radical military officers, overthrew the monarchy and instituted the Republic of Afghanistan in 1973. After Daoud's seizure of power, an American embassy cable stated that the new government had established a Soviet-style Central Committee, in which Karmal and Mir Akbar Khyber were given leading positions. Most ministries were given to Parchamites; Hassan Sharq became Deputy Prime Minister, Major Faiz Mohammad became Minister of Internal Affairs and Niamatullah Pazhwak became Minister of Education. The Parchamites took control over the ministries of finance, agriculture, communications and border affairs. The new government quickly suppressed the opposition, and secured their power base. At first, the National Front government between Daoud and the Parchamites seemed to work. By 1975, Daoud had strengthened his position by enhancing the executive, legislative and judicial powers of the Presidency. To the dismay of the Parchamites, all parties other than the National Revolutionary Party (NRP, established by Daoud) were made illegal.\nShortly after the ban on opposition to the NRP, Daoud began a massive purge of Parchamites in government. Mohammad lost his position as interior minister, Abdul Qadir was demoted, and Karmal was put under government surveillance. To mitigate Daoud's suddenly anti-communist directives, the Soviet Union reestablished the PDPA; Taraki was elected its General Secretary and Karmal, Second Secretary. While the Saur Revolution (literally the April Revolution) was planned for August, the assassination of Khyber led to a chain of events which ended with the communists seizing power. Karmal, when taking power in 1979, accused Amin of ordering the assassination of Khyber.\nTaraki\u2013Amin rule.\nTaraki was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, retaining his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government which consisted of both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers.Mohammad Aslam Watanjar became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and Mohammad Rafi, became Minister of Defence and Minister of Public Works, respectively. The appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar led to splits within the Council of Ministers: the Khalqists answered to Amin; Karmal led the civilian Parchamites; and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar (a Khalqist). The first conflict arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to military officers who had participated in the Saur Revolution; Karmal opposed such a move but was overruled. A PDPA Politburo meeting voted in favour of giving Central Committee membership to the officers.\nOn 27 June, three months after the Saur Revolution, Amin outmaneuvered the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting, giving the Khalqists exclusive right over formulating and deciding policy. A purge against the Parchamites was initiated by Amin and supported by Taraki on 1 July 1979. Karmal, fearing for his safety, went into hiding in one of his Soviet friends' homes. Karmal tried to contact Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, to talk about the situation. Puzanov refused, and revealed Karmal's location to Amin. The Soviets probably saved Karmal's life by sending him to the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia. In exile, Karmal established a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for 4 September 1979. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir and the Army Chief of Staff General Shahpur Ahmedzai. The coup was planned for the Festival of Eid, in anticipation of relaxed military vigilance. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. Another purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled. Few returned to Afghanistan; Karmal and Mohammad Najibullah stayed in their respective countries. The Soviets decided that Amin should be removed to make way for a Karmal-Taraki coalition government. However Amin managed to order the arrest and later the murder of Taraki.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One of the dirty faces who for years under the false revolutionary mask and false slogans wanted to seduce the youth was Babrak Karmal, a product of tyrannical and despotic rule of Daoud, the unprecedented hangman of history.\u2014\u200a\nAmin was informed of the Soviet decision to intervene in Afghanistan and was initially supportive, but was assassinated. Under the command of the Soviets, Karmal ascended to power. On 27 December 1979, Karmal's pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people was broadcast via Radio Kabul from Tashkent in the Uzbek SSR (the radio wavelength was changed to that of Kabul), saying: \"Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed, his accomplices \u2013 the primitive executioners, usurpers and murderers of tens of thousand of our fellow countrymen \u2013 fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters, children and old people\u00a0...\" Karmal was not in Kabul when the speech was broadcast; he was in Bagram, protected by the KGB.\nThat evening Yuri Andropov, the KGB Chairman, congratulated Karmal on his rise to the Chairmanship of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council, some time before Karmal received an official appointment. Karmal returned to Kabul on 28 December. He travelled alongside a Soviet military column. For the next few days Karmal lived in a villa on the outskirts of Kabul under the protection of the KGB. On 1 January 1980 Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Alexei Kosygin, the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, congratulated Karmal on his \"election\" as leader.\nLeadership.\nDomestic policies.\nKarmal's ascension was quickly troubled as he was effectively installed by the invading Soviet Union, delegitimizing him. Unrest in the country quickly escalated, and in Kabul two major uprisings, on 3 Hoot (22 February) and the months long students' protests were early signs of trouble. Karmal would also arrest Major Saddiq Alamyar in 1980, the commander of the 444th Commando Battalion, who committed the Kerala massacre while Afghanistan was still under the leadership of the Khalq. Other perpetrators were also arrested, such as other commandos and soldiers in the 11th Division of the Afghan Army. Alamyar remained in jail for a decade, even after Karmal was removed from his post as president.\nThe \"Fundamental Principles\" and amnesty.\nWhen he came to power, Karmal promised an end to executions, the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections, the creation of a constitution, and legalization of alternative political parties. Prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general amnesty (which occurred on 6 January). He promised the creation of a coalition government which would not espouse socialism. At the same time, he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic, military and political assistance. The mistrust most Afghans felt towards the government was a problem for Karmal. Many still remembered he had said he would protect private capital in 1978\u2014a promise later proven to be a lie.\nKarmal's three most important promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the adoption of a new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, with the exception of the general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.\nWork on the Fundamental Principles had started under Amin: it guaranteed democratic rights such as freedom of speech, the right to security and life, the right to peaceful association, the right to demonstrate and the right that \"no one would be accused of crime but in accord with the provisions of law\" and that the accused had the right to a fair trial. The Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of PDPA Politburo members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy where man was free. Another clause stated that the state had the right to take \"families, both parents and children, under its supervision.\" While it looked democratic at the outset, the Fundamental Principles was based on contradictions.\nThe Fundamental Principles led to the establishment of two important state organs: the Special Revolutionary Court, a specialized court for crimes against national security and territorial integrity, and the Institute for Legal and Scientific Research and Legislative Affairs, the supreme legislative organ of state, This body could amend and draft laws, and introduce regulations and decrees on behalf of the government. The introduction of more Soviet-style institutions led the Afghan people to distrust the communist government even more.\nThe Fundamental Principles constitution came into power on 22 April 1980.\nDividing power: Khalq\u2013Parcham.\nWith K\u0101rmal's ascension to power, Parchamites began to \"settle old scores\". Revolutionary Troikas were created to arrest, sentence and execute people. Amin's guard were the first victims of the terror which ensued. Those commanders who had stayed loyal to Amin were arrested, filling the prisons. The Soviets protested, and K\u0101rmal replied, \"As long as you keep my hands bound and do not let me deal with the Khalq faction there will be no unity in the PDPA and the government cannot become strong\u00a0... They tortured and killed us. They still hate us! They are the enemies of the party\u00a0...\" Amin's daughter, along with her baby, was imprisoned for twelve years, until Mohammad Najibullah, then leader of the PDPA, released her. When Karmal took power, leading posts in the Party and Government bureaucracy were taken over by Parchamites. The Khalq faction was removed from power, and only technocrats, opportunists and individuals which the Soviets trusted would be appointed to the higher echelons of government. Khalqists remained in control of the Ministry of Interior, but Parchamites were given control over KHAD and the secret police. The Parchamites and the Khalqists controlled an equal share of the military. Two out of Karmal's three Council of Ministers deputy chairmen were Khalqists. Khalqists controlled the Ministry of Communications and the interior ministry. Parchamites, on the other hand, controlled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. In addition to the changes in government, the Parchamites held clear majority in the PDPA Central Committee. Only one Khalqi, Saleh Mohammad Zeary, was a member of the PDPA Secretariat during Karmal's rule.\nOver 14 and 15 March 1982 the PDPA held a party \"conference\" at the Kabul Polytechnic Institute instead of a party \"congress\", since a party congress would have given the Khalq faction a majority and could have led to a Khalqist takeover of the PDPA. The rules of holding a party conference were different, and the Parchamites had a three-fifths majority. This infuriated several Khalqists; the threat of expulsion did not lessen their anger. The conference was not successful, but it was portrayed as such by the official media. The conference broke up after one and a half days of a 3-day long program, because of the inter-party struggle for power between the Khalqists and the Parchamites. A \"program of action\" was introduced, and party rules were given minor changes. As an explanation of the low party membership, the official media also made it seem hard to become a member of the party.\nPDPA base.\nWhen Karmal took power, he began expanding the support base of the PDPA. Karmal tried to persuade certain groups, which had been referred to class enemies of the revolution during Taraki and Amin's rule, to support the PDPA. Karmal appointed several non-communists to top positions. Between March and May 1980, 78 out of the 191 people appointed to government posts were not members of the PDPA. Karmal reintroduced the old Afghan custom of having an Islamic invocation every time the government issued a proclamation. In his first live speech to the Afghan people, Karmal called for the establishment of the National Fatherland Front (NFF); the NFF's founding congress was held in June 1981. Unfortunately for Karmal, his policies did not lead to a notable increase in support for his regime, and it did not help Karmal that most Afghans saw the Soviet intervention as an invasion.\nBy 1981, the government gave up on political solutions to the conflict. At the fifth PDPA Central Committee plenum in June, Karmal resigned from his Council of Ministers chairmanship and was replaced by Sultan Ali Keshtmand, while Nur Ahmad Nur was given a bigger role in the Revolutionary Council. This was seen as \"base broadening\". The previous weight given to non-PDPA members in top positions ceased to be an important matter in the media by June 1981. This was significant, considering that up to five members of the Revolutionary Council were non-PDPA members. By the end of 1981, the previous contenders, who had been heavily presented in the media, were all gone; two were given ambassadorships, two ceased to be active in politics, and one continued as an advisor to the government. The other three changed sides, and began to work for the opposition.\nThe national policy of reconciliation continued: in January 1984 the land reform introduced by Taraki and Amin was drastically modified, the limits of landholdings were increased to win the support of middle class peasants, the literacy programme was continued, and concessions to women were made. In 1985 the Loya Jirga was reconvened. The 1985 Loya Jirga was followed by a tribal jirga in September. In 1986 Abdul Rahim Hatef, a non-PDPA member, was elected to the NFF chairmanship. During the 1985\u201386 elections it was said that 60 percent of the elected officials were non-PDPA members. By the end of Karmal's rule, several non-PDPA members had high-level government positions.\nCivil war and military.\nIn March 1979, the military budget was 6.4\u00a0million US$, which was 8.3 percent of the government budget, but only 2.2 of gross national product. After the Soviet intervention, the defence budget increased to 208 million US$ in 1980, and 325\u00a0million US$ by 1981. In 1982 it was reported that the government spent around 22 percent of total expenditure.\nWhen the political solution failed (see \"PDPA base\" section), the Afghan government and the Soviet military decided to solve the conflict militarily. The change from a political to a military solution did not come suddenly. It began in January 1981, as Karmal doubled wages for military personnel, issued several promotions, and decorated one general and thirteen colonels. The draft age was lowered, the obligatory length of arms duty was extended and the age for reservists was increased to thirty-five years of age. In June 1981, Assadullah Sarwari lost his seat in the PDPA Politburo, replaced by Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, a former tank commander and Minister of Communications, Major General Mohammad Rafi was made Minister of Defence and Mohammad Najibullah appointed KHAD Chairman.\nThese measures were introduced due to the collapse of the army during the Soviet intervention. Before the intervention the army could field 100,000 troops, after the intervention only 25,000. Desertions were pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often drove them to the opposition. To better organize the military, seven military zones were established, each with its own Defence Council. The Defence Councils were established at the national, provincial and district level to empower the local PDPA. It is estimated that the Afghan government spent as much as 40 percent of government revenue on defense.\nKarmal additionally couldn't override Soviet influence from KhAD, the former intelligence agency of Afghanistan, despite numerous attempts. In 1983, two members of the Afghan Mellat party were arrested and their leader dissolved the organisation and agreed to support the government, leading Karmal to order KhAD to release them without trial. The agency, however, ignored Karmal's orders and the prisoners were tried and sentenced. Karmal sent a letter personally ordering the release of the two Afghan Mellat members, but this too had no effect. Karmal also demanded the release of five detained university professors before their trial, but his orders were ignored by KhAD. Despite this, KhAD served as Karmal's strongest power base and he would often visit the agency, praise it, and place his most loyal followers within it. Soviet advisors repeatedly held the true authority over the agency, and KhAD operated according to Soviet interests, not the Afghan government. Despite being the president, Karmal had no real control over KhAD.\nKarmal refused to recognize the rebels as genuine, saying in an interview:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The people of Afghanistan do not recognise [the rebels] who include a number of hired people of the reactionary circles of Pakistan, Chinese chauvinists, imperialist America and Britain, and the reactionaries of Arab countries and the Zionists, who pretend to be the representatives of Afghanistan.\nEconomy.\nDuring the civil war and the ensuing Soviet\u2013Afghan War, most of the country's infrastructure was destroyed. Normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The Gross national product (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3\u00a0billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159.7\u00a0billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounted for 63 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labor force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had grown in the pre-communist administration of Muhammad Daoud Khan, decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3\u00a0million $US. The only economic activity which grew substantially during Karmal's rule was export and import.\nForeign policy.\nKarmal observed in early 1983 that without Soviet intervention, \"It is unknown what the destiny of the Afghan Revolution would be\u00a0... We are realists and we clearly realize that in store for us yet lie trials and deprivations, losses and difficulties.\" Two weeks before this statement Sultan Ali Keshtmand, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, lamented the fact that half the schools and three-quarters of communications had been destroyed since 1979. The Soviet Union rejected several Western-made peace plans, such as the Carrington Plan, since they did not take into consideration the PDPA government. Most Western peace plans had been made in collaboration with the Afghan opposition forces. At the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, stated;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We do not object to the questions connected with Afghanistan being discussed in conjunction with the question of security in the Persian Gulf. Naturally here on only the international aspects of the Afghan problem can be discussed, not internal Afghan affairs. The sovereignty of Afghanistan must be fully protected, as must its nonaligned status.\nThe stance of the Pakistani government was clear, demanding complete Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the establishment of a non-PDPA government. Karmal, summarizing his discussions with Iran and Pakistan, said \"Iran and Pakistan have so far not opted for concrete and constructive positions.\" During Karmal's rule Afghan\u2013Pakistani relations remained hostile; the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was the catalyst for the hostile relationship. The increasing numbers of Afghan refugees in Pakistan challenged the PDPA's legitimacy to rule.\nThe Soviet Union threatened in 1985 that it would support the Baloch separatist movement in Pakistan if the Pakistani government continued to aid the Afghan mujahideen. Karmal, problematically for the Soviets, did not want a Soviet withdrawal, and he hampered attempts to improve relations with Pakistan since the Pakistani government had refused to recognise the PDPA government.\nPublic image.\nBecause Karmal was put into power without a formal ceremony as in Afghan tradition, he was seen as an illegitimate leader in many eyes of his people. A poor performance in foreign interviews also did not help his public image where he was noted to speak like an \"exhibitionist\" rather than a statesman. Karmal was widely viewed as a puppet leader of the Soviet Union by Afghans and the Western press.\nDespite his position, Karmal was apparently not permitted to make key decisions as he was following advice from Soviet advisers. The Soviet control of the Afghan state was apparently so much that Karmal himself admitted to a friend of his unfree life, telling him: \u201cThe Soviet comrades love me boundlessly, and for the sake of my personal safety, they don't obey even my own orders.\u201d\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The hands, feet and tongue of the poor Sultan had been tied, and he had no right to speak [without permission] with his personal friends.\u2014\u200a\nFall from power and succession.\nMikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said, \"The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.\" Karmal's position became less secure when the Soviet leadership began blaming him for the failures in Afghanistan. Gorbachev, worried over the situation, told the Soviet Politburo \"If we don't change approaches [to evacuate Afghanistan], we will be fighting there for another 20 or 30 years.\" It is not clear when the Soviet leadership began to campaign for Karmal's dismissal, but Andrei Gromyko discussed the possibility of Karmal's resignation with Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1982. While it was Gorbachev who would dismiss Karmal, there may have been a consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that Karmal should resign. Gorbachev's own plan was to replace Karmal with Mohammad Najibullah, who had joined the PDPA at its creation. Najibullah was thought highly of by Yuri Andropov, Boris Ponomarev and Dmitriy Ustinov, and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983. Najibullah was not the Soviet leadership's only choice for Karmal's succession; a GRU report noted that the majority of the PDPA leadership would support Assadullah Sarwari's ascension to leadership. According to the GRU, Sarwari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks; Najibullah was a Pashtun nationalist. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the Saur Revolution.\nNajibullah was appointed to the PDPA Secretariat in November 1985. During Karmal's March 1986 visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviets tried to persuade Karmal that he was too ill to govern, and that he should resign. This backfired, as a Soviet doctor attending to Karmal told him he was in good health. Karmal asked to return home to Kabul, and said that he understood and would listen to the Soviet recommendations. Before leaving, Karmal promised he would step down as PDPA General Secretary. The Soviets did not trust him and sent Vladimir Kryuchkov, the head of intelligence (FCD) in the KGB, into Afghanistan. At a meeting in Kabul, Karmal confessed his undying love for the Soviet Union, comparing his ardor to his Muslim faith. Kryuchkov, concluding that he could not persuade Karmal to resign, left the meeting. After Kryuchkov left the room, the Afghan defence minister and the state security minister visited Karmal's office, telling him that he had to resign from one of his posts. Understanding that his Soviet support had been eliminated, Karmal resigned from the office of the General Secretary at the 18th PDPA Central Committee plenum. He was succeeded in his post by Najibullah.\nKarmal still had support within the party, and used his base to curb Najibullah's powers. He began spreading rumors that he would be reappointed General Secretary. Najibullah's power base was in the KHAD, the Afghan equivalent to the KGB, and not the party. Considering the fact that the Soviet Union had supported Karmal for over six years, the Soviet leadership wanted to ease him out of power gradually. Yuli Vorontsov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, told Najibullah to begin undermining Karmal's power slowly. Najibullah complained to the Soviet leadership that Karmal used most of his spare time looking for errors and \"speaking against the National Reconciliation programme\". At a meeting of the Soviet Politburo on 13 November 1986 it was decided that Najibullah should remove Karmal; this motion was supported by Gromyko, Vorontsov, Eduard Shevardnadze, Anatoly Dobrynin and Viktor Chebrikov. A PDPA meeting in November relieved Karmal of his Revolutionary Council chairmanship, and exiled him to Moscow where he was given a state-owned apartment and a dacha. Karmal was succeeded as Revolutionary Council chairman by Haji Mohammad Tsamkani, who was not a member of the PDPA.\nLater life and death.\nMany years after the end of his leadership, he denounced the Saur Revolution of 1978 in which he took part, taking aim at the Khalq governments of Taraki and Amin. He told a Soviet reporter:\nIt was the greatest crime against the people of Afghanistan. Parcham's leaders were against armed actions because the country was not ready for a revolution... I knew that people would not support us if we decided to keep power without such support.\nKarmal was invited back to Kabul by Najibullah, and \"for equally obscure reasons Karmal accepted\", returning on 20 June 1991 (this could have been on the recommendation of Anahita Ratebzad who was very close to Karmal and also respected by Najibullah). If Najibullah's plan was to strengthen his position within the Watan Party (the renamed PDPA) by appeasing the pro-Karmal Parchamites, he failed \u2013 Karmal's apartment became a center for opposition to Najibullah's government. When Najibullah was toppled in 1992, Karmal became the most powerful politician in Kabul through leadership of the Parcham. However, his negotiations with the rebels collapsed quickly, and on 16 April 1992 the rebels, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, took Kabul. After the fall of Najibullah's government, Karmal was based in Hairatan. There, it is alleged, Karmal used most of his time either trying to establish a new party, or advising people to join the secular National Islamic Movement (\"Junbish-i-Milli\"). Abdul Rashid Dostum, the leader of Junbish-i-Milli, was a supporter of Karmal during his rule. It is unknown how much control Karmal had over Dostum, but there is little evidence that Karmal was in any commanding position. Karmal's influence over Dostum appeared indirect \u2013 some of his former associates supported Dostum. Those who spoke with Karmal during this period noted his lack of interest in politics. In June 1992 it was reported that he had died in a plane crash along with Dostum, although these reports later proved to be false.\nIn early December 1996, Karmal died in Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital from liver cancer. The date of his death was reported by some sources as 1 December and by others as 3 December. The Taliban summed up his rule as follows:\n[he] committed all kinds of crimes during his illegitimate rule\u00a0... God inflicted on him various kinds of hardship and pain. Eventually he died of cancer in a hospital belonging to his paymasters, the Russians.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "4468", "revid": "50464812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4468", "title": "Buddhist philosophy", "text": "Buddhist philosophical tradition\nBuddhist philosophy is the ancient Indian philosophical system that developed within the religio-philosophical tradition of Buddhism. It comprises all the philosophical investigations and systems of rational inquiry that developed among various schools of Buddhism in ancient India following the \"parinirv\u0101\u1e47a\" of Gautama Buddha (c. 5th century BCE), as well as the further developments which followed the spread of Buddhism throughout Asia.\nBuddhism combines both philosophical reasoning and the practice of meditation. The Buddhist religion presents a multitude of Buddhist paths to liberation; and with the expansion of early Buddhism from ancient India to Sri Lanka and subsequently to East Asia and Southeast Asia, Buddhist thinkers have covered topics as varied as cosmology, ethics, epistemology, logic, metaphysics, ontology, phenomenology, the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of time, and soteriology in their analysis of these paths.\nPre-sectarian Buddhism was based on empirical evidence gained by the sense organs (including the mind), and the Buddha seems to have retained a skeptical distance from certain metaphysical questions, refusing to answer them because they were not conducive to liberation but led instead to further speculation. However, he was also claimed to have affirmed theories with metaphysical implications, such as dependent arising, karma, and rebirth.\nParticular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different schools of Buddhism, as well as between representative thinkers of Buddhist schools and Hindu or Jain philosophers. These elaborations and disputes gave rise to various early Buddhist schools of Abhidharma, the Mah\u0101y\u0101na movement, and scholastic traditions such as Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101, Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da, M\u0101dhyamaka, Sautr\u0101ntika, Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika, Buddha-nature, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, and more. One recurrent theme in Buddhist philosophy has been the desire to find a Middle Way between philosophical views seen as extreme.\nHistorical phases of Buddhist philosophy.\nEdward Conze splits the development of Indian Buddhist philosophy into three phases:\nVarious elements of these three phases are incorporated and/or further developed in the philosophy and worldview of the various sects of Buddhism that then emerged.\nPhilosophical orientation.\nBuddhism is an Indian religion and \"dh\u0101rma\" that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs, and spiritual practices based on teachings attributed to Gautama Buddha (5th century BCE), but diversified since then in a wide variety of schools and traditions. Buddhism originated in ancient India, from where the \"Buddhadh\u0101rma\" spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent throughout Central Asia, East Asia, Mainland Southeast Asia, and Maritime Southeast Asia. Philosophy in ancient India was aimed primarily at spiritual liberation and had soteriological goals. In his study of the M\u0101dhyamaka and Sautr\u0101ntika schools of Buddhist philosophy in ancient India, Peter Deller Santina writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Attention must first of all be drawn to the fact that philosophical systems in India were seldom, if ever, purely speculative or descriptive. Virtually all the great philosophical systems of India: S\u0101\u1e43khya, Advaita Ved\u0101nta, M\u0101dhyamaka and so forth, were preeminently concerned with providing a means to liberation or salvation. It was a tacit assumption with these systems that if their philosophy were correctly understood and assimilated, an unconditioned state free of suffering and limitation could be achieved. [...] If this fact is overlooked, as often happens as a result of the propensity engendered by formal Occidental philosophy to consider the philosophical enterprise as a purely descriptive one, the real significance of Indian and Buddhist philosophy will be missed.\nFor the Indian Buddhist philosophers, the teachings of Gautama Buddha were not meant to be taken on faith alone, but to be confirmed by logical analysis and inquiry (\"pram\u0101\u1e47a\") of the world. The early Buddhist texts mention that a person becomes a follower of the Buddha's teachings after having pondered them over with wisdom (\"j\u00f1ana\") and the gradual training also requires that a disciple \"investigate\" (\"upaparikkhati\") and \"scrutinize\" (\"tuleti\") the teachings. The Buddha also expected his disciples to approach him as a teacher in a critical fashion and scrutinize his actions and words, as shown in the \"V\u012bma\u1e43saka Sutta\".\nSome Buddhist thinkers even argued that systems of rational reflection and philosophical analysis were a central practice which was necessary for the attainment of insight during meditation. Thus, Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophers like Praj\u00f1akaragupta argue that one is not a yogi \"merely because of meditation\"; rather, one must meditate, listen to the teachings, and understand them by \"reflecting through rational inquiry\" (\"yukti-cint\u0101maya\"). Only through this method, which combined rational reflection and the practice of meditation, will the wisdom that leads to enlightenment arise.\nThe Buddha and early Buddhism.\nBuddhism is devoted primarily to awakening or enlightenment (\"bodhi\"), \"Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\" (\"blowing out\"), and liberation (\"vimok\u1e63a\") from all causes of suffering (\"du\u1e25kha\") due to the existence of sentient beings in \"sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\" (the cycle of compulsory birth, death, and rebirth) through the threefold trainings (ethical conduct, meditative absorption, and wisdom). Classical Indian Buddhism emphasized the importance of the individual's self-cultivation (through numerous spiritual practices like keeping ethical precepts, Buddhist meditation, and worship) in the process of liberation from the defilements which keep us bound to the cycle of rebirth. According to the standard Buddhist scholastic understanding, liberation arises when the proper elements (\"dh\u0101rmata\") are cultivated and when the mind has been purified of its attachment to fetters and hindrances that produce unwholesome mental factors (various called defilements, poisons, or fluxes).\nThe Buddha.\nScholarly opinion varies as to whether Gautama Buddha himself was engaged in philosophical inquiry. Siddartha Gautama (c. 5th century BCE) was a north Indian \"\u015arama\u1e47a\" (wandering ascetic), whose teachings are preserved in the P\u0101li Nikayas and in the \u0100gamas as well as in other surviving fragmentary textual collections, collectively known as the early Buddhist texts. Dating these texts is difficult, and there is disagreement on how much of this material goes back to a single religious founder. While the focus of the Buddha's teachings is about attaining the highest good of \"nirv\u0101\u1e47a\", they also contain an analysis of the source of human suffering (\"du\u1e25kha\"), the nature of personal identity (\"\u0101tman\"), and the process of acquiring knowledge (\"praj\u00f1a\") about the world.\nThe Middle Way.\nThe Buddha defined his teaching as \"the Middle Way\" (P\u0101li: \"majjhim\u0101pa\u1e6dipad\u0101\"). In the \"Dharmacakrapravartana S\u016btra\", this is used to refer to the fact that his teachings steer a middle course between the extremes of asceticism and bodily denial (as practiced by the Jains and other Indian ascetic groups) and sensual hedonism or indulgence. Many \"\u015arama\u1e47a\" ascetics of the Buddha's time placed much emphasis on a denial of the body, using practices such as fasting, to liberate the mind from the body. Gautama Buddha, however, realized that the mind was embodied and causally dependent on the body, and therefore that a malnourished body did not allow the mind to be trained and developed. Thus, Buddhism's main concern is not with luxury or poverty, but instead with the human response to circumstances.\nAnother related teaching of the historical Buddha is \"the teaching through the middle\" (\"majjhena dhamma\u1e43 desana\"), which claims to be a metaphysical middle path between the extremes of eternalism and annihilationism, as well as the extremes of existence and non-existence. This idea would become central to later Buddhist metaphysics, as all Buddhist philosophies would claim to steer a metaphysical middle course.\nBasic teachings.\nApart from the middle way, certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout these early Buddhist texts, so older studies by various scholars conclude that the Buddha must at least have taught some of these key teachings:\nAccording to N. Ross Reat, all of these doctrines are shared by the P\u0101li Canon of Therav\u0101da Buddhism and the \"\u015a\u0101listamba S\u016btra\" belonging to the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika school. A recent study by Bhikkhu Analayo concludes that the Therav\u0101din \"Majjhima Nik\u0101ya\" and the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din \"Madhyama \u0100gama\" contain mostly the same major Buddhist doctrines. Richard G. Salomon, in his study of the Gandh\u0101ran Buddhist texts (which are the earliest manuscripts containing discourses attributed to Gautama Buddha), has confirmed that their teachings are \"consistent with non-Mahayana Buddhism, which survives today in the Theravada school of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, but which in ancient times was represented by eighteen separate schools.\"\nHowever, some scholars such as Schmithausen, Vetter, and Bronkhorst argue that critical analysis reveals discrepancies among these various doctrines. They present alternative possibilities for what was taught in earliest Buddhism and question the authenticity of certain teachings and doctrines. For example, some scholars think that the doctrine of \"karma\" was not central to the teachings of the historical Buddha, while others disagree with this position. Likewise, there is scholarly disagreement on whether insight into the true nature of reality (\"praj\u00f1a\") was seen as liberating in earliest Buddhism or whether it was a later addition. according to Vetter and Bronkhorst, \"dhy\u0101na\" constituted the original \"liberating practice\", while discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development. Scholars such as Bronkhorst and Carol Anderson also think that the Four Noble Truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism but as Anderson writes \"emerged as a central teaching in a slightly later period that still preceded the final redactions of the various Buddhist canons.\"\nAccording to some scholars, the philosophical outlook of earliest Buddhism was primarily negative, in the sense that it focused on what doctrines to \"reject\" and let go of more than on what doctrines to \"accept\". Only knowledge that is useful in attaining liberation is valued. According to this theory, the cycle of philosophical upheavals that in part drove the diversification of Buddhism into its many schools and sects only began once Buddhists began attempting to make explicit the implicit philosophy of the Buddha and the early texts.\nThe Four Noble Truths and dependent causation.\nThe Four Noble Truths or \"Truths of the Noble One\" are a central feature to the teachings of the historical Buddha and are put forth in the \"Dharmacakrapravartana S\u016btra\". The first truth of \"du\u1e25kha\", often translated as \"suffering\", is the inherent and eternal unsatisfactoriness of life. This unpleasantness is said to be not just physical pain and psychological distress, but also a kind of existential unease caused by the inevitable facts of our mortality and ultimately by the impermanence of all beings and phenomena.\nSuffering also arises because of contact with unpleasant events, and due to not getting what one desires. The second truth is that this unease arises out of conditions, mainly craving (\"ta\u1e47h\u0101\") and ignorance (\"avidy\u0101\"). The third truth is then the fact that whenever sentient beings let go of craving and remove ignorance through insight and knowledge, suffering ceases (\"nirodh\u0101\"). The fourth truth is the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of eight practices that end suffering. They are: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right \"sam\u0101dhi\" (concentration, mental unification, meditation). The highest good and ultimate goal taught by the historical Buddha, which is the attainment of \"nirv\u0101\u1e47a\", literally means \"extinguishing\" and signified \"the complete extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion (i.e. ignorance), the forces which power \"sa\u1e43s\u0101ra\"\".\n\"Nirv\u0101\u1e47a\" also means that after an enlightened being's death, there is no further rebirth. In earliest Buddhism, the concept of dependent origination (\"prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da\") was most likely limited to processes of mental conditioning and not to all physical phenomena. Gautama Buddha understood the world in procedural terms, not in terms of things or substances. His theory posits a flux of events arising under certain conditions which are interconnected and dependent, such that the processes in question at no time are considered to be static or independent. Craving (\"ta\u1e47h\u0101\"), for example, is always dependent on, and caused by sensations gained by the sense organs (\"\u0101yatana\"). Sensations are always dependent on contact with our surroundings. Buddha's causal theory is simply descriptive: \"This existing, that exists; this arising, that arises; this not existing, that does not exist; this ceasing, that ceases.\" This understanding of causation as \"impersonal lawlike causal ordering\" is important because it shows how the processes that give rise to suffering work, and also how they can be reversed.\nThe removal of suffering that stemmed from ignorance (\"avidy\u0101\"), then, requires a deep understanding of the nature of reality (\"praj\u00f1a\"). While philosophical analysis of arguments and concepts is clearly necessary to develop this understanding, it is not enough to remove our unskillful mental habits and deeply ingrained prejudices, which require meditation, paired with understanding. According to the Buddha's teachings as recorded in the Gandh\u0101ran Buddhist texts, we need to train the mind in meditation to be able to truly comprehend the nature of reality, which is said to have the Three marks of existence: suffering, impermanence, and non-self (\"an\u0101tman\"). Understanding and meditation are said to work together to clearly see (\"vipassan\u0101\") the nature of human experience and this is said to lead to liberation.\nNon-self.\nGautama Buddha argued that compounded entities and sentient beings lacked essence, correspondingly the self is without essence (\"an\u0101tman\"). This means there is no part of a person which is unchanging and essential for continuity, and it means that there is no individual \"part of the person that accounts for the identity of that person over time\". This is in opposition to the Upanishadic concept of an unchanging ultimate self (\"\u0101tman\") and any view of an eternal soul. The Buddha held that attachment to the appearance of a permanent self in this world of change is the cause of suffering (\"du\u1e25kha\"), and the main obstacle to the attainment of spiritual liberation (\"mok\u1e63a\").\nThe most widely used argument that the Buddha employed against the idea of an unchanging ego is an empiricist one, based on the observation of the five aggregates of existence (\"skandh\u0101\") that constitute a sentient being, and the fact that these are always changing. This argument can be put in this way:\nIP [There is no more to the person than the five aggregates of existence.] \n\u2234 There is no self.\nThis argument requires the implied premise that the five aggregates are an exhaustive account of what makes up a person, or else the self could exist outside of these aggregates. This premise is affirmed in other Buddhist texts, such as \"Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya\" 22.47, which states: \"whatever ascetics and brahmins regard various kinds of things as self, all regard the five grasping aggregates, or one of them.\"\nThis argument is famously expounded in the \"An\u0101tmalak\u1e63a\u1e47a S\u016btra\". According to this text, the apparently fixed self is merely the result of identification with the temporary aggregates of existence (\"skandh\u0101\"), the changing processes making up an individual human being. In this view, a 'person' is only a convenient nominal designation on a certain grouping of processes and characteristics, and an 'individual' is a conceptual construction overlaid upon a stream of experiences, just like a chariot is merely a conventional designation for the parts of a chariot and how they are put together. The foundation of this argument is purely empiricist, for it is based on the fact that all we observe is subject to change, especially everything observed when looking inwardly in meditation.\nAnother argument supporting the doctrine of non-self, the \"argument from lack of control\", is based on the fact that we often seek to change certain parts of ourselves, that the \"executive function\" of the mind is that which finds certain things unsatisfactory and attempts to alter them. Furthermore, it is also based on the \"anti-reflexivity principle\" of Indian philosophy, which states an entity cannot operate on or control itself (a knife can cut other things but not itself, a finger can point at other things but not at itself, etc.). This means then, that the self could never desire to change itself and could not do so; another reason for this is that, besides Buddhism, in the orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy the unchanging ultimate self (\"\u0101tman\") is perfectly blissful and does not suffer. The historical Buddha used this idea to attack the concept of self. This argument could be structured thus:\nIP [There is no more to the person than the five aggregates of existence.]\n\u2234 There is no self.\nThis argument then denies that there is one permanent \"controller\" in the person. Instead, it views the person as a set of constantly changing processes which include volitional events seeking change and an awareness of that desire for change. According to Mark Siderits:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;What the Buddhist has in mind is that on one occasion one part of the person might perform the executive function, on another occasion another part might do so. This would make it possible for every part to be subject to control without there being any part that always fills the role of the controller (and so is the self). On some occasions, a given part might fall on the controller side, while on other occasions it might fall on the side of the controlled. This would explain how it's possible for us to seek to change any of the skandhas while there is nothing more to us than just those skandhas.\nAs noted by K.R. Norman and Richard Gombrich, the Buddha extended his non-self critique to the Brahmanical belief expounded in the \"Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\" that the unchanging ultimate self (\"\u0101tman\") was indeed the whole world, or identical with Brahman. This concept is illustrated in the \"Alagaddupama S\u016btra\", where the Buddha argues that an individual cannot experience the suffering of the entire world. He used the example of someone carrying off and burning grass and sticks from the Jeta grove and how a monk would not sense or consider themselves harmed by that action. In this example, the Buddha is arguing that we do not have direct experience of the entire world, and hence the self cannot be the whole world. In this Buddhist text, as well as in the \"Soatt\u0101 S\u016btra\", the Buddha outlines six wrong views about self:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There are six wrong views: An unwise, untrained person may think of the body, 'This is mine, this is me, this is my self'; he may think that of feelings; of perceptions; of volitions; or of what has been seen, heard, thought, cognized, reached, sought or considered by the mind. The sixth is to identify the world and self, to believe: 'At death, I shall become permanent, eternal, unchanging, and so remain forever the same; and that is mine, that is me, that is my self.' A wise and well-trained person sees that all these positions are wrong, and so he is not worried about something that does not exist.\nFurthermore, Gautama Buddha argued that the world can be observed to be a cause of suffering (Brahman was held to be ultimately blissful in the orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy) and that since we cannot control the world as we wish, the world cannot be the self. The idea that \"this cosmos is the self\" is one of the six wrong views rejected by the historical Buddha, along with the related monistic Hindu theology which held that \"everything is a Oneness\" (SN 12.48 \"Lokayatika Sutta\"). The historical Buddha also held that understanding and seeing the truth of non-self led to un-attachment, and hence to the cessation of suffering, while ignorance (\"avidy\u0101\") about the true nature of personality (\"praj\u00f1a\") led to further suffering and attachment.\nEpistemology.\nAll schools of Indian philosophy recognize various sets of valid justifications for knowledge (\"pram\u0101\u1e47a\") and many see the Vedas as providing access to truth. The historical Buddha denied the authority of the Vedas, though, like his contemporaries, he affirmed the soteriological importance of holding the right view; that is, having a proper understanding of reality. However, this understanding was not conceived primarily as metaphysical and cosmological knowledge, but as a piece of knowledge into the arising and cessation of suffering in human experience. Therefore, the Buddha's epistemic project is different from that of modern philosophy; it is primarily a solution to the fundamental human spiritual/existential problem.\nGautama Buddha's logico-epistemology has been compared to empiricism, in the sense that it was based on the experience of the world through the senses. The Buddha taught that empirical observation through the six sense fields (\"\u0101yatan\u0101\") was the proper way of verifying any knowledge claims. Some Buddhist texts go further, stating that \"the All\", or everything that exists (\"sabbam\"), are these six sense spheres (SN 35.23, \"Sabba Sutta\") and that anyone who attempts to describe another \"All\" will be unable to do so because \"it lies beyond range\". This text seems to indicate that for the Buddha, things in themselves or noumena are beyond our epistemological reach (\"avisaya\").\nFurthermore, in the \"K\u0101l\u0101ma Sutta\" the Buddha tells a group of confused villagers that the only proper reason for one's beliefs is verification in one's own personal experience (and the experience of the wise) and denies any verification which stems from a personal authority, sacred tradition (\"anussava\"), or any kind of rationalism which constructs metaphysical theories (\"takka\"). In the \"Tevijja Sutta\" (DN 13), the Buddha rejects the personal authority of Brahmins because none of them can prove they have had personal experience of Brahman, nor could any of them prove its existence. The Buddha also stressed that experience is the only criterion for verification of the truth in this passage from the \"Majjhima Nik\u0101ya\" (MN.I.265):\n\"Monks, do you only speak that which is known by yourselves seen by yourselves, found by yourselves?\" \n\"Yes, we do, sir.\" \n\"Good, monks, That is how you have been instructed by me in this timeless doctrine which can be realized and verified, that leads to the goal and can be understood by those who are intelligent.\"\nFurthermore, the Buddha's standard for personal verification was a pragmatic and salvific one, for the Buddha a belief counts as truth only if it leads to successful Buddhist practice (and hence, to the destruction of craving). In the \"Discourse to Prince Abhaya\" (MN.I.392\u20134) the Buddha states this pragmatic maxim by saying that a belief should only be accepted if it leads to wholesome consequences. This tendency of the Buddha to see what is true as what was useful or \"what works\" has been called by Western scholars such as Mrs Rhys Davids and Vall\u00e9e-Poussin a form of pragmatism. However, K. N. Jayatilleke argues the Buddha's epistemology can also be taken to be a form of correspondence theory (as per the \"Apannaka Sutta\") with elements of coherentism, and that for the Buddha it is causally impossible for something which is false to lead to cessation of suffering and evil.\nGautama Buddha discouraged his disciples and early followers of Buddhism from indulging in intellectual disputation for its own sake, which is fruitless, and distracts one from the ultimate goals of awakening (\"bodhi\") and liberation (\"mok\u1e63a\"). Only philosophy and discussion which has pragmatic value for liberation from suffering is seen as important. According to the P\u0101li Canon, during his lifetime the Buddha remained silent when asked several metaphysical questions which he regarded as the basis for \"unwise reflection\". These \"unanswered questions\" (\"avy\u0101k\u1e5bta\") regarded issues such as whether the universe is eternal or non-eternal (or whether it is finite or infinite), the unity or separation of the body and the self (\"\u0101tman\"), the complete inexistence of a person after death and \"nirv\u0101\u1e47a\", and others. In the \"Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta\", the historical Buddha stated that thinking about these imponderable issues led to \"a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views\".\nOne explanation for this pragmatic suspension of judgment or epistemic Epoch\u00e9 is that such questions contribute nothing to the practical methods of realizing awakeness during one's lifetime and bring about the danger of substituting the experience of liberation by a conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith. According to the Buddha, the \"Dharma\" is not an ultimate end in itself or an explanation of all metaphysical reality, but a pragmatic set of teachings. The Buddha used two parables to clarify this point, the 'Parable of the raft' and the Parable of the Poisoned Arrow. The \"Dharma\" is like a raft in the sense that it is only a pragmatic tool for attaining nirvana (\"for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto\", MN 22); once one has done this, one can discard the raft. It is also like medicine, in that the particulars of how one was injured by a poisoned arrow (i.e. metaphysics, etc.) do not matter in the act of removing and curing the arrow wound itself (removing suffering). In this sense, the Buddha was often called \"the great physician\" because his goal was to cure the human condition of suffering first and foremost, not to speculate about metaphysics.\nHaving said this, it is still clear that resisting and even refuting a false or slanted doctrine can be useful to extricate the interlocutor, or oneself, from error; hence, to advance in the way of liberation. Witness the Buddha's confutation of several doctrines by Nigantha Nataputta and other purported sages which sometimes had large followings (e.g., Kula Sutta, Sankha Sutta, Brahmana Sutta). This shows that a virtuous and appropriate use of dialectics can take place. By implication, reasoning and argument shouldn't be disparaged by Buddhists.\nAfter the Buddha's death, some Buddhists such as Dharmakirti went on to use the sayings of the Buddha as sound evidence equal to perception and inference.\nTranscendence.\nAnother possible reason why the Buddha refused to engage in metaphysics is that he saw ultimate reality and nirvana as devoid of sensory mediation and conception and therefore language itself is \"a priori\" inadequate to explain it. Thus, the Buddha's silence does not indicate misology or disdain for philosophy. Rather, it indicates that he viewed the answers to these questions as not understandable by the unenlightened. Dependent arising provides a framework for analysis of reality that is not based on metaphysical assumptions regarding existence or non-existence, but instead on direct cognition of phenomena as they are presented to the mind in meditation.\nThe Buddha of the earliest Buddhists texts describes Dharma (in the sense of \"truth\") as \"beyond reasoning\" or \"transcending logic\", in the sense that reasoning is a subjectively introduced aspect of the way unenlightened humans perceive things, and the conceptual framework which underpins their cognitive process, rather than a feature of things as they really are. Going \"beyond reasoning\" means in this context penetrating the nature of reasoning from the inside, and removing the causes for experiencing any future stress as a result of it, rather than functioning outside the system as a whole.\nMeta-ethics.\nThe Buddha's ethics are based on the soteriological need to eliminate suffering and on the premise of the law of karma. Buddhist ethics have been termed eudaimonic (with their goal being well-being) and also compared to virtue ethics (this approach began with Damien Keown). Keown writes that Buddhist Nirvana is analogous to the Aristotelian Eudaimonia, and that Buddhist moral acts and virtues derive their value from how they lead us to or act as an aspect of the nirvanic life.\nThe Buddha outlined five precepts (no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, or drinking alcohol) which were to be followed by his disciples, lay and monastic. There are various reasons the Buddha gave as to why someone should be ethical.\nFirst, the universe is structured in such a way that if someone intentionally commits a misdeed, a bad karmic fruit will be the result. Hence, from a pragmatic point of view, it is best to abstain from these negative actions which bring forth negative results. However, the important word here is \"intentionally\": for the Buddha, karma is nothing else but intention/volition, and hence unintentionally harming someone does not create bad karmic results. Unlike the Jains who believed that karma was a quasi-physical element, for the Buddha karma was a volitional mental event, what Richard Gombrich calls \"an ethicised consciousness\".\nThis idea leads into the second moral justification of the Buddha: intentionally performing negative actions reinforces and propagates mental defilements which keep persons bound to the cycle of rebirth and interfere with the process of liberation, and hence intentionally performing good karmic actions is participating in mental purification which leads to nirvana, the highest happiness. This perspective sees immoral acts as unskillful (\"akusala\") in our quest for happiness, and hence it is pragmatic to do good.\nThe third meta-ethical consideration takes the view of not-self and our natural desire to end our suffering to its logical conclusion. Since there is no self, there is no reason to prefer our own welfare over that of others because there is no ultimate grounding for the differentiation of \"my\" suffering and someone else's. Instead, an enlightened person would just work to end suffering \"tout court\", without thinking of the conventional concept of persons. According to this argument, anyone who is selfish does so out of ignorance of the true nature of personal identity and irrationality.\nBuddhist schools and Abhidharma.\nThe main Indian Buddhist philosophical schools practiced a form of analysis termed \"Abhidharma\" which sought to systematize the teachings of the early Buddhist discourses (sutras). Abhidharma analysis broke down human experience into momentary phenomenal events or occurrences called \"dharmas\". Dharmas are impermanent and dependent on other causal factors, they arise and pass as part of a web of other interconnected dharmas, and are never found alone. The Abhidharma schools held that the teachings of the Buddha in the sutras were merely conventional, while the Abhidharma analysis was ultimate truth (paramattha sacca), the way things really are when seen by an enlightened being. The Abhidharmic project has been likened as a form of phenomenology or process philosophy.\nAbhidharma philosophers not only outlined what they believed to be an exhaustive listing of \"dharmas\" (Pali: dhammas), which are the ultimate phenomena, events or processes (and include physical and mental phenomena), but also the causal relations between them. In the Abhidharmic analysis, the only thing which is ultimately real is the interplay of dharmas in a causal stream; everything else is merely conceptual (\"pa\u00f1\u00f1atti\") and nominal.\nThis view has been termed \"mereological reductionism\" by Mark Siderits because it holds that only impartite entities are real, not wholes. Abhidharmikas such as Vasubandhu argued that conventional things (tables, persons, etc.) \"disappear under analysis\" and that this analysis reveals only a causal stream of phenomenal events and their relations. The mainstream Abhidharmikas defended this view against their main Hindu rivals, the Nyaya school, who were substance theorists and posited the existence of universals. Some Abhidharmikas such as the Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da were also strict nominalists, and held that all things - even dharmas - were merely conceptual.\nThe Abhidharma schools.\nAn important Abhidhamma work from the Therav\u0101da school is the \"Kath\u0101vatthu\" (\"Points of controversy\"), attributed to the Indian scholar-monk Moggaliputta-Tissa (c.\u2009327\u2013247 BCE). This text is important because it attempts to refute several philosophical views which had developed after the death of the Buddha, especially the theory that 'all exists' (\"sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\"), the theory of momentariness (\"kh\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da\") and the personalist view (\"pudgalavada\"). These were the major philosophical theories that divided the Buddhist Abhidharma schools in India.\nAfter being brought to Sri Lanka in the first century BCE, the Pali language Theravada Abhidhamma tradition was heavily influenced by the works of Buddhaghosa (4-5th century AD), the most important philosopher and commentator of the Theravada school. The Theravada philosophical enterprise was mostly carried out in the genre of Atthakatha (commentaries) as well as sub-commentaries (tikas) on the classic Pali Abhidhamma texts. Abhidhamma study also included smaller doctrinal summaries and compendiums, like the \"Abhidhammattha-sa\u1e45gaha\" (The Compendium of Things contained in the Abhidhamma).\nThe Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da-Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika (sometimes just \"Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika\") was one of the major Buddhist philosophical schools in India, and they were so named because of their belief that dharmas exist in all three times: past, present and future. Though the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Abhidharma system began as a mere categorization of mental events, their philosophers and exegetes such as Dharmatrata and Katy\u0101y\u0101niputra, the compiler of the \"Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63a\" (\"Great Commentary\"), eventually refined this system into a robust realism, which also included a type of essentialism or substance theory. This realism was based on the nature of dharmas, which was called svabhava (\"self-nature\" or \"intrinsic existence\"). Svabhava is a sort of essence, though it is not a completely independent essence, since all dharmas were said to be causally dependent. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da system extended this realism across time, effectively positing a type of eternalism with regards to time; hence, the name of their school means \"the view that everything exists\". Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika remained an influential school in North India during the medieval period. Perhaps the most influential figure in this tradition was the great scholar Sa\u1e43ghabhadra. Another key figure was \u015aubhagupta (720\u2013780), who was a Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika thinker within the epistemological (pramana) tradition.\nOther Buddhist schools such as the Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da (\"the nominalists\"), as well as the Caitika Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas refused to accept the concept of svabhava. Thus, not all Abhidharma sources defend svabhava. For example, the main topic of the \"Tattvasiddhi \u015a\u0101stra\" by Harivarman (3-4th century CE), an influential Abhidharma text, is the emptiness (shunyata) of dharmas. Indeed, this anti-essentialist nominalism was widespread among the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika sects. Another important feature of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika tradition was its unique theory of consciousness. Many of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika sub-schools defended a theory of self-awareness (\"svasa\u1e43vedana\") which held that consciousness can be simultaneously aware of itself as well as its intentional object. Some of these schools also held that the mind's nature (\"cittasvabh\u0101va\") is fundamentally pure (\"mulavisuddha\"), but it can be contaminated by adventitious defilements.\nThe Therav\u0101dins and other schools, such as the Sautr\u0101ntikas (\"those who follow the sutras\"), often attacked the theories of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins, especially their theory of time. A major figure in this argument was the scholar Vasubandhu, a Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101din monk himself (who was also influenced by the critiques of the Sautrantika school), who critiqued the theory of all exists and argued for philosophical presentism in his comprehensive treatise, the \"Abhidharmako\u015ba.\" This work is the major Abhidharma text used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism today. The Therav\u0101da also holds that dharmas only exist in the present, and are thus also presentists.\nThe Therav\u0101da presentation of Abhidharma is also not as concerned with ontology as the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da view, but is more of a phenomenological schema. Hence the concept of svabhava (Pali: sabhava) for the Therav\u0101dins is more of a certain characteristic or dependent feature of a dharma, than any sort of essence or metaphysical grounding. As the Sinhalese scholar Y. Karunadasa writes, the Pali tradition only postulates sabhava \"for the sake of definition and description.\" However, ultimately each dhamma (particular phenomenon) is not a singular independent existence. Thus, Karunadasa rejects the view that Theravada Abhidhamma defends an ontological pluralism (but it is also not monism either, since there is no single underlying ground of all things or metaphysical substratum). Instead they are merely processes that happen \"due to the interplay of a multitude of conditions.\" Karunadasa also describes the Theravada system as a \"critical realism\" which sees the ultimate existents as the myriad irreducible dhammas, and which also accepts the existence of an external world with entities that truly exist independently of cognition (as opposed to Mahayana forms of idealism).\nAnother important theory held by some Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins, Therav\u0101dins and Sautr\u0101ntikas was the theory of \"momentariness\" (Skt., k\u1e63\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da, Pali, kh\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da). This theory held that dhammas only last for a minute moment (\"ksana\") after they arise. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins saw these 'moments' in an atomistic way, as the smallest length of time possible (they also developed a material atomism). Reconciling this theory with their eternalism regarding time was a major philosophical project of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da. The Therav\u0101dins initially rejected this theory, as evidenced by the Kha\u1e47ikakath\u0101 of the Kathavatthu which attempts to refute the doctrine that \"all phenomena (dhamma) are as momentary as a single mental entity.\" However, momentariness with regards to mental dhammas (but not physical or r\u016bpa dhammas) was later adopted by the Sri Lankan Therav\u0101dins, and it is possible that it was first introduced by the scholar Buddhagosa.\nAll Abhidharma schools also developed complex theories of causation and conditionality to explain how dharmas interacted with each other. Another major philosophical project of the Abhidharma schools was the explanation of perception. Some schools such as the Sarvastivadins explained perception as a type of phenomenalist realism while others such as the Sautrantikas preferred representationalism and held that we only perceive objects indirectly. The major argument used for this view by the Sautr\u0101ntikas was the \"time-lag argument.\" According to Mark Siderits: \"The basic idea behind the argument is that since there is always a tiny gap between when the sense comes in contact with the external object and when there is sensory awareness, what we are aware of can't be the external object that the senses were in contact with, since it no longer exists.\" This is related to the theory of extreme momentariness.\nOne major philosophical view which was rejected by all the schools mentioned above was the view held by the Pudgalavadin or 'personalist' schools. They seemed to have held that there was a sort of 'personhood' in some ultimately real sense which was not reducible to the five aggregates. This controversial claim was in contrast to the other Buddhists of the time who held that a personality was a mere conceptual construction (praj\u00f1apti) and only conventionally real.\nIndian Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophy.\nFrom about the 1st century BCE, a new textual tradition began to arise in Indian Buddhist thought called Mah\u0101y\u0101na (Great Vehicle), which would slowly come to dominate Indian Buddhist philosophy. During the medieval period of Indian history, Buddhist philosophy thrived in large monastery complexes such as Nalanda, Vikramasila, and Vallabhi. These institutions became major centers of philosophical learning in North India (where both Buddhist and also non-Buddhist thought was studied and debated). Mah\u0101y\u0101na philosophers continued the philosophical projects of Abhidharma, while at the same time critiquing them and introducing many new concepts and ideas. Since the Mah\u0101y\u0101na held to the pragmatic concept of truth, which states that doctrines are regarded as conditionally \"true\" in the sense of being spiritually beneficial, these new theories and practices were seen as \"skillful means\" (\"up\u0101ya\") conductive to enlightenment.\nThe Mah\u0101y\u0101na also promoted the Bodhisattva ideal, which included an attitude of benevolence, wisdom, compassion, generosity, and loving-kindness for all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva is someone who chooses to remain in the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth in order to help and benefit all other beings who are suffering, until their final attainment of Buddhahood.\nMajor Mahayana philosophical schools and traditions include the Praj\u00f1aparamita, M\u0101dhyamaka, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, Tathagatagarbha, the epistemological school of Dignaga, and in China the Huayan, Tiantai, and Zen schools.\nPraj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 and M\u0101dhyamaka.\nThe earliest \"Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btras\" (\"Perfection of Wisdom\", c.\u20091st century BCE) emphasize the emptiness (\"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\") of all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena (\"dharma\"). It is thus a radical global nominalism and anti-essentialism, which sees all things as illusions and all of reality as a dreamlike appearance without any fundamental essence. \"Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" is said to be a transcendent spiritual knowledge of the nature of ultimate reality, which is empty of any essence or foundation, like a universal mirage.\nThus, the \"Diamond Sutra\" (\"Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra\") states: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe \"Heart Sutra\" famously affirms the emptiness of all phenomena:\nOh, Sariputra, form does not differ from emptiness, and emptiness does not differ from form.Form is emptiness and emptiness is form; the same is true for feelings, perceptions, volitions, and consciousness.The Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 sources also note that this applies to every single phenomenon, even Buddhahood. The goal of the Buddhist aspirant in the Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 texts is to awaken to the perfection of wisdom (\"praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\"), a non-conceptual transcendent wisdom that knows the emptiness of all things while not being attached to anything (including the very idea of emptiness itself or perfect wisdom).\nThe \"Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101\" teachings are associated with the work of the Buddhist philosopher N\u0101g\u0101rjuna (c.\u2009150 \u2013 c.\u2009250 CE) and the M\u0101dhyamaka (\"Middle Way\") school. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna was one of the most influential Indian Mah\u0101y\u0101na thinkers. He gave the classical arguments for the empty nature of all dharmas and attacked the essentialism found in various Abhidharma schools (and also in Hindu philosophy) in his magnum opus, \"The Root Verses on the Middle Way\" (\"M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101\"). In the \"M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101\", Nagarjuna relies on reductio ad absurdum arguments to refute various theories which assume \"svabh\u0101va\" (an inherent essence or substantial being), \"dravya\" (substances or entity), or any theory of existence (\"bh\u0101va\"). In this work, he covers topics such as causation, motion, and the sense faculties.\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna asserted a direct connection between, even identity of, dependent origination (\"prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da\"), emptiness (\"\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\"), and non-self (\"anatt\u0101\"). He pointed out that implicit in the early Buddhist concept of dependent origination is the lack of a permanent, unchanging self underlying the participants in origination, so that they have no independent existence, a state identified as being empty (\"svabh\u0101va \u015b\u016bnyam\": i.e., emptiness of a nature or essence).\nLater philosophers of the M\u0101dhyamaka school built upon N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's analysis and defended the M\u0101dhyamaka view against their opponents. These included \u0100ryadeva (3rd century CE), N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's pupil; Candrak\u012brti (600\u2013c.\u2009650), who wrote an important commentary on the \"M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101\"; and Shantideva (8th century), who is regarded as the key Mah\u0101y\u0101na ethicist.\nThe commentator Buddhap\u0101lita (c. 470\u2013550) has been understood as the originator of the Prasa\u1e45gika approach which is based on critiquing essentialism \"only\" through reductio arguments. He was criticized by Bh\u0101vaviveka (c.\u2009500 \u2013 c.\u2009578), who argued for the use of properly logical syllogisms to positively argue for emptiness (instead of just refuting the theories of others). These two approaches were later termed the Prasa\u1e45gika and Svatantrika approaches to M\u0101dhyamaka philosophy by Tibetan Buddhist philosophers and commentators.\nInfluenced by the work of Dignaga, Bh\u0101vaviveka's M\u0101dhyamaka philosophy makes use of Buddhist epistemology. Candrak\u012brti, on the other hand, critiqued Bh\u0101vaviveka's adoption of the epistemological (\"pramana\") tradition on the grounds that it contained subtle essentialism. He quotes Nagarjuna's famous statement in the \"Vigrahavyavartani\" which says \"I have no thesis\" for his rejection of positive epistemic Madhyamaka statements. Candrak\u012brti held that a true Madhyamika could only use \"consequence\" (\"prasanga\"), in which one points out the inconsistencies of their opponent's position without asserting an \"autonomous inference\" (\"svatantra\"), for no such inference can be ultimately true from the point of view of Madhyamaka.\nIn China, the Madhyamaka school (known as S\u0101nl\u00f9n) was founded by Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (344\u2013413 CE), who translated the works of Nagarjuna to Chinese. Other Chinese Madhymakas include Kum\u0101raj\u012bva's pupil Sengzhao, Jizang (549\u2013623), who wrote over 50 works on Madhyamaka, and Hyegwan, a Korean monk who brought Madhyamaka teachings to Japan.\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra.\nThe Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school (\"Yoga practice\") was a Buddhist philosophical tradition which arose in between the 2nd century CE and the 4th century CE and is associated with the philosophers and brothers Asanga and Vasubandhu and with various sutras such as the \"Sandhinirmocana Sutra\" and the \"Lankavatara Sutra\". The central feature of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra thought is the concept of \"vij\u00f1apti-m\u0101tra\", often translated as \"impressions only\" or \"appearance only\". This has been interpreted as a form of Idealism or as a form of Phenomenology. Other names for the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school are 'vij\u00f1anavada' (the doctrine of consciousness) and 'cittamatra' (mind-only).\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra thinkers like Vasubandhu argued against the existence of external objects by pointing out that we only ever have access to our own mental impressions, and hence our inference of the existence of external objects is based on faulty logic. Vasubandhu's \"Tri\u1e43\u015bik\u0101-vij\u00f1aptim\u0101trat\u0101 (The Proof that There Are Only Impressions in Thirty Verses\"), begins thus:\nI. This [world] is nothing but impressions, since it manifests itself as an unreal object, \nJust like the case of those with cataracts seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like.\nAccording to Vasubandhu then, all our experiences are like seeing hairs on the moon when we have cataracts, that is, we project our mental images into something \"out there\" when there are no such things. Vasubandhu then goes on to use the dream argument to argue that mental impressions do not require external objects to (1) seem to be spatio-temporally located, (2) to seem to have an inter-subjective quality, and (3) to seem to operate by causal laws. The fact that purely mental events can have causal efficacy and be intersubjective is proved by the event of a wet dream and by the mass or shared hallucinations created by the karma of certain types of beings. After having argued that impressions-only is a theory that can explain our everyday experience, Vasubandhu then appeals to parsimony - since we do not need the concept of external objects to explain reality, then we can do away with those superfluous concepts altogether as they are most likely just mentally superimposed on our concepts of reality by the mind. Yog\u0101c\u0101rins like Vasubandhu also attacked the realist theories of Buddhist atomism and the Abhidharma theory of svabhava. He argued that atoms, as conceived by the atomists (un-divisible entities), would not be able to come together to form larger aggregate entities, and hence that they were illogical concepts.\nInter-subjective reality for Vasubandhu is then the causal interaction between various mental streams and their karma, and does not include any external physical objects. The soteriological importance of this theory is that, by removing the concept of an external world, it also weakens the 'internal' sense of self as an observer which is supposed to be separate from the external world. To dissolve the dualism of inner and outer is also to dissolve the sense of self and other. The later Yogacara commentator Sthiramati explains this thus:There is a grasper if there is something to be grasped, but not in the absence of what is to be grasped. Where there is nothing to be grasped, the absence of a grasper also follows, there is not just the absence of the thing to be grasped. Thus there arises the extra-mundane non-conceptual cognition that is alike without object and without cognizer.\nApart from its defense of an idealistic metaphysics and its attacks on realism, Yog\u0101c\u0101ra sources also developed a new theory of mind, based on the Eight Consciousnesses, which includes the innovative doctrine of the subliminal storehouse consciousness (Skt: \u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na).\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra thinkers also developed a positive account of ultimate reality based on three basic modes or \"natures\" (svabh\u0101va). This metaphysical doctrine is central to their view of the ultimate and to their understanding of the doctrine of emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101).\nThe Dign\u0101ga-Dharmak\u012brti tradition.\nDign\u0101ga (c.\u2009480\u2013540) and Dharmak\u012brti (c. 6-7th century) were Buddhist philosophers who developed a system of epistemology (pramana) and logic in their debates with the Brahminical philosophers in order to defend Buddhist doctrine. This tradition is called \"those who follow reasoning\" (Tibetan: \"rigs pa rjes su 'brang ba\"); in modern literature, it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit \"pram\u0101\u1e47av\u0101da\", or \"the Epistemological School.\" They were associated with the Yogacara and Sautrantika schools, and defended theories held by both of these schools.\nDign\u0101ga's influence was profound and led to an \"epistemological turn\" among all Buddhists and also all Sanskrit language philosophers in India after his death. In the centuries following Dign\u0101ga's work, Sanskrit philosophers became much more focused on defending all of their propositions with fully developed theories of knowledge.\nThe \"School of Dign\u0101ga\" includes later philosophers and commentators like Santabhadra, Dharmottara (8th century), Praj\u00f1akaragupta (740\u2013800 C.E.), J\u00f1anasrimitra (975\u20131025), Ratnak\u012brti (11th century) and \u015aa\u1e45karanandana (fl. c. 9th or 10th century). The epistemology they developed defends the view that there are only two 'instruments of knowledge' or 'valid cognitions' (\"pramana\"): \"perception\" (\"pratyaksa\") and \"inference\" (\"anum\u0101\u1e47a\"). Perception is a non-conceptual awareness of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual.\nThese Buddhist philosophers argued in favor of the theory of momentariness, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra \"awareness only\" view, the reality of particulars (\"svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a\"), atomism, nominalism and the self-reflexive nature of consciousness (\"svasa\u1e43vedana\"). They attacked Hindu theories of God (Isvara), universals, the authority of the Vedas, and the existence of a permanent soul (\"atman\").\nLater Yog\u0101c\u0101ra developments.\nAfter the time of Asanga and Vasubandhu, the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school developed in different directions. One branch focused on epistemology (this would become the school of Dignaga). Another branch focused on expanding the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra's metaphysics and philosophy. This latter tradition includes figures like Dharmapala of Nalanda, Sthiramati, Chandragomin (who was known to have debated the Madhyamaka thinker Candrakirti), and \u015a\u012blabhadra (a top scholar at Nalanda). Yog\u0101c\u0101rins such as Paramartha and Gu\u1e47abhadra brought the school to China and translated Yogacara works there, where it is known as W\u00e9ish\u00ed-z\u014dng or F\u01cexi\u00e0ng-z\u014dng. An important contribution to East Asian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra is Xuanzang's \"Cheng Weishi Lun\", or \"Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only\".\nA later development is the rise of a syncretic tradition of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-tath\u0101gatagarbha thought. This group adopted the doctrine of \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" (the buddha-womb, buddha-source, or \"buddha-within\") found in various \"tath\u0101gatagarbha sutras.\" This hybrid school eventually went on to equate the \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" with the pure aspect of the storehouse consciousness. Some key sources of this school are the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra\", \"Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga\" (\"Uttaratantra\"), and in China, the influential \"Mahayana Awakening of Faith treatise.\" One key figure of this tradition was Param\u0101rtha, an Indian monk who was an important translator in China. He promoted a new theory that said there was a \"stainless consciousness\" (\"amala-vij\u00f1\u0101na\", a pure wisdom within all beings), which he equated with the Buddha-nature (tath\u0101gatag\u0101rbha). This synthetic tradition also became important in later Indian Buddhism, where the \"Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga\" became the key text.\nAnother later development was the synthesis of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra and M\u0101dhyamaka philosophies. J\u00f1\u0101nagarbha (8th century) and his student \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita (725\u2013788) brought together Yog\u0101c\u0101ra, M\u0101dhyamaka, and the Dignaga school of epistemology into a philosophical synthesis known as the \"Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Svatantrika-M\u0101dhyamika\". \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita was also instrumental in the introduction of Buddhism and the Sarvastivadin monastic ordination lineage to Tibet, which was conducted at Samye. \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's disciples included Haribhadra and Kamala\u015b\u012bla. This philosophical tradition is influential in Tibetan Buddhist thought.\nPerhaps the most important debate among late Yog\u0101c\u0101ra philosophers was the debate between alik\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101da (Tib. \"rnam rdzun pa\", False Aspectarians, also known as Nir\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101da) and Saty\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101da (\"rnam bden pa\", True Aspectarians, also known as s\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101da). The crux of the debate was the question of whether mental appearances, images or \u201caspects\u201d (\"\u0101k\u0101ra\") are true (\"satya\") or false (\"alika\"). The Saty\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101da camp, defended by scholars like Praj\u00f1akaragupta (ca. 8th\u20139th century), and J\u00f1\u0101na\u015br\u012bmitra (ca. 980\u20131040), held that images in consciousness have a real existence, since they arise from a real consciousness. Meanwhile, Alik\u0101k\u0101rav\u0101da defenders like Sthiramati and Ratn\u0101kara\u015b\u0101nti (ca. 970\u20131045) argued that mental appearances do not really exist, and are false (al\u012bka) or illusory. For these thinkers, the only thing which is real is a pure self-aware consciousness which is contentless (nir\u0101k\u0101ra, \u201cwithout images\u201d).\nBuddha-nature thought.\nThe \"tath\u0101gathagarbha sutras\", in a departure from mainstream Buddhist language, insist that there is a real potential for awakening is inherent to every sentient being. They marked a shift from a largely apophatic (negative) method within Buddhism to a decidedly more cataphatic (positive) mode. The main topic of this genre of literature is the \"tath\u0101gata-garbha,\" which can mean the womb or embryo of a Tath\u0101gata (i.e. a Buddha) and is what allows someone to become a Buddha. Another similar term used for this idea is \"buddhadh\u0101tu\" (buddha-nature or source of the Buddhas).\nPrior to the period of these scriptures, Mah\u0101y\u0101na metaphysics had been dominated by teachings on emptiness. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the buddha-nature literature can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of dependent origination using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sutras, the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self (atman). The word \"self\" (\"atman\") is used in a way idiosyncratic to these sutras; the \"true self\" is described as the perfection of the wisdom of not-self in the \"Buddha-Nature Treatise\" (\"F\u00f3x\u00ecng l\u00f9n\", \u4f5b\u6027\u8ad6, T. 1610) of Param\u0101rtha, for example. The ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used previously in Indian philosophy by essentialist philosophers, but which was now adapted to describe the positive realities of Buddhahood.\nPerhaps the most influential source in the Indian tradition for this teaching is the \"Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga\" (5th century CE). This \u015b\u0101stra brought together all the major themes of the tath\u0101gatag\u0101rbha theory into a single treatise. The \"Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga\" sees the tath\u0101gatagarbha as being an inherent nature in all things which is omnipresent, all-pervasive, non-conceptual, free of suffering and inherently blissful. It also describes buddha nature as \u201cthe intrinsically stainless nature of the mind\u201d (\"cittaprak\u1e5btivaimalya\"). Indeed, in many later Indian sources, the \"tath\u0101gathagarbha\" teachings also come to be identified with the similar doctrine of the luminous mind (prabhasvara-citta). This ancient idea holds that the mind is inherently pure, and that defilements are only adventitious. In the \"Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga\", this originally pure (prak\u1e5btipari\u015buddha) nature (i.e. the fully purified buddha-nature) is further described through numerous terms such as: unconditioned (asa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta), unborn (aj\u0101ta), unarisen (anutpanna), eternal (nitya), changeless (dhruva), and permanent (\u015b\u0101\u015bvata).\nAccording to some scholars, \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" does not represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language expression of emptiness and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this interpretation, the intention of the teaching of \"tath\u0101gatagarbha\" is soteriological rather than metaphysical.\nVajray\u0101na Buddhism.\nVajray\u0101na (also Mantray\u0101na, Secret Mantra, Tantray\u0101na, and Esoteric Buddhism) is a Mahayana Buddhist tradition associated with a group of texts known as the Buddhist Tantras which had developed into a major force in India by the eighth century. By this time Indian Tantric scholars were developing philosophical defenses, hermeneutics and explanations of the Buddhist tantric systems, especially through commentaries on key tantras such as the \"Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra\", \"Mahavairocana sutra\", and the \"Guhyagarbha Tantra\".\nWhile the view of the Vajray\u0101na was based on the earlier Madhyamaka, Yogacara and Buddha-nature theories, it saw itself as being a faster vehicle to liberation containing many skillful methods (\"upaya\") of tantric ritual. The need for an explication and defense of the Tantras arose out of the unusual nature of the rituals associated with them, which included the use of secret mantras, alcohol, sexual yoga, complex visualizations of mandalas filled with wrathful deities and other practices which were discordant with or at least novel in comparison to traditional Buddhist practice.\nThe \"Guhyasam\u0101ja Tantra\", for example, states: \"you should kill living beings, speak lying words, take things that are not given and have sex with many women\". Other features of tantra included a focus on the physical body as the means to liberation, and a reaffirmation of feminine elements, feminine deities and a positive view of sexuality.\nThe defense of these tantric practices is based on the theory of transformation which states that negative mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting. The \"Hevajra tantra\" states:\nThose things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists, this practice of reversals is not known.\nAnother hermeneutic of Buddhist Tantric commentaries such as the \"Vimalaprabha\" (\"Stainless Light\") of Pundarika (a commentary on the \"Kalacakra Tantra\") is one of interpreting taboo or unethical statements in the Tantras as metaphorical statements about tantric practice and physiology. For example, in the \"Vimalaprabha\", \"killing living beings\" refers to stopping the prana at the top of the head. In the Tantric Candrakirti's \"Pradipoddyotana\", a commentary to the \"Guhyasamaja Tantra\", killing living beings is glossed as \"making them void\" by means of a \"special samadhi\" which according to Bus-ton is associated with completion stage tantric practice.\nDouglas Duckworth notes that Vajray\u0101na philosophical outlook is one of embodiment, which sees the physical and cosmological body as already containing wisdom and divinity. Liberation (nirvana) and Buddhahood are not seen as something outside the body, or an event in the future, but as imminently present and accessible right now through unique tantric practices like deity yoga. Hence, Vajray\u0101na is also called the \"resultant vehicle\", that is to say, it is the spiritual vehicle that relies on the immanent nature of the result of practice (liberation), which is already present in all beings. Duckworth names the philosophical view of Vajray\u0101na as a form of pantheism, by which he means the belief that every existing entity is in some sense divine and that all things express some form of unity.\nMajor Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as Buddhaguhya, Padmavajra (author of the \"Guhyasiddhi\" commentary), Nagarjuna (the 7th-century disciple of Saraha), Indrabhuti (author of the \"J\u00f1\u0101nasiddhi\"), Anangavajra, Dombiheruka, Durjayacandra, Ratn\u0101kara\u015b\u0101nti and Abhayakaragupta wrote tantric texts and commentaries systematizing the tradition.\nOthers such as Vajrabodhi and \u015aubhakarasi\u1e43ha brought tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), and tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as Yi Xing (683\u2013727) and K\u016bkai (774\u2013 835).\nIn Tibet, philosophers such as Sakya Pandita (1182-28\u20131251), Longchenpa (1308\u20131364) and Tsongkhapa (1357\u20131419) continued the tradition of Buddhist Tantric philosophy in Classical Tibetan.\nTibetan Buddhist philosophy.\nTibetan Buddhist philosophy is mainly a continuation and refinement of the Indian Mahayana philosophical traditions. The initial efforts of \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and Kamala\u015b\u012bla brought their eclectic scholarly tradition to Tibet.\nThe initial work of early Tibetan Buddhist philosophers was in the translation of classical Indian philosophical treatises and the writing of commentaries. This initial period is from the 8th to the 10th century. Early Tibetan commentator-philosophers were heavily influenced by the work of Dharmakirti and these include Ngok Loden Sherab (1059\u20131109) and Chaba Ch\u00f6kyi Senge (1182\u20131251). Their works are now lost.\nThe 12th and 13th centuries saw the translation of the works of Chandrakirti, the promulgation of his views in Tibet by scholars such as Patsab Nyima Drakpa, Kanakavarman and Jayananda (12th century) and the development of the Tibetan debate between the prasangika and svatantrika views which continues to this day among Tibetan Buddhist schools. The main disagreement between these views is the use of reasoned argument. For \u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita's school, reason is useful in establishing arguments that lead one to a correct understanding of emptiness. Then, through the use of meditation, one can reach non-conceptual gnosis that does not rely on reason. However, Chandrakirti rejects this idea, because meditation on emptiness cannot possibly involve any object. Reason's role for him is purely negative. Reason is used to negate any essentialist view, and then eventually reason must also negate itself, along with any conceptual proliferation (\"prapa\u00f1ca\").\nAnother very influential figure from this early period is Mabja Jangchub Ts\u00f6ndr\u00fc (d. 1185), who wrote an important commentary on Nagarjuna's \"M\u016blamadhyamakak\u0101rik\u0101\". Mabja was studied under the Dharmakirtian Chaba and also the Candrakirti scholar Patsab. His work shows an attempt to steer a middle course between their views, he affirms the conventional usefulness of pram\u0101\u1e47a epistemology, but also accepts Candrakirti's prasangika views. Mabja's Madhyamaka scholarship was very influential on later Tibetan Madhyamikas such as Longchenpa, Tsongkhapa, Gorampa, and Miky\u00f6 Dorje.\nThere are various Tibetan Buddhist schools or monastic orders. According to Georges B.J. Dreyfus, within Tibetan thought, the Sakya school holds a mostly anti-realist philosophical position (which sees \"sa\u1e41v\u1e5btisatya\" / conventional truth as an illusion), while the Gelug school tends to defend a form of realism (which accepts that conventional truth is in some sense real and true, yet dependently originated). The Kagyu and Nyingma schools also tend to follow Sakya anti-realism (with some differences).\nShentong and Buddha nature.\nThe 14th century saw increasing interest in the Buddha nature texts and doctrines. This can be seen in the work of the third Kagyu Karmapa Rangjung Dorje (1284\u20131339), especially his treatise \"Profound Inner Meaning\". This treatise describes ultimate nature or suchness as Buddha nature which is the basis for nirvana and samsara, radiant in nature and empty in essence, surpassing thought.\nOne of the most important theoriests of buddha-nature in Tibet was the scholar-yogi D\u00f6lpopa Sh\u00e9rap Gyeltsen (c. 1292\u20131361). A figure of the Jonang school, D\u00f6lpopa developed a view called shentong (Wylie: gzhan stong, 'other emptiness'), based on earlier Yogacara and Buddha-nature ideas present in Indian sources (including the buddha-nature literature, the \"K\u0101lacakratantra\" and the works of Ratn\u0101kara\u015b\u0101nti). The shentong view holds that Buddhahood is already immanent in all living beings as an eternal and all-pervaside non-dual wisdom he termed \"all-basis wisdom\" or \"gnosis of the ground of all\" (Tib. \"kun gzhi ye shes\", Skt. \u0101laya-j\u00f1\u0101na). This view holds that all relative phenomena are empty of inherent existence, but that the ultimate reality, the buddha-wisdom (\"buddha j\u00f1ana\") is \"not empty\" of its own inherent existence.\nAccording to D\u00f6lpopa, all beings are said to have the Buddha nature, the non-dual wisdom which is real, unchanging, permanent, non-conditioned, eternal, blissful and compassionate. This ultimate buddha wisdom is \"uncreated and indestructible, unconditioned and beyond the chain of dependent origination\" and is the basis for both samsara and nirvana. Dolpopa's shentong view also taught that ultimate reality was truly a \"Great Self\" or \"Supreme Self\" referring to works such as the \"Mah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra\", the \"A\u1e45gulim\u0101l\u012bya S\u016btra\" and the \"\u015ar\u012bm\u0101l\u0101dev\u012b Si\u1e43han\u0101da S\u016btra.\"\nThe shentong view had an influence on philosophers of other schools, such as Nyingma and Kagyu thinkers, and was also widely criticized in some circles as being similar to the Hindu notions of Atman. The Shentong philosophy was also expounded in Tibet and Mongolia by the later Jonang scholar T\u0101ran\u0101tha (1575\u20131634) and numerous later figures of the Jonang tradition. In the late 17th century, the Jonang order and its teachings came under attack by the 5th Dalai Lama, who converted the majority of their monasteries in Tibet to the Gelug order, although several survived in secret.\nGelug.\nJe Tsongkhapa (Dzong-ka-ba) (1357\u20131419) founded the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, which came to dominate the country through the office of the Dalai Lama and is the major defender of the Prasa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka view. His work is influenced by the philosophy of Candrakirti and Dharmakirti. Tsongkhapa's magnum opus is \"The Ocean of Reasoning\", a Commentary on Nagarjuna's \"Mulamadhyamakakarika\". Gelug philosophy is based upon the study of Madhyamaka texts and Tsongkhapa's works as well as formal debate (rtsod pa).\nTsongkhapa defended Prasangika Madhyamaka as the highest view and critiqued the svatantrika position. Tsongkhapa argued that, because svatantrika conventionally establishes things by their own characteristics, they fail to completely understand the emptiness of phenomena and hence do not achieve the same realization. Drawing on Chandrakirti, Tsongkhapa rejected the Yogacara teachings, even as a provisional stepping point to the Madhyamaka view. Tsongkhapa was also critical of the Shengtong view of Dolpopa, which he saw as dangerously absolutist and hence outside the middle way. Tsongkhapa identified two major flaws in interpretations of Madhyamika, under-negation (of svabhava or own essence), which could lead to Absolutism, and over-negation, which could lead to Nihilism. Tsongkhapa's solution to this dilemma was the promotion of the use of inferential reasoning only within the conventional realm of the two truths framework, allowing for the use of reason for ethics, conventional monastic rules and promoting a conventional epistemic realism, while holding that, from the view of ultimate truth (\"paramarthika satya\"), all things (including Buddha nature and Nirvana) are empty of inherent existence (svabhava), and that true liberation is this realization of emptiness.\nSakya scholars such as Rongt\u00f6n and Gorampa disagreed with Tsongkhapa, and argued that the prasangika svatantrika distinction was merely pedagogical. Gorampa also critiqued Tsongkhapa's realism, arguing that the structures which allow an empty object to be presented as conventionally real eventually dissolve under analysis and are thus unstructured and non-conceptual (spros bral). Tsongkhapa's students Gyel-tsap, Kay-drup, and Ge-dun-drup set forth an epistemological realism against the Sakya scholars' anti-realism.\nSakya.\nSakya Pandita (1182\u20131251) was a 13th-century head of the Sakya school and ruler of Tibet. He was also one of the most important Buddhist philosophers in the Tibetan tradition, writing works on logic and epistemology and promoting Dharmakirti's \"Pramanavarttika\" (Commentary on Valid Cognition) as central to the scholastic study. Sakya Pandita's 'Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition' (\"Tshad ma rigs pa'i gter\") set forth the classic Sakya epistemic anti-realist position, arguing that concepts such as universals are not known through valid cognition and hence are not real objects of knowledge. Sakya Pandita was also critical of theories of sudden awakening, which were held by some teachers of the \"Chinese Great Perfection\" in Tibet.\nLater Sakyas such as Gorampa (1429\u20131489) and Sakya Chokden (1428\u20131507) would develop and defend Sakya anti-realism, and they are seen as the major interpreters and critics of Sakya Pandita's philosophy. Sakya Chokden also critiqued Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Madhyamaka and Dolpopa's Shentong. In his \"Definite ascertainment of the middle way\", Chokden criticized Tsongkhapa's view as being too logo-centric and still caught up in conceptualization about the ultimate reality which is beyond language. Sakya Chokden's philosophy attempted to reconcile the views of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka, seeing them both as valid and complementary perspectives on ultimate truth. Madhyamaka is seen by Chokden as removing the fault of taking the unreal as being real, and Yogacara removes the fault of the denial of Reality. Likewise, the Shentong and Rangtong views are seen as complementary by Sakya Chokden; Rangtong negation is effective in cutting through all clinging to wrong views and conceptual rectification, while Shentong is more amenable for describing and enhancing meditative experience and realization. Therefore, for Sakya Chokden, the same realization of ultimate reality can be accessed and described in two different but compatible ways.\nNyingma.\nThe Nyingma school is strongly influenced by the view of Dzogchen (Great Perfection) and the Dzogchen Tantric literature. Longchenpa (1308\u20131364) was a major philosopher of the Nyingma school and wrote an extensive number of works on the Tibetan practice of Dzogchen and on Buddhist Tantra. These include the \"Seven Treasures\", the \"Trilogy of Natural Ease\", and his \"Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness\". Longchenpa's works provide a philosophical understanding of Dzogchen, a defense of Dzogchen in light of the sutras, as well as practical instructions. For Longchenpa, the ground of reality is luminous emptiness, rigpa (\"knowledge\"), or buddha nature, and this ground is also the bridge between sutra and tantra. Longchenpa's philosophy sought to establish the positive aspects of Buddha nature thought against the totally negative theology of Madhyamika without straying into the absolutism of Dolpopa. For Longchenpa, the basis for Dzogchen and Tantric practice in Vajrayana is the \"Ground\" or \"Basis\" (\"gzhi\"), the immanent Buddha nature, \"the primordially luminous reality that is unconditioned and spontaneously present\" which is \"free from all elaborated extremes\".\nRim\u00e9 movement.\nThe 19th century saw the rise of the Rim\u00e9 movement (non-sectarian, unbiased) which sought to push back against the politically dominant Gelug school's criticisms of the Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma, and Bon philosophical views, and develop a more eclectic or universal system of textual study. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820\u20131892) and Jamg\u00f6n Kongtr\u00fcl (1813\u20131899) were the founders of Rim\u00e9. The Rim\u00e9 movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan. The aim of the movement was \"a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned.\"\nPhilosophically, Jamg\u00f6n Kongtr\u00fcl defended Shentong as being compatible with Madhyamaka while another Rim\u00e9 scholar Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso (1846\u20131912) criticized Tsongkhapa from a Nyingma perspective. Mipham argued that the view of the middle way is Unity (zung 'jug), meaning that from the ultimate perspective the duality of sentient beings and Buddhas is also dissolved. Mipham also affirmed the view of \"rangtong\" (self emptiness).\nThe later Nyingma scholar Botrul (1894\u20131959) classified the major Tibetan Madhyamaka positions as shentong (other emptiness), Nyingma rangtong (self emptiness) and Gelug bdentong (emptiness of true existence). The main difference between them is their \"object of negation\"; shengtong states that inauthentic experience is empty, rangtong negates any conceptual reference and bdentong negates any true existence.\nThe 14th Dalai Lama was also influenced by this non-sectarian approach. Having studied under teachers from all major Tibetan Buddhist schools, his philosophical position tends to be that the different perspectives on emptiness are complementary:\nThere is a tradition of making a distinction between two different perspectives on the nature of emptiness: one is when emptiness is presented within a philosophical analysis of the ultimate reality of things, in which case it ought to be understood in terms of a non-affirming negative phenomena. On the other hand, when it is discussed from the point of view of experience, it should be understood more in terms of an affirming negation \u2013 14th Dalai Lama\nEast Asian Buddhism.\nTiantai.\nThe schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from India, with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. The Tiantai school, founded by Zhiyi (538\u2013597), was the first truly unique Chinese Buddhist philosophical school. Tiantai doctrine sought to bring together all Buddhist teachings into a comprehensive system based on the ekayana (\"one vehicle\") doctrine taught in the \"Lotus Sutra\".\nTiantai's metaphysics is an immanent holism, which sees every phenomenon (dharma) as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality (the totality of all other dharmas). Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all \"inherently entailed\" within each other.\nTiantai metaphysics is entailed in their teaching of the \"three truths\", which is an extension of the M\u0101dhyamaka two truths doctrine. The three truths are: the conventional truth of appearance, the truth of emptiness and the third truth of 'the exclusive Center' (\u4f46\u4e2d \"danzhong\") or middle way, which is beyond conventional truth and emptiness. This third truth is the Absolute and expressed by the claim that nothing is \"Neither-Same-Nor-Different\" than anything else, but rather each 'thing' is the absolute totality of all things manifesting as a particular, everything is mutually contained within each thing. Everything is a reflection of \"The Ultimate Reality of All Appearances\" (\u8af8\u6cd5\u5be6\u76f8 \"zhufashixiang\") and each thought \"contains three thousand worlds\". This perspective allows the Tiantai school to state such seemingly paradoxical things as \"evil is ineradicable from the highest good, Buddhahood.\" Moreover, in Tiantai, nirvana and samsara are ultimately the same; as Zhiyi writes, \"a single, unalloyed reality is all there is \u2013 no entities whatever exist outside of it.\"\nWhile Zhiyi did write \"one thought contains three thousand worlds\", this does not entail idealism. According to Zhiyi, \"the objects of the [true] aspects of reality are not something produced by Buddhas, gods, or men. They exist inherently on their own and have no beginning\" (\"The Esoteric Meaning\", 210). This is then a form of realism, which sees the mind as real as the world, interconnected with and inseparable from it. In Tiantai thought, ultimate reality is simply the very phenomenal world of interconnected events or dharmas.\nOther key figures of Tiantai thought are Zhanran (711\u2013782) and Siming Zhili (960\u20131028). Zhanran developed the idea that non-sentient beings have buddha nature, since they are also a reflection of the Absolute. In Japan, this school was known as Tendai and was first brought to the island by Saicho. Tendai thought is more syncretic and draws on Huayan and East Asian Esoteric Buddhism.\nHuayan.\nThe Huayan school is the other native Chinese doctrinal system. Huayan is known for the doctrine of \"interpenetration\" (Sanskrit: \"yuganaddha\"), based on the \"Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra\" (\"Flower Garland Sutra\"). Huayan holds that all phenomena (Sanskrit: \"dharmas\") are deeply interconnected, mutually arising and that every phenomenon contains all other phenomena. Various metaphors and images are used to illustrate this idea. The first is known as Indra's net. The net is set with jewels which have the extraordinary property that they reflect all of the other jewels, while the reflections also contain every other reflection, ad infinitum. The second image is that of the world text. This image portrays the world as consisting of an enormous text which is as large as the universe itself. The words of the text are composed of the phenomena that make up the world. However, every atom of the world contains the whole text within it. It is the work of a Buddha to let out the text so that beings can be liberated from suffering.\nFazang (Fa-tsang, 643\u2013712), one of the most important Huayan thinkers, wrote 'Essay on the Golden Lion' and 'Treatise on the Five Teachings', which contain other metaphors for the interpenetration of reality. He also used the metaphor of a house of mirrors. Fazang introduced the distinction of \"the Realm of Principle\" and \"the Realm of Things\". This theory was further developed by Cheng-guan (738\u2013839) into the major Huayan thesis of \"the fourfold Dharmadhatu\" (dharma realm): the Realm of Principle, the Realm of Things, the Realm of the Noninterference between Principle and Things, and the Realm of the Noninterference of All Things. The first two are the universal and the particular, the third is the interpenetration of universal and particular, and the fourth is the interpenetration of all particulars. The third truth was explained by the metaphor of a golden lion: the gold is the universal and the particular is the shape and features of the lion. \nWhile both Tiantai and Huayan hold to the interpenetration and interconnection of all things, their metaphysics have some differences. Huayan metaphysics is influenced by Yogacara thought and is closer to idealism. The Avatamsaka sutra compares the phenomenal world to a dream, an illusion, and a magician's conjuring. The sutra states nothing has true reality, location, beginning and end, or substantial nature. The Avatamsaka also states that \"The triple world is illusory \u2013 it is only made by one mind\", and Fazang echoes this by writing, \"outside of mind there is not a single thing that can be apprehended.\" Furthermore, according to Huayan thought, each mind creates its own world \"according to their mental patterns\", and \"these worlds are infinite in kind\" and constantly arising and passing away. However, in Huayan, the mind is not real either, but also empty. The true reality in Huayan, the noumenon, or \"Principle\", is likened to a mirror, while phenomena are compared to reflections in the mirror. It is also compared to the ocean, and phenomena to waves.\nIn Korea, this school was known as Hwaeom and is represented in the work of Wonhyo (617\u2013686), who also wrote about the idea of essence-function, a central theme in Korean Buddhist thought. In Japan, Huayan is known as Kegon and one of its major proponents was My\u014de, who also introduced Tantric practices.\nChan and Japanese Buddhism.\nThe philosophy of Chinese Chan Buddhism and Japanese Zen is based on various sources; these include Chinese Madhyamaka (\"S\u0101nl\u00f9n\"), Yogacara (\"W\u00e9ish\u00ed\"), the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra, and the Buddha nature texts. An important issue in Chan is that of subitism or \"sudden awakening\", the idea that insight happens all at once in a flash of insight. This view was promoted by Shenhui and is a central issue discussed in the Platform Sutra, a key Chan scripture composed in China.\nHuayan philosophy also had an influence on Chan. The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu influenced the Five Ranks of Dongshan Liangjie (806\u2013869), the founder of the Caodong Chan lineage. Guifeng Zongmi, who was also a patriarch of Huayan Buddhism, wrote extensively on the philosophy of Chan and on the Avatamsaka sutra.\nJapanese Buddhism during the 6th and 7th centuries saw an increase in the proliferation of new schools and forms of thought, a period known as the six schools of Nara (\"Nanto Rokush\u016b\"). The Kamakura Period (1185\u20131333) also saw another flurry of intellectual activity. During this period, the influential figure of Nichiren (1222\u20131282) made the practice and universal message of the Lotus Sutra more readily available to the population. He is of particular importance in the history of thought and religion, as his teachings constitute a separate sect of Buddhism, one of the only major sects to have originated in Japan\nAlso during the Kamakura period, the founder of Soto Zen, Dogen (1200\u20131253), wrote many works on the philosophy of Zen, and the \"Shobogenzo\" is his magnum opus. In Korea, Chinul was an important exponent of Seon Buddhism at around the same time.\nEsoteric Buddhism.\nTantric Buddhism arrived in China in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty. In China, this form of Buddhism is known as M\u00ecz\u014dng (\u5bc6\u5b97), or \"Esoteric School\", and \"Zhenyan\" (true word, Sanskrit: Mantrayana). K\u016bkai (AD774\u2013835) is a major Japanese Buddhist philosopher and the founder of the Tantric Shingon (true word) school in Japan. He wrote on a wide variety of topics such as public policy, language, the arts, literature, music and religion. After studying in China under Huiguo, K\u016bkai brought together various elements into a cohesive philosophical system of Shingon.\nK\u016bkai's philosophy is based on the Mahavairocana Tantra and the Vajrasekhara Sutra (both from the seventh century). His \"Benkenmitsu nikky\u00f4ron\" (Treatise on the Differences Between Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) outlines the difference between exoteric, mainstream Mahayana Buddhism (kengy\u00f4) and esoteric Tantric Buddhism (mikky\u00f4). K\u016bkai provided the theoretical framework for the esoteric Buddhist practices of Mantrayana, bridging the gap between the doctrine of the sutras and tantric practices. At the foundation of K\u016bkai's thought is the Trikaya doctrine, which holds there are three \"bodies of the Buddha\".\nAccording to K\u016bkai, esoteric Buddhism has the Dharmakaya (Jpn: \"hosshin\", embodiment of truth) as its source, which is associated with Vairocana Buddha (Dainichi). Hosshin is embodied absolute reality and truth. Hosshin is mostly ineffable but can be experienced through esoteric practices such as mudras and mantras. While Mahayana is taught by the historical Buddha (nirm\u0101\u1e47ak\u0101ya), it does not have ultimate reality as its source or the practices to experience the esoteric truth. For Shingon, from an enlightened perspective, the whole phenomenal world itself is also the teaching of Vairocana. The body of the world, its sounds and movements, is the body of truth (dharma) and furthermore it is also identical with the personal body of the cosmic Buddha. For K\u016bkai, world, actions, persons and Buddhas are all part of the cosmic monologue of Vairocana, they are the truth being preached, to its own self manifestations. This is \"hosshin sepp\u00f4\" (literally: \"the dharmak\u00e2ya's expounding of the Dharma\") which can be accessed through mantra which is the cosmic language of Vairocana emanating through cosmic vibration concentrated in sound. In a broad sense, the universe itself is a huge text expressing ultimate truth (Dharma) which must be \"read\".\nDainichi means \"Great Sun\" and K\u016bkai uses this as a metaphor for the great primordial Buddha, whose teaching and presence illuminates and pervades all, like the light of the sun. This immanent presence also means that every being already has access to the liberated state (hongaku) and Buddha nature, and that, because of this, there is the possibility of \"becoming Buddha in this very embodied existence\" (\"sokushinj\u00f4butsu\"). This is achieved because of the non-dual relationship between the macrocosm of Hosshin and the microcosm of the Shingon practitioner.\nK\u016bkai's exposition of what has been called Shingon's \"metaphysics\" is based on the three aspects of the cosmic truth or Hosshin \u2013 body, appearance and function. The body is the physical and mental elements, which are the body and mind of the cosmic Buddha and which is also empty (Shunyata). The physical universe for Shingon contains the interconnected mental and physical events. The appearance aspect is the form of the world, which appears as mandalas of interconnected realms and is depicted in mandala art such as the Womb Realm mandala. The function is the movement and change which happens in the world, which includes change in forms, sounds and thought. These forms, sounds and thoughts are expressed by the Shingon practitioner in various rituals and tantric practices which allow them to connect with and inter-resonate with Dainichi and hence attain liberation here and now.\nModern philosophy.\nIn Sri Lanka, Buddhist modernists such as Anagarika Dharmapala (1864\u20131933) and the American convert Henry Steel Olcott sought to show that Buddhism was rational and compatible with modern Scientific ideas such as the theory of evolution. Dharmapala also argued that Buddhism included a strong social element, interpreting it as liberal, altruistic and democratic.\nA later Sri Lankan philosopher, K. N. Jayatilleke (1920\u20131970), wrote the classic modern account of Buddhist epistemology (\"Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge\", 1963). His student David Kalupahana wrote on the history of Buddhist thought and psychology. Other important Sri Lankan Buddhist thinkers include Ven \u00d1\u0101\u1e47ananda (\"Concept and Reality\"), Walpola Rahula, Hammalawa Saddhatissa (\"Buddhist Ethics\", 1987), Gunapala Dharmasiri (\"A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God\", 1988), P. D. Premasiri and R. G. de S. Wettimuny.\nIn 20th-century China, the modernist Taixu (1890\u20131947) advocated a reform and revival of Buddhism. He promoted an idea of a Buddhist Pure Land, not as a metaphysical place in Buddhist cosmology but as something possible to create here and now in this very world, which could be achieved through a \"Buddhism for Human Life\" () which was free of supernatural beliefs. Taixu also wrote on the connections between modern science and Buddhism, ultimately holding that \"scientific methods can only corroborate the Buddhist doctrine, they can never advance beyond it\". Like Taixu, Yin Shun (1906\u20132005) advocated a form of Humanistic Buddhism grounded in concern for humanitarian issues, and his students and followers have been influential in promoting Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan. This period also saw a revival of the study of Weishi (Yogachara), by Yang Rensan (1837\u20131911), Ouyang Jinwu (1871\u20131943) and Liang Shuming (1893\u20131988).\nOne of Tibetan Buddhism's most influential modernist thinkers is Gend\u00fcn Ch\u00f6phel (1903\u20131951), who, according to Donald S. Lopez Jr., \"was arguably the most important Tibetan intellectual of the twentieth century.\" Gend\u00fcn Ch\u00f6phel travelled throughout India with the Indian Buddhist Rahul Sankrityayan and wrote a wide variety of material, including works promoting the importance of modern science to his Tibetan countrymen and also Buddhist philosophical texts such as \"Adornment for Nagarjuna's Thought\". Another very influential Tibetan Buddhist modernist was Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa, whose Shambhala Training was meant to be more suitable to modern Western sensitivities by offering a vision of \"secular enlightenment\".\nIn Southeast Asia, thinkers such as Buddhadasa, Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh, Sulak Sivaraksa and Aung San Suu Kyi have promoted a philosophy of socially Engaged Buddhism and have written on the socio-political application of Buddhism. Likewise, Buddhist approaches to economic ethics (Buddhist economics) have been explored in the works of E. F. Schumacher, Prayudh Payutto, Neville Karunatilake, and Padmasiri de Silva. The study of the Pali Abhidhamma tradition continued to be influential in Myanmar, where it was developed by monks such as Ledi Sayadaw and Mahasi Sayadaw.\nJapanese philosophy was heavily influenced by the work of the Kyoto School which included Kitaro Nishida, Keiji Nishitani, Hajime Tanabe and Masao Abe. These thinkers brought Buddhist ideas in dialogue with Western philosophy, especially European phenomenologists and existentialists. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is Critical Buddhism, which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as Buddha nature and original enlightenment.\nThe Japanese Zen Buddhist D.T. Suzuki (1870\u20131966) was instrumental in bringing Zen Buddhism to the West and his Buddhist modernist works were very influential in the United States. Suzuki's worldview was a Zen Buddhism influenced by Romanticism and Transcendentalism, which promoted spiritual freedom as \"a spontaneous, emancipatory consciousness that transcends rational intellect and social convention.\" This idea of Buddhism influenced the Beat writers, and a contemporary representative of Western Buddhist Romanticism is Gary Snyder. The American Theravada Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu has critiqued 'Buddhist Romanticism' in his writings.\nWestern Buddhist monastics and priests such as Nanavira Thera, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Nyanaponika Thera, Robert Aitken, Taigen Dan Leighton, and Matthieu Ricard have written texts on Buddhist philosophy. A feature of Buddhist thought in the West has been a desire for dialogue and integration with modern science and psychology, and various modern Buddhists such as B. Alan Wallace, James H. Austin, Mark Epstein and the 14th Dalai Lama have worked and written on this issue.\nAnother area of convergence has been Buddhism and environmentalism, which is explored in the work of Joanna Macy. Another Western Buddhist philosophical trend has been the project to secularize Buddhism, as seen in the works of Stephen Batchelor.\nIn the West, Comparative philosophy between Buddhist and Western thought began with the work of Charles A. Moore, who founded the journal Philosophy East and West. Contemporary Western Academics such as Mark Siderits, Jan Westerhoff, Jonardon Ganeri, Miri Albahari, Owen Flanagan, Damien Keown, Tom Tillemans, David Loy, Evan Thompson, and Jay Garfield have written various works which interpret Buddhist ideas through Western philosophy.\nComparison with other philosophies.\nScholars such as Thomas McEvilley, Christopher I. Beckwith, and Adrian Kuzminski have identified cross influences between ancient Buddhism and the ancient Greek philosophy of Pyrrhonism. The Greek philosopher Pyrrho spent 18 months in India as part of Alexander the Great's court on Alexander's conquest of western India, where ancient biographers say his contact with the gymnosophists caused him to create his philosophy. Because of the high degree of similarity between N\u0101g\u0101rjuna's philosophy and Pyrrhonism, particularly the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus, Thomas McEvilley suspects that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonist texts imported into India.\nBaruch Spinoza, though he argued for the existence of a permanent reality, asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitory. In his opinion sorrow is conquered \"by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient, not ephemeral, but is immutable, permanent, everlasting.\" The Buddha taught that the only thing which is eternal is Nirvana. David Hume, after a relentless analysis of the mind, concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental states. Hume's Bundle theory is a very similar concept to the Buddhist \"skandhas\", though his skepticism about causation leads him to opposite conclusions in other areas. Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy parallels Buddhism in his affirmation of asceticism and renunciation as a response to suffering and desire (cf. Schopenhauer's \"The World as Will and Representation\", 1818).\nLudwig Wittgenstein's \"language-game\" closely parallel the warning that intellectual speculation or papa\u00f1ca is an impediment to understanding, as found in the Buddhist \"Parable of the Poison Arrow\". Friedrich Nietzsche, although himself dismissive of Buddhism as yet another nihilism, had a similar impermanent view of the self. Heidegger's ideas on being and nothingness have been held by some to be similar to Buddhism today.\nAn alternative approach to the comparison of Buddhist thought with Western philosophy is to use the concept of the Middle Way in Buddhism as a critical tool for the assessment of Western philosophies. In this way, Western philosophies can be classified in Buddhist terms as eternalist or nihilist. In a Buddhist view, all philosophies are considered non-essential views (ditthis) and not to be clung to.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He received international attention after writing, directing and starring in the independent drama film \"Sling Blade\" (1996), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. For his role in \"A Simple Plan\" (1998) he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\nThornton is known for his film roles in \"One False Move\" (1992), \"Tombstone\" (1993), \"Dead Man\" (1995), \"U Turn\" (1997), \"Primary Colors\" (1998), \"Armageddon\" (1998), \"Monster's Ball\" (2001), \"The Man Who Wasn't There\" (2001), \"Intolerable Cruelty\" (2003), \"Bad Santa\" (2003) and \"Friday Night Lights\" (2004). He has written a variety of films, including \"A Family Thing\" (1996) and \"The Gift\" (2000) and has directed films such as \"All the Pretty Horses\" (2000), \"Daddy and Them\" (2001) and \"Jayne Mansfield's Car\" (2012).\nThornton is also known for his roles on television acting in the CBS sitcom \"Hearts Afire\" from 1992 to 1995. In 2014, he starred as Lorne Malvo in the first season of the FX anthology series \"Fargo\", earning a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or Movie and winning a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Television Film. From 2016 to 2021 he played Billy McBride in the Amazon legal drama series, \"Goliath\", which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama. In 2024, he began playing the lead role of Tommy Norris in the Paramount+ series \"Landman\".\nThornton has released four solo albums and is the vocalist of the rock band the Boxmasters. Thornton has been vocal about his distaste for celebrity culture, choosing to avoid the public eye. He has been married six times, including to Angelina Jolie from 2000 to 2003.\nEarly life.\nThornton was born on August 4, 1955, in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the son of Virginia Roberta (\"n\u00e9e\" Faulkner; 1934\u20132017), a self-proclaimed psychic, and William Raymond \"Billy Ray\" Thornton (1929\u20131974), a high school history teacher and basketball coach. His brother Jimmy Don (April 1958 \u2013 October 1988) wrote a number of songs; Thornton recorded two of them (\"Island Avenue\" and \"Emily\") on his solo albums. He is of English and part Irish descent. He has two other siblings.\nThornton lived in numerous places in Arkansas during his childhood, including Alpine, Malvern, and Mount Holly. He was raised Methodist. He attended Malvern High School. Thornton struggled academically in school due to dyslexia, for which he was not conclusively diagnosed until later in life. A good high school baseball player, he tried out for the Kansas City Royals but was released after an injury. He graduated from Malvern in 1973 and spent a short period laying asphalt for the Arkansas State Transportation Department, before attending Henderson State University to pursue a degree in psychology but dropped out after two semesters.\nIn the mid-1980s Thornton settled in Los Angeles to pursue his career as an actor with future writing partner Tom Epperson. He had a difficult time succeeding as an actor and worked in telemarketing, offshore wind farming, and fast food management between auditioning for acting jobs. He also played the drums and sang with South African rock band Jack Hammer. While working as a waiter for an industry event, he served film director and screenwriter Billy Wilder. He struck up a conversation with Wilder, who advised Thornton to consider a career as a screenwriter.\nCareer.\n1986\u20131995: Early roles and breakthrough.\nIn September 1987, Thornton appeared on stage in a one-act play, \"Beethoven Symphonies\", as part of the West Coast Theatre Ensemble in Los Angeles. His first on-screen role was playing a character named Billy Bob in the thriller \"Hunter's Blood\". He was a stand-in on that film for the whole production, and then appeared in two scenes.\nHe subsequently appeared in minor roles in the film \"South of Reno\" and the 1987 \"Matlock\" episode \"The Photographer\". Another one of his early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom \"Hearts Afire\" and in 1989 he appeared as an angry heckler in Adam Sandler's debut film \"Going Overboard\". He played the role of the villain in 1992's \"One False Move\", which he also co-wrote. He also had roles in the 1990s films \"Indecent Proposal\", \"On Deadly Ground\", \"Bound by Honor\", and \"Tombstone\".\n1996\u20132004: \"Sling Blade\" and acclaim.\nHe went on to write, direct, and star in the 1996 independent film \"Sling Blade\". The film, an expansion of the short film \"Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade\", introduced the story of a mentally disabled man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder. \"Sling Blade\" garnered international acclaim. Thornton's screenplay earned him an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, a Writers Guild of America Award, and an Edgar Award, while his performance received Oscar and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Actor.\nThornton appeared in several major film roles following the success of \"Sling Blade\". In 1998, he portrayed the James Carville-like Richard Jemmons in \"Primary Colors\". That same year, he appeared in the disaster film \"Armageddon\", and the neo-noir thriller film \"A Simple Plan\", the latter of which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His screen persona has been described by the press as that of a \"tattooed, hirsute man's man\".\nThornton adapted the book \"All the Pretty Horses\" into a 2000 film of the same name. The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour of footage) led to his decision to never direct another film; a subsequent release, \"Daddy and Them\", had been filmed earlier. Also in 2000, an early script which he and Tom Epperson wrote together was made into \"The Gift\". In 2001, he directed \"Daddy and Them\" while securing starring roles in three Hollywood films: the romantic drama \"Monster's Ball\", the crime comedy-drama \"Bandits\", and the neo-noir film \"The Man Who Wasn't There\". In 2002, Thornton appeared in Travis Tritt's music video for the song \"Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde\".\nThornton played a malicious mall Santa in 2003's \"Bad Santa\", a black comedy on the set of which he has admitted to getting drunk, and in the same year, portrayed an oil millionaire in the comedy film \"Intolerable Cruelty\", and a womanizing President of the United States in the British romantic comedy film \"Love Actually\". He stated that, following the success of \"Bad Santa\", audiences \"like to watch him play that kind of guy\" and that \"casting directors call him up when they need an asshole\". He referred to this when he said that \"it's kinda that simple... you know how narrow the imagination in this business can be\". In 2004, Thornton starred as David Crockett in \"The Alamo\", and played Coach Gary Gaines in the football drama film \"Friday Night Lights\". Also that year, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 7.\n2005\u20132013: Career fluctuations.\nHe played a baseball coach in the 2005 sports comedy \"Bad News Bears\", a remake of the 1976 \"film of the same name\". He appeared in the 2006 comic film \"School for Scoundrels\". In the film, he plays a self-help doctor, a role which was written specifically for him. Other films include the 2007 drama \"The Astronaut Farmer\" and the comedy \"Mr. Woodcock\", in which he played a sadistic gym teacher. In September 2008, he starred in the action film \"Eagle Eye\". He has also expressed an interest in directing another film, possibly a period piece about cave explorer Floyd Collins, based on the book \"Trapped!: The Story of Floyd Collins\". In 2011, Thornton voiced Jack in the animated comedy film \"Puss in Boots\".\nSince 2014: \"Fargo\" and \"Goliath\".\nIn 2014, he starred as sociopathic hitman Lorne Malvo in the FX miniseries \"Fargo\", inspired by the 1996 film of the same name, for which he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Mini-Series. Thornton made a guest appearance on \"The Big Bang Theory\" in 2014, where he played a middle-aged urologist who gets excited about every woman who touches him. That same year, he played a prosecutor in the legal drama \"The Judge\". In 2015, Thornton appeared in \"Entourage\", the film adaptation of the television series.\n\"Goliath\", a television series by Amazon Studios, featured Thornton as a formerly brilliant and personable lawyer, who is now washed up and alcoholic. It premiered on October 13, 2016, on Amazon Prime Video. \"Goliath\" was renewed for two additional seasons, with the final season released on September 24, 2021. Also in 2016, he reprised his role as a bad mall Santa in \"Bad Santa 2\".\nIn 2017, Thornton starred in the music video \"Stand Down\" by Kario Salem (musically known as K.O.). It received the Best Music Video award from the Toronto Shorts International Film Festival.\nSince 2024, Thornton has starred in \"Landman\" as Tommy Norris, a landman at an oil company.\nMusic.\nIn the 1970s, Thornton was the drummer of a blues rock band named Tres Hombres. Guitarist Billy Gibbons, whose band ZZ Top released an album titled \"Tres Hombres\" in 1973, referred to the band as \"the best little cover band in Texas\", and Thornton bears a tattoo with the band's name on it. In 1983, the band released their only studio album, \"Gunslinger\" on Trigger Records.\nIn 1985, Thornton joined Piet Botha in the South African rock band Jack Hammer, while Botha worked in Los Angeles. Thornton recorded one studio album with Jack Hammer, \"Death of a Gypsy\", which was released in September 1986.\nIn 2001, Thornton released the album \"Private Radio\" on Lost Highway Records. Subsequent albums include \"The Edge of the World\" (2003), \"Hobo\" (2005) and \"Beautiful Door\" (2007). He performed the Warren Zevon song \"The Wind\" on the tribute album \"\". Thornton recorded a cover of the Johnny Cash classic \"Ring of Fire\" with Earl Scruggs, for the \"Oxford American\" magazine's Southern Music CD in 2001. The song also appeared on Scruggs' 2001 album \"Earl Scruggs and Friends\". In 2007, Thornton formed The Boxmasters with J.D. Andrew.\nOn April 8, 2009, Thornton and his musical group The Boxmasters appeared on the CBC Radio One program \"Q\". The appearance was widely criticized and received international attention after Thornton was persistently unintelligible and discourteous to host Jian Ghomeshi. Thornton eventually explained that he had instructed the show's producers to not ask questions about his movie career. Ghomeshi had mentioned Thornton's acting in the introduction. Thornton had also complained Canadian audiences were like \"mashed potatoes without the gravy.\" The following night, opening for Willie Nelson at Toronto's Massey Hall, Thornton said mid-set he liked Canadians but not Ghomeshi, which was greeted with boos and catcalls. The Boxmasters did not continue the tour in Canada as, according to Thornton, some of the crew and band had the flu.\nActing credits and accolades.\nThornton has received the President's Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films, a Special Achievement Award from the National Board of Review, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He has also been nominated for an Emmy Award, four Golden Globes, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and family.\nThornton has been married six times. He has four children by three women.\nFrom 1978 to 1980, he was married to Melissa Lee Gatlin, who in her divorce petition cited \"incompatibility and adultery on his part\". They have a daughter Amanda (Brumfield), who in 2008 was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the death of her friend's one-year-old daughter. The Innocence Project of Florida began representing Amanda in 2015 and claims that the child's death was entirely accidental. Amanda was freed in 2020 after a deal was reached with prosecutors prior to an evidentiary hearing to provide medical and scientific evidence of her innocence.\nThornton married actress Toni Lawrence in 1986; they separated the following year and divorced in 1988. From 1990 to 1992, he was married to actress Cynda Williams, who was cast in his writing debut \"One False Move\" (1992). In 1993, Thornton married \"Playboy\" model Pietra Dawn Cherniak, with whom he had two sons. The marriage ended in 1997 with Cherniak accusing Thornton of spousal abuse, sometimes in front of his children.\nThornton dated Laura Dern from 1997 to 1999, and in 2000, he married actress Angelina Jolie, with whom he starred in \"Pushing Tin\" (1999) and who was nearly 20 years his junior. The marriage became known for the couple's eccentric displays of affection, which reportedly included wearing vials of each other's blood around their necks; Thornton later clarified that the \"vials\" were actually two small lockets, each containing only a single drop of blood. Thornton and Jolie announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but it was later revealed that Jolie had adopted the child as a single parent. They separated in June 2002 and divorced the following year.\nIn 2003, Thornton began a relationship with makeup effects crew member Connie Angland, with whom he has a daughter. Although he once said that he likely would not marry again since marriage \"doesn't work\" for him, his representatives confirmed that he and Angland were married on October 22, 2014, in Los Angeles.\nHealth problems.\nDuring his early years in Los Angeles, Thornton was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with myocarditis, a heart condition thought to be brought on by his diet. He has since said that he follows a vegan diet and is \"extremely healthy\", eating no junk food as he is allergic to wheat and dairy.\nThornton has dyslexia and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Various idiosyncratic behaviors have been well documented in interviews with Thornton; among these is a phobia of antique furniture, a disorder shared by Dwight Yoakam's character Doyle Hargraves in the Thornton-penned \"Sling Blade\" and by Thornton's own character in the 2001 film \"Bandits\". Additionally, he has stated that he has a fear of certain types of silverware, a trait assumed by his character in 2001's \"Monster's Ball\", in which he insists on a plastic spoon for his daily bowl of ice cream.\nIn a 2004 interview with \"The Independent\", Thornton explained, &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's just that I won't use real silver. You know, like the big, old, heavy-ass forks and knives, I can't do that. It's the same thing as the antique furniture. I just don't like old stuff. I'm creeped out by it, and I have no explanation why\u00a0... I don't have a phobia about American antiques, it's mostly French\u2014you know, like the big, old, gold-carved chairs with the velvet cushions. The Louis XIV type. That's what creeps me out. I can spot the imitation antiques a mile off. They have a different vibe. Not as much dust.\nInterests.\nThornton is a baseball fan, particularly the St. Louis Cardinals. In his movie contracts, one of his conditions is a television in his trailer with a satellite dish so he can watch the Cardinals play. He narrated \"The 2006 World Series Film\", the year-end retrospective DVD chronicling the Cardinals' championship season. He is also a professed fan of the Indianapolis Colts football team.\nAsked about faith, Thornton said \"I'm not what you'd call a traditional religious person. We went to the Methodist church\u2014every Sunday you put on your little creepy suit with your clip-on tie and went to church. But it wasn't like I paid any attention. Hardcore Christians and atheists\u2014they both say they know exactly what the deal is. Anybody who says, 'I know what happens,' I don't believe them. That's kind of my religion.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "4472", "revid": "34765295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4472", "title": "The Big O", "text": "1999 Japanese anime television series\n is a Japanese mecha-anime television series created by designer Keiichi Sato and director Kazuyoshi Katayama for Sunrise. The writing staff was assembled by the series' head writer, Chiaki J. Konaka, who is known for his work on \"Serial Experiments Lain\" and \"Hellsing\". The story takes place forty years after a mysterious occurrence causes the residents of Paradigm City to lose their memories. The series follows Roger Smith, Paradigm City's top Negotiator. He provides this \"much needed service\" with the help of a robot named R. Dorothy Wayneright and his butler Norman Burg. When the need arises, Roger calls upon Big O, a giant relic from the city's past.\nThe television series was designed as a tribute to Japanese and Western shows from the 1960s and 1970s. The series is presented in the style of \"film noir\" and combines themes of detective fiction and mecha anime. The setpieces are reminiscent of \"tokusatsu\" productions of the 1950s and 1960s, particularly Toho's \"kaiju\" movies, and the score is an eclectic mix of styles and musical homages.\n\"The Big O\" aired on Wowow satellite television from October 13, 1999, and January 19, 2000. The English-language version premiered on Cartoon Network's Toonami on April 2, 2001, and ended on April 23, 2001. Originally planned as a 26-episode series, low viewership in Japan reduced production to the first 13. Positive international reception resulted in a second season consisting of the remaining 13 episodes, co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and Bandai Visual. Season two premiered on Japan's Sun Television on January 2, 2003, and the American premiere took place seven months later. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment by parent company Bandai (owned by Bandai Namco Holdings) in 2012, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013 that Sentai Filmworks acquired both seasons of \"The Big O\".\nSynopsis.\nSetting.\n\"The Big O\" is set in the fictional city-state of . The city is located on a seacoast and is surrounded by a vast desert wasteland. The partially domed city is wholly controlled by the monopolistic Paradigm Corporation, resulting in a corporate police state. Paradigm is known as because forty years prior to the story, destroyed the world outside the city and left the survivors without any prior memories. The city is characterized by severe class inequity; the higher-income population resides inside the more pleasant domes, with the remainder left in tenements outside. Residents of the city believe that they are the last survivors of the world and no other nations exist outside the city. Androids and giant robots known as \"Megadeus\" coexist with the residents of Paradigm City and residents do not find them unusual.\nPlot.\nAfter failing to negotiate with terrorists at the cost of his client's life, Roger Smith is obligated to care for Dorothy Wayneright, a young female android. Over the course of the series, Roger Smith continues to accept negotiation work from the residents of Paradigm City, he often leads to uncovering the nature and mystery of Paradigm City and encountering megadeus or other giant enemies that require Big O. Supporting characters are Angel, a mysterious woman in search of memories; Dan Dastun, chief of the military police of Paradigm city and old friend of Roger Smith; and Norman Burg, the butler of Roger Smith and mechanic of Big O.\nThe main antagonist is Alex Rosewater, chairman of Paradigm City whose goal is to revive the megadeus \"Big Fau\" in attempts to become the god of Paradigm City. Other recurring antagonists are Jason Beck, criminal and con-artist attempting to humiliate Roger Smith; Schwarzwald, an ex-reporter obsessed with finding the truth of Paradigm City and also pilot of the megadeus \"Big Duo\"; Vera Ronstadt, leader of a group of foreigners known as the Union searching for memories and revenge against Paradigm City; and Alan Gabriel, a cyborg assassin working for Alex Rosewater and the Union.\nThe series ends with the awakening of a new megadeus, and the revelation that the world is a simulated reality. A climactic battle ensues between Big O and Big Fau, after which reality is systematically erased by the new megadeus, an incarnation of Angel, recognized as \"Big Venus\" by Dorothy. Roger implores Angel to \"let go of the past\" regardless of its existential reality, and focus only on the present and the future. In an isolated control room, the real Angel observes Roger and her past encounters with him on a series of television monitors. On the control panel lies \"Metropolis\", a book featured prominently since the thirteenth episode; the cover features an illustration of angel wings and gives the author's name as \"Angel Rosewater\". Big Venus and Big O physically merge, causing the virtual reality to reset. The final scene shows Roger Smith driving down a restored Paradigm city with Dorothy and Angel observing him from the side of the road.\nProduction and release.\nDevelopment of the retro-styled series began in 1996. Keiichi Sato came up with the concept of \"The Big O\": a giant city-smashing robot, piloted by a man in black, in a Gotham-like environment. He later met up with Kazuyoshi Katayama, who had just finished directing \"Those Who Hunt Elves\", and started work on the layouts and character designs. But when things \"were about to really start moving,\" production on Katayama's \"Sentimental Journey\" began, putting plans on hold. Meanwhile, Sato was heavily involved with his work on \"City Hunter\". The initial story idea revolved around a cataclysm (caused by a meteorite impact) that destroyed most of human civilization. The setting would be a city that survived, where the protagonist pilots a giant robot engineered from the meteorite's recovered superalloy to battle against the authority in charge of the surviving city.\nSato admits it all started as \"a gimmick for a toy\" but the representatives at Bandai Hobby Division did not see the same potential. From there on, the dealings would be with Bandai Visual, but Sunrise still needed some safeguards and requested more robots be designed to increase prospective toy sales. In 1999, with the designs complete, Chiaki J. Konaka was brought on as head writer. Among other things, Konaka came up with the idea of \"a town without memory\" and his writing staff put together the outline for a 26-episodes series. Konaka deliberately chose to present the setting, Paradigm City, as a city of amnesiacs to avoid needing to develop lore for the origin of the show's mecha. When Cartoon Network later offered funding for the second season, its representatives requested that the story be satisfactorily finished at the end of this season; this prompted Konaka to continue developing the concept of the amnesiac city as its central theme.\n\"The Big O\" premiered on October 13, 1999, on Wowow. When the production staff was informed the series would be shortened to 13 episodes, the writers decided to end it with a cliffhanger, hoping the next 13 episodes would be picked up. In April 2001, \"The Big O\" premiered on Cartoon Network's Toonami lineup.\nThe series garnered positive fan response internationally that resulted in a second season co-produced by Cartoon Network and Sunrise. Season two premiered on Japan's Sun Television in January 2003, with the American premiere taking place seven months later as an Adult Swim exclusive. The second season would not be seen on Toonami until July 27, 2013, 10 years after it began airing on Adult Swim.\nThe second season was scripted by Chiaki Konaka with input from the American producers. Cartoon Network raised two requests for the second season: more action and reveal the mystery in the first season, although Kazuyoshi Katayama admitted that he did not intend to reveal it, just to make an anthology of adventures set in the universe. Along with the 13 episodes of season two, Cartoon Network had an option for 26 additional episodes to be written by Konaka, but according to Jason DeMarco, executive producer for season two, the middling ratings and DVD sales in the United States and Japan made any further episodes impossible to be produced.\nFollowing the closure of Bandai Entertainment by parent company in 2012, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013 that Sentai Filmworks rescued both seasons of \"The Big O\". On June 20, 2017, Sentai Filmworks released both seasons on Blu-ray.\nMusic.\n\"The Big O\" was scored by \"Geidai\" alumnus Toshihiko Sahashi. His composition is richly symphonic and classical, with a number of pieces delving into electronica and jazz. Chosen because of his \"frightening amount of musical knowledge about TV dramas overseas,\" Sahashi integrates musical homages into the soundtrack. The background music draws from \"film noir\", spy films and sci-fi television series like \"The Twilight Zone\". The battle themes are reminiscent of Akira Ifukube's compositions for the \"Godzilla\" series.\nThe first opening theme is the Queen-influenced \"Big-O!\". Composed, arranged and performed by Rui Nagai, the song resembles the theme to the \"Flash Gordon\" film. The second opening theme is \"Respect,\" composed by Sahashi. The track is an homage to the music of \"UFO\", composed by Barry Gray. In 2007, Rui Nagai composed \"Big-O! Show Must Go On,\" a 1960s hard rock piece, for Animax's reruns of the show; this composition replaced the original opening themes for the Blu-Ray release of the series. The closing theme is the slow love ballad \"And Forever...\" written by Chie and composed by Ken Shima. The duet is performed by Robbie Danzie and Naoki Takao.\nAlong with Sahashi's original compositions, the soundtrack features Chopin's Prelude No. 15 and a jazz saxophone rendition of \"Jingle Bells.\" The complete score was released in two volumes by Victor Entertainment.\nDesign.\n\"The Big O\" is the brainchild of Keiichi Sato and Kazuyoshi Katayama, an homage to the shows they grew up with. The show references the works of \"tokusatsu\" produced by the Toei Company and Tsuburaya Productions, as well as shows such as \"Super Robot Red Baron\" and \"Super Robot Mach Baron\" and \"old school\" super robot anime. The series is done in the style of \"film noir\" and pulp fiction and combines the feel of a detective show with the giant robot genre.\nStyle.\n\"The Big O\" shares many of its themes, diction, archetypes and visual iconography with \"film noirs\" of the 1940s like \"The Big Sleep\" (1946). The series incorporates the use of long dark shadows in the tradition of \"chiaroscuro\" and tenebrism. \"Film noir\" is also known for its use of odd angles, such as Roger's low shot introduction in the first episode. \"Noir\" cinematographers favoured this angle because it made characters almost rise from the ground, giving them dramatic girth and symbolic overtones. Other disorientating devices like dutch angles, mirror reflection and distorting shots are employed throughout the series.\nThe characters of \"The Big O\" fit the \"noir\" and pulp fiction archetypes. Roger Smith is a protagonist in the mold of Chandler's Philip Marlowe or Hammett's Sam Spade. He is canny and cynical, a disillusioned cop-turned-negotiator whose job has more in common with detective-style work than negotiating. Big Ear is Roger's street informant and Dan Dastun is the friend on the police force. The recurring Beck is the imaginative thug compelled by delusions of grandeur while Angel fills the role of the \"femme fatale\". Minor characters include crooked cops, corrupt business men and deranged scientists.\nThe dialogue in the series is recognized for its witty, wry sense of humor. The characters come off as charming and exchange banter not often heard in anime series, as the dialogue has the tendency to be straightforward. The plot is moved along by Roger's voice-over narration, a device used in \"film noir\" to place the viewer in the mind of the protagonist so it can intimately experience the character's angst and partly identify with the narrator.\nThe tall buildings and giant domes create a sense of claustrophobia and paranoia characteristic of the style. The rural landscape, Ailesberry Farm, contrasts Paradigm City. \"Noir\" protagonists often look for sanctuary in such settings but they just as likely end up becoming a killing ground. The series score is representative of its setting. While no classic \"noir\" possesses a jazz score, the music could be heard in nightclubs within the films. Roger's recurring theme, a lone saxophone accompaniment to the protagonist's narration, best exemplifies the \"noir\" stylings of the series.\nAmnesia is a common plot device in \"film noir\". Because most of these stories focused on a character proving his innocence, authors up the ante by making him an amnesiac, unable to prove his innocence even to himself.\nInfluences.\nBefore \"The Big O\", Sunrise was a subcontractor for Warner Bros. Animation's \"\", one of the series' influences. Cartoon Network, under the Toonami flag advertised the series as \"One part Bond. One part Bruce Wayne. One part City Smashing Robot.\"\nRoger Smith is a pastiche of the Bruce Wayne persona and the Batman. The character design resembles Wayne, complete with slicked-back hair and double-breasted business suit. Like Bruce, Roger prides himself in being a rich playboy to the extent that one of his household's rules is only women may be let into his mansion without his permission. Like Batman, Roger Smith carries a no-gun policy, albeit more flexible. Unlike the personal motives of the Batman, Roger enforces this rule for \"it's all part of being a gentleman.\" Among Roger's gadgetry is the Griffon, a large, black hi-tech sedan comparable to the Batmobile, a grappling cable that shoots out his wristwatch and the giant robot that Angel calls \"Roger's alter ego.\"\n\"The Big O\"'s cast of supporting characters includes Norman, Roger's faithful mechanically inclined butler who fills the role of Alfred Pennyworth; R. Dorothy Wayneright, who plays the role of the sidekick; and Dan Dastun, a good honest cop who, like Jim Gordon, is both a friend to the hero and greatly respected by his comrades.\nThe other major influence is Mitsuteru Yokoyama's \"Giant Robo\". Before working on \"The Big O\", Kazuyoshi Katayama and other animators worked with Yasuhiro Imagawa on \"\". The feature, a \"retro chic\" homage to Yokoyama's career, took seven years to produce and suffered low sales and high running costs. Frustrated by the experience, Katayama and his staff put all their efforts into making \"good\" with \"The Big O\".\nLike Giant Robo, the megadeuses of \"Big O\" are metal behemoths. The designs are strange and \"more macho than practical,\" sporting big stovepipe arms and exposed rivets. Unlike the giants of other mecha series, the megadeuses do not exhibit ninja-like speed nor grace. Instead, the robots are armed with \"old school\" weaponry such as missiles, piston powered punches, machine guns and laser cannons.\nKatayama also cited \"Super Robot Red Baron\" and \"Super Robot Mach Baron\" among influences on the inspiration of \"The Big O\". Believing that because \"Red Baron\" had such a low budget and the big fights always happened outside of a city setting, he wanted \"Big O\" to be the show he felt \"Red Baron\" could be with a bigger budget. He also spoke of how he first came up with designs for the robots first as if they were making designs to appeal to toy companies, rather than how \"Gundam\" was created with a toy company wanting an anime to represent their new product. Big O's large pumping piston \"Sudden Impact\" arms, for example, he felt would be cool gimmicks in a toy.\nRelated media.\nPublications.\n\"The Big O\" was conceived as a media franchise. To this effect, Sunrise requested a manga be produced along with the animated series. \"The Big O\" manga started serialization in Kodansha's \"Magazine Z\" in July 1999, three months before the anime premiere. Authored by Hitoshi Ariga, the manga uses Keiichi Sato's concept designs in an all-new story. The series ended in October 2001. The issues were later collected in six volumes. The English version of the manga is published by Viz Media.\nIn anticipation of the broadcast of the second season, a new manga series was published. , authored by Hitoshi Ariga. \"Lost Memory\" takes place between volumes five and six of the original manga. The issues were serialized in \"Magazine Z\" from November 2002 to September 2003 and were collected in two volumes. , a novel by Yuki Taniguchi, was released 16 July 2003 by Tokuma Shoten.\n\"The Big O Visual: The official companion to the TV series\" () was published by Futabasha in 2003. The book contains full-color artwork, character bios and concept art, mecha sketches, video/LD/DVD jacket illustrations, history on the making of The Big O, staff interviews, \"Roger's Monologues\" comic strip and the original script for the final episode of the series.\nAudio drama.\n\"Walking Together On The Yellow Brick Road\" was released by Victor Entertainment on 21 September 2000. The drama CD was written by series head writer Chiaki J. Konaka and featured the series' voice cast. An English translation, written by English dub translator David Fleming, was posted on Konaka's website.\nVideo games.\nThe first season of Big O is featured in \"Super Robot Wars D\" for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. The series, including its second season, is also featured in \"Super Robot Wars Z\", released in 2008. \"The Big O\" became a mainstay of the \"Z\" games, appearing in each entry of the subseries.\nToys and model kits.\nBandai released a non-scale model kit of Big O in 2000. Though it was an easy snap-together kit, it required painting, as all of the parts (except the clear orange crown and canopy) were molded in dark gray. The kit included springs that enabled the slide-action Side Piles on the forearms to simulate Big O's Sudden Impact maneuver. Also included was an unpainted Roger Smith figure.\nPVC figures of Big O and Big Duo (Schwarzwald's Megadeus) were sold by Bandai America. Each came with non-poseable figures of Roger, Dorothy and Angel. Mini-figure sets were sold in Japan and America during the run of the second season. The characters included Big O (standard and attack modes), Roger, Dorothy &amp; Norman, Griffon (Roger's car), Dorothy-1 (Big O's first opponent), Schwarzwald and Big Duo.\nIn 2009, Bandai released a plastic/diecast figure of the Big O under their Soul of Chogokin line. The figure has the same features as the model kit, but with added detail and accessories. Its design was closely supervised by original designer Keiichi Sato.\nIn 2011, Max Factory released action figures of Roger and Dorothy through their Figma toyline. Like most Figmas, they are very detailed, articulated and come with accessories and interchangeable faces. In the same year, Max Factory also released a 12-inch, diecast figure of Big O under their Max Gokin line. The figure contained most of the accessories as the Soul of Chogokin figure but also included some others that could be bought separately from the SOC figure, such as the Mobydick (hip) Anchors and Roger Smith's car: the Griffon. Like the Soul of Chogokin figure, its design was also supervised by Keiichi Sato. As well, in that same year, Max Factory released soft vinyl figures of Big Duo and Big Fau, in-scale with the Max Gokin Big O. These figures are high in detail but limited in articulation, such as the arms and legs being the only things to move. To date, this is the only action figure of Big Fau.\nReception.\n\"The Big O\" premiered on October 13, 1999. The show was not a hit in its native Japan, rather it was reduced from an outlined 26 episodes to 13 episodes. Western audiences were more receptive and the series achieved the success its creators were looking for. In an interview with AnimePlay, Keiichi Sato said \"This is exactly as we had planned\", referring to the success overseas.\nSeveral words appear constantly in the English-language reviews; adjectives like \"hip\", \"sleek,\" \"stylish\",\n \"classy\", and, above all, \"cool\" serve to describe the artwork, the concept, and the series itself. Reviewers have pointed out references and homages to various works of fiction, namely \"Batman\", Giant Robo, the works of Isaac Asimov, Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\", James Bond, and \"Cowboy Bebop\". But \"while saying that may cause one to think the show is completely derivative\", reads an article at Anime on DVD, \"\"The Big O\" still manages to stand out as something original amongst the other numerous cookie-cutter anime shows.\" One reviewer cites the extensive homages as one of the series problems and calls to unoriginality on the creators' part.\nThe first season's reception was positive. Anime on DVD recommends it as an essential series. Chris Beveridge of the aforementioned site gave an A\u2212 to Vols. 1 and 2, and a B+ to Vols. 3 and 4. Mike Toole of Anime Jump gave it 4.5 (out of a possible 5) stars, while the review at the Anime Academy gave it a grade of 83, listing the series' high points as being \"unique\", the characters \"interesting,\" and the action \"nice.\" Reviewers, and fans alike, agree the season's downfall was the ending, or its lack thereof. The dangling plot threads frustrated the viewers and prompted Cartoon Network's involvement in the production of further episodes.\nThe look and feel of the show received a big enhancement in the second season. This time around, the animation is \"near OVA quality\" and the artwork \"far more lush and detailed.\" Also enhanced are the troubles of the first season. The giant robot battles still seem out of place to some, while others praise the \"over-the-top-ness\" of their execution.\nFor some reviewers, the second season \"doesn't quite match the first\" addressing to \"something\" missing in these episodes. Andy Patrizio of IGN points out changes in Roger Smith's character, who \"lost some of his cool and his very funny side in the second season.\" Like a repeat of season one, this season's ending is considered its downfall. Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD wonders if this was head writer \"Konaka's attempt to throw his hat into the ring for creating one of the most confusing and oblique endings of any series.\" Patrizio states \"the creators watched \"The Truman Show\" and \"The Matrix\" a few times too many.\"\nSato, Katayama, Konaka, and Bandai in general received many inquiries from fans in Japan asking for further clarification on the plot and ending. The three directly addressed these questions via an art book and companion to the series in 2004. Katayama describes Paradigm City as the created narrative of Angel, who (alongside Roger Smith only) stands above the story but writes herself a role to play. The narrative provided for civilization to continue in some form, though Angel included a safeguard that would reset the narrative should her identity as the creator ever be discovered by the characters. Having fallen in love with the character of Roger Smith, she inserts herself into the story with conditions designed to bring them together whenever Roger encounters a particularly tough challenge or is investigating mysteries. According to Katayama, her planned narrative collapses when she becomes jealous of Roger's affinity for R. Dorothy, culminating in Gordon Rosewater's realization that Angel is indeed the creator of Paradigm City. Angel prepares to end the narrative world via piloting Big Venus, which Konaka states will return everything to its destroyed, ruined state it lay in immediately after the cataclysm 40 years ago. Roger however successfully negotiates for her to simply restart the narrative and allow Paradigm City to be reset and continue in some form. Konaka originally wrote the ending to clearly show that Angel changed her role to become Roger's assistant, repeating a scene in the first episode where Roger negotiates for the release of Dorothy Waynewright, who is implied to now be human; Katayama changed this to make the ending more ambiguous. In both endings, Paradigm City continues as a city of amnesiacs, despite Gordon Rosewater's wishes for Roger to negotiate with the creator to return people's memories to them.\nThe series continues to have a strong cult following into the 2010s. In 2014 BuzzFeed writer Ryan Broderick ranked \"The Big O\" as one of the best anime series to binge-watch. Dan Casey host of The Nerdist's \"Dan Cave\" stated \"The Big O\" was the anime series he was most eager to see rebooted or remade, along with \"Trigun\" and \"Soul Eater\". In 2017, Ollie Barder of Forbes wrote, \"From the classic and retro styled mecha design of Keiichi Sato to the overall film noir visual tone of the series, The Big O was a fascinating and visually very different kind of show. It also had a fantastic voice cast, with probably the most notable of these being Akiko Yajima as the voice of Roger's disapproving android Dorothy.\" In 2019, Crunchyroll writer Thomas Zoth ranked \"The Big O\" as his top 10 anime since the 1990s.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
